The first and third blocks perform cross-validation to select optimal parameters r and l to be used in (3) and (4), respectively. The second block produces weights fwijg and error-variance estimate ŝ2 after solving (4). Finally, the fourth block takes data X and Y together with l, fwijg and ŝ2 and solves (3) to yield B̂, which represents the SML estimator for B in (1) revealing the genetic-interaction network.
