  "rationale": "None of the provided captions explicitly mention terms like 'causal model,' 'DAG,' 'mediator,' 'confounder,' or 'pathways.' The figures describe 'covariance structure' or a 'strategy for model selection,' which are not indicative of a causal model as defined. Therefore, no figure strongly qualifies as a causal model."
