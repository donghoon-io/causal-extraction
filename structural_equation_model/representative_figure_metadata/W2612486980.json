  "rationale": "Figure 1 explicitly refers to \"analysis models\" and depicts both \"single-group\" and \"multi-group analysis models.\" The mention of \"indirect effect\" and \"group difference\" within these models strongly suggests a visual representation of causal pathways and relationships, which is characteristic of a causal model. The other figure focuses on empirical power, which is a statistical outcome rather than a model itself."
