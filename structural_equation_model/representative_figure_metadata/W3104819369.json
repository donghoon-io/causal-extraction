  "rationale": "Figure 2 explicitly mentions \"path diagrams,\" which are a common visual representation of causal models in structural equation modeling. The description of \"original\" and \"parameter-expanded version\" further suggests the depiction of relationships between variables, aligning with the characteristics of a causal model. The other captions describe trace plots or an example of an approach, not a causal model itself."
