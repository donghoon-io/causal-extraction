  "rationale": "Figure 1 explicitly uses the term 'causal population model,' directly aligning with the primary criteria for identifying a causal model. Similarly, Figure 2 also refers to a 'hypothesized causal model,' further reinforcing the selection of figures that explicitly state 'causal model.' These terms indicate a visual representation of cause-and-effect relationships, which is central to the definition of a causal model."
