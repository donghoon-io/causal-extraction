  "rationale": "Figure 1 explicitly refers to \"Conceptual models describing the relationships between the built environment and travel behaviour.\" The term \"conceptual models\" strongly implies a visual representation of theoretical relationships, which aligns with the characteristics of a causal model used for theorizing. The paper's title also mentions \"mediating variable\" and \"structural equation modelling,\" further supporting the likelihood of a causal model being depicted."
