  "rationale": "Figure 2 and Figure 3 both describe a 'model' related to design measures for waste minimization. The paper's abstract explicitly mentions using 'structural equation modeling,' which is a statistical technique used to test causal relationships and pathways between variables. Therefore, Figure 3, described as the 'Final Model,' is most likely to represent the causal model developed and tested in the study, depicting the relationships between design measures and waste minimization."
