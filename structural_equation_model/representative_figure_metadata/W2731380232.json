  "rationale": "Figure 2 explicitly describes an \"a priori model\" and a \"path diagram describing the hypothesized effects\" including a \"mediating effect.\" This language strongly indicates a causal model, outlining directional relationships and mechanisms. Figure 1, while discussing a \"final model\" and \"significant pathways,\" is a result of the model testing rather than the theoretical causal model itself."
