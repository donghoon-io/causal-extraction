  "rationale": "Figure 1 explicitly mentions a \"CFA path diagram,\" which directly implies a visual representation of causal relationships using directed paths. This aligns with the definition of a causal model, as it depicts how different variables are hypothesized to influence each other. The other figures describe various statistical models (ACE, CP twin, Cholesky decomposition) but do not explicitly use terms that denote a causal model as strongly as \"path diagram.\""
