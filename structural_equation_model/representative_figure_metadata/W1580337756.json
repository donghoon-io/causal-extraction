  "rationale": "The abstract explicitly mentions the use of 'structural equation models' to determine associations and adjust for imprecision in exposure variables, which are a type of causal model. However, none of the provided captions describe a figure that visually represents such a model, a DAG, or any causal pathways. Figure 1 describes dose-response functions and associations, but not a causal model."
