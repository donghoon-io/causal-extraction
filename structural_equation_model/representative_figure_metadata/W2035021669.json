  "rationale": "Figure 1 is selected because its caption, \"Proposed Model of Academic Achievement,\" directly implies a theoretical framework outlining causal relationships. The paper's abstract also explicitly mentions developing and testing a \"multicausal model\" and using \"structural equation modelling,\" which are techniques for analyzing causal models. This suggests that Figure 1, as the 'proposed' model, would visually represent these hypothesized causal pathways."
