<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The present study assessed the impact of sample size on the power and fit of structural equation modeling applied to functional brain connectivity hypotheses. The data consisted of timeconstrained minimum norm estimates of regional brain activity during performance of a reading task obtained with magnetoencephalography. Power analysis was first conducted for an autoregressive model with 5 latent variables (brain regions), each defined by 3 indicators (successive activity time bins). A series of simulations were then run by generating data from an existing pool of 51 typical readers (aged 7.5-12.5 years). Sample sizes ranged between 20 and 1,000 participants and for each sample size 1,000 replications were run. Results were evaluated using chi-square Type I errors, model convergence, mean RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) values, confidence intervals of the RMSEA, structural path stability, and D-Fit index values. Results suggested that 70 to 80 participants were adequate to model relationships reflecting close to not so close fit as per MacCallum et al.'s recommendations. Sample sizes of 50 participants were associated with satisfactory fit. It is concluded that structural equation modeling is a viable methodology to model complex regional interdependencies in brain activation in pediatric populations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Undoubtedly, one of the most promising areas of research related to understanding human cognition and behavior involves unraveling the complex relations among neurophysiologically active brain regions. This may be particularly important for populations for which specific deficits have been observed such as individuals with dyslexia, who have significant reading difficulties that interfere with adaptive functioning in society.</p><p>The majority of existing studies assessing functional interdependencies between activation sites (i.e., functional connectivity) have relied on hemodynamic estimates of regional brain activity obtained with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Koyama et al. (2013)</ref> demonstrated that the investigation of functional connectivity in the brain is particularly fruitful from the perspective of behavioral remediation. Using t tests they found significantly weaker intrinsic functional connectivity between the left intraparietal sulcus and left middle frontal gyrus across all dyslexia groups but specific deficits for the noremediation group compared with the partially or fully remediated groups. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> suggested, however, the use of univariate modeling is limited by the amount of information provided in relation to the communication among brain regions of interest and neural activity in general.</p><p>Our understanding of functional connectivity involves several challenges. First, one obtains multiple time-series data from each participant and from multiple regions of interest (ROIs), with the likelihood of looped relationships and with the involvement of multiple covariates. Second, despite the large number of variables to be modeled, sample sizes are typically small because of the cost of obtaining neuroimaging data. Thus, issues of proper modeling and power are of paramount importance. Recently, J. <ref type="bibr">Kim, Zju, Chang, Bentler, and Ernst (2007)</ref> suggested the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze functional MRI data. They implemented their modeling approach on data from 28 participants and concluded that their method had promise. However, there was no mention of the stability of parameters, the power of the model, or sample size considerations with the former being even more important than the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wolf, Harrington, Clark, &amp; Miller, 2013)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Price, Laird, Fox, and Ingham (2009)</ref> presented the use of path analysis within SEM to model functional neuroimaging data using a restricted model with manifest rather than latent variables. Power analysis simulations indicated that sample sizes of fewer than 15 participants were associated with low power and large parameter bias. More recent recommendations involved two-stage ridge least squares estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bollen, 1996)</ref> with the overall conclusion that a sample size of 50 would suffice in most cases in order to obtain proper parameter recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jung, 2013)</ref>. Thus, although variations of SEM have been presented in the literature, what is less known is sample size considerations in relation to the size of the model as it relates to the complexity of brain activation patterns. The objective of the present study was to evaluate sample size requirements for modeling functional neuroimaging data using SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why Have These Models Been Inaccessible to Neuroscientists?</head><p>There are several reasons why SEMs have been inaccessible to researchers exploring regional interdependencies in the human brain. First, developers have recommended sample sizes that are prohibitive for the method. For example, MacCallum, Lee, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Browne (2010)</ref> suggested that for large models (involving more than 100 degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr">[df]</ref>) 500 participants are not adequate to model close fit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hancock and Freeman (2001)</ref> suggested including 300 to 500 participants for models having 30 to 60 dfs. Other researchers have suggested between 132 and 3488 participants for a test of close fit (MacCallum, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996)</ref>, with as many as 180 participants proposed even for small models <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(McQuitty, 2004)</ref>. Most researchers would agree that fewer than 200 participants would lead to an unacceptably high rate of Type I error, with regard to the omnibus likelihood ratio test (estimating absolute discrepancies between the observed and implied variance-covariance matrices; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Curran, Bollen, Chen, Paxton, &amp; Kirby, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Curran, Bollen, Paxton, Kirby, &amp; Chen, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Second, the enormous amount of data for the limited number of participants is associated with participant to variable ratios that again are prohibitive of the method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(MacCallum et al., 1996)</ref>. Third, the properties of the physiological data may violate some of the assumptions required by the model (e.g., multivariate normality) and there may be a need to apply least known distributions (e.g., ex Gaussian; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rottelo &amp; Zeng, 2008)</ref>. Fourth, issues of power may be of concern as the inappropriate acceptance of a test of close fit due to a small number of parameters and sample size is prohibitive. Fifth, sample size estimation may become increasingly complex as one needs to take into account construct reliabilities, variable intercorrelations, number of indicators per construct or number of constructs, model complexity, population heterogeneity, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Iacobucci, 2010)</ref>. Last, the fact that physiological data involve complex relationships that vary over time, makes an already complex analytical approach difficult or even impossible to implement in the majority of available statistical programs (e.g., when needed to model various autocorrelation processes, J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariance Structure Modeling: Description</head><p>Covariance structure models use a simultaneous equation approach to define unobservable latent factors using observable indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Marcoulides, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2010)</ref>. The goal of the model is to minimize the discrepancy between a population covariance matrix [model implied variance covariance matrix Σ(θ)] and the model's covariance matrix <ref type="bibr">[Σ]</ref>. Generally, model fit is evaluated by means of an omnibus asymptotic chi-square test (likelihood ratio test [LRT]), which tests the hypothesis that [Σ(θ) = Σ]. Thus support of the null hypothesis that the model fits exactly in the population is desired <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacCallum &amp; Hong, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>One of the biggest concerns in SEM models is the ability of the researcher to validly test the hypotheses of interest. In SEM, several means have been used to evaluate empirical model fit. 1 Some of those means involve the acceptance of the null hypothesis in the LRT, the use of descriptive fit indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Marcoulides, 1990)</ref>, and/or evaluation of the residuals. Thus, with regard to the validity of the above tests, an important prerequisite pertains to the minimum requirements of sample size and the respective estimates of power. Below, there is description of procedures to evaluate power using analysis of the residuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(MacCallum et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>1 Defined as the discrepancy between the observed variance covariance matrix S compared with the one implied by the model [i.e., Σ(θ)]. For the distinction between theoretical and empirical fit, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Olsson, Foss, Troye, and Howell (2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power Considerations in Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>One important issue related to the validity of the estimates derived from an SEM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cirillo &amp; Barroso, 2012)</ref> pertains to the capacity of the model to identify discrepancies between observed relations and hypothesized relations specified in the model. Thus, the issue of sample size is particularly important as one evaluates the fit of a confirmatory factor analysis model. Early recommendations involved having 10 observations per estimated parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bentler &amp; Chou, 1987)</ref> or per variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Nunnally, 1967)</ref> and sample sizes between 100 and 200 participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boomsma, 1982)</ref>. Others have proposed estimating power using change in fit indices rather than the LRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Marsh, Balla, &amp; McDonald, 1988)</ref>. Fit indices come in the form of standardized statistics, namely the comparative fit index (CFI), normed fit index (NFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) with acceptable values ranging greater than .95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. With regard to residuals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Meade, Johnson, and Braddy (2006)</ref> suggested that they represent the most unbiased estimates of model fit. One such statistic is the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Steiger &amp; Lind, 1980)</ref>, which is described in the next section. In the remainder of the introduction we describe power analysis using the noncentral chi-square test and RMSEA using examples. Then the problem and its practical implications are discussed. Subsequently, a simulation is performed using real brain imaging data in order to evaluate the minimum sample requirements that are associated with proper model identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power Analysis and Evaluation of Close Versus Exact Fit in Covariance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure Modeling</head><p>The fit of a SEM model is evaluated by means of estimating the discrepancy function between the observed and model variance covariance matrix. Alternative methods provide different weighting criteria in estimating the discrepancies of the two matrices, S and Σ.</p><p>Several such estimations exist, such as the less cumbersome ordinary least squares method or the most cumbersome maximum likelihood estimation. When evaluating model fit, researchers have suggested moving away from the test of exact fit and attempting to estimate close fit as accurately as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hancock &amp; Freeman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">MacCallum et al., 1996)</ref>. To this end several fit indices have been proposed with the one gaining more acceptance as an index of global fit being the RMSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Steiger &amp; Lind, 1980)</ref>. This index is estimated as a function of the discrepancy function F 0 and the degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Curran et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>(1)</p><p>The RMSEA has been recommended because it is relatively unaffected by sample size, it has a recommended range of acceptable values, it does not require a reference model, it makes reasonable adjustments for model length and it provides easy to use confidence intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Loehlin, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Steiger, 1990)</ref>. For example, when the RMSEA value of acceptable model fit is below the lower level of the confidence interval then one concludes that there is a poorly fitted model. On the contrary, limitations of the index have been related to a biased estimation of the noncentrality parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Raykov, 2000)</ref>, model size <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Breivik &amp; Olsson, 2001)</ref>, and model misspecification and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Curran et al., 2003)</ref>. The RMSEA is estimated using the ratio of the rescaled noncentrality parameter to the estimated model's dfs. Recommended conventions suggest that values of .05 and lower are indicative of acceptable fit and values between .05 and .08 of mediocre fit. Values greater than .10 have been considered unacceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">MacCallum et al. (1996)</ref> proposed that the power to evaluate model fit in SEM should be based on discrepancies between null and alternative RMSEA values. Their case was grounded on the fact that the chi-square test (and its significance) is a test of exact fit, which is of little interest (and may be considered too strict or impractical for real life situations) as all models estimated with real data are, to some extent, misspecified. Thus, they described three forms of fit, exact, close and not so close fit between a null and an alternative hypothesis model based on RMSEA by making use of the confidence intervals around the estimated RMSEA value. As mentioned above, a test of exact fit (i.e., RMSEA = 0) is considered unrealistic and impractical as it would not be met with even moderate sample sizes, although it would likely reflect trivial misspecifications. A test of close fit is associated with RMSEA values less than or equal to .05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993)</ref>. Not so close fit has been defined as reflecting RMSEA values equal to .08. Most researchers would also agree that RMSEA values greater than 0.10 are indicative of poor fit. Let's take a look at a practical example: In fitting a two factor model the RMSEA confidence interval is .025 to .05. The model of exact fit is rejected because the value of zero is not included in the interval. The model of close fit is plausible because the entire interval is smaller than the value of close fit (i.e., .05). Furthermore, the model of not so close fit is rejected because the value of .08 is not within the obtained confidence interval and far above the upper limit of the confidence interval. Thus, the test of not so close fit is highly implausible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power Analysis Using the MacCallum et al. (1996) Approach: An Example</head><p>An example of power estimation for a null RMSEA 0 = .05 versus an alternative value RMSEA a = .08 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. This example involves the structural model of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> with 5 latent variables and 15 indicators (3 per latent variable). Power involves estimation of the non-centrality parameter 2 using the formula:</p><p>(2)</p><p>with N being the sample size, d the number of degrees of freedom, and ε 2 the null RMSEA 0 (the value of RMSEA that the model becomes acceptable). In the example of Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, drawing a sample from Simos, Rezaie, Fletcher, and Papanicolaou (2013), the noncentrality parameter was estimated to be λ 0 = (ö-1)dε 2 = (51 -1) * 76 * (.05) 2 = 9.5 under the null hypothesis. The respective estimate for the alternative hypothesis λ 1 was (51 -1) * 76 * (. 08) 2 = 24.32. So, for approximate power of 80%, α = 5%, null RMSEA = .05, and a noncentrality parameter of 9.5, 159 participants would suffice. In this context, the present 2 Assuming that the discrepancy function is properly identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(MacCallum &amp; Hong, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>study examines how different sample sizes affect the behavior of the parameters in the model, namely, the omnibus chi-square test, Type I errors, and biased fit indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Problem Under Study</head><p>Modeling neuroimaging data using SEM methods is challenging because it involves estimating a large number of parameters using relatively small sample sizes. This apparent contradiction is unfortunately built on our estimate of power estimation using the RMSEA: When the number of parameters is large (as in extended models that assess functional brain connectivity) the sample size required to evaluate close model fit, becomes increasingly small <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Herzog, Boomsma, &amp; Reinecke, 2007)</ref>. For example, for a latent variable model with 80 indicators V defining 8 latent variables ξ, the required number of participants is 29! (for power equal to 80%, null RMSEA = .05 and alternative RMSEA = .02). It is rather utopic to expect that a sample size of 29 participants would suffice to measure population parameters (e.g., factor loadings, standard errors, etc.), for at least two reasons. First, the small sample size would adversely affect the estimate of the noncentrality parameter and thus, compromising the validity of the sample size estimation.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> Second, LRT estimates would likely reflect Type I errors, thus incorrect acceptance of poorly fitted models <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Herzog &amp; Boomsma, 2009)</ref>. It has been well documented that chi-square tests are seriously inflated as the number of parameters increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Herzog et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kenny &amp; McCoach, 2003)</ref>. Third, asymptotic distribution theory requires large numbers to provide stable estimates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">MacCallum et al. (1996)</ref> suggested that N should always be greater than p. This proposition suggests that for a 70-or 80-item model, sample sizes of 71 or 81 participants would suffice. This, however, is a tentative assumption without strong support from the empirical literature. On the contrary, power analysis simulations most often suggest sample sizes greater than 200 participants (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cirillo &amp; Barroso, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Curran et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref> with 200 participants being particularly inadequate when model sizes increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Herzog et al., 2007)</ref>. Cases where smaller sample sizes have been recommended involve corrections of the maximum likelihood chi-square statistic for various factors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bartlett, 1950;</ref><ref type="bibr">Swain, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yuan, 2005)</ref>, which are beyond the scope of the present article. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents sample size estimates for various SEM designs based on the noncentral chi-square test. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, sample sizes range between 31 and 286 participants. In fact, designs having more than 20 measured indicators and between 4 and 10 latent variables, all required fewer than 100 participants. So a focal question relates to the adequacy of various sample sizes in latent variable structural models in order to explore functional connectivity in the brain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of the Study and Hypotheses Tested</head><p>At present the use of multivariate methods that account for the complexity and interactions in the brain are of limited use in applied research. Several methodologies have been proposed in the literature but have largely been inaccessible to applied researchers. Methods related to SEM have been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Price et al. (2009)</ref> making use of Bayesian methods or <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> suggesting autoregressive methods within path modeling but with measured variables rather than latent (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Roebroeck, Formisano, &amp; Goebel, 2005)</ref>. One of the most prominent approaches to correlated structures involves the simplex model <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rogosa &amp; Willett, 1985)</ref>, which is traced originally to the pioneering work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Guttman (1954)</ref> and posits that later measures of a construct are regressed onto earlier measures of the same construct. It is important that proper methods are tested and made accessible so that the wealth of available neurophysiological information will be properly modeled. SEM is potentially one such methodology, as it allows for modeling complexities in behavior (e.g., model loops, cross-lagged effects, autocorrelation structures, etc.), given adequate sample sizes. Given cost-related issues in this line of research it is important to select a properly estimated sample size to achieve representativeness, parameter stability, and correct decision making (regarding hypotheses of model fit). Unfortunately, however, information about sample size cannot be drawn from other research-related power analyses as the specificity of the complex brain relationships needs to be properly modeled (e.g., by modeling multivariate relationships and autocorrelation structures). The use of earlier suggested rules of thumb cannot be relied on as these rules have been largely atheoretical (not model based), have been outdated, and are unable to account for the complexity often encountered with various data types (e.g., continuous versus categorical, dimensional, count, etc.). They are also silent with regard to model complexity, magnitude of communalities, missing data, and other factors. The present study attempts to (a) model a complex structure in the brain of typical readers and (b) evaluate the minimum sample size requirements to validly support the hypotheses of interest. The following research questions were examined: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Description of Study and Theoretical Model</head><p>The data in the present study came from <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Simos et al. (2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dale, Fischl, &amp; Sereno, 1999)</ref>. Temporally constrained pairwise functional associations between three left hemisphere temporoparietal regions (superior temporal gyrus, STG/ BA22; supramarginal gyrus, SMG/BA40; angular gyrus, ANG/BA39), and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG/BA44/45) were assessed. Functional contributions made by activity in the left fusiform gyrus (BA 37) to each of the temporoparietal regions and IFG were also explored (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The original study employed partial correlation analysis to evaluate pairwise interdependencies in the average current in successive 50-ms bins after controlling for autoregressive (or simplex model) effects. The latent variable model fitted to the same data is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> as derived from the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Simos et al. (2013)</ref> with two exceptions: paths from fusiform to the angular gyrus and from the angular gyrus to IFG were not associated with significant regression coefficients and were dropped from the model. The final structural model featured contributions by the left fusiform gyrus to the superior temporal gyrus, which in turn affected the degree of activity in the supramarginal, angular, and inferior frontal gyri. Activity in the inferior prefrontal cortex was determined by superior temporal and supramarginal activation (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Index variables defining each latent variable represented activity in early (150-200 ms after stimulus onset), middle (500-550 ms after stimulus onset), and late activation in each region (800-850 ms poststimulus onset). The sample's estimates were used to simulate the data in the present study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariance Structure Modeling: Description of the Model and the Simulation</head><p>The present model poses several challenges. First, it is multivariate in nature with several latent variables each defined by several indicators. Second, the indicators represent time series observations. Thus, a typical SEM structure would not hold. For this reason we tested a correlated structure that theoretically is described by an autoregressive process (in that observations at time t are a function of lagged variables from the preceding period; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Curran &amp; Bollen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">van Buuren, 1997)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimating Power</head><p>Power analysis was conducted to estimate the required number of participants to achieve levels of power equal to 80% for the SEM model described in study with a SEM model with 15 measured variables and 5 latent constructs, the number of degrees of freedom is 76 (i.e., 120 -30 -10 -3 -1). Power was estimated using the free package R (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Preacher &amp; Coffman, 2006)</ref>. For a sample syntax file, see the Appendix. The estimated sample size for a level of significance α = 5%, df = 76, null RMSEA 0 = .05 (which is a test of close fit) and an alternative RMSEA a = .08 (test of not so close fit) equaled 159 participants. Thus, power analysis answered the question how many participants were required in order to rule out the hypothesis that two models with a difference of .03 points in their RMSEA values are significantly different from each other (difference between .05 and .08). The focal question of the present study was to evaluate sample sizes in which the power analysis estimate no longer holds.</p></div>

The samples of all sizes were generated from the original data of 51 students, using sampling with replacement <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Simos et al., 2013)</ref>. All analyses were run using the maximum likelihood estimation method and the factor loadings were modeled from the original data (Simulation 1) as well as a set of simulated data that posited all measurement and structural coefficients to have a standardized effect of .5 in order to evaluate power estimation with a configuration of modest relationships and thus, provide a blueprint for a wider range of measured relationships (Simulation 2). Autocorrelation coefficients were set as previously to .30. For the simulation that was guided from the original data, the standardized factor loadings guided the simulation were the following: For indicators X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 , they were λ 11 = . 652, λ 21 = .765, and λ 31 = .900; For items Y 1 to Y 12 , they were λ 11 = .577, λ 21 = .769, λ 31 = .836, λ 41 = .915, λ 51 = .829, λ 61 = .636, λ 71 = .724, λ 81 = .737, λ 91 = .783, λ 101 = .659, λ 111 = .646, and λ 121 = .840. The structural paths were defined as follows: γ 31 = .874, β 13 = . 977, β 32 = .867, and β 42 = .236. Lag-1 autocorrelation coefficients were fixed to .30 to provide for an identifiable effect given a medium effect size. Outcomes of interest were percentages of model solutions (out of 1,000) that converged, termed solution propriety <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gagne, &amp; Hancock, 2006)</ref>, mean significance estimate of chi-square tests, amount of Type I errors of the chi-square test, mean value of the RMSEA and minimum-maximum values, confidence intervals of the RMSEA, mean values of the measurement paths and minimummaximum values, mean values of the structural paths and minimum-maximum values, and mean values of the following descriptive fit indices: goodness-of-fit index (GFI), AGFI, incremental fit index (IFI), McDonald fit index (MFI), NFI, nonnormed fit index (NNFI), and CFI.

Evidence in favor of the stability of parameters within a specific sample size would be provided when the following conditions were met (a) the RMSEA mean value should be contained within the confidence interval defining close fit (i.e., RMSEA &lt; .05), (b) factor loading difference should be within recommended conventions (λ 1 -λ 2 &lt; .10; Wang, Whittaker, &amp; Beretvas, 2012), (c) Δ-Fit index variability should be within ±.02 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fan &amp; Sivo, 2009)</ref>, (d) more than 90% of the models should converge, and (e) Type I errors should be less than 25%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power Analysis Based on the RMSEA and the Observed Sample Estimates (Simulation 1)</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> summarizes the results for power levels equal to 80%. The second column refers to the average probability level observed on the chi-square test from 1,000 replications of size N. The third column refers to percentage of Type I errors again from 1,000 replications. The loading bias column (sixth column from the left) refers to the absolute discrepancy of the mean of the four structural paths (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) across the 1,000 replications. Last, for all estimates the reference model, characterized as the population model, was the model including sample sizes of 1,000 participants across 1,000 replications.</p><p>When looking at the mean RMSEA values, sample sizes of 50 participants were associated with mean RMSEA values less than .05, suggesting close fit. When considering the respective confidence intervals of RMSEA, sample sizes of approximately 70 participants were associated with models evaluating close and not so close fit 95% of the time. With 70 participants, the percentage of Type I errors of the chi-square was 20.4%, which represents a small margin of error for a test of exact fit (which is rather unrealistic). With 70 participants, 100% of the models converged, and the ΔCFI value suggested very small amounts of bias, equal to 0.012, less than the cutoff value of .02 suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fan and Sivo (2009)</ref>. Furthermore, the bias in the structural paths was negligible, that is, equal to 0.0057, and much less than the .10 criterion put forth by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wang et al. (2012)</ref>. Thus, 70 participants would suffice to draw valid conclusions about a model having close to not so close fit across all standards and based on the actual sample's estimates.</p><p>A sample size of 50 participants was further associated with negligible path bias (equal to 0.0081) and plausible close fit according to mean RMSEA values. The vast majority of models converged properly (99.9% of the time) and the mean chi-square value was nonsignificant (for the strict test of exact fit). Thus, for liberal versus conservative estimates 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fan and Sivo (2009)</ref> in their simulation study reported that ΔCFI values greater than .0160 (rounded to .020) should be considered indicative of significant model change or bias. Other researchers have proposed more stringent criteria (i.e., .01 in Δ-Fit values; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>of sample size, 50 to 70 participants would be adequate in testing the hypothesized relationships of the model of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Sample sizes of 40 participants or less are not considered adequate as the upper level of the RMSEA confidence interval was above .10, which is indicative of a poorly fitted model. Interestingly, with 40 participants the structural paths bias was negligible thus stability of the parameters was not an issue. Furthermore, most models converged properly (99.6%).</p><p>For a test of close fit, one would need 150 participants in order for the RMSEA confidence interval to be less than .05 so that the value of close fit would be within the 95% confidence interval. This estimate is nevertheless, much lower than earlier recommendations regarding proper sample sizes. If, however, a researcher is targeting global fit measures, sizes of 150 participants are imperative.</p><p>When looking at the behavior of the fit indices, three were associated with minimum biases, less than .02, with sample sizes equal to 50 participants (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). These were the CFI, the IFI, and the NNFI. The remaining indices were heavily influenced by sample size, which was expected given their formulae. Thus, these three indices suggested that sample sizes of 50 participants were associated with minimal bias and proper evaluation of model fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power Analysis Based on the RMSEA and Parameter Estimates of Modest Magnitude (Simulation 2)</head><p>As a thoughtful reviewer stated the simulation based on the observed estimates from the Simos et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) study would underestimate sample sizes as model fit was excellent. Thus, the simulation was rerun with factor loading estimates equal to .5 in order to evaluate sample size needs with more realistic data sets. These findings are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> for power levels equal to 80%. Results indicated that the findings from the second simulation closely replicated those from the observed data. Once again, sample sizes with 20 to 50 participants were associated with non-acceptable rejection rates of the chi-square statistic and corresponding power levels below .80. Thus, with regard to the omnibus chisquare test a sample size of 70 participants was associated 79.6% correct rejections.</p><p>Similarly, if omnibus model fit is of interest, 150 participants would be required for the RMSEA value of 5% to be estimated within a 95% confidence interval. If, however, one is willing to accept a confidence interval window up to .08, which is still acceptable given conventional standards, a sample size of N = 60 would suffice. Of greater importance, however are parameter estimates and the ability to estimate them with minimal bias. Results, similar to the first simulation, indicated that again 50 participants suffice to accurately estimate measurement and structural paths or even smaller sample sizes; however, fewer than 50 participants were associated with worrisome effects on measures of global fit.</p><p>Fit indices became substantially worse compared with the original data simulation (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). That is, previously sample sizes of 50 participants were associated with minimal bias when relying on the CFI, IFI, and NNFI. When simulating factor loadings to have modest contributions to the latent construct, the required sample sizes for bias less than .02 shifted from 50 participants to 80 participants. Thus, with regard to those three descriptive fit indices, required sample sizes are greater than 80 participants or between 70 and 80 participants. With 150 participants, the MFI was also within a minimum margin of error; all other fit indices, however, required more than 500 participants, which is likely prohibitive for this line of research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>The present study attempted to evaluate the minimum sample size requirements to validly support specific hypotheses regarding functional brain connectivity using real neuromagnetic data. The results showed that 50 to 70 participants seemed to suffice in order to maintain low Type-I error rates, ensure RMSEA values are between .05 and .08 and stable model parameters. Models converged properly (convergence ranged between 99.9% and 100% for sample sizes equal or greater than 50 participants). Estimates of change in descriptive fit statistics were also below the cutoff point of 0.02 with just 50 participants given the simulation that relied on actual data and between 70 and 80 participants using more modest parameter effects. These estimates are much lower compared to earlier recommendations of sample sizes in structural equation modeling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">MacCallum et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MacCallum &amp; Hong, 1997)</ref> and are much larger compared to estimates proposed with regard to path models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Price et al., 2009)</ref>, or longitudinal latent variable models. These findings are encouraging for researchers modeling brain relationships as they recommend manageable numbers.</p><p>Modeling the above relations with 40 participants seemed to be unacceptable because the error rates of the chi-square test increase exponentially. The RMSEA was between close and not so close fit but with a larger confidence interval that moved beyond acceptance. The loading bias for both measurement and structural paths was also worrisome. Thus, as earlier researchers did before us we do not recommend the use of sample sizes with fewer than 40 participants (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chin, &amp; Newstead, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2002)</ref>. Thus, this sample size is not sufficient. The marginal size of 50 participants was associated with a properly accepting chi-square test but with a Type I error of 25%. The point estimate of the RMSEA was acceptable but not its confidence interval that just went higher than .08. Thus 60 to 70 participants are needed to ensure proper model fit and decision making. The above recommendation is based on simulating the actual data set; when using more modest parameter estimates the required sample size becomes N = 80.</p><p>One advantage of the present study relates to modeling and simulation of real functional connectivity data, thus, distributional issues and idiosyncrasies of such data were properly accounted for and this analysis was also supplemented with a simulation having more modest effects in order to provide suggestions based on a broader range of estimated models (i.e., having more modest relationships. This contrasts with previous simulation studies using fixed factor loadings that may not resemble real relationships and actual estimates of measurement error. Also, this study captures the essential limitation of observing a large amount of Type I errors of the chi-square test with data that misfit a model (E. S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim, Yoon, &amp; Lee, 2012)</ref>. Moreover, the correlated nature of brain connectivity was modeled using novel auto-regressive methods suggested by J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim et al. (2007)</ref> by first evaluating the observed lagged relationships. Thus, the findings of the present simulation likely reflect real rather than artificial scenarios of hypothesized regional brain interdependencies. Another advantage of the present study was that a manageable number of indicators was selected (based on lagged relationships) so that conservative estimates of power were obtained (large numbers of indicators could result in excessive power estimates; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marsh, Hau, Balla, &amp; Grayson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wolf et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, we did not find as great as an effect of the magnitude of factor loadings and their influence on sample size as previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wolf et al., 2013)</ref>. For example, we concluded that 70 participants would be adequate for both global model fit and stability of item parameters with the simulation of observed data (that had strong measurement and structural relations). When modeling modest relations, however, we found that only a marginal increase in sample size (from 70 to 80 participants) was required to observe both proper model fit and stable parameter estimates. Under various conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wolf et al. (2013)</ref> recommended between 60 and 190 observations.</p><p>Researchers should also target the largest sample size possible to improve proximity with population parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kelley &amp; Maxwell, 2003)</ref>. Additionally, power should be estimated for the smallest-needed estimated effect. For example, if the interest is in deciphering a small-to-medium correlation between two activation areas, then large samples would be needed and one would need to estimate power for that specific configuration.</p><p>The present study is limited by a number of factors. First, the analysis was not performed for power levels equal to .90 or .95 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wang et al., 2012)</ref>. Such power levels would be associated with findings that would require much larger samples. Instead, the present findings reflect the absolute minimum in terms of sample size requirements and should be viewed as conservative, and in light of contributing absolutely minimum recommendations to the applied researcher. Second, the model tested was of medium size involving only five brain regions and three time indicators per region so inferences about larger models cannot be made. However, such a restricted model is much more appropriate to estimate measurement error in assessing activity in brain areas through latent variables, compared to aggregated terms. Third, the present power estimates are based on real data and thus, the first simulation's findings are bound to the specificities and idiosyncrasies of the present sample and magnetoence-phalography data set. It is important to state here, however, that even larger effects with regard to reading behavior in dyslexia have been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Koyama et al., 2013)</ref>. To account for that limitation we conducted an ancillary proactive simulation in order to evaluate the requirements of minimum sample size with more modest effects (i.e., factor loadings and structural paths equal to .50 in standardized values). Fourth, a number of factors that influence the present estimates have not been accounted for. For example, nonnormality in the data or various missing patterns can seriously moderate the present findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davey &amp; Salva, 2009)</ref>. Fifth, there must be a mention of the positive bias of RMSEA in conditions when it is estimated to be below zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Curran et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fan, Thompson, &amp; Wang, 1999)</ref>. Last, the present simulation presents sample size estimation using a specific approach, which has its own limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Herzog &amp; Boomsma, 2009)</ref>, and assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Curran et al., 2002)</ref> although other alternatives to sample size estimation exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Satorra &amp; Saris, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>In the future, it will be interesting to estimate factors related to the reliability of the measured constructs and ways to account for low reliability when modeling the hypothesized relationships. For example, if constructs are defined by lagged effects one may consider including a large number of lagged relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bollen &amp; Curran, 2004)</ref> in order to improve construct reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Wolf et al., 2013)</ref>. Also, it will be interesting to see where the power analysis model breaks down as the number of parameters increases for a given sample size or when the data misfit the model. The issue of sample size estimation for multigroup models may become particularly important as one would want to test various configurations in the brain across groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Raykov, Marcoulides, Lee, &amp; Chang, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Regardless, the present study suggests that a modest and realistic number of participants suffices to model complex, time-dependent interrelationships in regional brain activity.
