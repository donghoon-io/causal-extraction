<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>In structural equation modeling (SEM), the measurement and structural parts of the model are usually estimated simultaneously. In this paper, we revisit the long-standing idea that we should first estimate the measurement part, and then estimate the structural part. We call this the 'Structural-After-Measurement' (SAM) approach to SEM. We describe a formal framework for the SAM approach under settings where the latent variables and their indicators are continuous. We review earlier SAM methods and establish how they are specific instances of the SAM framework. Decoupled estimation for the measurement and structural parts using SAM possesses three key advantages over simultaneous estimation in standard SEM. First, estimates are more robust against local model misspecifications. Second, estimation routines are less vulnerable to convergence issues in small samples. Third, estimates exhibit smaller finite sample biases under correctly specified models. We propose two variants of the SAM approach. 'Local' SAM expresses the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix of the latent variables as a function of the observed summary statistics and the parameters of the measurement model. 'Global' SAM holds the parameters of the measurement part fixed while estimating the parameters of the structural part. Our framework includes two-step corrected standard errors, and permits computing both local and global fit measures. Nonetheless, the SAM approach is an estimation strategy, and should not be regarded as a model-building tool.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling (SEM)</head><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is an umbrella term for a broad class of statistical models that are widely used in the social and behavioral sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hoyle, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Examples include multivariate regression, path analysis, factor analysis, growth curve models, and multilevel (regression, factor and path) modeling, among many others. The most prototypical use of SEM is for analyzing models with both a measurement part and a structural part. Two examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The measurement part of the model relates the latent variables (depicted by circles inside the dashed box) to their manifest indicators (depicted by rectangles outside the dashed box). The structural part (inside the dashed box) postulates hypotheses concerning the relationships among a set of variables of interest, some of which may be latent. In many practical settings, it is the structural part that is the main interest of the analysis: It reflects the theory that a substantive researcher wants to put to the test. The measurement part arises only because certain variables in the structural part are latent, and must be measured using (typically multiple) manifest indicators. In this paper, we will focus on settings where all latent variables and their indicators are continuous. For related work involving categorical latent variables (or latent class models), see <ref type="bibr">Bakk and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuha (2018, 2021)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bolck et al. (2004), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vermunt (2010)</ref>. For related work involving categorical indicators, or item response theory (IRT) models, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hoshino and Bentler (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lu et al. (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wang et al. (2019)</ref>.</p><p>Clearly, if all the latent variables would be observed (i.e., measured without error), the analysis would be much simpler. We could then use standard linear regression and standard path analysis to estimate the coefficients in the structural parts, such as those depicted inside the dashed box in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> respectively. In fact, because the model in the structural part in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is recursive (no feedback loops), we could also use a sequence of two linear regressions (one for each dependent variable M and Y ) and obtain the same regression coefficients as standard path analysis. Given that many substantive researchers are well-versed in linear regression, it is unsurprising that the following practice is widely used:</p><p>first, the latent variables are replaced by either sum scores or factor scores, and second, linear regression (or path analysis) is used to fit the structural part of the model as if the latent variables were merely observed. However, sum scores and factor scores still contain measurement error leading to biased point estimates of the regression coefficients in the structural part <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Devlieger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">McNeish &amp; Wolf, 2020)</ref>. In addition, the presence of measurement error may lower the power of any hypothesis test that involves these regression coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Carroll et al., 2006)</ref>; this concern is well documented and widely known in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cole &amp; Preacher, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Westfall &amp; Yarkoni, 2016)</ref>. Yet this practice (of merely replacing latent variables with their sum scores or factor scores) dominates in the applied literature, despite the efforts of several generations of statisticians, methodologists, teachers and journal editors stressing the adverse impacts of measurement error on substantive conclusions. There are several possible reasons why applied researchers avoid using SEM to account for measurement error. First, as mentioned before, the main interest of the analysis is often on the structural part, with the measurement part simply being a nuisance due to certain variables being latent. In particular, when interest is in assessing nonlinear relations in the structural part, adding nonlinear terms (e.g., interaction or quadratic terms) to the regression or path analysis models is trivial when all variables are observed, but far from trivial when using SEM under the setting that these nonlinear terms involve latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Brandt et al., 2020)</ref>. Second, fit measures reported by SEM software are typically global indications of how well the full model (including both the measurement and structural part) fits the data. Global fit measures do not accurately reflect local fits of the measurement or structural parts. If the structural part of the model is saturated (as in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), these fit measures only reflect the quality of the measurement part. If the structural part is unsaturated (as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), the global fit measures reflect the conflated quality of both the measurement and structural part, and are therefore not always useful to judge the specific quality of the structural part alone.</p><p>Third, the sample size of the available data is often (mis)conceived to be too small for using SEM. Indeed, SEM has a bad reputation of demanding large sample sizes for successful model fitting and unbiased estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rosseel, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, many applied researchers (wisely) hesitate to use SEM for moderately complex models in the absence of a large sample size; e.g., SEM may be deemed unsuitable for fitting a model with 100 free parameters when the data contains only about 200 observations. In our experience, these applied users avoid SEM not because they are afraid of the additional effort and complexity or because they are unaware of the problem of measurement error. Rather, they genuinely believe that SEM is unsuitable for the problem at hand, either because there is inadequate focus on the structural part of the model, or because the sample size requirements for a healthy SEM analysis are not met.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a formal framework that combines the best of both worlds: the simplicity of using linear regression (or path analysis) to analyze the structural part of the model, but taking into account the measurement error when manifest indicators are used to measure the latent variables in the structural part of the model. Our motivation is twofold:</p><p>we seek to develop an estimation strategy that is relatively robust against local model misspecifications, and we seek to obtain estimates for the structural part of the model with good statistical properties even with only modest sample sizes. We call our solution the 'Structural-After-Measurement' (SAM) approach to SEM. The defining characteristic of the SAM approach is that we first estimate the parameters of the measurement part of the model, and then we estimate the parameters of the structural part of the model. Our paper has three central contributions. First, we will bring together different related solutions in a single coherent framework. The proposed SAM framework is based on a long-standing idea motivating similar methods progressively presented earlier in the literature. In fact, almost as soon as SEM was born in the early seventies, did several authors advocate the SAM approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Burt, 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Burt, , 1976;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hunter &amp; Gerbing, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lance et al., 1988)</ref>. Second, we will provide explicit formulae for estimators of the mean vector and the variance-covariance matrix of the latent variables, as a function of the observed summary statistics and the estimated parameters from the measurement part of the model. These estimators can then be used to construct estimators of the regression or path coefficients in the structural part of the model. Furthermore, our framework includes two-step corrected standard errors for the structural part that account for the uncertainty arising from estimating the parameters in the measurement part. Third, we will implement the SAM framework in open-source software, as part of the R package lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Note that our proposal should not be confused with the 'two-step approach' for model-building that is often recommended in the SEM literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bollen, 2000)</ref>. In such a model-building procedure, the measurement part of the model (only)</p><p>is tested in a first step. Then, if (and only if) the fit is deemed acceptable, the full model (combining the measurement and structural part) is fitted in a second step. In contrast, our proposed approach is an estimation strategy, and is not intended to detect misspecifications in the measurement part. In fact, we will assume throughout this paper that the measurement part of the model is grounded in established subject matter theory and fits the observed data well.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the statistical model formulae and parameters, and describe the standard estimation method for the SEM framework. Then, we review the aforementioned SAM methods that have been presented earlier in the literature, and establish how they are specific instances of the SAM framework.</p><p>Next, we introduce our SAM framework, and describe in detail two variants: 'local' SAM and 'global' SAM. The final section clarifies various connections to more recent work that similarly decouples estimation of the measurement and structural parts. We conclude with a discussion of the SAM approach, possible extensions, and future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SEM framework</head><p>The statistical model used by SEM</p><p>In this section, we introduce notation and the statistical model for a standard SEM.</p><p>Because substantive interest is often in assessing the structural relations between variables, we start with the structural part of the model, which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">η = α + B η + ζ, (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where η is an M × 1 random vector of latent variables, α is an M × 1 vector of intercepts, B is an M × M matrix of coefficients for the regressions of the latent variables on each other, and ζ is an M × 1 random vector of disturbance terms. In most common settings, the diagonal elements of B are set to zero, and (I -B) is invertible by design. To simplify the notation, we will use the convention that an observed variable involved in the structural part of the model (e.g., 'Age' in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) is upgraded to a latent variable, with the observed variable as its only indicator with no measurement error. To obtain the model-implied mean vector E(η) and variance-covariance matrix Var(η), we first rewrite (1) in its so-called reduced form, where η only appears in the left-hand side of the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">η = (I -B) -1 (α + ζ) = (I -B) -1 α + (I -B) -1 ζ. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>Assuming E(ζ) = 0 and writing Var(ζ) = Ψ, it follows from (2) that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E(η) = (I -B) -1 α (3) Var(η) = (I -B) -1 Ψ (I -B) -T . (4)</formula><p>The measurement part of the model relates the latent variables to their manifest indicators and is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">y = ν + Λ η + , (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where y is a P × 1 random vector of observed variables, ν is a P × 1 vector of intercepts, Λ is a P × M matrix of factor loadings relating the M latent variables to the P observed variables, and is a P × 1 random vector of residual errors. We assume that E( ) = 0, Cov(η, ) = 0, Cov( , ζ) = 0, and we denote the variance-covariance matrix of by Θ. It follows from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) that the model-implied mean vector µ = E(y) and variance-covariance matrix Σ = Var(y) are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">µ = ν + Λ E(η)<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">Σ = Λ Var(η) Λ + Θ.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The model matrices are then α, B, and Ψ for the structural part, and ν, Λ, and Θ for the measurement part. A structural model can be defined by setting certain elements of these model matrices to a fixed constant (often zero or one), while allowing other elements to be free. The T free elements are collected in a T -dimensional parameter vector ϑ. For a given choice of values of ϑ, the model-implied summary statistics can be written as µ(ϑ) and Σ(ϑ)</p><p>to stress that they are a function of these free parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The standard estimation approach in SEM</head><p>A common (working) assumption in SEM is that the data y follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector µ and variance-covariance matrix Σ. Given a set of i.i.d. data vectors Y = {y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y N }, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation then seeks those values of ϑ that maximize the multivariate normal log-likelihood given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">logl(ϑ|Y) = - N P 2 ln(2π)- N 2 ln |Σ(ϑ)|- N 2 tr SΣ(ϑ) -1 - N 2 [ ȳ-µ(ϑ)] Σ(ϑ) -1 [ ȳ-µ(ϑ)], (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where ȳ is the sample mean vector, S is the (biased) sample variance-covariance matrix (divided by N instead of N -1), and tr[•] is the trace operator that computes the sum of the diagonal elements of its matrix argument. It can be shown that maximizing ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">8</ref>) is equivalent to minimizing</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">F N M L (ϑ) = [ ȳ -µ(ϑ)] T Σ(ϑ) -1 [ ȳ -µ(ϑ)] + tr SΣ(ϑ) -1 -ln |SΣ(ϑ) -1 | -P,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>which is commonly called the normal theory-based ML discrepancy function <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Browne &amp; Arminger, 1995)</ref>. Another popular discrepancy function is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">F W LS = [s -σ(ϑ)] T V [s -σ(ϑ)], (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where s is a P × 1 vector collecting all the non-redundant observed summary statistics (for example, the elements of ȳ and the lower triangular elements of S) and σ is its model-implied counterpart. The V matrix is used as a weight matrix. Several estimators can be defined depending on the choice of V. Ideally, we set V = Γ-1 , where Γ is an estimator of the asymptotic variance matrix of the observed summary statistics in s. This is called Asymptotically Distribution Free (ADF) or weighted least squares (WLS) estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Browne, 1984)</ref>. Under normality, V simplifies and becomes a function of ȳ and S only, leading to normal-theory generalized least squares (GLS) estimation. If V is an identity matrix, we obtain unweighted least squares (ULS) estimation. To minimize the discrepancy function in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>) or (10), we need an optimization method, because in general, no closed-form solutions are available. Possible choices include Newton-Raphson, Fisher scoring, and various quasi-Newton methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kochenderfer &amp; Wheeler, 2019)</ref>. We denote the resulting estimator of ϑ by θ.</p><p>All these estimators (ML, ADF, GLS, ULS) are available in various SEM software packages, such as LISREL (K. G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1996)</ref>, EQS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bentler, 2004)</ref>, Mplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010)</ref>, OpenMx <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Neale et al., 2016 and</ref><ref type="bibr">lavaan (Rosseel, 2012)</ref>. All these SEM packages use maximum likelihood (ML) estimation as the default estimator. That is why we call this the 'standard' estimation approach in the SEM framework. For our purposes, it is important to underline three aspects that these estimators have in common. First, they rely on iterative optimization procedures. Second, although all these estimators are consistent, optimal statistical properties are attained only if all the assumptions hold and the sample size is 'sufficiently' large. Third, all parameters (in both the measurement and structural parts) are estimated simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problems with the standard estimation approach in SEM</head><p>A variety of problems can arise when using the standard estimation approach. Because the optimization procedure is iterative, it is possible that no (local or global) solution that minimizes a given discrepancy function is found at all. This is referred to as 'non-convergence.' Non-convergence is observed most often in settings where the sample size is (very) small, even if the model is correctly specified <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Boomsma, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yuan &amp; Bentler, 1997)</ref>, and remains a vulnerability even if some solutions are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Lüdtke et al., 2021)</ref>. If a solution is found, some parameters may be out-of-range with estimates outside the boundary of the parameter space. For example, variances may be estimated to be negative, or correlations may be estimated to be larger than one (in absolute value). This is called an 'improper' solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Van Driel, 1978)</ref>, and again, they are most likely to occur when the sample size is small <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gerbing &amp; Anderson, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Estimators such as ML and GLS further rely on distributional assumptions.</p><p>Specifically, they assume that all latent variables and error terms (and therefore, the data) are multivariate normally distributed. While point estimates using ML (and GLS) are are relatively robust to nonnormality, the standard error estimates and the chi-square model test statistics are much more susceptible to violations of the normality assumption. Hence ML estimation is often combined with robust standard errors and a robust test statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Satorra &amp; Bentler, 1994)</ref>. Estimators such as ADF and ULS do not rely on distributional assumption, but are encumbered by other drawbacks. It is well-known that huge sample sizes are needed to obtain good quality point estimates using ADF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Curran et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hu et al., 1992)</ref>. The reason is that the P × P dimensional Γ matrix can become very large, and it takes a very large amount of data to estimate it properly. ULS estimation is known to be less efficient than the other estimators, and is neither scale-free nor scale-invariant <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kaplan, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, ULS is consistent and often overlooked in the SEM literature.</p><p>Perhaps the most subtle shortcoming with the standard estimation procedures is that they estimate all the parameters (in both the measurement and structural parts)</p><p>simultaneously. Such so-called 'system-wide' estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bollen, 1996)</ref> works well only if both the measurement and structural parts in the full model are correctly specified. But if one part of the model is misspecified (e.g., a missing cross-loading or error-covariance in a measurement model), all parameters are affected, leading to biased estimates in other correctly specified parts of the model (such as the structural relations). Avoiding such biases by estimating the model in parts is therefore a major motivation of not only our proposed SAM approach, but also the model-implied instrumental variable (MIIV) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bollen, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bollen, , 2019))</ref>. MIIV is an alternative estimation procedure for SEM, and has been demonstrated to be (much more) robust against local model misspecifications, compared to the standard (system-wide) approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bollen et al., 2018)</ref>. A similar procedure that does not rely on instrumental variables is proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Burghgraeve et al. (2021)</ref>. We will refer to these two methods as the equation-by-equation approach. However, as we will discuss in a later section, they do not fall within our SAM framework because they do not necessitate estimating the measurement part before estimating the structural part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Earlier SAM approaches in the SEM literature</head><p>Before the advent of software packages such as LISREL (K. G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1996)</ref> and EQS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bentler, 2004)</ref> in the seventies and eighties, the SAM approach was the norm in the social and behavioural sciences. There was simply no other choice. But the rapid adoption of these SEM software packages led to simultaneous estimation of both the measurement and structural part quickly becoming the dominant approach in the SEM literature. This was reinforced by a growing emphasis on the importance of the joint (or 'one-step') modeling strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bentler, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fornell &amp; Yi, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hayduk, 1987)</ref>. Since the start of the LISREL revolution in the early seventies, only a few papers were steadfast in explicitly advocating the SAM approach. We will discuss three of these papers (listed in chronological order) in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Burt (1976)</head><p>Burt ( <ref type="formula">1976</ref>) was mostly concerned with a problem that he called 'interpretational confounding.' Already in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Burt (1973)</ref> did he make the following observation (reinterpreted to the current context as follows): When the same unidimensional measurement model (representing a single latent construct) is used in different models, and all parameters are estimated simultaneously, the factor loadings for this latent variable may change across models. These changes may then shift the meaning or interpretation of the latent variable.</p><p>Therefore, in a given model, we may have a potential discrepancy between the 'intended' meaning of the latent variable, and the 'empirical' meaning of the latent variable. To avoid this problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Burt (1976)</ref> suggested the following alternative estimation procedure: First, for the measurement part, each measurement model (a single latent variable with its set of indicators) is fitted separately using maximum likelihood estimation. Then, keeping the parameters related to the measurement part fixed, all the remaining parameters in the full model can be estimated in a second stage, again using maximum likelihood estimation. This is a clear example of a SAM approach.</p><p>The Burt approach of fitting a separate confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for each latent variable is not without its own problems. For example <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fornell and Yi (1992)</ref> demonstrated how separate CFAs could individually fit very well, despite having indicators that were (deliberately) assigned to the wrong factor. But when these misspecified (but well-fitting) measurement models were then embedded in a correctly specified structural model, the model fit of the full model strongly suggested that the model did not fit well, thus incorrectly implying a misspecified structural model. On the other hand, from an estimation perspective, it is interesting to observe that if we follow Burt's approach, the point estimate for the (only) regression coefficient in the structural part of the model (0.878) is very close to the true population value (0.700) in the example given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fornell and Yi (1992)</ref>.</p><p>Hunter &amp; Gerbing (1982) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hunter and Gerbing (1982)</ref> offer another explicit example of the SAM approach.</p><p>Unlike Burt's approach, these authors use a single CFA (including all latent variables) in a first step, resulting in a correlation matrix among all the latent variables. This correlation matrix is then used in a second step to estimate the structural part of the model. In their paper, the focus was on recursive models, and therefore, a series of linear regressions could be used to estimate all the needed path coefficients. But they also mention (on page 295) that for non-recursive models, 'two-stage least squares' (2SLS) or 'full information maximum likelihood' could be used. An interesting aspect of this paper is that they refer to an unpublished manuscript by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gerbing &amp; Hunter (1980)</ref> entitled: 'The return to multiple groups:</p><p>Analysis and critique of confirmatory factor analysis with LISREL.' The 'multiple groups' method here (not to be confused with multiple group CFA) refers to a noniterative estimation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Holzinger, 1944;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Thurstone, 1945)</ref> that was used before the advent of maximum likelihood estimation (K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Jöreskog, 1967)</ref> to estimate CFA models (See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Stuive et al., 2008)</ref>. So both stages in the SAM approach exemplified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hunter and Gerbing (1982)</ref> were noniterative.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SAM framework</head><p>As the name suggests, in a 'Structural-after-Measurement' framework, we first estimate the parameters that are related to the measurement part of the model. Then, keeping these estimated measurement parameters fixed, we estimate the remaining parameters of the structural part of the model. To formalize this idea, we will collect the parameters of the measurement part in the vector ϑ 1 , and the parameters of the structural part in the vector ϑ 2 . In particular, ϑ 1 consists of the free elements in the following model matrices: the intercepts (ν), the factor loadings (Λ), and the variance-covariance matrix of the error terms (Θ); and ϑ 2 consists of the free elements in the following model matrices for the latent variables: the intercepts (α), the regression coefficients (B), and the variance-covariance matrix of the disturbances (Ψ). We seek to obtain good quality point (and standard error) estimates for ϑ 2 , and we will use θ1 only as a means to obtain θ2 . Therefore, the proposed framework offers a foundation for multiple possibilities to estimate these parameter subsets.</p><p>We will first discuss estimation of the measurement part, and then discuss two approaches to estimate the structural part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimating the measurement part</head><p>By temporarily ignoring the structural part of the model, we can readily apply methods for estimating a CFA model with M latent variables (or factors). Suppose that we use a standard CFA using maximum likelihood estimation, and we allow all latent variables to freely covary with each other, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lance et al. (1988)</ref>. We would then obtain estimates of the free parameters in ν, Λ, and Θ, and collect them in the vector θ1 . Because our focus is on estimating the measurement part, estimates for the variance-covariance matrix of the latent variables (Ψ) are ignored at this point. An alternative strategy could be to estimate M separate one-factor CFAs, one for each latent variable, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Burt (1976)</ref>. we use B to denote the number of measurement blocks, then we can make a distinction between these three strategies as follows:</p><p>1. B = 1: a single measurement block contains all the latent variables;</p><p>2. B = M : each latent variable has its own measurement block;</p><p>3. 1 &lt; B &lt; M : at least one measurement block contains more than one latent variable.</p><p>In terms of robustness against model misspecifications in the measurement part, it is advantageous to adopt the B = M or 1 &lt; B &lt; M strategy. A maximal number of measurement blocks improves the chances that a misspecified measurement block will not affect the other measurement blocks. Nonetheless, manifest indicators for different latent variables can be linked or connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hayes &amp; Usami, 2020)</ref> due to equality constraints, cross-loadings, or correlated residuals. For example, theory may dictate a single measurement block for several latent variables due to cross-loadings between the indicators of different variables. There may be other arguments to prefer B &lt; M over B = M . For example, a one-factor measurement block with only two indicators cannot be identified; whereas a one-factor measurement block with only three indicators is saturated, and no fit measures will be available. In general, we do not recommend the B = 1 strategy. Any biases due to misspecifying the measurement model for one latent variable will likely spread to the (correctly specified) measurement models for other latent variables within the same measurement block, minimizing the benefits of the SAM approach. This method of compartmentalization turns out to be crucial if we wish to build an estimation procedure that is robust against local misspecifications.</p><p>Focusing on only the measurement blocks permits using different estimators for the measurement model parameters. In particular, noniterative estimators for CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bentler, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bollen, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Burghgraeve et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dijkstra &amp; Schermelleh-Engel, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hägglund, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Holzinger, 1944;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ihara &amp; Kano, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Thurstone, 1945)</ref> can be used instead of prevailing maximum likelihood estimators. Noniterative estimators have many advantages. They do not suffer from non-convergence issues, and depending on the implementation, they always produce proper solutions. If estimation fails, the cause is often revealed directly, making it easier to fix the problem. Noniterative estimators are also extremely fast, and this can be helpful if they are used in combination with computationally-intensive resampling methods.</p><p>An extensive study of these noniterative estimators in the context of the SAM framework will be reported in a separate paper (But see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Takane &amp; Hwang, 2018)</ref>. Hence estimating the measurement part of the model separately from the structural part has the dual benefits of protection against biases from local model misspecifications, and permitting more computationally robust noniterative estimation methods.</p><p>After the parameters of the measurement part have been estimated, we can proceed with estimating the parameters in the structural part. We make a distinction between two different approaches leading to local SAM and global SAM respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimating the structural part using local SAM</head><p>The idea behind local SAM is that the estimated parameters of the measurement part (stored in θ1 ) are used together with the observed summary statistics ( ȳ and S) to construct an estimate of the mean vector E(η) and the variance-covariance matrix Var(η) of the latent variables. These estimated summary statistics of the latent variables can then be used in a standard linear regression or path analysis to obtain the parameter estimates of the structural part. Because the latter analysis only 'sees' the summary statistics of the latent variables, we call this approach 'local' SAM. In order to find an explicit expression for E(η) and Var(η), we start from (5), and solve for η:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ν + Λ η + = y Λ η = y -ν - MΛ η = M [y -ν -] η = M [y -ν -] , (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where M is an M × P mapping matrix such that MΛ = I M . We elaborate in the next section how to formulate M. In fact, there are several possibilities, but the key property is that MΛ = I M . It follows from (11) that we can express the expectation and variance of η as (see Appendix A):</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E(η) = M [E(y) -ν] (12) Var(η) = M [Var(y) -Θ] M T . (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>The local SAM approach can now be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. In a first stage, we estimate the parameters of the measurement part of the model as described in the previous section. This results in estimates for ν, Λ, and Θ, collected in θ1 . We choose a suitable formulation of M and plug in the estimates of θ1 and the summary statistics of the observed data to obtain an estimate M. Finally, we estimate E(η) and Var(η) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">E(η) = M [ ȳ -ν] (14) Var(η) = M [S -Θ] MT . (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">)</formula><p>2. In a second stage, we use E(η) and Var(η) to estimate ϑ 2 , the parameters related to the structural part. Depending on the model, we can use standard linear regression, a sequence of linear regressions (if the model is recursive), or standard path analysis.</p><p>For the second stage, we can use various estimators. Standard iterative methods such as ML and GLS can be used for more complex path models. But another option for non-recursive path models (e.g., with feedback loops, or with correlations between predictors and residual error terms) is to use two-stage least squares (2SLS) in combination with instrumental variables, which is noniterative <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bollen, 1996)</ref>. If the path model is recursive, or just a linear regression model, we can use ordinary (unweighted) least-squares. Whenever possible, we prefer noniterative estimation methods for the reasons stated above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choosing the mapping matrix M</head><p>A key ingredient of the local SAM approach is the mapping matrix M. A rationale behind the choice of M can be given by carefully choosing a discrepancy function that reflects the distance between the (full) model and the data. We describe three examples: the ML discrepancy function in (9), or the WLS discrepancy in (10) where we use either the normal-theory (GLS) or unweighted least-squares (ULS) variant. We assume for the moment that ν, Λ and Θ are known, and solve for Var(η) and E(η). The derivations are shown in Appendix B and lead to the following results:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">M = (Λ T Θ -1 Λ) -1 Λ T Θ -1 (ML) (16) M = (Λ T S -1 Λ) -1 Λ T S -1 (GLS) (17) M = (Λ T Λ) -1 Λ T . (ULS)<label>(18)</label></formula><p>It can be easily verified that all three choices of M satisfy the requirement that MΛ = I M .</p><p>Another important feature is that they only rely on Λ , Θ and S: the former two ingredients are available from the measurement part, and the latter is simply the observed sample variance-covariance matrix. The three choices of M have pleasantly familiar expressions. The first (ML) corresponds to the factor score matrix that is used by the Bartlett method to compute factor scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bartlett, 1937</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bartlett, , 1938))</ref>. It only depends on Λ and Θ. An alternative but equivalent expression for the Bartlett factor score matrix is given by (Λ T Σ -1 Λ) -1 Λ T Σ -1 <ref type="bibr">(Bentler &amp; Yuan, 1997)</ref>. If we replace Σ by S, we obtain the second (GLS) expression.</p><p>Finally, the ULS solution is nothing more than the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Λ + = (Λ T Λ) -1 Λ T .</formula><p>We have focused on selected choices of M simply to aid our exposition of local SAM, and defer investigating more possible choices and their properties to future work.</p><p>Plugging in the ML solution for M in ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">15</ref>) gives the following estimators of the summary statistics of the latent variables:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">E(η) = ( ΛT Θ-1 Λ) -1 ΛT Θ-1 [ ȳ -ν] (19) Var(η) = ( ΛT Θ-1 Λ) -1 ΛT Θ-1 [S -Θ] Θ-1 Λ ( ΛT Θ-1 Λ) -1 .

The fact that the ML solution for M is identical to the Bartlett factor score matrix is of course no coincidence. We explain the relationship with factor scores in a later section.</p><p>Finally, in Appendix C, we have provided R code to illustrate the various steps that are needed to apply the local SAM method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of local SAM</head><p>The local SAM approach is useful in most practical settings. However, we describe three settings where local SAM cannot be applied but SEM (and global SAM) can be applied.</p><p>First and foremost, there must be a clear distinction between the measurement part and the structural part of the model. This implies that indicators of a latent variable cannot be involved in the structural part of the model. To illustrate, consider the model in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Here, the indicator x 3 of the latent variable X has a direct effect on the latent variable Y . This is not allowed in the local SAM approach.</p><p>Another class of models that cannot be fitted with local SAM have (by design) a factor loading matrix Λ that is not of full column rank. If Λ is rank-deficient, any product involving Λ (e.g., Λ T Θ -1 Λ, Λ T SΛ, or Λ T Λ) will also be rank-deficient, and therefore not invertible, making it impossible to compute the M matrix. A specific example is the Social Relations Model (SRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kenny &amp; La Voie, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Loncke et al., 2018)</ref>. In such models, the number of latent variables often exceeds the number of observed variables, so that identification requires fixing most (if not all) elements in Λ to a (non)zero constant. The Social Relations Model belongs to a broad class of variance-components models, and when these models are translated to the SEM framework, they often result in a rank-deficient Λ matrix. In addition, these models often impose an a-priori structure on the variance-covariance matrix Var(η), fixing many off-diagonal elements to zero. Applying local SAM to these models would require a reparameterization that is deferred to future work.</p><p>A final (more technical) limitation of local SAM is that we require the estimator Var(η) to be positive definite. This requirement imposes the restriction that the difference [S -Θ ] must be positive definite, where S = MS MT and Θ = M Θ MT . Violations of this restriction can be overcome using a solution that is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fuller (1987)</ref>. First, we compute the smallest root, λ, of the determinantal equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">|S -λ Θ | = 0;<label>(21)</label></formula><p>and then we compute Var(η) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Var(η) =          S -Θ if λ ≥ 1 + (N -1) -1 S -λ -(N -1) -1 Θ if λ &lt; 1 + (N -1) -1 , (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">)</formula><p>where N is the sample size. A similar (and almost equivalent) solution has been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amemiya (1985)</ref> in the context of random-effect models. Although this solution is technically correct, clarifying how such adjustments affect the quality of the results in realistic sample sizes is deferred to future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimating the structural part using global SAM</head><p>Global SAM, just like local SAM, starts with the estimation of the measurement blocks. However, we do not explicitly construct estimators of E(η) and Var(η). Instead, we simply fill in the model matrices that are related to the measurement part (ν, Λ, and Θ) and keep them fixed. Then, we estimate the remaining (free) parameters of the structural part using standard SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Burt, 1976)</ref>. Because the analysis in the final step 'sees' the full model with both the measurement and structural parts, we call this approach 'global' SAM. The computation of E(η) and Var(η) is implicit, although it can be made explicit post-estimation.</p><p>Therefore, the key distinction from local SAM is that during the estimation stage of the structural part, E(η) and Var(η) are not used, and no mapping matrix M is needed. The global SAM approach can now be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. In a first stage, we estimate the parameters of the measurement part of the model as described in an earlier section. This results in estimates for ν, Λ, and Θ, collected in θ1 .</p><p>2. In a second stage, we estimate the parameters of the structural part of the model, keeping the parameters of the measurement model fixed. This results in estimates for B and Ψ, collected in θ2 .</p><p>For the measurement part in the first stage, we again recommend noniterative estimators, although iterative (ML) estimators are possible. But for the structural part in the second stage, we have only relied (so far) on traditional iterative estimators, especially ML, GLS, or WLS, from standard SEM. Notwithstanding the reliance on standard SEM estimation, we emphasize that a subset of the parameters have already been computed and are held fixed in global SAM.</p><p>If a model can be fitted with local SAM, and the same estimators are used in both stages of global SAM, then the results (for the structural part) will be identical. However, global SAM can be applied in settings where local SAM cannot be applied. For example, global SAM can be used to fit the model in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In principle, global SAM can be used to fit any model that can be fitted with standard SEM.</p><p>In the current implementation of global SAM, we always ignore the elements of the Ψ matrix that are computed during the first stage, just as in local SAM. In future implementations, we may store the variances (and covariances) of exogeneous latent variables and keep them fixed during the second stage. If some covariances have not been computed yet, we could use (13) again but only for these exogenous latent variables. This would correspond to the fixed.x = TRUE option in lavaan. This will not change the results, but may further reduce the number of free parameters that need to be estimated in the second stage, which can be particularly useful if there are many exogenous latent variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-step standard errors</head><p>In standard SEM where all parameters are estimated simultaneously, standard errors for all the model parameters are easily computed <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Savalei &amp; Rosseel, 2021)</ref>. In our two-stage SAM procedure, we have two sets of standard errors: those associated with the measurement part (θ 1 ), and those associated with the structural part (θ 2 ). The former can be computed using the standard approach. But for the latter, it is important that we take into account the uncertainty from the first stage in the two-stage process. In the current implementation in lavaan (0.6-9), we use the same approach for both local and global SAM. The method we use is essentially equivalent to equation 17 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al. (2014)</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gong and Samaniego (1981)</ref>. The details are provided in Appendix D.</p><p>An alternative to closed-form expressions for the standard errors is to use a resampling method, such as the nonparametric bootstrap <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Efron, 1979)</ref>. The nonparametric bootstrap does not rely on distributional assumptions, and works well even in small samples. In particular for local SAM, when noniterative estimators are used in both stages, this may be an attractive alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global and local fit measures</head><p>Both local and global SAM first estimate the measurement part of the model. For each fitted measurement block, we can inspect the fit measures. We refer to these fit measures as 'local' fit measures, as they only reflect the fit for a selected portion of the full model. Applied users can use these local fit measures to verify that the measurement blocks themselves fit well. It should be noted, however, that when a measurement block only contains a single latent variable and three indicators, the model is saturated, and no fit measures will be available. Similarly, the structural part will have its own set of fit measures (if the structural part is not saturated).</p><p>Nevertheless, as demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fornell &amp; Yi, 1992)</ref>, these local fit measures may fail to detect certain types of model misspecifications that are only revealed when the full model is evaluated. Therefore, we also need a method to construct global fit measures, even if a SAM approach is used to estimate the model parameters. In the SAM framework, this can be accomplished by filling in the estimated parameters into the model matrices for the full model, and using these to compute a global model-implied variance-covariance matrix Σ.</p><p>Similarly, if a meanstructure is included, we can compute a global model-implied mean vector μ. We can then use these model-implied summary statistics to compute 'pseudo' versions of the traditional global fit measures. To approximate the chi-square test statistic (and other fit measures that depend on it), we use the ML discrepancy function in (9), even if non-ML estimators have been used in the two estimation stages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Devlieger et al. (2019)</ref> have described this procedure in the context of factor score regression and showed that these 'pseudo' global fit measures behave in a very similar way as the traditional fit measures using SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An illustrative example</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the SEM literature, the traditional approach is to jointly estimate the measurement part and the structural part of the model. In contrast, in other fields, the dominant approach is to estimate these parts separately. For example, in the literature on measurement error models, it is usually assumed that all the relevant information about the measurement part (i.e., the S vv and S uu matrices, or the score reliabilities) is already known, based on previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Carroll et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fuller, 1987)</ref>. When estimating the structural part, this information is then taken into account. Another example is the analysis of datasets collected in large-scale assessment programs such as TIMSS and PISA. Here, item response theory (IRT) models are typically used for the measurement part. Plausible values are then computed to represent the latent variables. Plausible values are similar to factor scores, but instead of generating a single (factor) score for each individual, multiple 'plausible' values are computed to reflect the inherent uncertainty that is involved when unknown quantities are replaced by observable quantities. These plausible values are then used in a separate analysis to estimate the structural part (often called a 'secondary analysis') <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mislevy, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Von Davier &amp; Sinharay, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wu, 2005)</ref>. Both examples implicitly adopt a SAM approach where the measurement part precedes estimation of the structural part.</p><p>In this paper, we have built on earlier literature to develop a formal framework applying the SAM approach to SEM. We made a distinction between local and global SAM.</p><p>Local SAM generalizes earlier work on bias-corrected factor score regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Devlieger et al., 2016)</ref>, and was thus the main focus of this paper. In fact, we recommend local SAM over global SAM whenever possible. In our view, global SAM is mostly useful for settings where local SAM cannot be used.</p><p>The SAM framework is implemented in the sam() function, which is part of the lavaan package. In this paper, we have only described the use of local SAM in a single-group, single-level setting, but various extensions have already been developed. The current implementation of the sam() function in lavaan 0.6-9 supports multiple-group models (including equality constraints across groups) and twolevel SEMs with random intercepts.</p><p>Other extensions are currently under development, and include the handling of missing data, noniterative estimators, support for categorical indicators, and support for interaction and quadratic terms in the structural part. For the latter, explicit formulae have been derived for E(η ⊗ η) and Var(η ⊗ η) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Burghgraeve, 2021)</ref>. We will communicate about these extensions in future papers.</p><p>It is important to reiterate that our SAM framework is an estimation strategy. It is not intended as a model-building tool, and therefore, it is not designed to detect misspecifications in the measurement part. We assume that the measurement part is well-grounded in subject matter theory, and fits the observed data well, and researchers only wish to account for the (nuisance of) measurement error when estimating the structural part of the model. Therefore, our SAM approach is not meant to replace traditional SEM. But as an estimation procedure, we believe it has potential because it is more robust against local model misspecifications, and it can be applied in settings where the samples size is small (relative to the size of the full model). Local SAM can thus be particularly fruitful when measurement error is limited to a subset of the variables whose structural (or causal) relations are of primary interest; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Loh et al. (2020)</ref> for an example of such a setting in the context of longitudinal (causal) mediation.</p><p>We have not included simulation studies in this paper to support the claimed advantages of the SAM approach. Rather, we have shown that specific implementions of the SAM approach, such as factor score regression (and path analysis) with Croon's corrections, measurement error models, the 2SMM estimator, and single-indicator models that have previously shown to outperform traditional SEM under certain settings, are a special case of (local) SAM.</p><p>There is, of course, much work to be done.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C R code to illustrate how SAM works</head><p>In this Appendix, we provide R code (see below) and some partial output to illustrate how various aspects of the SAM approach work. As a working example, we use the model depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. For simplicity, we ignore the meanstructure and assume all observed variables are centered at zero. First, we generate random data drawn from this model, and then transform the data so that it perfectly corresponds to the population model (block 1: Lines 3-20). This removes all sampling variability and makes it easier to verify the results. Then we first apply traditional SEM with ML estimation (block 2: Lines 22-36). Unsurprisingly, SEM was able to estimate the regression coefficients perfectly (partial output: Lines 38-46). We can also compute the model-implied variance-covariance matrix Var(η) obtained by SEM (Lines 48-55). It can be verified by the reader that all the reported regression coefficients can be obtained from this variance-covariance matrix. Next, we start the local SAM approach. We do this by first estimating a CFA for each of the (five) latent variables (Lines 58-62). To proceed, we assemble the Λ and Θ matrices, by filling in the corresponding elements from the individual measurement blocks (Lines 64-76). We then compute the ML solution for M (Lines 78-80). We only need to add an additional row and column to M and Θ for the only observed variable (Age) that is included in the structural part. We fill in the number 1 in M and 0 in Θ (Lines: 82-84). The final ingredient is the (biased) sample covariance matrix S (Lines 87-89). Now we are ready to apply (13) to estimate Var(η) (Lines 91-92). As can be seen in the output (Lines 95-101), this variance-covariance matrix is identical to the one we obtained from traditional SEM using ML estimation. Lastly, we manually compute the regression coefficients (Lines: 103-120). As the output shows, they match the population values perfectly.</p><p>To automate these steps, we have created the sam() function in the lavaan package </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two-step corrected standard errors</head><p>We provide a brief description of how the two-step corrected standard errors are computed in the sam() function. Let T 1 and T 2 denote the length of ϑ 1 and ϑ 2 respectively. The total number of free parameters in the full model is then given by T = T 1 + T 2 . First, a T 1 × T 1 empty matrix Σ 11 is constructed. For each fitted measurement block, we compute the variance-covariance matrix for the free parameters in this block. The rows and columns of this variance-covariance matrix that correspond to parameters that also appear in the full model are filled in into the corresponding rows and columns of Σ 11 . We do this for all measurement blocks. If some of these rows and columns correspond to parameters that are estimated (again) in the structural part (for example, factor variances, or other elements from the Ψ matrix), they are set to zero. After we have fitted the structural part, we compute the T 2 × T 2 variance-covariance matrix Σ 22 of the parameters in ϑ 2 (ignoring for the moment the two-stage process). Next, we fill in all the estimated parameters into the model matrices of the full model. Then, a joint T × T information matrix is computed for all the parameters in the full model. We order the information matrix so that the first rows (and columns) correspond to the parameters of the measurement part only. This results in a partitioned matrix with the following form:</p><p>where the 1-index corresponds to the measurement part, and the 2-index corresponds to the structural part. The two-step corrected T 2 × T 2 variance-covariance matrix of the structural parameters (Σ 2(1) ) is then computed as follows:</p><p>The first term on the right hand side is the 'naive' estimator, ignoring the uncertainty that comes from estimating the parameters in the measurement part. The second term is a correction term that is added to account for the two-step estimation process.</p><p>Although this method works well, there may be several ways to improve it. First, when the sample size is small, it may be beneficial to use a slightly more complicated expression, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gong and Samaniego (1981)</ref>; see also equation 18 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakk et al. (2014)</ref>. Second, although this method comes natural for the global SAM approach, it is somewhat incompatible with the local SAM approach. The reason is that we must take on a global view to compute the joint information matrix in (45). Note that we only needed this joint information matrix to obtain the I 21 -part. The I 22 -part and the I 11 -part are not used.</p><p>In future research, we hope to find a method to approximate the I 21 -part without the need to switch back to a global perspective. Finally, to allow for robust (sandwich-type) standard errors in both parts, we plan to adopt the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yuan and Chan (2002)</ref>. </p></div>			</div>
