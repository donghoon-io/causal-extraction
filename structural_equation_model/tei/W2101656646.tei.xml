<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Students who are enrolled in MOOCs tend to have different motivational patterns than fee-paying college students. A majority of MOOC students demonstrate characteristics akin more to "tourists" than formal learners. As a consequence, MOOC students' completion rate is usually very low. The current study examines the relations among student motivation, engagement, and retention using structural equation modeling and data from a Penn State University MOOC. Three distinct types of motivation are examined: intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and social motivation. Two main hypotheses are tested: (a) motivation predicts student course engagement; and (b) student engagement predicts their retention in the course. The results show that motivation is significantly predictive of student course engagement. Furthermore, engagement is a strong predictor of retention. The findings suggest that promoting student motivation and monitoring individual students' online activities might improve course retention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The large enrollment characteristic of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has generated excitement and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Pappano, 2012)</ref>. A typical MOOC attracts around 20,000 students <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Jordan, 2014b)</ref>. However, a MOOC can potentially accommodate an unlimited number of students because, unlike a traditional classroom, a MOOC usually entails minimal student-instructor interaction. Also, unfortunately, unlike a traditional class, the student completion rates for MOOCs are low.</p><p>The median of MOOC completion rates is about 6.5% with most completion rates below 10% <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Jordan, 2014a)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have started to investigate possible reasons for attrition in MOOCs, most notably by examining student-level variables, such as motivation and social engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Khalil &amp; Ebner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rosé et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang &amp; Rosé, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yuan &amp; Powell, 2013)</ref>. However, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>What influences MOOC retention? <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jordan (2014a)</ref> has gathered the available data from different online sources to explore factors that may affect MOOC completion. She mainly studied macro-level factors, especially courselevel variables such as course launching time, total enrollment, and university rank. These were found to be unrelated to the completion rate. Course length was the only variable to have a negative correlation with the completion rate.</p><p>As might be predicted, a lack of time is an obstacle, given that MOOCs serve as a supplemental, rather than principal, educational experience for most enrollees. As MOOC-based credit and degree programs develop, an increasing number of "full-time" MOOC students is foreseeable. Notwithstanding, "parttime" MOOC learners are still the biggest population.</p><p>More attention has been paid to studentlevel factors in order to understand the reasons for MOOC attrition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Khalil &amp; Ebner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rosé et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang &amp; Rosé, 2013)</ref>. Most notably, internal and external factors related to student motivation were found to contribute to student dropout rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Khalil &amp; Ebner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yuan &amp; Powell, 2013)</ref>. The internal factors include curiosity and enjoyment, while the external factors entail job-related development and future economic benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yuan &amp; Powell, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Rosé (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang (2013)</ref> have conducted survival analysis on a MOOC dataset in order to understand the social behaviors that might be related to student dropouts on a weekby-week basis. They found some aspects of peer interaction were closely related to student retention. Generally, students who engaged other students in the discussion and stayed in the discussion for a long period tended not to drop out. In addition, students who participated during the very first week of the course tended to remain. Socio-cultural theorists hold that learning is a social process in which learners construct their own understanding through interaction with others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Vygotsky, 1978)</ref>. Social interactions essential for learning and community building are primarily peer interactions in MOOCs. "Lurkers" or others who do not participate in such MOOC interactions are more likely to quit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Student Motivation, Engagement and Retention in MOOCs</head><p>Several researchers are beginning to examine various activity patterns of MOOC students, with the goal of creating broad student categories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kizilcec, Piech, and Schneider (2013)</ref> leveraged k-means clustering to examine students in three MOOCs from Stanford University. Based on activity data, they found students broadly fit into four categories: completers (students who completed most assignments), auditing (students who did few-to-no assignments but engaged in watching videos), disengaging (students who did assignments early in the course, then later stopped participating), and sampling (students who watched videos only in the beginning of the course). Other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wilkowski, Deutsch, &amp; Russell, 2014)</ref> defined four other categories of students: no-shows (students who register, but never participate), observers (students who want to see what an online course looks like or how it is taught), casual learners (students who are interested in a subset of the overall course), and completers (students who do all necessary work to finish the course). Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hill, 2013)</ref> identified five categories of MOOC students: no-shows, observers, drop-ins, passive participants and active participants. While categorizing students based on student activity patterns is helpful for descriptive purposes, it provides little basis for understanding how a student's motivation might influence different interactions with the course.</p><p>There has been a great deal of research on student motivation in traditional schools and higher education settings, but the study of student motivation in MOOCs remains thin, despite the broadly-understood acknowledgement that student motivation is necessary to initiate learning and to sustain or adapt behaviors needed to achieve learning goals. The diminished social interaction within an online environment (i.e., a lack of face-to-face interaction between instructors and students) raises questions about students' engagement and motivation in MOOC classes, and how sustaining these may differ from face-to-face learning environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Stewart, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies about online education emphasize the importance of social interaction within a community of learners engaged in course activities and with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Young &amp; Bruce, 2011)</ref>. As students engage with each other and with course activities, student motivation generally increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Richards, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Miltiadou and Savenye (2003)</ref> stated that interaction may increase students' persistence in an online course. Motivation is particularly important for retention in MOOCs because participants generally are not required to complete the course, and lack of motivation is a primary reason for students dropping out of a MOOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Khalil &amp; Ebner, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yuan and Powell (2013)</ref> argued that there might be different factors that influence MOOC students' motivation level, including "future economic benefits, development of personal or professional identify, challenge and achievement, enjoyment and fun" (p. 9). These factors largely are in accord with the findings of a survey conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Belanger and Thornton (2013)</ref>, who found that students have different motivation to enroll in a MOOC; these researchers identified four relevant aspects: a) to support lifelong learning or gain the subject matter understanding; b) for fun; c) for the convenience of online learning; and d) to experience online education.</p><p>The different aspects of MOOC student motivation accord broadly with research on motivation outside the MOOC setting. For example, motivation theories commonly acknowledge two broad categories of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amabile, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Intrinsic motivation entails pursuing a task for the satisfaction, engagement or interest the task itself might provide. Extrinsic motivation entails pursuing a task for purposes beyond the task-for example, for pay or to earn a credential. Some earlier motivation theories saw these as wholly separate and even at odds with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amabile, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Deci, 1971)</ref>, such that extrinsic motivation might undermine intrinsic desire to pursue an activity. However, more recent theories allow for complementarities between the two. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref> hold that extrinsic motivation spans a range from externally compelled to motivations that become integrated into the self in the presence of social ties and supports for developing competence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amabile (1993)</ref> stated that human activity often entails both types of motivation. As an example, she might be both intrinsically motivated by the substance of the article she's working on and yet simultaneously extrinsically motivated to work on it right away to meet an editor's deadline.</p><p>In MOOC settings, students may bring intrinsic motivation, including curiosity and a desire for new experiences, alongside extrinsic motivation, including the need to obtain new skills or credentials that might be beneficial for their future study or work. Alongside intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is social motivation. For this paper, social motivation refers to social contexts and social interactions that may impel students to engage in the course. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref> reported that social supports and social contexts can play an important positive or negative influences on motivation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wentzel (1999)</ref> argued that social-motivational processes play an important role in driving individuals to achieve certain social goals. Social motivation in parallel with academic motivation may also influence students' academic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Wentzel, 1999)</ref>. In the context of MOOC research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yuan and Powell (2013)</ref> found that one of the elements of a MOOC that motivated learners to participate was an enjoyable social experience along with gaining subject matter knowledge and skills. Therefore, the social elements of a MOOC learning experience, which are afforded by discussion forums and participants' use of social networking, may play an important role in students' motivation.</p><p>In the MOOC environment, social motivation includes students' feeling of relatedness with peers. This coincides with the notion of "social presence," which has been studied in the online collaborative learning situations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gunawardena &amp; Zittle, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">So &amp; Brush, 2008)</ref>. Relative to face-to-face settings, learners in an online environment tend to have a reduced sense of connectedness and belonging, and this potentially impedes online peer interaction and engagement. Using survival models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wen, Yang, and Rosé (2014)</ref> found that student motivation, measured by percentage of posts per week, and cognitive engagement, measured by level of language abstraction in forum posts, were significant predictors of dropouts. The results suggest that social interactions, which typically take place in discussion forums and posts in MOOCs, influence students' motivation to continue in the course or drop out.</p><p>Drawing on previous literature, we propose that MOOC learners' motivation is comprised of three dimensions: intrinsic, extrinsic and social aspects. This threedimensional motivation model might not be exhaustive; however, we believe it captures the components that most deserve further investigation. Furthermore, in accord with existing literature that finds motivation impacts student engagement and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lau &amp; Roeser, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martin &amp; Dowson, 2009)</ref>, we propose that (a) motivation predicts student course engagement; and (b) student engagement predicts their retention in the course. In addition, the three dimensions of motivation correlate with each other. The conceptual model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures and Variables</head><p>The variables are operationally defined as follows in this study:  Retention: the length of the period in staying in the course. The model we have devised posits that MOOC participants may hold intrinsic, extrinsic, and social motivations. Participants' motivation was measured by five-point Likert items in a pre-course survey questionnaire, with 1 indicating that the statement is "not at all important" in the decision to enroll in the course and 5 indicating "very critical." Based on the available information from the pre-course survey, we identified one item measuring intrinsic motivation, four measuring extrinsic motivation, and two measuring social motivation. Information regarding student online activities, such as lecture video watching, quiz taking, etc., was extracted from the course data to measure student engagement in the MOOC. Retention is measured by the number of days between the start of the MOOC and the last day of activity by the student.</p><p>All the items are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. In summary, items measuring the three types of motivations are from the MOOC pre-course survey, and items measuring engagement and retention are from the course data.  <ref type="bibr">2000)</ref>; they are measured by multiple indicators, whereas intrinsic motivation and retention are each measured by only one indicator. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) for data analysis, which is a powerful approach to examine the relations among latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. Specifically, we used robust meanand variance-adjusted weighted least squares estimation (WLSMV), implemented in Mplus 7, to estimate the model, given its robustness to deal with non-normal and categorical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Model fit was evaluated using several prevailing indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Different indices reflect various aspects of model fit. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref>, the root mean square error of the approximation (RMSEA) value should be equal to or smaller than 0.06; a comparative fit index (CFI) value close to 0.95 or higher indicates a close fit, and values up to 0.90 indicate a reasonable fit. Further, a chi-square statistic indicates whether the proposed model is significantly different from the data. A non-significant chi-square value indicates good model-data fit. However, chi-square is sensitive to sample size and is more likely to be significant with large sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Fan, Thompson, &amp; Wang, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hooper, Coughlan, &amp; Mullen, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the descriptive statistics of the observed indicators. Skewness and kurtosis are used to evaluate the normality of the variable distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Glass &amp; Hopkins, 1996)</ref>. Both skewness and kurtosis values should be close to zero if the distribution is nearly normal. The two indicators, lecture and forum, had distributions that departed greatly from a normal distribution. We thus took a natural log transformation on the two variables. The transformed variables (i.e., ln(lecture) and ln(forum) shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) had much smaller skewness and kurtosis values compared to the original variables. We, therefore, used the two transformed variables in the subsequent analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>The CFI value was .97, which is bigger than the  (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lau &amp; Roeser, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>In general, the findings suggest that promoting student motivation and monitoring student online activities might be a way to increase MOOC retention. However, we may need to take a more sophisticated and differentiated approach to promote MOOC student motivation, given the broad range of student motivation in participating in a MOOC.</p><p>While the majority of students enrolled in a traditional college are dedicated to earn a credential, MOOC students have more diverse intents. One out of four MOOC students who indicated a strong commitment to complete the course are reported to finish it <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Koller, Ng, Do, &amp; Chen, 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, the completion rate among fee-paying students was even higher, which is reported to be 74% for the Coursera Signature Track classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Koller et al., 2013)</ref>. This implies that the completion rate of the highly motivated student group is much higher than the average completion rate. Therefore, it might be fruitless to promote the completion among the student group who do not want to finish the course at the first place. A more practical approach is to identify students with different intents and accommodate them to achieve their respective goals. Given that extrinsic motivation stands out as the strongest predictor of student engagement, it is reasonable for MOOC designers to provide badges, awards, certificates, or other incentives. as a means of promoting student engagement and retention. For example, the Signature Track in Coursera is a good way to promote student extrinsic motivation and foster student engagement and retention in the MOOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monitoring student engagement in</head><p>MOOCs provides another approach that may increase MOOC retention. Our investigation of this MOOC reveals highly skewed student engagement, as reflected in very disparate amounts of participation in student forums.</p><p>Since engagement is associated with retention, efforts to design MOOCs in ways that spur engagement need to be explored. One approach might be to encourage student collaboration.</p><p>Given the limited assistance from instructors or teaching assistants, building a student learning community might be the solution to increasing students' engagement in the learning process.</p><p>Such work may enable MOOCs to realize not only their promise of improved educational access but also improved learning.</p><p>This preliminary study also raises a number of questions for future work. One need is to develop theory-driven instruments which can be used to explore more clearly the factors that may contribute to, or impede, students' participation in MOOCs. For example, in the current investigation, the various constructs of motivation were not equally well represented.</p><p>For instance, due to the limited items in the precourse survey, there is only one item measuring intrinsic motivation. In addition, we only found a small proportion of variance in engagement being explained by motivation. Engagement could be influenced by many other factors that have not been investigated in this study. For instance, student readiness to participate in the online courses, language barriers that a student may face, and other variables related to course design might be explored in the future. Future work is needed to address these issues.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>studies thus far have rarely gone beyond observational and data-driven research. In contrast, our paper offers a theory-driven, structural model of MOOC student motivation, engagement, and retention. Specifically, we posit that (a) motivation predicts MOOC students' course engagement; and (b) students' engagement predicts their retention in the course. We present this study as a means of providing a theoretically and empirically sound model for understanding MOOC students' motivation and how it is related to student behaviors in MOOCs. The ultimate goal is to provide practical guidelines to online educators for improving MOOC retention.</figDesc></figure>
