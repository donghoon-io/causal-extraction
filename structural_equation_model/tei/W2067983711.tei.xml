<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There has been great interest in developing nonlinear structural equation models and associated statistical inference procedures, including estimation and model selection methods. In this paper a general semiparametric structural equation model (SSEM) is developed in which the structural equation is composed of nonparametric functions of exogenous latent variables and fixed covariates on a set of latent endogenous variables. A basis representation is used to approximate these nonparametric functions in the structural equation and the Bayesian Lasso method coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used for simultaneous estimation and model selection. The proposed method is illustrated using a simulation study and data from the Affective Dynamics and Individual Differences (ADID) study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis tool that has been widely used in the behavioral, medical and social sciences where latent variables are frequently encountered (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jöreskog, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kenny and Judd, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Schumacker and Marcoulides, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee, 2007)</ref>. SEMs are designed to investigate the relationships among observed manifest variables and unobservable latent variables through a measurement equation and a structural equation. While the measurement equation relates the latent variables to the manifest (or response) variables, the structural equation expresses the relationships among the endogenous and exogenous latent variables. The latter thus provides the key foundation on which most research hypotheses are based and tested.</p><p>Traditional SEMs assume linear relations among latent variables (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jöreskog, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1996)</ref>. Recently, the nonlinear SEM (NSEM), originating from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kenny and Judd (1984)</ref>, has generated considerable interest among SEM modelers, which allows nonlinear relations among latent variables such as the interactions and quadratic terms (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Schumacker and Marcoulides, 1998</ref>, and the references therein). However, one fundamental issue bypassed by NSEMs lies in the fact that in real data analysis, the parametric form(s) of the nonlinearities are usually unknown. Misspecification of the corresponding parametric functions, in contrast, can lead to very misleading results, as we will show in our simulation study. To handle the unknown parametric forms at the latent level, several semiparametric approaches have been developed recently in the context of SEMs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bauer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fahrmeir and Raach, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Song and Lu, 2010)</ref>. However, the proposed modeling frameworks do not or only take into account limited kinds of interactions, which restricts their utility in practice.</p><p>Besides estimation, model selection is another issue we seek to address in this paper. Most contemporary work on SEMs focuses on model selection for parametric SEMs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Raftery, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lee and Tang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lee and Song, 2008)</ref>, as opposed to semiparametric modeling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fahrmeir and Raach (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Song and Lu (2010)</ref> did not consider the model selection issue in their semiparametric formulations. Classical model selection methods are based on pairwise hypothesis testing of the nested models under comparison, but these methods are usually difficult for comparing non-nested complex SEMs. In addition, popular criteria for non-nested models, like AIC and BIC as adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bauer (2005)</ref>, are computationally expensive and unstable when the search dimension is high -an inherent feature for most semiparametric SEMs. Recently, Bayesian model selection methods have been developed in the SEM context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Raftery, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee and Song, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee, 2007)</ref> due to the advantages of the Bayesian approach (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee, 2007)</ref>, where the most commonly used measure is the Bayes factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kass and Raftery, 1995)</ref>. Despite its popularity, computation of the Bayes factor is very intensive for SEMs because multiple intractable integrals are involved. Moreover, hypothesis testing-based methods such as the Bayes factor operate by performing pairwise comparisons of two competing models. If many models are under comparison, the associated computational costs can be very intensive.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to address these issues. The present article extends earlier work on semiparametric modeling by considering a broader framework that allows for linear and nonlinear relations in the structural equation with covariates. We utilize basis expansions to represent the nonparametric structural relations in our proposed semiparametric SEM (SSEM). With the basis representation, penalization methods such as the Bayesian Lasso <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Park and Casella, 2008</ref>) can be readily used to achieve simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. No additional measure of model selection is needed and the posterior estimates automatically provide guidance for identifying the true underlying model.</p><p>To motivate the proposed method, we consider the Affective Dynamics and Individual Differences (ADID) study <ref type="bibr">(Emotions and Dynamic Systems Laboratory, 2010)</ref>. The purpose of this study was to evaluate individual (e.g., age and personality) differences in the dynamics of emotions in laboratory and everyday life. We investigate possible effects of three latent exogenous variables, namely, perceived stress, emotional clarity and psychological resilience on two latent endogenous variables: positive and negative emotions. Generally, higher perceived stress is known to be associated with lower positive emotion and higher negative emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(von Känel et al., 2005)</ref>. There is, however, evidence that certain protective personality traits, such as psychological resilience (the ability to cope with negative experiences) and emotion clarity (the ability to differentiate discrete emotions with clarity and prevision), may help counteract the adverse effect of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ong and Allaire, 2005)</ref>. Although findings from the affect literature have suggested some general linkages among these exogenous variables on positive and negative emotions, the precise structural relationships among them and the extent to which such relations are nonlinear remain unclear.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our SSEM framework with its associated basis representation. In Section 3, we propose the Bayesian Lasso method to achieve simultaneous estimation and model selection. To illustrate our proposed method, a simulation study and the ADID study are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 discusses some related issues and possible extensions for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Model Formulation</head><p>We observe a p × 1 vector of response (or manifest) variables y i and an s × 1 vector of fixed covariates x i for i = 1, • • •, n, where n is the number of subjects. For each subject, it is common to introduce a q × 1 vector of latent variables, denoted by ω i , for i = 1, …, n. The measurement equation is commonly defined as a factor analysis model given by <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> where c i is an r × 1 vector of known functions of x i , ε i is a p × 1 vector of measurement errors, A and Λ are p × r and p × q unknown parameter matrices. Assume that ω i and ε i are independent, ε i are independent copies of a N (0, Ψ ε ) distribution with Ψ ε =diag(ψ ε1 , …, ψ εp ), and ω i (i = 1, …, n) are independently distributed. Due to the unobservable ω i , the model is not identifiable unless certain constraints are imposed. The most common strategy is to have some elements of Λ and/or A m to be fixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The relations among the latent variables are modeled by the structural equation. Let</p><p>, where η i is a q 1 × 1 vector of endogenous latent variables and ξ i is a q 2 × 1 vector of exogenous latent variables with q 2 = qq 1 . Instead of using a parametric structural equation, we propose a general nonparametric structural equation as follows:</p><p>(2) where ζ i is a q 1 × 1 vector of residuals which follows a N (0, Ψ ζ ) distribution with covariance matrix Ψ ζ =diag(ψ ζ1 , …, ψ ζq 1 ), and F(x i , ξ i ) = {F 1 (x i , ξ i ), …, F q 1 (x i , ξ i )} T is a q 1 × 1 vector of unknown functions of {x i , ξ i }. It is assumed that ξ i and ζ i are independently distributed, and ξ i ~ N (0, Φ). For simplicity, we assume that Π 0 = I -Π is nonsingular and | Π 0 | is independent of the elements of Π. We refer to (1) and (2) as our Semiparametric Structural Equations Model (SSEM). Generally, F(x i , ξ i ) could take any arbitrary form of the covariates and exogenous latent variables, including standard linear or nonlinear functions of x i and/or ξ i as special cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jöreskog, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee, 2007)</ref>. Consider two latent variables for example, as in the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jöreskog (1973)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kenny and Judd (1984)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">, F(x i , ξ i ) = β 1 ξ i1 + β 2 ξ i2 ; in</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">, F(x i , ξ i ) = β 1 ξ i1 + β 2 ξ i2 + β 12 ξ i1 ξ i2 ; for NSEMs in Lee (2007), F(x i , ξ i ) = Πη i + Bx i + ΓH(ξ i1 , ξ i2 )</formula><p>, where H(ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) is a vector-valued function containing non-zero differentiable functions; etc. Particularly, our SSEM also includes some semiparametric latent variable models, such as the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Song and Lu (2010)</ref> when Π = 0 and each component of</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F(x i , ξ i ) equals g h1 (x i1 )+• • • +g hs (x is )+f h1 (ξ i1 )+• • • +f hq 2 (ξ iq 2 )+ ζ hi , h = 1, …, q 1 ,</formula><p>where g hj (x ij ) and f hj (ξ ij ) are all one-dimensional functions. Although their model allows an unspecified structure of each exogenous latent variable ξ ij and covariate x ij on η hi , they did not consider the possible interactions among these covariates and/or the exogenous latent variables, which restricts the utility of this model in many applications. In parametric SEMs, it is very common to compare models with or without terms like ξ i1 ξ i2 .</p><p>Notice that (2) in our SSEM allows interactions among the covariates and/or exogenous variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modeling Nonparametric Functions</head><p>We approximate the nonparametric functions in (2) by using linear basis expansions. As an illustration, we consider a simple structural equation with one endogenous and two exogenous latent variables ξ i = (ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) T and no covariates, given by (3)</p><p>We note that any two-dimensional function F(ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) can be decomposed into f 1 , f 2 , and f 12 as in (3), where f 1 and f 2 could be constant but f 12 must be a function of both ξ i1 and ξ i2 if an interaction between the two exists. For j = 1, 2, we model (4) as a linear basis expansion in ξ ij , where {h jm j (•), m j = 1, …, M j } are basis functions for ξ ij , such as piecewise polynomials and natural cubic splines, among many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hastie et al., 2009)</ref>. For f 12 , we model it by using the tensor product basis as follows:</p><p>(5)</p><p>where {h 1m j (•), m j = 1, …, M 1 } and {h 2m j (•), m j = 1, …, M 2 } are basis functions for ξ i1 and ξ i2 , respectively. Specifically, if h jm (ξ ij ) = ξ ij for j = 1, 2, (3) recovers the common nonlinear structural equation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kenny and Judd, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>It is worth noting that some spline bases may contain constant basis functions, as in the case of natural cubic splines and regression splines. This leads to redundant basis functions when both (4) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) are used, and consequently, potential identifiability problems. Without loss of generality, suppose that h j1 (ξ ij ) = 1. To solve the redundant basis functions problem, we combine all the constant bases together as a single intercept term β 0 , and use for each one-dimensional function and for the two-dimensional function f 12 , where the summation is taken from m j = 2 to exclude the constant basis. The spline model for higher dimensional functions can be modified accordingly. It follows from ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) that the structural equation can be represented by a linear model of basis functions given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">η i = β T H(ξ i )+ ζ i , where H(ξ i ) = {h 1m 1 (ξ i1 ), …, h 1M 1 (ξ i1 ), h 2m 2 (ξ i2 ), …, h 2M 2 (ξ i2 ), h 1m 1 (ξ i1 )h 2m 2 (ξ i2 ), …, h 1M 1 (ξ i1 )h 2M 2 (ξ i2 )} T and β is the coefficient parameter associated with H(ξ i ).</formula><p>The linear basis representation can be easily extended to the general F(x i , ξ i ) with covariates and any number of latent variables following the same techniques above, where the interactions between x i and ξ i are also allowed and can be modeled in a similar vein. The basis representation (5) can be generalized to higher dimensional functions if interactions among more than two variables are of interest. In practice, we usually only interested in the interactions between every two are variables. Let H(x i , ξ i ) be an N H × 1 vector of basis functions formed similarly by (4) and/or (5) for each component of {x i , ξ i }. By using the linear basis expansion, the general structural equation model in (2) can be represented as: <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> where BH(x i , ξ i ) is the basis expansion of F(x i , ξ i ) and B q 1 ×N H is the unknown parameter matrix. Based on (6), we adopt the idea of the Bayesian Lasso proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Park and Casella (2008)</ref> and use it in conjunction with MCMC methods to estimate the parameters in our SSEM. As detailed below, this approach provides a much more computationally efficient and flexible methodology for simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Bayesian Lasso (BLasso)</head><p>Consider the linear model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = μ1 n + Xβ + ε, ε ~ N (0, σ 2 I),</formula><p>where y is the response vector and X is a standardized design matrix. The main interest is usually to estimate β to identify important covariates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tibshirani (1996)</ref> proposed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) by introducing an L 1 penalty to the residual sum of squares for estimating</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">β, i.e.,</formula><p>. By the nature of the L 1norm, Lasso shrinks some of the β j 's corresponding to the unimportant covariates exactly to 0, which automate the simultaneous model selection and estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Park and Casella (2008)</ref> proposed a Bayesian framework of the Lasso (BLasso) by imposing a conditional Laplace prior:</p><p>, where the form ae -a|z| /2 can be represented as a scale mixture of normals with an exponential mixing density:</p><p>, a &gt; 0. This motivates a hierarchical representation:</p><p>(7)</p><p>which greatly simplifies the computation, since all of the full conditional distributions have known closed forms and can be sampled by the Gibbs sampler <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Geman and Geman, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>One advantage of BLasso is that it provides a posterior sample which can be used to summarize the entire distribution of β, whereas Lasso only gives a point estimate of β. In particular, the posterior mode of β is equivalent to the Lasso estimator. Although BLasso does not shrink the posterior mean or median exactly to zero, it does shrink them close to 0 much faster than ridge regression and yields better prediction accuracy. Another advantage is that, with the hierarchical representation, BLasso is likely to be adopted in a more complex modeling framework and it provides an efficient procedure for simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. More discussions about (B)Lasso can be found in Appendix A of the supplementary document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Prior Specification</head><p>We discuss the BLasso prior specifications for the structural equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) first. For simplicity, let Λ ω = (Π, B) denote the unknown matrices in the basis representation (6). We specify BLasso priors for each row of Λ ω , i.e., Λ ωh for h = 1, …, q 1 . That is,</p><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">D Λ ωh = diag(τ Λ ωh ) with τ Λ ωh = (τ Π h , τ B h ) T ,</formula><p>and , λ Π h and λ B h are regularization parameters from the Laplace priors for Π h and B h , respectively, and α 0ζh and β 0ζh are pre-specified hyperparameters. By using (8), Λ ω can be estimated efficiently and at the same time the estimation provides guidance for identifying the true structural relations. The regularization parameters are also assigned gamma priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Park and Casella, 2008)</ref>. For Φ, we use the inverse-Wishart prior, i.e., Φ ĨW(R 0 , ρ 0 ) with pre-specified hyperparameters R 0 and ρ 0 . For the case of constant basis functions, a flat prior can be assigned for the nuisance parameter β 0 .</p><p>For the measurement equation, let Λ y = (A, Λ). In practice some elements of Λ and/or A are fixed for model identifiability purposes. To carry out the prior specification, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee and Zhu (2000)</ref>. We create an index matrix M = (m kj ) p×(r+q) with elements m kj = 1 if the kjth element of Λ y , λ ykj , is unknown and 0 otherwise. Let for k = 1, …, p. If r yk &gt; 0, let be the r yk × 1 vector of unknown parameters in the k-th row of Λ y and assign a conjugate prior for { }, i.e., , where , α 0εk , and β 0εk are pre-specified hyperparameters. See Appendix B in the supplementary document for guidance in selecting the hyperparameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Related Issues</head><p>Unobservable latent variables cause several difficulties when applying the BLasso to our SSEM. One difficulty is related to the use of the spline basis, where the scales of the knots are unknown beforehand because of the unknown range of the latent variables. There are two ways to solve this problem. A simple way is to determine the range based on empirical results, or generate a separate MCMC chain using a simple structural equation or use a software procedure like SAS PROC TCALIS to run a simple SEM in order to get rough estimates of the latent variables. Another way to solve this problem is to introduce a free scale parameter s j for each ξ ij <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Song and Lu, 2010)</ref>. Specifically, we choose K j percentiles from a N (0, 1), say (κ 1 , …, κ K j ), for the spline basis, and then use (s j κ 1 , …, s j κ K j ) as the knots. To determine s j , a prior can be assigned and an additional MCMC step will be added to update s j . Another difficulty caused by latent variables concerns the use of the BLasso.</p><p>The magnitude of the BLasso estimates can automatically guide the model selection since the covariates are standardized to the same scale. However, the mean and standard deviation of the basis functions involving ξ in H(x, ξ) cannot be pre-determined because ξ is unobservable. We solve this problem by generating a separate MCMC chain using either a simple structural equation or a non-standardized H(x, ξ) to obtain samples of ξ so as to calculate the scale of the basis functions for standardization purposes.</p><p>Note that formulations such as the decomposed functions f 1 , f 2 , and f 12 in (3) are identified only up to a constant. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Song and Lu (2010)</ref>, they imposed constraints on f j = {f j (ξ 1j ), …, f j (ξ nj )} T and g k = {g k (x 1k ), …, g k (x nk )} T for all j, k in their model by setting 1 T f j = 0 and 1 T g k = 0 to ensure unique identification of each f j and g k . However, this is unnecessary in our model representation (6). By standardizing {η, H(x, ξ)} for the use of the BLasso, the constraints are automatically satisfied. For the case with constant basis functions, all constant terms are combined into an intercept β 0 , and identifying the component functions up to a constant is enough in practice.</p><p>Ordered categorical data are frequently encountered in subject-matter areas such as public health and social science research. If ordered categorical manifest variables are present, we may follow the approach adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee and Zhu (2002)</ref> to deal with such data and all the prior specifications above remain the same. See the supplemental document for more details.</p></div>

In practice, the true relations between the latent variables are unknown and the number of latent variables and the full model to be used mainly depend on the research questions of interest. Suppose that we are also interested in x 3 ~ binomial(1, 0.4) and the interaction between ξ 1 and ξ 2 . Then the full model we use to explore the unknown structural relations at the latent level is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">η i = b 1 x i1 + b 2 x i2 + b 3 x i3 + f 1 (ξ i1 ) + f 2 (ξ i2 ) + f 12 (ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) + ζ i .</formula><p>We expect that the BLasso would help identify the true model by shrinking b 3 and the spline coefficients for f 12 (ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) towards zero.</p><p>Natural cubic splines were used to approximate the unknown functions. Cubic splines are linear beyond the boundaries so that we do not need to be concerned if an MCMC sample of ξ ij exceeds the boundaries. For each ξ j , K = 5 knots were used (κ k , k = 1, …, K). A simple version of natural cubic splines derived from a truncated power series basis was used for illustration in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hastie et al., 2009)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">h j1 (ξ ij ) = 1, h j2 (ξ ij ) = ξ ij , and h j,k+2 (ξ ij ) =d k (ξ ij ) -d K-1 (ξ ij ) for k = 1, …, K -2, where</formula><p>.</p><p>The hyperparameters used here are α 0εk = α 0ζk = 10, β 0εk = β 0ζk = 4, ρ 0 = 8, R 0 = 5Φ 0 where Φ 0 is the true value of Φ, μ 0yk is the true value, and H 0yk = 0.25I. The hyperparameters for the regularization parameters were taken to be r 0B = 1.0, δ 0B = 0.1.</p><p>Based on our sensitivity analysis (see Appendix D of the supplementary document), the posterior distributions are not very sensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters.</p><p>We generated MCMC chains of size 10,000 with the first half used as burn-in samples, which appears to be good enough for convergence based on the Estimated Potential Scale Reduction (EPSR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gelman, 1996)</ref> values. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Gelman (1996)</ref>, the MCMC procedure is said to have converged if all the EPSR values of the unknown parameters are less than 1.2. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> plots all the EPSR values, where the convergence is achieved very fast after the first few hundred iterations. The convergence can be further observed from three additional diagnostics (see Appendix C in the supplementary document). The simulation study was repeated 100 times (100 simulated datasets) and the average posterior estimates based on the 100 replicates are presented. Before we start, a separate chain of size 5,000 was generated to obtain estimates of ξ so as to calculate the scale of H(x, ξ) for standardization purposes.</p><p>For performance comparison purposes, we also analyzed the same simulated data by applying the BLasso (without using splines) to two alternative parametric NSEM models, NSEM-I and NSEM-II. For NSEM-I, we specify:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">η i = b 1 x i1 + b 2 x i2 + b 3 x i3 + γ 1 ξ i1 + γ 2 ξ i2 + γ 3 ξ i1 ξ i2 + ζ i ,</formula><p>where the posterior estimates of b 3 and γ 3 are expected to be zero since x 3 and the interaction term are not in the true model. The structural equation considered in NSEM-II is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">η i = b 1 x i1 +b 2 x i2 +b 3 x i3 +γ 1 f 1 (ξ i1 )+ γ 2 f (ξ i2 )+ γ 3 f 12 (ξ i1 , ξ i2 )+ ζ i ,</formula><p>where f 1 and f 2 are the true nonlinear functions used to simulate the data and f 12 (ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) = exp(ξ i1 )/{1 + exp(ξ i2 )} is an interaction term that is not present in the true model but is of interest to test.</p><p>Thus, the true values of the γ j 's are γ 1 = γ 2 = 1 and γ 3 = 0. The interaction term is included here to illustrate the ability of our method to detect spurious interaction effects. The main average results of NSEM-I, NSEM-II, and the non-spline part of SSEM based on 100 simulation replicates are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, where only important and representative results are reported to save space. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> gives the posterior estimates for the spline coefficients in the SSEM. Briefly, the results demonstrate that the BLasso for our SSEM performs very well in both estimation and model selection. The results of NSEM-II show that with the correct parametric form, the BLasso can accurately estimate the unknown parameters and identify the true model. In contrast, when the associated parametric functions are misspecified as in NSEM-I, very poor estimates and misleading model selection conclusions were obtained.</p><p>We begin with the results of NSEM-II. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that the unknown parameters are accurately estimated with small biases and standard deviations. Moreover, the BLasso identifies the true model by shrinking b 3 and γ 3 towards zero. Thus, if the correct parametric structural relation can be recognized, then the BLasso provides an efficient way for accurate estimation and model selection. However, in practice, the actual parametric forms are usually unknown and misspecification can yield very misleading results as shown from the results for NSEM-I. Although the parametric form of NSEM-I is very commonly used in the NSEM literature, it led to poor results here in that none of the b i s were estimated correctly and the large magnitude of γ 3 misleadingly implies a strong interaction effect. The estimates associated with the measurement equation are relatively accurate, but with larger biases and standard deviations than SSEM and NSEM-II.</p><p>For our SSEM, non-spline parameter estimation results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> are as good as those obtained from NSEM-II wherein the true parametric functions are known, which demonstrates its superior performance. Estimates of all the spline parameters, including the intercept β 0 , parameters for f 1 , f 2 and interaction f 12 , are given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, which are based on the standardized basis so their relative magnitudes reflect the significance of the corresponding terms in the model. As seen, the spline coefficients for the interaction term are all relatively small and close to zero, which suggests that no strong interaction effect exists and that the main effects need to be further evaluated. For the basis functions of f 1 and f 2 , there are large spline coefficients (marked by a *), and thus strong main effects of ξ 1 and ξ 2 are implied. These can be validated by inspecting Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, which plots the true twodimensional surface f(ξ 1 , ξ 2 ) and the one estimated by our SSEM. It can be seen that the estimated surface identifies the true shape. The shape of the curves of ξ 1 given different values of ξ 2 does not change with ξ 2 and vice verse, which implies that no interaction exists between the two. The function plots in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> further illustrate the spline estimation accuracy, where the true parametric structural relations were correctly identified by our SSEM. Since the relations are identified up to a constant as discussed in Section 3.3, there are slight shifts in the plot.</p><p>The performance of the proposed approach in recovering the true structural relations among the latent variables is further measured by the root mean square error of the function:</p><p>, where f (ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) = f 1 (ξ i1 ) + f 2 (ξ i2 ) is the true function used to simulate the data. In NSEM-I, f ̂(ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) = γ ̂1ξ i1 + γ ̂2ξ i2 + γ ̂3ξ i1 ξ i2 , while f ̂(ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) = γ ̂1f 1 (ξ i1 )+ γ ̂2f 2 (ξ i2 )+ γ ̂3f 12 (ξ i1 , ξ i2 ) for NSEM-II. The corresponding RMSEs are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. With the known parametric specification, NSEM-II leads to the smallest RMSE, whereas the misspecification of NSEM-I yields a large RMSE. In SSEM, f(ξ 1 , ξ 2 ) is estimated using spline methods and the resultant RMSE is reasonably small, indicating a satisfactory performance even though the parametric form is unknown.</p><p>No true interaction is included above to illustrate the model selection ability of our method. We also simulated data with an interaction term using the structural equation of NSEM-II. Due to space constraints, the results of this part of the simulation are included in the supplementary document. In this case, our method still leads to accurate estimation. In particular, the estimates of the spline parameters imply a strong interaction effect, namely, the corresponding estimates are large in magnitude. The computation time of the proposed method is comparable to other commonly used Bayesian methods discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee (2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Affective Dynamics and Individual Differences (ADID) Study</head><p>To illustrate the empirical utility of the proposed method, we use a subset (271 participants with baseline trait measures) of the data from the ADID Study for our analysis. The participants enrolled in a laboratory study during which a series of behavioral, psychophysiological and trait measures were collected, followed by an experience sampling study. After removing data from participants who did not complete a sufficient portion of the study, a total of 247 participants were retained in the final analysis. The two endogenous variables of interest here are the participants' general levels of positive emotion (PE) and negative emotion (NE). The three latent exogenous variables used here include the individuals' scores on the emotion clarity (EC), perceived stress (PSS) and the participants' psychological resilience (PR). Therefore, η i = (PE i , NE i ) T and ξ i = (PSS i , EC i , PR i ) T with q 1 = 2 and q 2 = 3. More information about this data set is given in Appendix F in the supplementary document. Our main objective is to study the relationships among the latent variables, specifically, whether the effects of PSS on PE and NE are moderated by positive traits such as PR and EC. In addition, three demographic variables, namely, Age (continuous), Income (categorical), and Education (categorical), are used as covariates in the structural equation.</p><p>Due to the relatively large number of ordinal manifest items involved and the lack of variability in some participants' item responses, we created three composite indicators (socalled "parcels") for each latent variable (see Appendix F in the supplementary document). Thus, we have in total p = 15 manifest variables, three parcels for each of the five latent variables. As each latent variable is related to its corresponding observable three parcels, we consider the commonly used non-overlapping structure for Λ in the measurement equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(9)</formula><p>We take A =diag(0 * , …, 0 * , μ 7 , …, μ 15 ) and c i = (1, …, 1) T . To study the research questions of interest, we consider the following structural equation model: where h = 1, 2 and the effects of x i are constrained to be linear since this part of the model is not our main interest and preliminary graphical explorations of the data indicated no obvious nonlinear patterns between η and x.</p><p>To analyze the data using the proposed method, we used natural cubic splines for f hj (ξ ij ) with K j = 5 knots and the same choices of the hyperparameters as in the simulation study, except that μ 0yk = 0 and Φ 0 = I. MCMC chains of size 5,000, with different starting values, were generated, which is sufficient for convergence as shown from the EPSR plot and other diagnostics (see Appendix C.2 for details).</p><p>The main results of the representative parameters are given in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The structural equation related coefficient estimates are for the standardized bases, and thus the relative magnitude of each of the coefficient estimates reflects the importance of the corresponding term. As seen from the table, all the estimates of the b ij 's are small and close to zero, which implies weak effects of the covariates in predicting PE or NE. The lack of age differences in PE and NE, in contrast to some findings in the aging literature, may relate to the fact that the manifest items used to identify PE and NE here included both low-and high-intensity items, which differed from other studies that utilized primarily high-intensity affect items.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, β h,ij indicates the coefficient corresponding to the j-th basis of f hi (ξ i ) for the h-th endogenous variable and represents the coefficient corresponding to the product of the i-th basis of f hk (ξ k ) and the j-th basis of f hl (ξ l ) for f h,kl (ξ k , ξ l ). Specifically, the β (12)  weights are for PSS*EC while the β (13) weights are associated with PSS*PR. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> only reports the spline coefficients for PE to save space. The results suggest a strong interaction effect of PSS*PR on PE (some spline coefficients for PSS*PR, e.g., , and</p><p>, are large in magnitude). The main effects of PSS and PR are thus significant, as confirmed by the spline estimates for PSS and PR. In contrast, all of the spline coefficients for PSS*EC are small and close to zero, which implies a weak interaction effect PSS*EC on PE. We thus proceed to examining the main effect of EC instead. The small corresponding coefficients for EC (β 1,22 , …, β 1,25 ) indicate a weak main effect of EC on PE. Therefore, the underlying structure identified by the BLasso for PE has the form: η i = F 1 (PSS, PR) + ζ 1i with F 1 (PSS, PR) = f 11 (ξ i1 )+f 13 (ξ i3 )+f 1,13 (ξ i1 , ξ i3 ). The surface of F 1 (PSS, PR) is plotted in the left panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, where high PSS lowers PE among individuals with low PR. However, for those with moderate to high PR, PSS has little or even a positive effect on PE. For NE, all the spline coefficients are relatively small and close to zero for both PSS*EC and PSS*PR, which implies weak interaction effects on NE. The estimates for the onedimensional functions of ξ do not suggest the existence of other main effects, except for PSS. As shown in the right panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, high PSS is associated with high NE. SAS PROC TCALIS, as a commonly used and widely accepted procedure, was also used to analyze the data to evaluate the potential input of our analysis. The modeling framework of PROC TCALIS only handles linear structural equations without covariates and interactions, i.e., η hi = γ h1 ξ i1 + γ h2 ξ i2 + γ h3 ξ i3 + ζ hi . Results from PROC TCALIS, also given in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, provide a basis for comparing the results from our SSEM, which can accommodate both linear and nonlinear relations of latent exogenous variables and covariates. The SAS results concurred largely with the results from the linear portion of our SSEM. Significance of γ = (γ 11 , γ 12 , γ 13 , γ 21 , γ 22 , γ 23 ) can be tested based on the SAS output of their corresponding t-values <ref type="bibr">(-4.0349, -2.1137, 5.5670, 6.3625, 1.5956, -1.2263)</ref>, which indicates that PSS is significant in predicting both PE and NE in terms of a large absolute value of the t-values, PR is weakly related to PE and NE, and PR is significantly related to PE but not NE. Similar relationships were also found by SSEM, but our SSEM can be used to extract additional nonlinear structural relations that cannot be evaluated using PROC TCALIS. In summary, using our newly proposed SSEM, we were able to further clarify the role of perceived stress on PE and NE and how such relationships are moderated in part by PR in the case of PE but not NE. That is, whereas individuals with higher PSS inevitably experience higher NE, PR serves as a protective factor in helping individuals maintain a high level of PE despite the heightened perceived stress. This helps provide a basis for formulating other theories concerning the interrelationships among emotions and personality traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we present a general semiparametric structural equation model and propose basis expansions as a nonparametric representation of the relations at the structural level. The main advantage of our model is that it allows for any linear or nonlinear relationships between the endogenous variables and other exogenous variables/covariates. Moreover, by using the proposed basis representation, the BLasso method can be applied to our SSEM to automate model selection during estimation. The performance of our proposed method was evaluated in both simulation studies and a real data analysis. As we have seen, our BLasso in SSEM provides an accurate and efficient way for simultaneous estimation and model selection. Commonly encountered methodological difficulties were also considered and the corresponding solutions were discussed in Section 3.3.</p><p>Other pertinent issues are discussed here, with suggestions for future research. Firstly, the proposed method was illustrated by using a simple version of natural cubic splines in our examples. More sophisticated spline models may be used to improve the performance of the proposed procedures. Secondly, we only used a small number of knots in our examples. Although more knots may provide more accurate function estimation results, the number of basis functions and the associated unknown parameters also correspondingly increase, which may lead to numerical difficulties if the sample size is relatively small. Thirdly, we use the BLasso as an efficient way for simultaneous estimation and model selection. There are many variants of the (B)Lasso, we refer the reader to Appendix A of the supplementary document for more details. One possible alternative here is to use the Bayesian Group Lasso <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kyung et al., 2010)</ref> to penalize the spline parameters for each unknown function as a group.

The parameters of interest here are , where θ 1 = {Λ y , Ψ ε } denotes the unknown parameters in the measurement equation and θ 2 = {Λ ω , Ψ ξ , Φ} contains the unknown parameters in the structural equation. For the case with constant basis functions, there is also a nuisance parameter β 0 . Let Y = {y 1 , …, y n }, X = {x 1 , …, x n }, C = {c 1 , …, c n }, and Ω = {ω 1 , …, ω n }. Since Ω is an unobserved quantity, the joint posterior distribution of interest is p(Ω, θ|Y, X, C), which can be sampled using the Gibbs sampler along with the Metropolis Hastings (MH) algorithm. Under the prior specifications of Section 3.2, it is straightforward to derive the full conditional distributions. The main steps of the MCMC algorithm are summarized below.
