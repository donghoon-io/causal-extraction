Interactional justice refers to how customers experience justice in their interaction with the employees of the firm during the service re covery process <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sparks &amp; McColl Kennedy, 1998)</ref>. Several authors ana lyze the relationship between justice and emotions.</p><p>Río <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lanza et al., (2009)</ref> report that distributive and interactional forms of justice do not exert significant influences on negative emo tions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">DeWitt et al., (2008)</ref> study the influence of perceived justice (without differentiating between components of justice) on positive and negative emotions, observing a greater influence on positive emo tions than on negative emotions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chebat and Slusarczyk (2005)</ref> analyze the effect of justice dimensions on emotions. The authors report that all three dimensions of perceived justice affect negative emotions signifi cantly, and that interactional justice and distributive justice affect posi tive emotions. Distributive justice has a greater effect on positive emotions than on negative emotions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schoefer and Ennew (2005)</ref> find that all three dimensions of justice have significant effects.</p><p>McColl <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kennedy and Sparks (2003)</ref> emphasize the importance of interactional justice in emotions. These authors also state that poor treatment by the employee can cause negative emotions on the custom er, weakening the effects of adequate justice efforts. Procedural justice is a basic requirement because customers expect service providers to have the procedures and speed to correct service failures. In this regard, low levels of procedural justice elicit negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schoefer &amp; Ennew, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>A considerable number of studies deal with justice and satisfaction with service recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Karatepe, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Maxham &amp; Netemeyer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schoefer &amp; Ennew, 2005)</ref>, and some show that procedural justice has a positive effect on customer satisfaction in service recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Homburg &amp; Fürst, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Karatepe, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ok et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schoefer &amp; Ennew, 2005)</ref>. Satisfaction with service recovery is the feeling of affec tion toward a company resulting from the handling of an interaction complaint <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Davidow, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Other empirical studies show that interactional justice contributes to satisfaction after a complaint <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McCollough et al., 2000)</ref>. Río <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lanza et al., (2009)</ref> find a positive relationship between interactional justice and satisfaction with service recovery. Interactional justice is important be cause of its intrinsic value (treating someone with respect and polite ness) and its role as a signal to the customer about how the company behaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chiu et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Beliefs about a firm's benevolence, competence, and integrity consti tute the concept of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Doney &amp; Cannon, 1997)</ref>. The majority of un happy customers do not complain, but those who do expect a just response from the organization. Not receiving such a response, or re ceiving an inadequate response, causes the customer to lose trust in the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeWitt et al., 2008)</ref>. Trust develops over time if the customer feels that the service provider behaves honestly and fairly <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Morgan &amp; Hunt, 1994)</ref>. Trust is essential to satisfying e commerce cus tomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ratnasingham, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Findings regarding the influence of different types of justice on be haviors such as loyalty, however, are inconclusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wang et al., 2011)</ref>. Effective measures of service recovery can strengthen the customer's trust in the quality of products or services, and develop customer loyal ty. Other research suggests that service recovery efforts to remedy ser vice failures are crucial to maintaining relations with existing customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ha &amp; Jang, 2009)</ref>. Loyalty refers to continuity in the purchas ing relationship between a customer and a company <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Keller, 1993)</ref>. Loy alty implies that the customer abstains from changing firm, even if he or she must pay more for the service <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shankar et al., 2003)</ref>. Numerous au thors study the effect of justice in customer retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chebat &amp; Slusarczyk, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McCollough et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wang et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>According to these premises, the study tests the following hypotheses:</p><p>H1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Emotions as antecedents of trust, loyalty, and satisfaction with service recovery</head><p>Although research into the influence of emotions on service recov ery are scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Río Lanza et al., 2009)</ref>, some authors report the influence of emotional factors following a complaint <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Menon &amp; Dubé, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schoefer &amp; Ennew, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Smith &amp; Bolton, 2002)</ref>. The following describes very briefly the relationships studied in the literature between emotions and trust, loyalty, and satisfaction with service recovery.</p><p>In this context, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schoefer and Ennew (2005)</ref> suggest that perceived justice has a relationship (through emotions) with customer satisfaction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Westbrook (1987)</ref> highlights how positive and negative emotions significantly influence customer satisfaction, explaining al most as much variance as other cognitive variables.</p><p>Researchers explore the influence of some emotions on trust in ser vice recovery contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kim et al., 2004)</ref>. Highly negative emotions (e.g., anger) can play a significant moderating role in these processes, and can damage trust. Action to mitigate these types of emotions is like ly to contribute to regaining trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kim et al., 2004)</ref>. In addition, emo tions play an important role in building trust and positive emotions, enabling individuals to make the leap of faith from feelings to beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andersen &amp; Kumar, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wicks et al., (1999)</ref> indicate that positive emotions are an indispensable condition for building trust. Findings show that emotions can cause more stable and deeper levels of trust than feelings that stem purely from rational sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Williams, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Customers' emotions stemming from perceived justice affect loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeWitt et al., 2008)</ref>. Successful service recovery causes an individual to remain loyal to the provider. Conversely, if negative emotions arise, then the customer may become disloyal or may unsubscribe from the service <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeWitt et al., 2008)</ref>. Affect control theory (ACT) addresses the influence of emotions on loyalty. When customers experience inade quate service recovery, those customers express their emotions and act to regain their own identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chebat &amp; Slusarczyk, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>According to these premises, this study tests the following hypothe ses: negative emotions have a negative influence on satisfaction with service recovery (H6), trust (H7), and loyalty (H8). Positive emotions have a positive influence on satisfaction with service recovery (H9), trust (H10), and loyalty (H11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Satisfaction with service recovery as an antecedent of trust and loyalty</head><p>Finally, studies in scientific literature report connections among sat isfaction with service recovery, trust, and loyalty. In service recovery, customer trust reflects how willing customers are to embrace their vul nerability and expect a positive solution after experiencing service fail ure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dunn &amp; Schweitzer, 2005)</ref>. When customers receive unsatisfactory responses to complaints, those customers lose trust in their service pro vider <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeWitt et al., 2008)</ref>; likewise, satisfactory resolution of com plaints may increase customers' trust in the provider. Trust develops over time if the customer perceives the provider is reliable, and behaves fairly and honestly <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Morgan &amp; Hunt, 1994)</ref>. Trust is essential for creating satisfied, loyal customers in e commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ratnasingham, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The literature reports links between customers' loyalty and their levels of satisfaction. Nevertheless, the literature reveals a lack of con sensus on satisfaction's effect on loyalty. Although a relationship exists between satisfaction and loyalty, satisfaction explains around 8% of the variance in loyalty, with this figure improving with the inclusion of a greater number of moderating and mediating variables. Whereas some studies report a linear relationship between satisfaction and loyal ty, others indicate that the relation is non linear and asymmetric, with satisfaction often a necessary but not sufficient condition for loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kumar et al., 2013)</ref>. Levels of agreement between customers and em ployees also relate to satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chang &amp; Chang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kelley &amp; Davis, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andreassen (2001)</ref> indicates that customers' satisfaction with service recovery has a positive relationship with loyalty. Therefore, satisfaction with service recovery positively influences trust (H12) and loyalty (H13).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Trust as an antecedent of loyalty</head><p>Trust largely determines the establishment and maintenance of rela tionships between customers and providers and plays a fundamental role in developing loyalty in online environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kim et al., 2004)</ref>. To gain customers' loyalty, vendors must first gain customers' trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reichheld et al., 2000)</ref>. Additionally, the spatial and temporal separa tion between purchasers and sellers in B2C e commerce means that trust is a key factor in maintaining loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chiu et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Trust is also key to building relationships between buyer and seller <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sirdeshmukh et al., 2002)</ref>. In any relationship of this kind, customers' trust evaluations directly influence their post purchase satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Singh &amp; Sirdeshmukh, 2000)</ref>. In electronic commerce, where trust may act as a trigger to initiate a transaction, this relationship may also hold. Customers perceive a higher level of risk with online retailers than traditional retailers do in terms of delivery, payment, information disclosure, and so forth. B2C e commerce customers may therefore pre fer to buy from online retailers they can trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Singh &amp; Sirdeshmukh, 2000)</ref>. Therefore, trust positively influences loyalty (H14).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the study's model and the research hypotheses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sample and procedure</head><p>Research on service recovery often takes the form of laboratory studies, but this empirical research, following other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chebat &amp; Slusarczyk, 2005)</ref>, is a field study of users who experienced service problems. An online questionnaire validates the research model. Respondents come from a sample of an official database of B2C e commerce. The owner of this database is the public corporate entity Red.es, responsible for promoting and studying the development of the information society in Spain. The sample designs for the database are a random proportional stratification following population size, location of the household social class, and number of persons per household; the sample has a pattern similar to that of other reports of B2C e commerce in Spain. Customers in this database received an email asking whether they purchased a product or service through the Internet during the previous year. If they answered yes, a second ques tion asked whether they experienced any kind of problem and whether they had complained. Those who answered yes to all questions then re ceived an invitation to participate in the survey.</p><p>First, participants had to recall the last time they had experienced a service failure with an Internet purchase about which they had complained. Participants named the e vendor and the specific failure.</p><p>From the initial sample of 5000 Internet users, 59% declared that they had made an online purchase in the last year. Of this 59%, 10.3% experienced failures with their purchases and lodged some kind of complaint with the company or an ombudsman. The response rate of e shoppers who lodged complaints about purchase problems is 6.07%, a normal figure for service recovery studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gustafsson, 2009)</ref>. The final sample consists of 303 respondents who issued at least one complaint after a B2C transaction in the previous year, and experienced service recovery actions from vendors following their complaint. Inter viewees also gave the main reason for their complaint. The main rea sons are delays in delivery (41.6%), defective products (38.9%), and receipt of the wrong product (29.4%). The field study took place between May and July 2012. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the socio demographic characteristics of the sample.</p><p>The scales come from previous studies: justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chebat &amp; Slusarczyk, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tax et al., 1998)</ref>, satisfaction with service recov ery <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kim et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Maxham &amp; Netemeyer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tax et al., 1998)</ref>, negative and positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chebat, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">DeWitt et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Río Lanza et al., 2009)</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chiu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">DeWitt et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tax et al., 1998)</ref> and loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chebat &amp; Slusarczyk, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">DeWitt et al., 2008)</ref>. All items use seven point Likert scales.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiu et al., (2010)</ref>, justice is a formative indicator, com prising distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice. To evaluate formative indicators, the examination of the weights using SPSS software provides information about how the indicator contrib utes to the construct. The results show that procedural justice and inter actional justice have weights of 0.93 and distributive justice has a weight of 0.43. Multicollinearity should be absent from formative indicators. If present, multicollinearity could lead to unstable results. Variance inflation factors (VIF) are 4.7 (procedural justice), 3.7 (distrib utive justice), and 3.6 (interactional justice), all below the limit of 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. The next section describes data analysis using SEM and fsQCA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Structural equation modeling (SEM)</head><p>Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a SEM technique that allows analyzing non normal data with small samples. The study uses PLS Graph version 3.00 to analyze the data through (1) measurement model testing and</p><p>(2) structural model testing: explained variance of the endogenous var iables (R 2 ), path coefficients or standardized linear regression weights (β) and their respective levels of significance.</p><p>Prior to analyzing the measurement model, a test is necessary to ver ify single item reliability of reflective indicators measuring the factor loadings of the variable indicators. Reflective indicators should present factor loadings greater than 0.707 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>, although loadings of 0.5 0.6 may be acceptable in preliminary phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Esposito et al., 2010)</ref>. In the present study, all the factor loadings exceed 0.90, except one of the loyalty indicators, whose value (0.79) nonetheless exceeds the lower limit by a wide margin <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. From these results, all indicators are valid at this stage.</p><p>Next, this method requires a composite reliability analysis, a Cronbach's alpha measurement, and an analysis of the average variance extracted (AVE) from the constructs. These values should be greater than 0.7, 0.7, and 0.5, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. In this case, the values for Cronbach's alpha are greater than 0.87, values of composite reliability are greater than 0.92, and the aver age variance extracted is greater than 0.8 (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>Average variance extracted (AVE) analysis tests discriminant validi ty. This analysis consists of verifying that the average shared variance between a construct and its measurement scales is greater than the shared variance between the construct and the other constructs in the model (i.e., squared correlation between two constructs). Here, the square root of the AVE is higher than the correlations between con structs, and is greater than 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Furthermore, correlations between different constructs confirm that every construct differs from all others <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kline, 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA)</head><p>QCA is a family of methods that provides an alternative to regression based analysis. Using fsQCA, researchers can explore com plex causal patterns among different causal or independent variables by studying a small number of cases. By considering causal configura tions, fsQCA does not analyze how two or more independent variables affect an outcome, but rather explores all possible interactions among variables. These interactions are of great interest in studies of complaint behavior. Different combinations of causal factors can thereby lead to the same outcome. Depending on the context and potential combina tion with other factors, an outcome can derive from the presence or ab sence of a certain causal factor.</p><p>As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ragin (1987)</ref>, by analyzing causality according to context and background, fsQCA yields different underlying causal configurations arising from comparison between diverse case studies. For the Likert scales in this study, 7 represents full membership in a category, 1 repre sents non membership in a category, and 4 represents maximum inde termination regarding membership in a category <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Leischnig et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In fsQCA, the choice of solution depends on two parameters: consis tency and coverage. Taking a value between 0 and 1, consistency indi cates the proportion of a causal condition that the outcome covers. In some sense, consistency is similar to the coefficient of correlation, and constitutes a test of the solution's sufficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Woodside, 2013)</ref>. Cover age is thus similar to the coefficient of determination (R 2 ).</p><p>A solution or path is informative when its consistency is above 0.75 0.80, and its coverage is between 0.25 and 0.65, although small variations are also acceptable. The final step is to calculate the raw cov erage (indicating which share of the outcome a certain alternative path explains) and unique coverage (indicating which share of the outcome a certain alternative path exclusively explains). Three types of solution exist in fsQCA: complex, parsimonious, and intermediate. The complex solution contains the most detail. This solution assumes that configura tions that do not present real cases in the sample would not lead to the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Structural model results</head><p>The evaluation of the structural model consisted of a bootstrapping procedure using three indicators: path coefficients (β), t statistics, and explained variance (R 2 ). All the paths except negative emotions trust and satisfaction with service recovery loyalty were significant, and therefore the evaluation only rules out H7 and H13 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The rest of the hypotheses remain: Justice has negative/positive influence in negative/positive emotions; positive emotions have positive influ ence on satisfaction with service recovery, trust, and loyalty; negative emotions have a negative influence on satisfaction with service  The R 2 values indicate a good explanation of the model building on the constructs. For the dependent variables, the variance in the explana tion of loyalty is above 50%.</p><p>Results show that most correlation coefficients range between 0.47 and 0.68 (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), which implies an asymmetric relationship between variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Woodside, 2013)</ref>. When correlation coefficients among vari ables fall below 0.70, relations are asymmetric and different combina tions of independent variables may yield the same outcome. Second, although less than 5, multicollinearity is relatively high, which may cause problems when conducting multiple regression analysis (MRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Van der Meer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Woodside, 2013)</ref>. Third, studies on complaint behavior show a high cause effect interdependence among variables. Hence, fsQCA is a suitable, complementary tool for identifying anteced ents of customer loyalty following complaint behavior. FsQCA avoids problems arising from the use of regression methods. The fsQCA method thereby responds to the second research question in the introduction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">FsQCA results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows the complex solutions that lead to customer loyalty. Black circles represent the presence of a causal condition, and white cir cles represent the absence or negation of a causal condition. Blank cells represent irrelevant conditions.</p><p>Regarding the complete sample, solution 1 shows that high loyalty re sults from high procedural and interactional justice, low (positive and negative) emotions, and high trust. This solution has a consistency of 0.93 and explains a good number of cases (coverage = 0.43). Solution 2 indicates that high procedural and interactional justice, high positive emotion and low negative emotion, and high satisfaction with service re covery lead to highly loyal consumer behavior. Of the three solutions, solution 2 explains the most cases (raw coverage = 0.68), and has a con sistency of 0.92. Solution 3 shows that the combination of high distribu tive and procedural justice, high positive emotions during the complaint process, low negative emotions, high satisfaction with service recovery, and high trust result in loyalty (consistency = 0.94 and raw coverage = 0.63). Thus, the three solutions (paths 1, 2, and 3) all contain the condi tions of high procedural justice and low negative emotions, which implies that these conditions are necessary to achieve high customer loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and limitations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Conclusions</head><p>From a methodological perspective, this research demonstrates the usefulness of combining traditional techniques, namely SEM, with fsQCA techniques. SEM techniques let researchers observe the strength of relationships between variables in the model, whereas fsQCA yields configurations between variables that lead to a certain outcome in this study, loyalty following complaint behavior. Researchers should view the two approaches as complementary.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to the scientific literature on service recovery by proposing a model that reports configural paths to loyalty using justice, positive and negative emotions, satisfaction with service recovery, and trust as antecedents of loyalty. Most service recovery studies consider satisfaction with service recovery (i.e., cumulative satisfaction) an output, but other marketing variables such as customer loyalty are also important when explaining future con sumer behavior. This research pioneers the study of the influence of cog nitive and emotional factors using fsQCA in a service recovery context.</p><p>A relevant point relates to the implications concerning justice. Proce dural justice and interactional justice are key antecedents to loyalty. When a problem appears in B2C e commerce service recovery,  customers seem to value positively the company's efforts and proce dures to re establish the service as soon as possible. The special influ ence of negative emotions on loyalty may have its origin in the problems shoppers report with online purchases. Because logistical and payment problems often stem from provider companies that oper ate under their own trade name and do not deal directly with the B2C e commerce platform, such problems may be situational and beyond the control of the B2C e commerce vendor. Nevertheless, these problems evoke negative emotions in customers. In addition, understanding the role of positive emotions is important because emotions receive little at tention in service recovery studies.</p><p>From the managerial perspective, results reveal the importance of training employees in how to manage customer emotions in a com plaint situation through role playing and techniques to detect emotions during telephone conversations or e mails. Simultaneously, managers should be aware of the difficulties this process entails in an online envi ronment because of a lack of face to face interaction with the customer. Providing employees with appropriate training and technological re sources (e.g., webcams for videoconferences) that enable them to rec ognize customers' emotions more accurately can improve the quality of interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Limitations</head><p>The study has some limitations. Future studies should explore addi tional antecedents of loyalty (e.g., perceived value or quality following a complaint) and investigate emotions in a more specific manner by in corporating a larger battery of emotional responses and studying their influence on loyalty. Such research would provide a more comprehen sive explanation in service recovery contexts. Finally, an alternative ap proach to improving the current model would be considering the affective and cognitive components of trust.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
