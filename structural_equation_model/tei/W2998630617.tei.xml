<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Teacher self-efficacy (TSE) is one of the most salient motivational characteristics that is assumed to affect teachers' instructional quality and student motivational beliefs.

Among an array of motivational constructs, teacher self-efficacy (TSE) is recognized as a relevant predictor of teacher effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Klassen &amp; Tze, 2014)</ref>. TSE is directly related to certain aspects of instructional quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Holzberger, Philipp, &amp; Kunter, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ryan, Kuusinen, &amp; Bedoya-Skoog, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Künsting, Neuber, &amp; Lipowsky, 2016)</ref> and is believed to shape student motivation and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Klassen &amp; Tze, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk Hoy, &amp; Hoy, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016)</ref>. Moreover, some researchers argue that TSE affects student outcomes indirectly, that is, through its effects on instructional practices <ref type="bibr">(Guo, McDonald Connor, Yang, Roehrig, &amp; Morrisson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Woolfolk Hoy &amp; Davis, 2005)</ref>. Furthermore, teachers' levels of instructional quality have been found to be related to student motivation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fauth et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sakiz, Pape, &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2011)</ref> as well as student learning and achievement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hattie, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kunter et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Despite evidence on the above-described individual interrelationships between TSE, classroom processes, and student outcomes, a holistic process model including these associations have been primarily conceptual (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998)</ref> rather than empirical <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016</ref>). In addition, many studies that examined the links between the different aspects of the classroom climate (e.g., instructional quality) and student outcomes have suffered from methodological flaws, such as failing to consider the appropriate level of statistical analysis and inadequately controlling for potential measurement and sampling errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Morin, Marsh, Nagengast, &amp; Scalas, 2014)</ref>. Finally, past studies have often relied either on teacher or student self-reports instead of integrating the TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT MOTIVATIONAL BELIEFS 3 perspectives of both the teacher and the student. Therefore, the goal of the present study is to empirically expand our understanding of the nature of the associations between TSE, teachers' instructional practices, and students' motivational beliefs, while overcoming certain methodological issues that were present in previous research.</p><p>1.1. Teacher Self-Efficacy and its Associations with Teachers' Instructional Quality and Students' Motivational Beliefs One of the premises of the social-cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandura, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">1997)</ref> is that human functioning involves a dynamic interplay of intrapersonal, behavioral, and environmental factors, which are linked to each other by a triadic reciprocal codetermination.</p><p>Individuals are seen as agents who exert intentional influence over their functioning and the course of the events in their lives. Their agency is rooted in corresponding self-efficacy beliefs, which are affected by various behavioral and environmental factors; namely, through mastery experiences, vicarious experiences (i.e., social modeling), social persuasion, and physiological and emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">2012)</ref>. Self-efficacy beliefs affect the quality of human functioning through cognitive, motivational, affective, and decisional processes. That is, these beliefs shape individuals' outcome expectations, causal attributions of successes and failures, and the ways individuals motivate themselves and preserve in the face of obstacles. In addition, self-efficacy affects individuals' beliefs in their coping capabilities, emotion regulation mechanisms, and vulnerability to stress and depression.</p><p>Lastly, self-efficacy beliefs can influence the choices individuals make at important life points, therefore, potentially shaping the course of their lives and what they become <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Self-efficacy beliefs are domain-specific, manifesting itself in different forms depending on the activity domain and situational condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura, 2012)</ref>. In the teaching domain, TSE can be defined as teachers' beliefs in their capabilities to teach their subject TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT MOTIVATIONAL BELIEFS 4 matter and to accomplish desired outcomes of student engagement and learning even when teaching challenging students <ref type="bibr">(Tschannen-Moran &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2001)</ref>. In general, individuals with high self-efficacy beliefs perform better at work since they tend to work harder, are more persistent, and experience lower levels of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>. In this light, teachers with a strong sense of efficacy invest more time in planning, are better organized, are more open to new ideas and methods, show greater enthusiasm for teaching, and tend to be more persistent in working with struggling students (Tschannen-Moran &amp; Woolfolk <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Hoy, 2001)</ref>. Indeed, research indicate that TSE is related to various indicators of teacher performance, such as student academic achievement and student motivational beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Klassen &amp; Tze, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Midgley, Feldlaufer &amp; Eccles, 1989)</ref>, as well as teacher instructional quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Klassen &amp; Tze, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Klassen, Tze, Betts, &amp; Gordon, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk Hoy &amp; Hoy, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Contemporary conceptualizations of instructional quality stipulate that the effects of teachers and classrooms on student learning are achieved through the interactions between teachers and students. For example, the Teaching through Interactions Framework <ref type="bibr">(Hamre et al., 2013)</ref> proposes there are three important domains of classroom teaching: classroom organization (which promotes positive behavior and attention), instructional support (which enhances learning), and emotional support (which promotes student social development).</p><p>Similarly, according to the Three Basic Dimensions Framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Praetorius, Klieme, Herbert, &amp; Pinger, 2018)</ref>, classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate are critical for student learning and motivation. Classroom management encompasses one's ability to deliver well-structured and organized instructions as well as the ability to demonstrate effective student behavior management that ensure enough time for learning activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pianta &amp; Hamre, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schlesinger &amp; Jentsch, 2016)</ref> and promote both student learning and achievement (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Seidel &amp; Shavelson, 2007)</ref> as well as their motivation <ref type="bibr">(Rakoczy et al., 2007)</ref>. Cognitive activation refers to one's ability to engage students in higher order thinking skills and challenging tasks, foster student in-depth understanding of the content, and stimulate explorations of concepts, ideas, and prior knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pianta &amp; Hamre, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pianta et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schlesinger &amp; Jentsch, 2016)</ref> and is related to student engagement in higher-level thinking processes and metacognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baumert et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, supportive climate focuses on aspects of self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985)</ref> and refers to one's ability to demonstrate features of the teacher-student relationship, such as constructive feedback during instruction, positive approach to student errors and misconceptions, and caring behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Klieme, Pauli, &amp; Reusser, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Klieme et al., 2001)</ref>. This dimension of instructional quality has been thought to enhance student well-being and learning motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Praetorius et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In their synthesis on 40 years of TSE research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zee and Koomen (2016)</ref> concluded that teachers with high levels of self-efficacy tend to cope effectively with a range of problematic student behaviors in the classroom, use proactive and student-centered classroom behavior strategies, and create positive relationships with their students. In addition, the existing empirical evidence clearly supports the link between TSE and dimensions of instructional quality. For example, teachers with a strong sense of efficacy tend to create a supportive classroom environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Künsting et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ryan, Kuusinen, &amp; Bedoya-Skoog, 2015)</ref>, deliver cognitively activating instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Holzberger et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Künsting et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Schiefele &amp; Schaffner, 2015)</ref>, and effectively organize classroom activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guo et al, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Holzberger et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Künsting et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ryan et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Student motivation can be viewed as a process through which goal-directed learning or achievement activity is instigated and sustained <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pintrich &amp; Schunk, 1996)</ref>. According to a social-cognitive view on motivation, motivational beliefs, values, and goals are of critical importance in this process (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Eccles &amp; Wigfield, 2002</ref> for a review). For instance, the expectancy-value theory of achievement motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000)</ref> posits that students' choices, persistence, and performance in an activity can be explained by their motivational beliefs. That is, their confidence, expected performance, and the perceived value of the activity (i.e., attainment value, intrinsic value, utility value, and cost) can influence their level of engagement and persistence in an activity. Student expectancies and values are shaped by factors, such as their goals, self-schemata, and perceptions of task demands, which are rooted in the perceptions of their own previous experiences and a variety of socialization influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000)</ref>. Therefore, teachers (and their instructional behaviors) can have important roles in shaping students' motivational beliefs, namely expectancies and values. More specifically, ensuring that students are being attentive and receive adequate cognitive stimulation and opportunities for success along with fulfilling their needs in a selfdetermined way, may boost their confidence levels and expectancies for success as well as the subjective value they ascribe to the learning tasks.</p><p>In the present study, the expectancy component of student motivation is conceptualized through self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997)</ref> and the value component is conceptualized through intrinsic motivation, that is, performing an activity to experience pleasure and satisfaction that are inherent to the activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985)</ref>. Intrinsic motivation is a construct very similar to intrinsic value component in the expectancy-value model of achievement, which can be described as enjoyment a student experiences while performing the activity or the subjective interest the student has in the subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Eccles &amp; Wigfield, 2002)</ref>. Both of these motivational beliefs are of great importance for student academic outcomes -student beliefs about their ability and expectancies for success strongly predict academic achievement, while student subjective values predict domain-specific (career) aspirations <ref type="bibr">(Guo, Marsh, Parker, Morin, &amp; Dicke, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lauermann Tsai, &amp; Eccles, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang, Eccles, &amp; Kenny, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 2000)</ref>. The focus of the present research was on high school students enrolled in grammar school programs that best prepare students for pursuing higher education at universities. Therefore, investigating the teacher and classroom characteristics that may explain their ability and value beliefs is of crucial importance for understanding their future academic success and career choices.</p><p>It was suggested that TSE influences student motivation. That is, teachers with greater sense of efficacy provide their students with more choices, transfer greater confidence, and provide students with a greater sense of control of their learning, which in turn positively affect students' engagement in class activities, their learning values, and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Woolfolk Hoy, Hoy, &amp; Davis, 2009)</ref>. Indeed, some research suggests that TSE may be directly and positively related to different aspects of student motivation, such as engagement, on-task behavior, and invested effort, as well to student motivational beliefs like expectancies, self-efficacy, intrinsic value, and attitudes towards learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Midgley, Feldlaufer, &amp; Eccles, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reyes et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ross, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016</ref> for a review). However, most of this research, with an exception of Midgley et al.'s study, were either based on small samples and cross-sectional designs, relied solely on a self-report method, and/or failed to analyze these associations at an appropriate level (i.e., teacher level).</p><p>For instance, when taking into account both teachers' and students' responses and acknowledging the multilevel structure of such data, TSE was not related either to studentreported school investment or to student motivational beliefs, such as self-efficacy, intrinsic values, and goal orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Thoonen, Sleegers, Peetsma, &amp; Oort 2011)</ref>. Due to the scarcity and inconsistency of existing empirical evidence, as well as the methodological shortcomings of previous research, further elucidation of the link between TSE and student motivation is warranted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">The Association Between Instructional Quality and Student Motivational Beliefs</head><p>Teacher instructional quality has been acknowledged as an important source of variation in student learning and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Creemers &amp; Kyriakides, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hattie, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The different dimensions of instructional quality not only explain student cognitive outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fauth et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kunter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Riconscente, 2014)</ref>, but also affect student motivational beliefs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fauth et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sakiz, Pape, &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Schiefele &amp; Schaffner, 2015)</ref>. For example, according to the Teaching through Interactions Framework and the Three Basic Dimensions Framework <ref type="bibr">(Klieme &amp; Rakoczy, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Praetorious et al., 2018)</ref>, providing support to students is expected to foster student intrinsic value beliefs. More precisely, creating a supportive classroom climate that can fulfill students' basic intrinsic needs (i.e., relatedness, autonomy, and competence; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref> should have positive effects on student intrinsic motivation and subject-related interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kunter, Baumert, &amp; Köller, 2007)</ref>. In addition, providing meaningful and adequately challenging learning tasks that promote learning goals and ensuring mastery experiences (which may be achieved through cognitive activation dimension of instructional quality) are expected to promote student intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lepper &amp; Henderlong, 2000)</ref>. Lastly, since efficient classroom management ensures that students are attentive and are being offered opportunities for learning without disruptions and disturbances, it may foster student motivation as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Praetorius et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, <ref type="bibr">Sakiz, Pape, and Woolfolk Hoy (2011)</ref> found that perceived teacher affective support was positively related to student academic enjoyment, self-efficacy, and effort in mathematics. Moreover, studies show that other dimensions of instructional quality, namely, cognitive activation and classroom management, are also related to student value beliefs. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fauth et al. (2014)</ref> found that students instructed by teachers who are seen as more supportive and more cognitively activating, are in general more interested in taught subject.</p><p>In addition, in the same study, classroom management was also positively related to student TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT MOTIVATIONAL BELIEFS 9</p><p>interest, but only at the student level of analysis. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dorfner et al. (2018)</ref> found positive total effects of all three dimensions of instructional quality on student situational interest. Lastly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kunter et al. (2013)</ref> found both learning support and classroom management had positive effects on students' mathematics enjoyment which, along with interest, positively contribute to the processes of intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Reeve, 1989)</ref>. These results</p><p>clearly indicate that all three dimensions of instructional quality (and not only supportive climate) may be important for student intrinsic motivation. However, they also indicate that some of these effects could be mediated by third variables. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dorfner et al. (2018)</ref> found that cognitive activation mediates the effects of classroom management and supportive climate on situational interest.</p><p>Empirical evidence regarding the effects of the three dimensions of instructional quality on student self-efficacy (SSE) beliefs is relatively scarce. Aligned with the socialcognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>, SSE beliefs should rise from one's previous performance, but also from observing others (e.g., observing classmates succeeding in a task), verbal persuasion (e.g., encouragement and support from teachers), and interpretation of one's physiological states (e.g., anxiety and stress may signal the lack of needed skills to succeed; <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Zimmerman, 2000)</ref>. Therefore, teacher behavior in the classroom is highly relevant for the development of SSE. More specifically, teachers who are more supportive of their students, who manage classrooms more efficiently, and who are more able to stimulate deep levels of cognitive processing and engagement in a subject, are expected to provide students with generally more sources for greater SSE. That is, they offer their students more opportunities for achievement and mastery experience, have more credibility in persuading them that success is attainable, and are able to maintain low levels of stress and anxiety in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Schunk &amp; Pajares, 2009)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fast et al. (2010)</ref> found that students who perceived their classroom environments as more caring, challenging, and TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT MOTIVATIONAL BELIEFS 10 mastery-oriented reported significantly higher levels of SSE. Furthermore, Riconscente (2014) revealed that teacher caring, content explanations, and interest promotion play an important role in explaining both student interest and SSE beliefs. In addition, students who view their learning environment as supportive for their autonomy reported higher levels of self-esteem and perceived competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ryan &amp; Grolnick, 1986)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">The Present Study</head><p>TSE is recognized as an important motivational variable that influences teacher effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Klassen &amp; Tze, 2014)</ref>. The existing literature indicates that TSE shapes teacher instructional practices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Künsting et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ryan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tschannen-Moran &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2001)</ref> and is related both to students' academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Caprara, Barbaranelli, Steca, &amp; Malone, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klassen &amp; Tze, 2014)</ref>, and student motivation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Midgley et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ross, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998)</ref>. In addition, teacher instructional quality was recognized as important positive predictor of student motivational beliefs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fauth et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sakiz, Pape, &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Schiefele &amp; Schaffner, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, the existing knowledge on the relationships between TSE, instructional quality, and student motivational beliefs is still rather fragmented and inconsistent. Some of these inconsistencies may be attributable to different methods used for assessing the constructs of interest across studies (e.g., videotaping teacher instructions in <ref type="bibr">Dorfner et al.'s (2018)</ref> study as opposed to using only teacher-reports in <ref type="bibr">Künsting et al.'s (2016)</ref> study) or even to different levels of conceptualization and measurement of constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Zee, Koomen, &amp; de Jong, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, some of the most cited papers on the importance of TSE for student motivation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998)</ref> were theoretical rather than empirical in its nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016)</ref>, thus leaving the association between TSE and student motivational beliefs to be mostly empirically unestablished fact. Next, the majority of studies that examined the link between TSE and student outcomes solely relied on teacher reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016)</ref> and were, therefore, possibly burdened with a bias of overestimation of the size and statistical significance of the examined associations due to a common method variance <ref type="bibr">(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, &amp; Podsakoff, 2013)</ref>. In addition, many earlier educational studies failed to examine the relationships between TSE, instructional quality, and student motivational beliefs at an appropriate level of analysis. More specifically, in many previous studies, true classroom-level climate constructs (e.g., instructional quality and teacher enthusiasm) have been treated as individual student constructs, which is based on an implicit assumption that the effects observed at one (student) level can be generalized to another (classroom or teacher) level. Such analytical strategies typically lead to confounding the true effects from individual students and classrooms as well as to biased estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Morin et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Within the present study, the relationship between instructional quality and student motivational beliefs is considered a classroom climate effect (instead of an individual student effect) since students were asked to evaluate the same objective classroom or teacher characteristic, that is, teachers' instructional quality. Accordingly, instructional quality should be based on individual student responses by aggregating them at the teacher level of analysis, and, thus, the relationships between instructional quality and other student motivational beliefs should also be tested at the teacher level (for more information, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Morin et al., 2014)</ref>. In other words, proper disaggregation of the individual and classroom (or teacher) components of the hypothesized relationships between instructional quality and student motivational beliefs and analyzing these relationships at the appropriate level are necessary to calculate accurate estimates. Lastly, in many previous investigations, sampling and measurement errors were not controlled for, which may have led to biased estimates of the obtained effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Morin, et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>To overcome these issues, the present study employed a multilevel design (i.e., students were nested within teachers) and used data from both teachers and students to test the proposed relationships between TSE, instructional quality, and student motivational beliefs. More precisely, in order to assess the climate effect of instructional quality, each student within a class directly rated the instructional quality of their teacher, thus making the teacher (rather than the student) the referent <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Morin et al., 2014)</ref>. Moreover, we used studentreports of instructional quality as opposed to teacher self-reports in order to reduce the likelihood of bias due to common-method effects and self-serving strategies that might be used by teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Schiefele &amp; Schaffner, 2015)</ref>. Student-reports are easily accessible and can provide a valid information on instructional quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Scherer &amp; Gustafsson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wagner et al., 2013)</ref>. Finally, we employed a doubly latent multilevel modeling technique (ML-SEM) in order to test the hypothesized relationships at proper level (i.e., classroom or teacher) of analysis and to control the measurement error (by using multiple indicators of the constructs at both student and teacher levels) and sampling error (by incorporating the scores for different students in the same class as multiple indicators of latent teacher level constructs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Morin et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Based on theoretical assumptions and prior research, it can be assumed that teacher self-reported levels of self-efficacy would be positively related to class-reported levels of all three dimensions of instructional quality (H1). However, due to the scarcity and inconsistency of available findings on the relationship between TSE and students' motivational beliefs, we leave the nature of the association TSE has with SSE and intrinsic</p><p>motivation as an open question (H2). Lastly, we expect that class-reported levels of instructional quality will be positively related to class-reported levels of motivational beliefs (i.e., positive climate effect of instructional quality on SSE and intrinsic motivation; H3). Data was collected at a single time point via the administration of paper-and-pencil questionnaires, which were distributed to the students and the teachers with the assistance of school psychologists and returned to the researchers by post. As indicated above, this study was part of a larger research project; therefore, data on additional variables were also collected. Both teachers and students needed approximately 30 to 45 minutes to complete the questionnaires. Students completed the questionnaires during class time and teachers completed them during their free time. The participation in the study was anonymous and voluntary. More specifically, all the teachers from the eight schools were approached and invited to participate in the study, and only those who voluntarily agreed were enrolled in data collection procedure (the average response rate was 50%). Teachers gave self-reports on their levels of self-efficacy, while students reported the perceived levels of the three dimensions of instructional quality (i.e., classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate) delivered by their teacher (i.e., target teacher) as well as self-reports on their own levels of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation in the target teacher's subject. Each student reported on the characteristics of only one teacher. On average, reports from 22 students were obtained per teacher.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Analysis</head><p>Data in the current study were hierarchically structured-students located at Level 1 (L1) were nested within teachers located at Level 2 (L2). In such designs, L1 constructs (i.e., students' ratings of instructional quality and student motivation) are based on responses of individual students, while L2 constructs can be based on either true L2 measures (i.e., TSE)</p><p>or aggregates of student responses within the class (i.e., aggregated ratings of instructional quality and class-average reports of motivational beliefs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh et al., 2012)</ref>. The effect of aggregated ratings of instructional quality on the class-average motivational beliefs is considered a climate effect since the referent is the class and each student in the class is asked to directly rate the same features of the classroom environment (i.e., teacher instructional quality) rather than to rate themselves in that environment. Since climate effects reflect the students' shared perceptions of their classroom environment, any residual inter-individual differences that occur at the student level once shared perceptions are controlled for are considered to be a source of unreliability (i.e., measurement error; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arens, Morin, &amp; Watermann, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh et al., 2012)</ref>. These residual L1 ratings represent unique perceptions of each student that cannot be explained by the class-shared perceptions but may play a substantive role in the interpretation of the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Morin et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In order to test the study hypotheses, we used a doubly latent multilevel structural equation modeling (ML-SEM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. The advantages of doubly latent ML-SEM are the ability to control for measurement error at both L1 and L2 levels by using multiple indicators of a construct, as well as the ability to control for sampling error through the aggregating individual student responses to represent teacher level characteristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Morin et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The analysis was conducted in several steps. First, the intraclass correlation coefficients (i.e., ICC1 and ICC2) were obtained to evaluate the extent to which students of the same teacher shared similar perceptions of instructional quality and had similar levels of motivation. ICC1 denotes the proportion of the total variance occurring at the class level and ICC2 refers to the degree of agreement between students or the reliability of the group average <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lüdtke, Marsh, Robitzsch, Trautwein, 2011)</ref>. It is suggested that ICC1 values should be close to or exceed .10, while ICC2 values should be higher than .70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lüdtke et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh et al., 2012)</ref>. Second, the Pearson correlation coefficients between demographics and study variables were calculated at both student (L1) and teacher (L2) levels. Third, a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (ML-CFA) was performed to test the latent structure of the used measures and to examine their validity. Scale items were used as indicators of each of the latent variables. To facilitate interpretation and to reduce nonessential multicollinearity, all variables in the model were standardized (M = 0.00, SD = 1.00; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arens et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Morin et al., 2014)</ref>.

Therefore, to reduce the likelihood of issues caused by multicollinearity and model complexity, we tested separate models for each of the dimensions of instructional quality (i.e., classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate) in three steps: ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) an unconstrained measurement model (M1), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) a constrained measurement model (factor loadings set to be equal across levels; M2), and (3) a hypothesized structural model with years of teaching experiences as control variable at L2 (M3).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between TSE, instructional quality, and student motivational beliefs by implementing a multilevel design and by As expected, the analysis showed that TSE was positively correlated to each of the three dimensions of instructional quality. Teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy were perceived by their students as someone who was more effective in classroom management, who stimulated higher levels of cognitive engagement among students, and who was more supportive. These results are in accordance with previous research that found positive associations between TSE and effective classroom management <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Holzberger et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Künsting et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ryan et al., 2015)</ref>, creating a supportive climate in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Künsting et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ryan et al., 2015)</ref>, and delivering cognitively activating instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Holzberger et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Künsting et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Schiefele &amp; Schaffner, 2015)</ref>. The current study findings also support the propositions of the socialcognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>, which stipulate that individuals with higher self-efficacy beliefs perform better, which is achieved through hard work, persistence, and lower levels of stress. Indeed, teachers' expectations and confidence in their capabilities to accomplish teaching goals and desired student outcomes were reflected in their greater levels of effectiveness, that is, higher students' perceptions of instructional quality.</p><p>Next, the test of our second hypothesis showed that TSE was not directly related to the student motivational variables in the present study, which is in contrast to some earlier propositions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ashton &amp; Webb, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ross, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">(i.e., teacher)</ref>, the relationship between TSE and student motivational beliefs is not as robust as it has been previously suggested. Indeed, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zee &amp; Koomen (2016)</ref>, the mostcited papers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998)</ref> were theoretical papers that only assumed associations between TSE and student motivational beliefs instead of empirically testing them. In addition, some authors claim that TSE shapes student outcomes indirectly through the delivered instructional quality, thus implying a mediating role of teacher instructional behavior in explaining the relationship between TSE and student outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dembo &amp; Gibson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kunter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Woolfolk Hoy &amp; Davis, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016)</ref>. However, these claims were again in most cases derived either from theoretical considerations or from empirical findings based on a cross-sectional study design, which cannot accurately reveal underlying causal mediational mechanisms.</p><p>In line with the third hypothesis, aggregated student-reports of instructional quality were positively related to their motivational beliefs, namely self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Classes of students who gave their teachers higher ratings on all three dimensions of the instructional quality also reported higher levels of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Interestingly, all three dimensions of instructional quality showed to be similarly relevant in explaining student motivation. According to the Teaching through Interactions framework <ref type="bibr">(Hamre et al., 2013)</ref> and the Three Basic Dimensions of teaching quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Praetorius et al., 2018)</ref>, providing support to students is the most important factor for fostering student well-being and motivation, while classroom management and cognitive activation dimensions have the strongest role in facilitating student learning and achievement.</p><p>However, our results showed that each of the three basic dimensions are similarly important in explaining student intrinsic motivation, which are in line with previous studies' findings TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT MOTIVATIONAL BELIEFS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23</head><p>(e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dorfner et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fast et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fauth et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kunter et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Riconscente, 2014)</ref>. The obtained findings suggest that ensuring a supportive classroom climate may increase students' sense of personal autonomy and self-determination <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>, which then promotes their intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kunter, Baumert, &amp; Köller, 2007)</ref>. In addition, delivering instructions that are interesting and optimally challenging, as well as ensuring that students are being attentive and learning without disruptions, may enhance students' value beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lepper &amp; Henderlong, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Praetorius et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The observed patterns of the relationships between instructional quality and SSE are in accordance with the social-cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>, which posits that students' self-efficacy beliefs stem from actual performances, vicarious experiences, social persuasion and physiological and emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Schunk &amp; Pajares, 2009)</ref>. Teachers' instructional behaviors can influence some of these sources of SSE. For instance, teachers who ensure students' attention to learning by efficient classroom management and who stimulate students to actively engage in knowledge construction also offer students more opportunities for mastery experience and success, which in turn boosts SSE. Moreover, such teacher behaviors can enable vicarious learning experiences for students since they can observe their class peers' task mastery behaviors. In addition, a supportive climate during learning and achievement activities may raise SSE through processes of social persuasion (e.g., providing positive feedback to students while ensuring that the envisioned success is attainable) and assist in maintaining low levels of stress and anxiety, which then promote the development of skills and competences in a safe environment and consequently enhance SSE levels.</p><p>At the student level, residual ratings of instructional quality dimensions were related to individual student differences in SSE and intrinsic motivation. Such residual climate ratings may play a substantive role in the interpretation of the results. For instance, systematic differences in residual L1 climate ratings may reflect systematic method effects -students may give consistently more or less favorable responses when rating the climate constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marsh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Morin et al., 2014)</ref>. Considering positive relationships between the residual ratings of the three basic dimensions and student motivation at L1, it is possible that students who are more motivated also tend to rate their teacher more favorably and vice versa. However, future studies with higher levels of methodological rigor (e.g., longitudinal designs and implementation of procedural remedies to control for common method bias; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref> are necessary to clarify these findings further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>This research has several limitations. First, our study was based on a cross-sectional design, which does not avail itself to drawing any conclusions regarding the causal ordering of the examined constructs. That is, it is impossible to determine whether TSE is shaped by or influences the hypothesized outcome variables. Although the use of longitudinal data for future research is necessary, it may not be sufficient. For instance, although teacher motivation has mostly been conceptualized as an antecedent of instructional behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kunter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016)</ref>, findings from empirical studies based on longitudinal data have questioned whether it should be conceptualized as an antecedent construct. For example, in <ref type="bibr">Künsting et al.'s (2016)</ref> study, which was based exclusively on teacher-reports, TSE was found to be a long-term predictor of instructional quality. In contrast, in Hozberger, Philipp, and Kunter's ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) study, which used data from both teachers and students, the reverse effect of instructional quality on TSE was found. That is, dimensions of instructional quality predicted TSE rather than the other way around. Finally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Praetorius et al.'s (2017)</ref> study, based on longitudinal data from both teachers and students, revealed no significant cross-lagged effects between TSE and teaching quality when teachers' stable characteristics were taken into account. Moreover, they found that TSE was quite stable among experienced teachers, with autocorrelations of up to .80, thus further complicating the determination of causal inferences (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Antonakis, Bendahan, Jacquart, &amp; Lalive (2014)</ref> for further discussions). Nevertheless, longitudinal studies aimed at establishing the nature of the possible casual associations between the examined constructs are warranted. In addition, such studies would enable a test of the proposed indirect effect of TSE on student outcomes through instructional quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dembo &amp; Gibson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Woolfolk Hoy &amp; Davis, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zee &amp; Koomen, 2016)</ref>, which could not be achieved in the present research due to its cross-sectional design. Additionally, future studies should examine other teacher characteristics that are relevant for instructional quality using longitudinal data. In particular, besides TSE, teacher general and subject-specific pedagogical knowledge, beliefs, motivational orientations, and self-regulation skills should be considered in relation to their instructional quality and student motivational beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kunter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lauermann &amp; König, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Second, moderate to high correlations between different dimensions of instructional quality obtained in this study indicated relatively poor discriminative validity of studentratings. Even though some studies demonstrated that the three-dimensional model of teaching quality can be replicated in student-ratings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wagner et al., 2013)</ref>, the current data suggest the insufficient capabilities of students to discriminate between different aspects of instructional quality. Nonetheless, the positive associations between TSE and the dimensions of instructional quality support the validity of student-ratings in assessing teacher instructional behaviors in the classroom to some extent.</p><p>Third, student-ratings of instructional quality may have been possibly affected by the perceived teacher popularity or grading practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aleamoni, 1999)</ref>. Unfortunately, teacher popularity was not assessed in this study and, therefore, we could not test for a positive association between class perceived instructional quality and class motivation, after controlling for teacher popularity. However, previous research demonstrated that student-ratings of classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate predicted student outcomes (i.e., achievement and subject-related interest), even after controlling the teacher popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fauth et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, since students gave reports on both instructional quality and motivational beliefs, the size of the relationships between these two constructs may suffer from artificial inflation due to a common-method variance. Therefore, in future studies, much more care should be taken in implementing the most effective procedural and statistical remedies (e.g., using data from different sources, temporal separation of the predictor and criterion, eliminating common scale properties, direct measurement of latent method factor, measurement of response style; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. In addition, future research should aim at collecting data from both teachers and students on the same constructs to obtain a more holistic picture of the antecedents and the effects of classroom processes.</p><p>Fifth, despite some empirical evidence showing that the dimensionality of instructional quality is invariant across school subjects (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sherer &amp; Gustafsson, 2015)</ref>, there are indications that not all domains of instructional quality ratings are invariant across <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Klieme, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wagner, Göllner, Helmke, Trautwein, &amp; Lüdtke, 2013)</ref>. More specifically, the cognitive activation dimension has predominately been developed in mathematics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baumert et al., 2010)</ref> and may be less applicable to other subject areas.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to a relatively small teacher sample size, academic subject specificity could not be statistically taken into account in the present study. However, the cognitive activation dimension was assessed through a newly created scale (see Appendix A) and special care was taken to choose and formulate items that would be applicable across a wide array of academic subject areas. Indeed, the high reliability coefficients and theoretically meaningful relations to other examined constructs found in this study show that cognitive activation can be successfully applied across multiple academic subject areas.</p><p>TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT MOTIVATIONAL BELIEFS 27</p><p>Lastly, the hypotheses in this study were tested only at the teacher level of analysis even though SSE and intrinsic motivation are inherently individual student constructs.</p><p>However, since the referent in this study was the class rather than an individual student (i.e., all students within a class rated the same characteristic of their teacher), the effect of instructional quality on student outcomes was, by definition, a climate effect that must be tested at the teacher level of analysis. Nonetheless, future studies may wish to examine the contextual effect of instructional quality on student motivational beliefs where the referent is the individual student and not the class. This approach could also enable the test of this association at both the teacher and student levels of analyses (for more details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>

Lastly, raising teacher TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT MOTIVATIONAL BELIEFS 28 instructional quality may not only promote student outcomes, but also the sense of their own efficacy since these teaching behaviors also represent sources of self-efficacy for teachers.</p><p>However, these suggestions should be viewed cautiously due to the cross-sectional design of the present study and the scarcity of research conducted with methodological rigor that allow making causal inferences regarding the interrelationships between TSE, instructional quality, and student motivational beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Findings from this research contribute to the scarce empirical evidence regarding the relationships between teacher motivational variables, their instructional behavios, and student outcomes. The obtained results emphasize the robustness of the positive link between teachers' self-efficacy and instructional quality even when these constructs are collected from different sources (i.e., teacher-and student-reports), but also question the existence of the often-assumed direct link between TSE and student intrinsic motivation.</p></div>

That is, teachers with higher levels of TSE were, on average, rated by students as managing classrooms better (β = .255, p = .041), providing more cognitive activation (β = .261, p = .033), and showing greater support (β = .234, p = .035). In regards to H2, TSE was not related to SSE and intrinsic motivation in classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate models (β = -.094, p =.447 and β = -.171, p = .137; β = -.083, p = .497 and β = -.168, p = .165; β = -.091, p = .469 and β = -.139, p = .296, respectively). Next, in support of H3, in classes of teachers with higher levels on the three instructional quality domains (i.e., classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate), the students reported higher levels of SSE (β = .361, p = .001; β = .312, p = .016; and β = .384, p = .003, respectively) and intrinsic motivation (β = .539, p &lt; .001; β = .510, p &lt; .001; and β = .446, p &lt; .001, respectively). The results also revealed that more experienced teachers reported lower levels of TSE (β = -.239, p = .029; β = -.244, p = .028; and β = -.242, p = .028, for each of the models respectively). Lastly, the more experienced teachers were rated as poorer classroom managers by their students (β = -.217, p = .055) and had classes of students with somewhat lower levels of SSE (β= -.178, p = .093; β = -.210, p = .040; and β = -.205, p = .052, respectively). At L1, students' residualized perceptions of classroom management, cognitive activation, and supportive climate were positively related to SSE (β = .351, p &lt; .001; β = .427, SE = 0.026, p &lt; .001; and β =.334, p &lt; .001, respectively) and intrinsic motivation (β = .442, SE = 0.031, p &lt; .001; β = .483, SE = 0.025, p &lt; .001; and β = .363, SE = 0.030, p &lt; .001, respectively).</figDesc></figure>
