<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Classical two-stage least squares methods and the limited information maximum likelihood estimator provide attractive methods of estimation for Gaussian linear structural equation models with additive errors. However, these methods offer only a conditional mean view of the structural relationship, implicitly imposing quite restrictive location-shift assumptions on the way that covariates are allowed to influence the conditional distributions of the endogenous variables. Quantile regression methods seek to broaden this view, offering a more complete characterization of the stochastic relationship among variables and providing more robust, and consequently more efficient, estimates in some non-Gaussian settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amemiya (1982)</ref> was the first to seriously consider quantile regression methods for the structural equation model showing the consistency and asymptotic normality of a class of two-stage median regression estimators. Subsequent work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Powell (1983)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Portnoy (1996)</ref> extended this approach, but maintained the focus primarily on the conditional median problem. Recent work has sought to broaden the perspective. Abadie, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angrist and Imbens (2002)</ref> considered quantile regression methods for estimating endogenous treatment effects focusing on the binary treatment case. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sakata (2000)</ref> has considered a median regression analogue of the LIML estimator. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chernozhukov and Hansen (2001)</ref> have proposed a novel instrumental variables approach.</p><p>Version: <ref type="bibr">February 3, 2004</ref>. The authors would like to express their appreciation to Andrew Chesher for stimulating conversations regarding this work. They would also like to thank Annelie van der Wind for her extensive help with the interpretation of the PRIMA data. This work was partially supported by NSF Grant SES-0240781.</p><p>In a series of recent papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chesher (2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chesher ( , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chesher ( , 2003) )</ref> has considerably expanded the scope of quantile regression methods for structural econometric models. He considers a general nonlinear specification whose crucial feature is its triangular stochastic structure. By recursively conditioning, a sequence of conditional quantile functions are available to characterize the model and identify the structural effects. The approach may be viewed as a natural generalization of the "causal chain" models advocated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Strotz and Wold (1960)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Imbens and Newey (2002)</ref> have also recently stressed the utility of the triangular stochastic structure.</p><p>Chesher has elegantly laid out the structural interpretation of his proposed models and dealt with the ensuing identification issues. In so doing he has clarified the objectives of estimating models with heterogeneous structural effects; his focus on structural derivatives of conditional quantile functions provides a natural target for nonparametric identification and estimation. Our objective is to consider more pragmatic problems of estimation and inference in parametric structural models. We will consider two general classes of the estimation methods. The first is a class of average derivative methods based directly on the Chesher identification strategy. The second is a new "control variate" approach. In parametric settings we compare the asymptotic behavior of the two approaches and show that the control variate methods attain an efficiency bound corresponding to an optimally weighted form of the average derivative estimator. In typical applications where the precise specification of the covariate effects are subject to dispute the two estimation strategies are useful complements, offering a valuable framework for inference.</p><p>The next section introduces the recursive structural model and describes the two classes of estimators. We will focus primarily on a simple two equation setting, with some brief remarks on the extension to larger models. Sections 3 and 4 are devoted to the asymptotic behavior of the estimators and their asymptotic relative efficiency. Section 5 reports the results of a small simulation experiment designed to explore the finite sample performance of the two approaches. Section 6 describes an application of the models to the problem of estimating structural effects of changes in class size on student performance in Dutch primary schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Recursive Structural Models and Their Estimation</head><p>To motivate Chesher's approach it is worthwhile to briefly reconsider the simple, exactly identified, triangular model, <ref type="bibr">(2.1</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y i1 = Y i2 α 1 + x i α 2 + ν i1 + λν i2 (2.2) Y i2 = z i β 1 + x i β 2 + ν i2 .</formula><p>Suppose that the unobserved errors ν i1 and ν i2 are stochastically independent and identically distributed with ν i1 ∼ F 1 and ν i2 ∼ F 2 . Assume further that the ν ij 's are independent of (z i , x i ) , and that for convenience Y i2 and z i are scalars.</p><p>We will focus on the estimate of the scalar structural parameter α 1 . The classical two stage least squares estimator of α 1 may be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">α1 = ( Ŷ 2 M X Ŷ2 ) -1 Ŷ 2 M X Y 1 where Ŷ2 = z β1 + X β2 , β1 = (z M X z) -1 z M X Y 2 , β2 = (X M z X) -1 X M z Y 2 , M z = I - z(z z) -1 z</formula><p>, and M X = I -X(X X) -1 X . A somewhat less conventional interpretation of α1 can be derived substituting for ν i2 in (2.1) to obtain <ref type="bibr">(2.3</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y 1 = Y 2 (α 1 + λ) -zβ 1 λ + X(α 2 -λβ 2 ) + ν 1 ≡ W δ + ν 1 ,</formula><p>where W = [Y 2 . . .z . . .X] and δ = (δ 1 , δ 2 , δ 3 ) = (α 1 + λ, -β 1 λ, α 2λβ 2 ) .</p><p>Now, suppose we estimate the hybrid structural equation (2.3) by ordinary least squares. We have the following result.</p><p>Proposition 1. α1 = δ1 + β-1 1 δ2 , where δ = (W W ) -1 W Y 1 . The proof of this result is somewhat involved and is, therefore, relegated to the Appendix, as are proofs of subsequent results, but its interpretation is simple and straightforward. The two stage least squares estimator may be viewed as a bias corrected form of the least squares estimator of the structural effect in the hybrid model <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>.</p><p>The same strategy can be employed to estimate the conditional quantile effects in this model. We have the conditional quantile functions</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , z, x) = Y 2 (α 1 + λ) -zβ 1 λ + x (α 2 -λβ 2 ) + F -1 1 (τ 1 ) Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z) = zβ 1 + x β 2 + F -1 2 (τ 2 ). Provided that ∇ z Q 2 (τ 2 |z, x) = β 1 =</formula><p>0 we may write following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chesher (2003)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">α 1 = ∇ Y 2 Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , x, z) + ∇ z Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , x, z) ∇ z Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z) α 2 = ∇ x Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , x, z) - ∇ z Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , x, z) ∇ z Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z) ∇ x Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z), adopting the convention that Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , x, z) is always evaluated at Y 2 = Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z).</formula><p>In this case, because the covariate effects take the simple location shift form, the structural parameters α 1 and α 2 are globally constant independent of τ 1 and τ 2 and of the exogenous variables x and z. As we will now see, this is highly unusual. </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Y i1 = ϕ 1 (Y i2 , x i , ν i1 , ν i2 ) (2.5) Y i2 = ϕ 2 (z i , x i , ν i2 )</formula><p>where as earlier we assume that ν i1 and ν i2 are independent, and identically distributed with ν ij ∼ F j . The pairs (ν i1 , ν i2 ) are also maintained to be independent of (z i , x i ) . The function ϕ 1 , is assumed strictly monotonic in ν 1 , and differentiable with respect to Y 2 and x, and ϕ 2 is assumed strictly monotonic in ν 2 , and differentiable with respect to both z and x. Under these conditions, we can write the conditional quantile functions,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q 1 (τ 1 |Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z), x) = ϕ 1 (Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z), x, F -1 1 (τ 1 ), F -1 2 (τ 2 )) Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z) = ϕ 2 (z, x, F -1 2 (τ 2 )</formula><p>). How should we measure the effect of Y 2 on Y 1 in this model? Given the stochastic character of the "treatment", Y 2 , we must evaluate the treatment effect at various quantiles of the treatment distribution. We may view this as corresponding to a thought experiment in which we exogenously alter not the value of Y 2 as we would with a treatment fully under our control, but instead alter the distribution of Y 2 . Thus, for example, in our anticipated study of class-size effects on educational performance, we may imagine altering the prevailing distribution of class-sizes and exploring the consequences of this perturbation on various quantiles of the distribution of students' attainment. Of course, in the model Y 2 is determined according to (2.5), so to assume otherwise requires some sort of "willing suspension of disbelief" in the model. But this is inevitable in structural models and we are always entitled to interpret effects as long as they can be formulated in terms of well-posed gedankan experiments.</p><p>In their (infamous) tryptych on causal chain systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Strotz and Wold (1960)</ref> illustrate this point with a vivid fresh water example: Suppose z is a vector whose various elements are the amounts of various fish feeds (different insects, weeds, etc.) available in a given lake. The reduced form y = B -1 Γz + B -1 u would tell us specifically how the number of fish of any species depends upon the availabilities of different feeds. The coefficient of any z is the partial derivative of a species population with respect to a food supply. It is to be noted, however, that the reduced form tells us nothing about the interactions among the various fish populations -it does not tell us the extent to which one species of fish feeds on another species. Those are the causal relations among the y's. Suppose, in another situation, we continuously restock the lake with species g, increasing y g by any desired amount. How will this affect the values of the other y's? If the system were recursive and we had estimates of the elements of B, we would simply strike the gth equation out of the model and regard y g , the number of fish of species g, as exogenous -as a food supply or, when appearing with a negative coefficient as a poison. (pp. 421-2, emphasis added) Recursive conditioning enables us to contemplate similar kinds of policy experiments in the context of the triangular structural models considered by Chesher; related models have also been recently considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Imbens and Newey (2002)</ref>. In contrast to the linear structural models of the Cowles Commission era, whose causal effects were restricted to take the form of location shifts of the conditional distributions of the endogenous variables, recent work poses the identification of structural effects in a general non-parametric framework so structural effects can take quite heterogeneous forms. We will focus on a more restricted finite dimensional parametric formulation, a formulation that is more conducive to our asymptotic analysis. Extensions to sequences of models with the parametric dimension tending to infinity could be considered in subsequent work.</p><p>To explore this further, consider the following model in which Y 2 exerts both a location and a scale shift effect on Y 1 ;</p><p>(2.6)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Y i1 = Y i2 α 1 + x i α 2 + δY i2 (ν i1 + λν i2 ) (2.7) Y i2 = z i β 1 + x i β 2 + γz i ν i2 .</formula><p>Maintaining our prior assumptions on (ν i1 , ν i2 ), and assuming that δ = 0 and γ = 0, we can again substitute for ν i2 in (2.6) to obtain,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Y i1 = Y i2 (α 1 + δν i1 -δβ 1 λ/γ) + x i α 2 + Y 2 i2 z i δλ γ - Y i2 x i z i δλβ 2 γ , Y i2 = z i (β 1 + γν i2 ) + x i β 2 .</formula><p>So we have the conditional quantile functions,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Q 1 (τ 1 |Y i2 , x i , z i ) = Y i2 θ 1 (τ 1 ) + x i θ 2 (τ 1 ) + Y 2 i2 z i θ 3 (τ 1 ) + Y i2 x i z i θ 4 (τ 1 ) (2.8) Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z) = zβ(τ 2 ) + x β 2 (τ 2 ), (2.9) where θ 1 (τ 1 ) = α 1 +δF -1 1 (τ 1 )-δβ 1 λ/γ, θ 2 (τ 1 ) = α 2 , θ 3 (τ 1 ) = δλ/γ, θ 4 (τ 1 ) = -δλβ 2 /γ, β 1 (τ 2 ) = β 1 + γF -1 2 (τ 2 ) and β 1 (τ 2 ) = β 2 .</formula><p>By recursive conditioning we have the conditional quantile functions,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q 1 (τ 1 |Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z), x, z) = Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z)(α 1 + δ(F -1 1 (τ 1 ) + λF -1 2 (τ 2 ))) + x α 2 Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z) = z(β 1 + γF -1 2 (τ 2 )) + x β 2 so the structural effect of interest is, π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) = α 1 + δ(F -1 1 (τ 1 ) + λF -1 2 (τ 2 )). A straightforward calculation shows that π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) = ∇ Y 2 Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , x, z) + ∇ z Q 1 (τ 1 |Y 2 , x, z) ∇ z Q 2 (τ 2 |x, z) .</formula><p>As in the location-shift model, this structural effect is independent of the conditioning covariates x i and z i so the Chesher identification strategy suggests an obvious estimation strategy. Note however, that since estimation of the conditional quantile functions (2.8) and (2.9) will fail to produce the convenient cancellation of the exact calculation, some scheme to average over the covariate space would be required to obtain the structural effect. This will be even more apparent in the next subsection where a more general nonlinear-in-parameters model is considered.</p><p>Given the separate contributions of F -1 1 (τ 1 ) and F -1 2 (τ 2 ), it is clear that π(τ 1 , τ 2 ) reflects not only the fact that the stochastic effect of Y 2 on Y 1 arises from two distinct sources, but also provides structural insight into how these sources are related. Suppose we fix τ 1 so ν 1 is fixed at its τ 1 quantile, changes in τ 2 in π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) reflect how the distribution of ν 2 affects the τ 1 quantile of the response Y 1 . On the other hand, if we fix τ 2 , and allow τ 1 to change, this sheds light on how the τ 2 quantile of Y 2 influences the whole distribution of the response Y 1 . By considering variation in both τ 1 and τ 2 we obtain a panoramic view of the stochastic relationship between Y 2 and Y 1 .</p><p>Recalling that integrating the quantile function F -1 X (τ ) of a random variable, X, over the domain [0, 1], yields its expectation, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">EX = 1 0 F -1 X (t)dt,</formula><p>we can define a mean quantile treatment effect by integrating out τ 2 , and denoting</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">µ i = Eν i , π1 (τ 1 ) = 1 0 (α 1 + δ(F -1 1 (τ 1 ) + λF -1 2 (τ 2 )))dτ 2 ≡ α 1 + δF -1 1 (τ 1 ) + δλµ 2</formula><p>Averaging again, this time with respect to τ 1 yields the mean treatment effect π1 =</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">1 0 (α 1 + δF -1 1 (τ 1 ) + δλµ 2 )dτ 1 ≡ α 1 + δµ 1 + δλµ 2 .</formula><p>This mean treatment effect would be what is estimated by the two stage least squares estimator in the pure location shift version of the model, but when the effects are more heterogeneous as in this location-scale shift model the structural quantile treatment effect π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) represents a deconstruction the mean effect into its elementary components. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>.1 illustrates the three versions of the treatment effect π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ), π1 (τ 1 ) and π1 for a particular parametric instance of the model (2.6-7).</p><p>2.2. Estimation of Structural Quantile Treatment Effects. In this section we will describe two general classes of estimators for the parametric recursive structural model,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Y i1 = ϕ 1 (Y i2 , x i , ν i1 , ν i2 ; α) (2.10) Y i2 = ϕ 2 (z i , x i , ν i2 ; β). (2.11)</formula><p>We will maintain our assumptions on the ν ij 's and the functions ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and we will explicitly assume that the functions ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are known up to the finite dimensional parameter vectors α and β. Under these conditions we have an inverse function for ϕ 2 with respect to ν 2 , say φ2 , allowing us to write</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ν i2 = φ2 (Y i2 , z i , x i ; β)</formula><p>and thus we have,  1 (τ 1 ), the mean quantile treatment effect; the right figure shows π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) = 10 + 3(F -1 1 (τ 1 ) + 2F -1 2 (τ 2 )), the general quantile treatment effect.</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Y i1 = ϕ 1 (Y i2 , x i , ν i1 , φ2 (Y i2 , z i , x i ; β); α).</formula><p>We will write the conditional quantile functions of Y 1 and Y 2 as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Q 1 (τ 1 |Y i2 , x i , z i ) = h 1 (Y i2 , x i , z i ; θ) Q 2 (τ 2 |z i , x i ) = h 2 (z i , x i ; β).</formula><p>Fixing τ 1 and τ 2 we can estimate the parameters of the conditional quantile functions, θ(τ 1 ) and β(τ 2 ), as illustrated in the previous subsection, by solving the possibly nonlinear weighted quantile regression problems,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">θ(τ 1 ) = argmin θ∈Θ n i=1 σ i1 ρ τ 1 (Y i1 -h 1 (Y i2 , x i , z i ; θ)) (2.12) β(τ 2 ) = argmin β∈B n i=1 σ i2 ρ τ 2 (Y i2 -h 2 (z i , x i , β)). (2.13)</formula><p>The weights σ ij are assumed to be strictly positive and will play an important role in the efficiency comparisons made in Section 4. The function ρ τ (u) = u(τ -I(u &lt; 0)) is as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Koenker and Bassett (1978)</ref>. Methods for computing quantile regression estimates for models that are nonlinear in parameters are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Koenker and Park (1996)</ref>. When h 1 and h 2 yield specifications that are nonlinear in parameters, then we require compact domains Θ and B for the parameters.</p><p>Our primary objective will be to estimate the weighted average quantile treatment effect implied by the Chesher formula,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) = ∇ y Q 1 (τ 1 |y, x i , z i ) + ∇ z Q 1 (τ 1 |y, x i , z i ) ∇ z Q 2 (τ 2 |x i , z i ) w(x, z)dxdz</formula><p>with y evaluated as before, at Q 2 (τ 2 |x i , z i ). A secondary object will be to estimate the corresponding structural effect of the exogonous variables x,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">π 2 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) = ∇ x Q 1 (τ 1 |Y i2 , x i , z i ) - ∇ z Q 1 (τ 1 |y, x i , z i ) ∇ z Q 2 (τ 2 |x i , z i ) ∇ x Q 2 (τ 2 |x i , z i ) w(x, z)dxdz</formula><p>Since, in general, the above integrands depend upon the point of evaluation in the space of the exogenous covariates we consider the class of weighted average derivative estimators,</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">π1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) = n i=1 w i ∇ y ĥ1 (τ 1 |y, x i , z i , θ) + ∇ z ĥ1 (τ 1 |y, x i , z i , θ) ∇ z ĥ2 (τ 2 |x i , z i . β)</formula><p>again evaluating at y = ĥ2 (τ 2 |x i , z i , β). A weighted average derivative estimator for the structural effects of x is defined similarly as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">π2 (τ 1 , τ 2 ) = n i=1 w i ∇ x ĥ1 (τ 1 |y, x i , z i , θ) - ∇ z ĥ1 (τ 1 |y, x i , z i , θ) ∇ z ĥ2 (τ 2 |x i , z i , β) ∇ x ĥ2 (τ 2 |x i , z i , β) .</formula><p>The weights are assumed to be positive and sum to one. A convenient choice would be w i ≡ n -1 . In some cases, like the location shift model the dependence on the exogenous covariates vanishes so the weights are irrelevant. The foregoing considerations have presumed a situation of exact identification in which there is a single "instrumental variable," z, available. In over-identified settings we may have several versions of π(τ 1 , τ 2 ) corresponding to different choices of the variable z and we may wish to again consider weighted averages. This point will be addressed in more detail when we come to asymptotics. The estimator πn (τ</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">1 , τ 2 ) = (π 1 (τ 1 , τ 2 ), π 2 (τ 1 , τ 2 )</formula><p>) is based squarely on Chesher's identification strategy. Its advantage is that it takes a rather skeptical attitude toward the original model and is thereby based on a rather loosely restricted form of the two conditional quantile functions. This complements nicely the more restrictive form of the estimators described in the next subsection and consequently may eventually prove to be advantageous from a specification diagnostics and testing viewpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">A Control Variate Estimator.</head><p>To motivate the control variate approach to estimation of the structural quantile treatment effect, it is helpful to return briefly to the classical two stage least squares estimator of the location shift model (2.1-2) and recall its control variate interpretation. Suppose that rather than replacing Y 2 by Ŷ2 in (2.1) and estimating the resulting model by least squares, we instead compute ν2 = Y 2 -Ŷ2 , the residuals from the first stage of 2SLS. Now consider including ν2 as an additional covariate in (2.1) and estimating by least squares. It is easy to show that the resulting estimates of α 1 and α 2 are the same as those produced by 2SLS. This result holds much more generally: Y i2 and z i may be vector-valued and the model may be overidentified.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Asymptotic Relative Efficiency of the Structural Estimators</head><p>Naturally, we would like to compare the performance of our two classes of estimators. The first and most obvious prerequisite for this is to ensure that they are really estimating the same quantity. For linear in parameters specifications the situation is quite straightforward so we will consider this case in some detail first, treating it as a rehearsal for the general result embodied in Theorem 4. To formalize what we mean by linear models, suppose that</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">ϕ 1 (Y i2 , x i , ν i2 , α, F -1 1 (τ 1 )) = ġ i1 α(τ 1 , τ 2 ) = ḣ i1 θ(τ 1 ) (4.1) ϕ 2 (z i , x i , F -1 2 (τ 2 ), β) = ġ i2 β(τ 2 ) = ḣ i2 β(τ 2 ) (4.2)</formula><p>where the vectors ġij and ḣij are free of dependence on the parameters. The linearity of ϕ 1 implies that there is a linear mapping, W 1 = ∂π/∂θ, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">W 1 θ = π.</formula><p>Writing G j for the matrix with typical row n -1/2 (f ij ġ ij ) for j = 1, 2, and similarly let H j denote the matrix with typical row n -1/2 (f ij ḣ ij ). Note that G 2 = H 2 and that there is a matrix A such that G 1 = H 1 A so Aα = θ. Thus we have W 1 Aα = π. Further, let L = W 1 A, so Lα = π. The transformation L reduces the dimensionality of the α vector, eliminating the components that are required to describe the ν 2 -effect and allowing us to focus attention on the performance of the control variate estimator of the π parameter.</p><p>We can now compare the performance of our two estimators of π: the weighted average derivative estimator πn and the control variate estimator πn = L αn . To facilitate this comparison it is convenient to restrict attention to the optimally weighted form of both estimators for which σ ij = f ij . In this case, the asymptotic covariance matrix of πn specializes to Avar(</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">√ nπ n ) = ω 11 W 1 J -1 1 W 1 + ω 22 W 2 J -1 2 W 2 while that of αn specializes to Avar( √ n αn ) = ω 11 D -1 1 + ω 22 D -1 1 D 12 D -1 2 D 12 D -1</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">D -1 i = lim n→∞ n -1 f 2 ij ġij ġ ij and D 12 = lim n→∞ n -1 f 2 i1 η i ġi1 ġ i2 .

While the restricted form of the πn estimator yields an efficiency gain when we are confident about the model specification, it clearly offers some disadvantages in situations in which we are not so confident. Indeed, tests of model specification based on the unrestricted form of the estimators ( θn , βn ) might be viewed as a reasonable precaution in the early stages of model construction.</p><p>When the model is nonlinear in parameters the situation is much the same from an asymptotic viewpoint. Jacobians of the nonlinear transformations, W 1 , A, and L evaluated at the true parameters now play the role of the matrices in the previous development, and the δ-method yields the following general result. Theorem 3. For the parametric model (2.4-5) with the optimal weighting, σ ij = f ij , let Λ(α) = π denote the mapping from the structural parameter α to the weighted average derivative parameter π. Suppose that the Jacobian, L = ∂Λ/∂α is continuous in a neighborhood of the true parameters. Then the optimally-weighted average derivative estimator, πn , and the optimally-weighted control variate estimator, πn = Λ( αn ), have limiting Gaussian behavior with asymptotic covariance matrices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">Avar( √ nπ n ) = ω 11 W 1 J -1 1 W 1 + ω 22 W 2 J -1 2 W 2 Avar( √ nπ) = ω 11 L(G 1 G 1 ) -1 L + ω 22 L(G 1 G 1 ) -1 G 1 P G 2 G 1 (G 1 G 1 ) -1 L and Avar( √ nπ n ) ≤ Avar( √ nπ).</formula><p>Remark: It is worth emphasizing at this point that the superior asymptotic performance of the control variate estimator asserted in Theorem 3 is particularly appealing when the model is overidentified. In such cases the weighted average derivative approach becomes somewhat cumbersome, while the control variate method remains entirely straightforward.</p></div>

For the sake of simplicity, we set τ 1 = τ 2 = τ and consider only the quantiles τ = (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9). Results are reported in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.1 for sample size n = 100, and in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.2 for n = 1000. The number of replications is R = 1000. We see first, that both estimators exhibit very modest bias at sample size, n = 100, and bias is substantially reduced at n = 1000. Secondly, in terms of the standard error and root mean square error, the control variate estimator outperforms the weighted derivative estimator at all considered quantiles.</p><p>For the sake of comparison we consider four other estimators:</p><p>QR: Naive quantile regression applied to (5.1) without any attempt to deal with the endogoneity of Y 2 . 2SQRQ: Two stage quantile regression replacing Y 2 by the predicted Ŷ2 from the τ = τ 2 quantile regression estimation of (5.2). 2SQRA: Two stage quantile regression replacing Y 2 by the predicted Ŷ2 from the τ = 1/2 median regression estimation of (5.2). 2SQRS: Two stage quantile regression replacing Y 2 by the predicted Ŷ2 from the ordinary least squares (mean) regression estimation of (5.2). The performance of the other estimators is quite unsatisfactory by comparison with the WADQR and CVQR proposals. At the median the two-stage methods all have good bias and variance performance, as one would expect from the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amemiya (1982)</ref>. But at all other quantiles they exhibit serious bias problems. Bias of the various 2SQR estimators is not substantially improved by the increase in sample size, contrary to the performance of the CVQR and WADQR estimator. Naive quantile regression estimation of the structural equation, as expected, is also weighted derivative and the control variate methods to a structural equation model of the impact of class size on student achievement. Our main objective is to demonstrate how these new approaches can be employed to reveal new aspects of the sample and thus yield more detailed and constructive policy analysis. We find that the two methods produce quite similar results, especially for language performance, a finding that somewhat reenforces our confidence in our model specification. Both estimators indicate that the class size effects vary significantly across quantiles of the class size distribution and student achievement distribution. For the lower attainment students, bigger classes improve language performance, while smaller classes improve math scores. For average students, class sizes have insignificant effects on both language and math performance. For high attainment students smaller classes are slightly better for language performance, but class size effects are not significant for math performance. These findings suggest that a general policy of class size reduction is unlikely to have large beneficial effects on overall student achievement and should be approached with some skepticism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.1.</head><p>A Brief Review of the Literature on Class Size Effect. Student academic performance is of paramount importance to parents, teachers and educational policy makers. Among policy tools available to school administrators reductions in class size appear among the most promising prescriptions for improving student achievement. However, the statistical evidence on the linkages between class size and student performance is mixed. 1 Since the publication of the influential Coleman report (1966), there have been literally hundreds of studies examining the relationship between class size and student achievement. The results span the full range of possible conclusions: some find that there is a significant and positive relationship between class size and student achievement; some find that smaller classes are more effective; some find that there is no discernible relationship. Inevitably, some of the uncertainty in the literature derives from the fact that there is no uniformly agreed specification of the model or estimation method for the causal effect of class size. Most empirical studies have employed least squares methods to obtain estimates of the effect of class size on student achievement, and thus present a mean treatment view of class size effect. Recognizing the heterogeneity in the potential effects several authors have recently suggested that a more disaggregated estimation of the policy effects would be preferred, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hanushek (1986)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krueger (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Card (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angrist and Krueger (2001)</ref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, only two studies take up the challenge to investigate class size effects across quantiles of school achievement distribution.</p><p>1 For meta-analysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Glass and Smith (1979)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Glass et al.

Dutch policy makers have recently dedicated more than $500 million to reduce class sizes in primary education <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Levin, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Eide and Showalter (1998) using US data, apply quantile regression methods to a model of student achievement and find that the class size effect is insignificantly different from zero at all quantiles of students achievement distribution. It should be emphasized that this model does not include students' family background, or peer effects, and that they treat the class size variable as exogenous. Noting the endogeneity problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levin (2001)</ref> applies a variant of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amemiya's (1982)</ref> methods to a structural equation model, but also finds little empirical support for beneficial effects of smaller classes at most quantiles with or without peer effects added to the model. Note that both Eide and Showalter (1998) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levin (2001)</ref> present what we have characterized as a mean quantile treatment effect view of class size effects: How does mean class size affect the distribution of academic outcomes? By revealing the variations of class size effects across quantiles of students achievement, the MQTE approach offers a more complete view than earlier work. However, the effect of variations across quantiles of the distribution of class sizes remains obscure. As a consequence, it is hard to evaluate the class size effect without acknowledging that various class sizes have different influences on students' academic performance. For broader view of class size effects, we consider the structural quantile treatment effect in the framework that we have set out in Section 2, in an effort to explore the potential heterogeneity in the class size effect over both the distribution of students achievement as well as the distribution of class sizes. 6.2. Data Description. The data we employ is the first wave of the PRIMA cohort study, which contains detailed information on Dutch primary school students in grades 2, 4, 6, and 8 as well as the associated teacher and school characteristics for the school year 1994/1995. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> The PRIMA cohort study is a comprehensive survey of primary education in Holland, enabling researchers to explore relationships between pupil's achievements, their characteristics, those of their parents, as well as class level and school level characteristics. Pupils are tested with regard to intelligence, reading abilities, the Dutch language and mathematics. Background data are gathered through parents and teachers and detailed school level data are furnished by the directors of the participating schools. In total, there are about 57,000 pupils from 700 primary schools in the survey. Of these, 450 schools form the representative random sample that we use in this paper. Only grades 4, 6 and 8 are considered and the three grades are pooled together in our analysis. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>A brief statistical summary of the variables used in our modeling is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">6</ref>.1. The average class size is 24 and ranges from 5 to 39, but about 70% of classes are between 15-35. It may be noted that the variability of math scores is considerably higher than that of the language scores. About 72% of the schools in the sample are public, but it probably should be emphasized that the distinction between private and public schools in Holland is not nearly so great as one may be led to expect from the vantage point of the US. Estimates of the interaction of school denomination and class size indicate that there is no significant difference in class size effects between public and private schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Model Specification.</head><p>Before considering the formal model, there are two concerns about class size effects that should be addressed. The first one is the causal mechanism: class size per se should not contribute to students' academic achievement. Presumably, class size operates through various channels that exert influences on student performance. For example, smaller classes may induce changes in instructional methods and change the nature of peer effects. Both these factors are thought to play important roles in students' academic performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lazear (2001)</ref>, for example, has focused on the public good aspect of classroom teaching and investigates the congestion effects of class size from a theoretical perspective. But there seems to be no generally accepted theory of the causal mechanism that links class size to student performance.</p><p>A second major concern for the emprical study of class size effects is potential endogeneity. Parents may make location decisions based on the quality of local public schools attempting to ensure that their children attend small classes; school administrators may have a desire to put the lower attainment students in smaller classes or try to assign better teachers to bigger classes. Correspondingly, to treat the endogeneity problem of class size, there are two approaches in the literature: one is to sidestep endogeneity issues by focusing on "experimental" settings like the Tennessee STAR experiment, or related "natural experiments" as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hoxby (2000)</ref>; the other is to use instrumental variable methods to correct for the bias induced by endogenous covariates, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krueger (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Angrist and Lavy (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Hanushek (2001)</ref>. While most studies adopt the IV approach, a good IV is notoriously hard to find. Empirically, researchers have taken the assigned class size, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krueger (1997)</ref>; school enrollment, Akerheilm (1995), <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Iacovou (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levin (2001)</ref>; and grade enrollment, Angrist and Lavy (1999); as instrumental variables for actual class size in either continuous or non-continuous forms.</p><p>Given the observational, i.e. non-experimental, nature of our data, we may begin by considering a conventional approach based on a linear structural equation model of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">y = α 0 + X i α 1 + X c α 2 + X s α 3 + Y δ + u (6.1) Y = β 0 + X i β 1 + X c β 2 + X s β 3 + Zγ + U. (6.2)</formula><p>The precise specification of the random components u and U will be delayed momentarily while we consider the observable variables. Math or language test scores are denoted by y i for student i in class c and school s; X i are individual i's characteristic variables including pupil's gender, IQ, socioeconomic status (SES), peer effects and risk level;<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> X c are class c's characteristic variables including teacher's experience;<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> X s are school s's characteristic variables, including the school denomination (public or nonpublic) only; Y is the covariate for class size and Z denotes the instrument for class size; u and U denote unobserved random components. As we have already noted, in the pure location shift form of the model the structural effect of class size is unambiguous: the parameter δ captures this effect and it may be interpreted as the shift in location of test scores induced by a change in class size that describes the effect at all quantiles of the academic performance distribution and at all quantiles of the class size distribution.</p><p>What is z, the instrumental variable for class size? The Dutch Ministry of Education imposed a new funding allocation rule during the time period of the first wave of the PRIMA survey. Each primary school reported weighted school enrollment (WSE) to the Ministry with weights determined by the socio-economic status of the enrolled students. Based on the value of this WSE, the Ministry allocated funding to each school and this funding determined how many teachers the school could hire. It is clear that this WSE variable is closely related to the actual class size but has no direct relation with student achievements conditional on characteristics. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levin (2001)</ref> we employ WSE as our instrumental variable for class size. This weighted school enrollment is calculated according to the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">(6.3) z i = 1.03 max{ n i j=1 s ij -.09n i , n i },</formula><p>where n i is the total school enrollment of school i and s ij is the weight determined by the socioeconomic status of each student j in school i. The variable s ij takes values {1.0, 1.25, 1.4, 1.7, 1.9} with 1 being the reference level and 1.9 being the worst family background. Based on this formula, we see that schools located in poorer neighborhoods will have more teachers. Since z i varies only between schools not within schools, a natural question may be, are we actually just using the school size as the IV? Preliminary tests indicate that although z i and school size are closely related, z i is quite distinct from school size. This is shown clearly by the top plot of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.1. where the upper conditional quantile functions of z i given school enrollment have different slopes. The scatter plot also reveals that when the school size is smaller than 100 or bigger than 500, z i is quite close to the school size, however, when the school size is between 100 and 500, z i can be significantly different from the school size. This can be well explained by the fact that smaller schools, typically located in small towns or villages where most families are more homogeneous, have z i that would be roughly similar to a scaled value of school size; for bigger schools, however, there are more varied family backgrounds. So z i may diverge substantially from school size. Another concern is: how is class size is related to school size? Is it true that bigger schools imply bigger class sizes? The answer is no. Though the class size has more variability in bigger schools, it does not increase with the school size. This can be seen clearly from the bottom plot in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.1.</p><p>Regarding the performance of z i , since our instrumental variable is at the school level, the more variation of class sizes is from "between schools", the better is the IV. We have estimated variance components for class size variable. The unconditional variance of class sizes is 41, the variance "between schools" is 28 and "within schools" is 13, so 70% of the variation of class sizes is "between schools". It should be emphasized that this does not imply that the variation comes from different school sizes! Furthermore, 83% of schools have only one class for each grade and the variation of class sizes within schools is due mainly to variation between grade levels. This is further supported by noting that in a decomposition of the "within school" variation the "between grades" variation in class size accounts for more than 92% of the within-school variation.</p><p>After some specification search we have selected a model in which class size is allowed to influence both the location and scale of the student performance distribution. Explicitly, we will assume that, u i = (λν i2 + ν 1i )(Y i ξ + 1) and U i = ν 2i , where ν 1 and ν 2 are independent of one another and iid over individuals. We will consider both weighted average derivative and control variate methods of estimation. As we have shown above, when the model is correctly specified both methods yield consistent estimators with the latter being more efficient. Substituting for ν 2 in the y i equation The top plot indicates that the weighted school enrollment variable, z, used as an instrument, is significantly different from the school size; the middle plot shows that class sizes are not strongly related to school sizes. The bottom plot shows that there is some heteroscedasticity in the relationship between class size and the WSE instrumental variable, the two solid lines represent the 0.75 and 0.90 quantiles.</p><p>yields a rather complicated form of what we have called the hyrid structural equation that is estimated in the weighted average derivative approach; it involves the location shift effects of the original specification plus a quadratic term in Y i and interactions of Y i with the other exogonous variables including z i . In the case of the control variate estimator the situation is considerably simpler: the estimate ν2 (τ 2 ) is computed in the first stage, and then it is included along with its interaction with Y i as additional covariates in the τ 1 quantile regression of the first y i equation. In large samples like ours we would expect both estimators would produce similar results, provided that the model was correctly specified. When the model is misspecified, the weighted average derivative method is clearly preferable, the control variate method will be used primarly for checking the credibility of the specified structural model. We will focus on the estimation of the structural class size effect. It should be emphasized that peer effects are also an very important influence on student performance. Moreover, since peer effects and class size effects are highly interconnected, their interaction should also be carefully explored. The endogeneity of peer effects makes this inquiry particularly challenging, but it is especially important from a policy standpoint to explore the distributional consequences of peer effects. We plan to address this issue in subsequent work. 6.4. Empirical Analysis. Before considering the structural estimation of the model we briefly describe some preliminary quantile regression results based on treating class size as exogonous. These results are illustrated in Figures 6.2 and 6.3 for language and math performance, respectively. Considering the class size effect first. The plots suggest that class size effects are roughly similar for math and language performance: both are significant, both are downward sloping, indicating that while class size reductions are beneficial to all students they are more beneficial to better students conditional on the other covariates. The plots also suggest that peer effects are quite important especially for math, although considerable caution is required in the interpretation of these effects. Individual student characteristics are also quite interesting. Girls appear to be clearly disadvantaged in math, but exhibit a modest advantage in language. The "at risk" variable has a large impact, suggesting that students' attitude and behavior towards school work is crucial for their scholastic performance, although again, exogoneity may be controversial. As expected, family background plays an important role in students' academic performance, especially in language. Socio-economic status has a significantly positive effect across all quantiles of students achievement distribution and the effect increases as we move to higher quantiles of student achievement. IQ has the expected positive effect on students achievement with the magnitude of this effect larger on the math scores than on the language scores. Interestingly, more experienced teachers have no significant impact on language performance, but do seem to have a desirable effect on the upper quantiles of math performance. A public versus parochial school effect on student attainment is not distinguishable across the quantiles considered.</p><p>We now turn to the estimation of the class size effect in our structural framework. A concise visual summary of the structural estimates of the class size effect on language and math scores is provided in Figures 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>   the τ 2 effect from the weighted average derivative estimate of the δ(τ 1 , τ 2 ) estimate of the structural class size effect. In the right panel we present δ(τ 1 , τ 2 ). The two stage least squares estimate of the class size effect is -0.07 with a standard error of 0.20, a finding consistent with many other unsuccessful attempts to discern a significant effect of class size. However, our estimates of the mean quantile treatment effect of class size in the middle panel reveals a somewhat more nuanced view. Both math and language plots show a positive effect of around 0. at the lower quantiles of test scores, and negative effects at the upper quantiles. In such circumstances it is not surprising that averaging over both quantile dimensions yields a result that is statistically negligible.</p><p>To examine the structural estimates more closely we plot in Figures 6.6 and 6.7 cross-sectional slices of the foregoing perspective plots. Superimposed on these plots is a .90 (pointwise) confidence band. To contrast the weighted average derivative approach and the control variate method we illustrate both estimates in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.6 for language performance and in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.7 for math. The similarity of the WAD and CV estimates provides some support for the model specification. We summarize our findings briefly as follows:</p><p>• The class size effect on language scores: -For weaker students the plots indicate that bigger classes are better.</p><p>-For near median students class size effects are not significant.</p><p>-For better students smaller classes appear marginally better.</p><p>• The class size effect on math scores:</p><p>-For weaker students smaller classes are better -For the average and good students the class size effect is not significant. Our finding that class size has an insignificant influence on median performance in language and math is quite consistent with previous literature indicating similarly insignificant conditional mean effects. However, especially in the case of language performance, we find that one should interpret findings of insignificant mean effects with considerable caution since it appears that they arise from averaging significant benefits from reductions in class size for good students and significant benefits from increases in class size for poorer students.</p><p>We would again stress the point that changes in class sizes per se cannot produce academic gains, but in combination with other instructional practices and instituational arrangements such changes may have benefits. By providing a more nuanced view of the apparently heterogeneous effects of class size, structural methods based on quantile regression may be able to constructively contribute to the policy debate on these important issues.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 1.
