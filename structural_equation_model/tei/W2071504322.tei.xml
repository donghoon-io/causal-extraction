<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper attempts to study the impact of customer satisfaction and the Chinese e-retailers competitiveness using quality factors. Two conceptual models have been proposed to analyze the impact of Chinese customer satisfaction and competitiveness. Using empirical survey from young population who use quite extensively online purchase, this study, with the support of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) identifies the importance of reliability in service quality and purchasing experience in e-service quality as dominant customer satisfaction factors. Furthermore, this study suggests that Chinese e-retailers to be competitive have to focus more on logistics and delivery of products compared to other intangible service quality factors. The outcome of the study would be highly beneficial to the Chinese electronic retailers to fine tune their strategy to satisfy the growing demand. This study would also guide third party logistics to be more competitive in future. Furthermore, this study can supplement government policy makers to regulate the growing volatile market.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Electronic retailing (e-retailing) is a popular channel for selling goods in China <ref type="bibr">(CNNIC, 2011)</ref>. Popular e-retailers in China include Taobao Marketplace (Customer-to-Customer electronic platform), T-mall.com (a Business-to-Customer electronic platform), 360buy (Business-to-Customer electronic platform), Amazon.cn (Business-to-Customer electronic platform) and Dangdang.com (Business-to-Customer electronic platform).</p><p>A recent report by Goodman Group suggests that the population for online purchasing worldwide is growing at a tremendous rate i.e. 15% to 20% per annum <ref type="bibr">(Goodman report, 2012)</ref>. However the growth rate is highly exponential in China and it is around 75% per annum. There are 150 million Internet users in China who are spending around USD 200 to USD 250 per year. The e-retailing market worth is going to be USD 305 billion during 2015. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Collier and Bienstock (2003)</ref> pointed out that e-retailing is not only selling the product through online but also offering service which is considered to be vital process and it contains both tangible and intangible aspects. The quality of the online shopping process has been found to influence customers' purchase decisions, customer satisfaction, logistics selection choice and loyalty to e-retailing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fassnacht and Koese, 2006)</ref>. Hence, to keep competitiveness, e-retailers should not only provide superior goods, but also offer "a better purchasing environment, better personalization choice, and greater customer control" and make sure that the online purchase process is convenient and efficient for customers.</p><p>Firstly, measuring the quality of electronic service (intangible) is a paramount task for proactive e-retailers in future to satisfy the demanding customers. Scholars have proposed service quality models to measure customer satisfaction in physical service and to the best of our knowledge there are very few studies available to measure customer satisfaction with both electronic service quality (e-service quality) and service quality on buyer perspective and its role to improve competitiveness. Our paper measures customer satisfaction index using American Customer satisfaction Index (ACSI) model. Furthermore, there are few studies specifically addressed the customer satisfaction issues related to e-retailing in China.</p><p>On the other hand from competitive point of view, the other predominant aspect which plays a vital role in the e-service process is how the e-retailers are able to deliver their products to the customers (tangible service). Third party logistics service providers are the important driver in this aspect <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al, 2008)</ref>. In famous Chinese e-retailors, customers can choose a particular third party logistics provider from a wide range of choices. Thus, measuring the service quality of third party logistics service providers is measuring the service quality of eretailing in China. Hence, our contributions in this paper are to address the following research objectives:</p><p>• To capture customer satisfaction in the Chinese e-retailing.</p><p>• To develop a structural equation model with quality factors (service quality and eservice quality) that have direct or causal relationship with customer satisfaction and competitiveness of the Chinese e-retailers.</p><p>• To suggest influencing quality factors and choice of logistics selection that drives the competitiveness of the Chinese e-retailers. This paper is organized as follows Section 2 discusses factors governing e-retailing with respect to retailer and customer perspectives. Section 3 narrates the customer satisfaction index in general and the Chinese context in particular. Section 4 summarizes the studies that relate customer satisfaction with quality factors. Section 5 proposes two conceptual models to understand the role of quality factors in customer satisfaction and e-retailer competitiveness.</p><p>Section 6 delineates structural equation modeling approach used in the current context under research methodology. Section 7 discusses the major findings of this study. Finally section 8 summarizes major outcome, limitations and future scope in conclusion section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">E-retailing</head><p>E-retailing made the young generation passionate because they feel the benefits such as convenience, time saving, a good deal of product information, door to door services and 24-7services <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al, 2008)</ref>. The online purchase process involves three stages which are presales stage, online sales stage and post-sales stage. Both customer and e-retailers would have different roles and objectives at different stages. In the pre-sales stage, e-retailers attempt to attract consumers by offering economical products with great service while customers have to make a decision to choose a particular e-retailer. During the online sales stage, customers would do online purchasing with e-retailers providing ease of use and security. In the postsales phase, e-retailers have to deliver the products safely and to support customers if there are any issues or problems with respect to products <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bames and Vidgen, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">E-retailers competing factors</head><p>High quality service at a low price, fast delivery of goods combined with enhanced website performance retains customers in e-retailing <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Shankar et al, 2003)</ref>. In addition to these factors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jarvenpaa and Todd (1997)</ref> in their study have reported a few more factors which capture customer attitudes and shopping intention. These factors include product characteristics (such as variety, quality and price), shopping experience (such as effective, convenience and pleasure), customer service (such as responsiveness, assurance, reliability, tangibility and intangibility), and consumer risks (such as social risk, economic risk, performance risk, privacy risk and policy risk). Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lohse and Spiller (1998)</ref> endorsed that e-retailers to be successful should focus on goods they sell (such as quantity of products, goods variety, products' quality, and price of goods),e-service (including frequently asked questions -FAQs, e-retailers' credit and after sale service), marketing promotion (such as sales performance, advertising investment and special promotions),shopping convenience (such as stores' management and arrangement), checkout method (such as availability of e-payment methods and ease of e-payment moment) and e-retailers' websites navigation (such as ease of use e-menus and search guidance) as the key features. Few emphasized the importance of the Internet specifically on service quality, system quality, information quality, learning capability, playfulness, and system use and marketing <ref type="bibr">(Liu and Arnett, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Customer attractive factors</head><p>From customers' perspective, e-retailer' reputation, other customers' comments or feedbacks and pre-and post-sales services are three major elements which predict the level of security and reliability of the online purchasing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Szymanski and Hise, 2000)</ref>. As a very important part in e-retailing, e-retailer' level of service quality directly affects consumer online purchasing behaviors, such as e-retailer selection and e-loyalty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lee and Lim (2005)</ref> reported that shopping online is a complex process and it includes web navigation, searching for information, information transactions, delivery, customer interaction, checkout, and so on.</p><p>However, it is difficult for customers to evaluate the details of each independent process.</p><p>They are only able to perceive from the consequences of the overall service <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Riel et al., 2001)</ref>. In general, the experience of purchasing online include the online consumers' general emotional responses and sensation for acting with their whole online shopping process, and will finally influence online customers' purchasing decision making. Effecting online purchasing decisions include performance and reputation of e-retailers, pre-and post-sales services, other buyers' evidence or feedbacks, delivery speed, quality and price of products, brand building <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Koufaris, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Szmanski and Hise (2000)</ref> point out that the e-satisfaction as the result of online customers' perceptions of online purchasing process includes online shopping time and ease of browsing, marketing promotion with regard to product, quantity and quality information of products; website design which refers to clean screens, ease of search paths and clear introductions; and financial security. In addition, e-retailer image is another serious element in the customer purchasing decision making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Nevin and Houston, 1980)</ref>. While, under an ecommerce environment, the features of electronic retailers (e-retailers) image is quite different with the characteristics of a real retail store image <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jahng et al, 2000)</ref>. Many research studies have been carried out to understand the characteristics of web-based eretailing system, besides environment of physical retail store, level of service quality, and quality of goods. <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. (2000)</ref> identified the key factor of e-retailing image is website design. In their study, they found that a well-designed website would attract much more regular customers and make customers a positive attitude toward the e-retailers and their products and service. The study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Imrie et al. (2002)</ref> show that quality of e-service quality can bring positive benefits, such as customer retention and market growth.</p><p>Overall e-retailers aim to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty to their stores by offering competitive advantages, such as a well-design and ease of use website, convenience purchasing, variety of product information, speedy delivery and competitive pricing <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Verhoef &amp; Langerak, 2001)</ref>. Electronic retailers believe customer satisfaction always brings great results such as customer retention, positive word of mouth, and increased profit <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Zeithaml et al., 2002)</ref>. Thus, it is important for electronic retailers, to meet customer requirements and to make effort in each aspect in effecting customer satisfaction in the B2C e-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buzzell &amp; Gale, 1987)</ref>. Furthermore, many scholars agree that total service quality of electronic retailers is essential to customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Janda et al., 2002)</ref>. However, there is very limited empirical research of customer satisfaction and e-service quality in e-retailing in the context of China.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Customer satisfaction index</head><p>Oliver (1980) defined the customer satisfaction as customers' evaluations of a product or service with regard to their needs and expectations. Marketing researchers have paid more attention towards measurement of service quality to understand customer satisfaction. Both researchers and practitioners give more weightage to customer satisfaction, because, a high degree of customer satisfaction can lead to customer retention and enhance companies' market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Yuksel and Yuksel, 2002)</ref>.In essence, e-retailing companies' managers need to know how to treat customer and to understand which factors (both tangible and intangible) affect customer satisfaction towards e-service quality and finally willing to return to purchase from their company <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hansemark and Albinsson, 2004)</ref>.Satisfaction is an emotional reaction to the difference between what customer's expectation and what they receive <ref type="bibr">(Zineldin, 2000)</ref>. In e-retailing commerce, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson and Srinivasan (2003)</ref> describe electronic satisfaction as "the contentment of the customer with respect to his or her prior purchasing experience with a given electronic commerce firm". Prior researches have also indicated that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Pont and McQuilken, 2005)</ref>. In addition to that <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gommans et al. (2001)</ref> proposed that e-loyalty comprises of brand value, trust and security, website and technology, and customer service. In a highly competitive e-commerce market, electronic retailers need to create great service quality to target customers and oversatisfy them to retain them <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Tan and Pawitra, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>3.1 Customer satisfaction index <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Garver et al. (2002)</ref> argue that to strengthen competitive advantage of companies, e-retailing managers should better understand their customers, and provide highest quality products or effective services. According to market orientation and customer satisfaction researches show that there is a direct relationship between customer satisfaction and e-stores' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson and Srinivasan, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, under the e-retailing commerce environment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mckinney et al. (2002)</ref> point out that online retailers have to know how to satisfy customers, because it will assist them to keep develop and get market share. Many studies proposed different models to measure the degree of customer satisfaction and they are European Customer satisfaction Index (ECSI), Sweden customer satisfaction model index (SCSB), and American customer satisfaction index (ASCI). ASCI model is used quite extensively by researchers 3.2 Chinese customer satisfaction study <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kim and Stoel (2004)</ref> emphasized that online customers' needs greatest satisfaction during online purchasing process, or else they will switch to another e-retailer. A survey done by CNNIC (2011) reported that only 3.5 percent Chinese online customers are totally satisfied with online shopping process. Customer dissatisfaction will have negative effects and hence Chinese e-retailers have to pay their fullest attention to attract Chinese customers. In general Chinese customers are more sensitive to price during online purchase than quality until now whereas recent studies state that they started to pay attention towards quality than price due to their improved living standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lu, 2005)</ref>. Compared with western countries, China greatly differs in commerce culture, logistic industry and credit building system. Chinese commerce culture contains eastern traditional culture system, and the level of logistics in China is far below than developed countries. However, there is not well building of credit system in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gentry, 1982)</ref>. Previous research identified that in different country context that culture, logistics and credit system are three major factors that decides customer behavior and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(David, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sharma et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gentry, 1982)</ref>.However, very few studies have researched Chinese e-retailing online shopping customer satisfaction. This motivated us to study the influencing tangible and intangible factors of online customer satisfaction and competitiveness of e-retailers. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summaries various studies carried out to understand the Chinese customer satisfaction. We found only four studies related to e-commerce or online shopping in the Chinese context. However, their focus is towards web quality service and overall analysis of contributing factors. Out of the four studies one study used SEM to model the web quality service. To best of our knowledge there is no specific study which takes into account both tangible and intangible aspects to measure e-retailing e-service quality and customer satisfaction. Similarly it's very hard to find the relationship between tangible and intangible factors and its relationship with competitiveness of e-retailer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Electronic service quality and customer satisfaction</head><p>Service quality is usually expressed as a function of customers' expectations of the service to be provided (based upon their previous experience, the organizations image, the price of the service) compared to their perceptions of the real service experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gronroos, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berry et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Johnston and Heineke, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Parasuraman et al. (1988)</ref> state the concept of perceptions is the consumer's judgment of the service provider's performance. However, the service performance gap between the introduction of service and the real delivery is bigger than past experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chenet et al., 2000)</ref>. The SERVQUAL model is often used to measure service quality. It contains five dimensions, which are tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Parasuraman et al., 1994)</ref>. Structural equation models (SEM) are also used to analyze relationships among variables in marketing and consumer research <ref type="bibr">(Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schumacker and Lomax, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Batista-Foguet and Coenders, 2000)</ref>. A study by Bureau of transport and communications economics stated that the empirical studies are essential to understand e-service quality and its importance among young generation (Bureau of transport and communications economics, 1994). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chang and Yeh (2002)</ref> stated that it's hard to describe and measure e-service quality in e-retailing because of its heterogeneity, intangibility, and inseparability. Previous studies on service quality related to the internet suggested that large amount of time frame is needed to measure the interaction of the online customers and the website design but have ignored the e-service quality which is more important than just the reaction of a consumer to website <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yoo and Donthu, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, they also miss other factors such as outcome quality and recovery. These two have much affection on perceptions of quality of online purchasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Pakdil and Harwood, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Long back, a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kuei (1998)</ref> recognized the importance of e-service quality as an important factor for e-retailers sustainable competitive advantage. A recent study of online shopping failures reported that consumers considered the problem in delivery service as the most frequently happening problem in online purchasing process <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2008)</ref>. On the one hand, consumers cared about web site interactivity (it is easy for them to one click away to switch to another e-retailing company.); on the other hand, they concerned about desired product or service quality. In addition to that, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Holloway and Beatty (2003)</ref> found that majority of consumers were dissatisfied with delivery speed and complaint solving attitudes, and this dissatisfaction affected intentions to return to an e-retailing company.</p><p>One of the first and most widely used instruments (SERVQUAL Model) to measure service quality was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Parasuraman et al. (1988)</ref>. Later it has been extended to measure eservice quality (e-SQ). <ref type="bibr">Zeithamal et al. (2002)</ref> found that ease of navigation, flexibility, efficiency and security to be added in addition to SERVQUAL model to measure e-service quality. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the indicators of e-SQ. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zeithaml et al. (2002)</ref> suggested 11 dimensions</p><p>to measure e-SQ. However, it has been refined later to six and they are efficiency, system availability, fulfillment, privacy, compensation and contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref>. Gefen ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) categorized e-service quality dimensions into tangibles; a combined dimension of responsiveness, reliability and assurance; and empathy. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Li et al. (2002)</ref> detailed the dimensions of e-service quality as reliability, responsiveness, integration of communication, assurance and quality of communication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wolfinbarger and Gilly (2003)</ref> proposed an e-SQ scale initially referred as .comQ, which has been modified later to eTailQ. Tangible, Combine Responsiveness, reliability and assurance, Empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wolfinbarger &amp; Gilly (2003)</ref> Web site design, processing speed, aesthetic design, interactive responsiveness, tangibles <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Collier &amp; Bienstock, (2003)</ref> Process quality (privacy, design, information accuracy, ease of use, functionality), Outcome quality (order timeliness, order accuracy, order condition), Recovery quality (interactive fairness, procedural fairness, outcome fairness) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Li et al. (2002)</ref> Reliability, Responsiveness, Integration of communication, Assurance, Quality of information, Empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Parasuraman et al. 2005</ref> e-S-QUAL and e-Recs-QUAL (Efficiency, system availability, fulfillment, privacy, compensation, contact) <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. (2008)</ref> Information search, purchase stage, post-purchase stage, alternative evaluation stage Sheng <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">&amp; Liu, (2010)</ref> Efficiency, requirement, fulfillment, accessibility and privacy Based on the above it is evident that dimensions of e-SQ contains both service quality and eservice quality factors and the following sections in detail about the details of both quality and e-service quality factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">e-Service Quality factors</head><p>A review of related literature revealed various studies aimed at identifying determinant factors of customer satisfaction in electronic commerce B2C and which also conclude that tangibility affects the perceived quality of virtual supply, thus stressing its academic and professional importance. After the review of previous works, it observed that, in generic terms, design refers to usability (ease of navigation), aesthetic aspects of the web site, and page download speed. However, there is a certain overlap between design, reliability of the service and web site content. Few other e-service quality factors are personalization option, customer loyalty, customer control, and purchasing experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yoo &amp; Donthu, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jun et al, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lee and Lim, 2005)</ref>. There is no previous study to analyze intangibility aspects such as purchasing experience and customer control with customer satisfaction.  <ref type="formula">2004</ref>); <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lee and Lim (2005)</ref> Customer control Customer experience about preferred e-retailers website, complaints re-address mechanism, contact information with customer service centre</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Service Quality factors</head><p>The main feature distinguishes services from goods is intangibility aspect: services are subjects, and products are objects. Thus, e-retailing companies' image and credit will affect online customers' satisfaction degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fizsimons and Fizsimons, 2001)</ref>. Thus, few have stressed more to reliability and responsiveness of e-retailers as an important aspect than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Long and McMellon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> describe the usage of the two important factors among the other SERVQUAL factors that include reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy factors to measure the service quality. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Responsive ness</head><p>Mainly refers to the quality of time, from the client to set the length of time to complete the order; willingness to help customers and provide promote service; related service information can easily obtained; employees can promptly response to your requests even when they are busy; employees can promptly serve you.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conceptual models</head><p>In previous studies, there are limited researches about customer satisfaction in e-retailing, especially in China. There are few studies about using SERVQUAL to analyze online customer satisfaction on e-service quality in the retailing industry in China. SERVQUAL instrument designed for use in broad set of service business and provides only a basic skeleton through its expectations/perceptions format and can be considered to measure customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Joo and Sohn, 2008)</ref>. Hence, this study using SERVQUAL basic skeleton investigates the Chinese e-retailing industry's service quality, e-service quality and customer satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">SQ and e-SQ on customer satisfaction</head><p>Based on ACSI, this paper proposes a new model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) to analyze the customer satisfaction of Chinese e-retailing. This study considers the variables of customer expectations, perceived value and customer loyalty in ACSI. According to previous studies, there are few researches about effect of e-service quality and service quality on customer satisfaction. This study relates e-service quality and service quality with aspect customer satisfaction. It also predicts both e-service quality and service quality are positively related to customer satisfaction (H1 and H2). is not a problem in logistics service industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wang et al., 2008)</ref>. The second key difference is the services quality of both west and east 3 rd party logistics service providers. There are some researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hong &amp; Liu, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Zhou et al., 2008)</ref> established that to compare with 3PL service providers in the USA and other developed countries, it shows that China local logistics service providers mainly stress on basic or traditional business such as transportation and warehousing, rather than add value to consumers by offering additional service, high service quality, and integration supply chain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Langley et al. (2006)</ref> established that 3 rd party logistics users in China consider that the quality of 3 rd party logistics service providers' services are more significant than delivery price when they decide to choose a 3 rd party logistics service provider.</p><p>Thus, to improve online customers' purchasing experience, some electronic retailers, like 360buy, Amazon.cn, and dangdang.com try to build their own logistics systems. The first reason is that especially in rural areas, delivery speed and delivery service quality has been a big problem for the e-retail stores development. Therefore, controlling 3 rd party logistic partners' delivery speed and responsiveness is a serious issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Langley et al., 2006)</ref>. The second reason is that foreign logistic providers' services are too expensive for both e-retailers and online customers. Wholly-owned delivery companies are found to cover wide areas at speedy delivery, but it cost more financial resources and effort than using 3 rd party logistics service. Therefore, later online retailers prefer to cooperate with private 3 rd party logistics (3PL) service providers for express to assist with their own delivery services. And online customers would like to choose 3 rd party logistics, because it cost less and delivery speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hong &amp; Liu, 2007)</ref>. In China, the major 3 rd party logistics service providers are STO, ZTO, YT, YUNDA, TTK, and SF. The EMS, a local-owned postal service company covers ninety percent of fields of China <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(EMS, 2009)</ref>. So, for many rural areas, EMS postal service is used frequently. While, if the place other 3 rd party logistic service providers can deliver, people will seldom choosing used EMS, unless to send some official documents. The reason is that: EMS' service is more expensive than other local third party logistics service companies. It is obvious that deliveries to rural place might cause extra charges needs e-retailers or online buyers to pay. Performance of foreign express companies such as FedEx and DHL offer great quality services but that are more expensive than local third party logistics service providers, so it has fewer users than 3 rd party logistics service providers in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goh &amp; Ling, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Chinese e-retailers competitiveness depends mostly on options they have for logistics selection (H3) and quality factors (H4) as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Analysis of SEM</head><p>In order to estimate the proposed two SEM models, a questionnaire regarding the measurement variables was distributed in a sino-foreign university in China. This questionnaire contains three parts. Firstly, it captures some general demographic information, such as gender, age, grade, and average monthly expense. Next, the second part measures the five latent constructs for the customer satisfaction model which are customer satisfaction, customer control, purchasing experience, reliability and responsiveness. Finally, the third part measures the additional latent constructs for the competitiveness model which are logistics selection and competitiveness. All items used to measure latent constructs are scored against a scale of 1-to-5, with 5 indicating a complete satisfaction. The specific survey questionnaire is provided in Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Sampling and data collection</head><p>The subjects of questionnaires in this research are the students of a sino-foreign university in China, and they all have a lot of online purchasing experience. The reasons of using university students are that university students are skillful in operating computers and have limited living expenses <ref type="bibr">(Barnes &amp; Vidgen, 2002)</ref>. Therefore, most of them are active online shoppers and gain enough online purchasing experience. Consequently, this paper chooses the university students who were from different provinces in China as the targeted subjects to be the representative of online purchasing customers in China. After few weeks, we received 323 feedbacks. Therefore we had a response rate of 23.2%. The response rate is similar to the previous empirical study which has 24.8% in the Chinese context <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Tian, 2010)</ref>. However, due to the missing data or other errors, we had 162 valid respondents. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows the demographic results of these respondents. We had slightly more females than males which is consistent with the gender ratio of the university. Most of respondents are aged between 22-27 and they spend about 1500-2000 Non-response bias was assessed by examining the differences in the mean scores of certain items between firms that responded to the survey and firms that did not. For lack of comparable statistics from non-responding firms, t-tests were used to test the response bias between early and late wave returned surveys, late wave respondents being treated as a proxy for non-respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Armstrong and Overton, 1977)</ref>. In this study, 120 useable responses were received in the early mailing wave and 42 in the late wave. The mean differences between the two groups with respect to the gender, age, grade and average monthly expense were tested using an unpaired t-test. No significant differences were observed at the 0.05 level, indicating no systematic bias between the two groups. These analyses indicate that the study has no major non-response bias problems, and the final sample of 162 firms can be considered as representative of the population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Structural equation modeling approach</head><p>During early nineties Fornell (1992) developed an SEM approach to estimate the ASCI. Later on use of SEM has become popular for customer satisfaction in different domains that include examination of the relationship between flexible IT infrastructure and competitive advantage, network performance on customer satisfaction and loyalty in Korean high speed internet service, IS performance in manufacturing firms and technology commercialization success index <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Shin et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Kim et al., 2007)</ref>.

Based on its applicability, we use structural equation modeling (SEM) for investigating the two proposed research models in Chinese e-retailing. SEM follows a two steps approach constructing the measurement model and testing the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing 1988)</ref>. This study employs the SPSS 20 package because it can be used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and it includes the Amos 20 for measuring the structural equation models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Measurement Model -validity and reliability</head><p>Validity is the extent to which a particular item relates to other items consistent with theoretically derived hypotheses concerning the variables that are being measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campbell and Fiske, 1959)</ref>. In this paper, exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine the number of constructs and the loadings of items on the corresponding construct. The results of exploratory factor analysis of the two models were shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6 respectively.</ref> It is to test the convergent validity and discriminant validity of latent variables. Convergent validity refers to the degree to which a measure is correlated with other measures that it is theoretically predicted to correlate with. It was assessed by checking loadings to see whether the items measuring the same construct correlate highly among themselves. Discriminant validity describes the degree to which the operationalization does not correlate with other operationalization's that it theoretically should not be correlated with. It was assessed by checking whether the items loaded more strongly on their intended construct rather than other constructs. Furthermore, any item with a factor loading smaller than 0.35 was not considered for further analysis as it did not measure a specific construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hair et al., 2006)</ref>. Based on these criteria, several items were dropped. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> and 8 shows the correlations between constructs, composite reliability, Cronbach's Alpha and the average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct. AVE is utilized to assess the discriminant validity, the square root of which should be larger than the correlations between constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chin, 1998)</ref>. The results showed that all items meet the requirement.</p><p>The reliability or internal consistency was assessed through Cronbach's alpha coefficient and composite reliability. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nunally (1978)</ref>, a value greater than 0.70 showed good reliability for newly developed constructs. Measurement scales for all constructs were greater than 0.70, which means all of them had adequate reliability (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> and<ref type="table">8</ref>). The results</p><p>show that composite reliability values for all constructs are greater than 0.70, which indicate good internal consistency (see Table <ref type="table">8</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>)  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the AMOS result of the structural equation model on customer satisfaction. Both H1 and H2 are supported by our set of data. Both e-service quality and service quality are positively related to customer satisfaction. The coefficient between e-service quality and customer satisfaction is significant with a value of 0.92 (p&lt;0.001). It means that high eservice quality is strongly associated with high customer's satisfaction. The coefficient between service quality and customer satisfaction is also significant with a value of 0.17 (p&lt;0.01). This means that high service quality is also associated with high customer's satisfaction. Moreover, the second-order latent variable model indicates that e-service quality is constructed only by purchasing experience (with a coefficient value of 0.22 and p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Customer control was not supported to formulate e-service quality, with a coefficient value of -0.04. As for the service quality, both reliability and responsibility are supported to forming the e-service quality (coefficient value of 0.99 and 0.71 respectively). and H4 are supported. The coefficient between logistics selection and competitiveness is significant with a value of 0.71 (p&lt;0.001). This indicates that logistics options provided by the e-retailer and the choice of customer have more influence on the competitiveness of the Chinese e-retailer. Similarly co-efficient between quality and competitiveness is also found to be significant with a value of 0.6 (p&lt;0.001). In the case of second order latent variable purchasing experience directly dominates (0.46 with p&lt;0.001) the construction of quality factors whereas reliability indirectly dominates (-0.46 with p&lt;0.001) the quality constructs.</p><p>The second order latent variable results indicate reliability is important and the Chinese customers never agree to pay more or settle at higher level of reliability in order to increase quality. Our study and SEM analysis reveals that customer satisfaction of the products purchased through Chinese e-retailers is influenced by both service quality and e-service quality factors.</p><note type="other">Purchasing Experience Customer Control Reliability Responsiv eness Eservice Quality Service Quality Customer Satisfaction</note><p>Our findings are contrary to the previous study which identified service quality has no impact on customer satisfaction compared to information quality and system quality in web based customer support system <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">( Joo and Sohn, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Negash et al., 2003)</ref>. In service quality we found both reliability and responsiveness are significant with respect to customer satisfaction.</p><p>Our findings are in line with <ref type="bibr">Selnes and Gonhaug (2000)</ref> argument that high reliability will have a strong positive effect on satisfaction. It is interesting to note that Chinese customers are paying more attention towards purchasing experience than customer control or price of the product. Since the Chinese online customers are consciousness towards price. Nowadays, Chinese customers expect core values, personalized care with improved products or service value rather than price to buy products through e-retailers. This finding is along the lines of previous study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ueltschy et al. (2009)</ref>  to focus more on both e-service and service quality factors such as purchasing experience, reliability and responsiveness which ultimately lead to improved customer satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Competitiveness</head><p>E-retailers are learning to meet customers' needs and provide high quality products and service. Customers demand more through online shopping and the products they buy depend on improved product varieties then they offer and additional services. It is obvious through our study that the tie-up the e-retailers going to have with the best logistics firms is a serious concern for their competitiveness. Because there were few reports which suggest that Chinese logistics operational efficiency is declining due to inadequate transportation and information technology infrastructures, local protection regulations and beaurocracy, shortage of quality logistics managers and lack of awareness of logistics concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Zhou et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lau and Zhang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Tian et al., 2010)</ref>. Meanwhile, logistic service providers are trying to enhance their service coverage and service quality which makes e-retailers to improve their marketing skills. This improvement lead to more customer satisfaction and positive market share growths in the e-retailing industry. Furthermore from our analysis it is obvious that customers are more cautious in selecting logistics service providers with due importance towards quality and price which conveys to e-retailer to be competitive and to focus more on options available to customers to pick a popular logistics service providers To sum up, e-retailers will provide more and more personalized care and increase the products or service value to customers during online purchase. In due course, Chinese online customers hope to gain more advantages from online purchasing in the coming years. When it becomes part of customers' lifestyle, more unique personal needs will arise. Therefore, the risk of online shopping can be reduced and this shows a positive way to the market growth in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>This study captures Chinese e-Retailing on both customer and e-retailer perspectives. The study proposes two structural equation models to capture the role of service quality, e-service quality and selection of logistics providers on customer satisfaction and e-retailers competitiveness. The study empirically validates the models using a representative Chinese sample of young population who are more active in online shopping. The major findings of the study are purchasing experience of e-service quality, reliability and responsiveness of service quality drives Chinese customer satisfaction. To be competitive Chinese e-retailers should have good connections with top logistics service providers. Selections of logistics providers have a significant impact on competitiveness along with quality factors such as purchasing experience and reliability. The study is more focused towards electronics products and the results may vary if we consider different products. Furthermore the results are biased towards young population who are the active online users and their views will not be similar to other age groups. The sample is dominated by representation from single Chinese province and likely the inference may not be similar to other provinces. Future research can take into account the limitations in terms of sample and product. In addition to that they can propose a combined single model which has both customer satisfaction and competitiveness perspectives and find the influence of factors other than logistics selection and quality.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Quality factors on customer satisfaction (Conceptual measurement model)</figDesc></figure>
