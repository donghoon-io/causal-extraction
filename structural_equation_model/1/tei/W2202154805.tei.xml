<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality, and may thus produce biased parameter estimates as a result of this limitation. Before presenting these two sources, it is important to differentiate substantive multidimensionality, which refers to instruments that have been specifically designed to assess multiple dimensions with separate items tapping into each of these dimensions, and psychometric multidimensionality, which refers to the idea that the items forming an instrument may be associated with more than one source of true score variance (i.e., be associated with more than one content area). In many multidimensional instruments, two sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality are likely to be present and related to: (a) the hierarchical nature of the constructs being assessed whereby all items may be expected to present a significant level of association with their own subscales (e.g., peer self-concept, verbal intelligence, or attention difficulties), as well as hierarchically-superior constructs (e.g., global self-esteem, global intelligence, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders); (b) the fallible nature of indicators typically used to measure psychological and educational constructs, which tends to be reinforced in instruments assessing conceptually-related and partially overlapping domains (i.e., such as peer and parent self-concepts, verbal intelligence and memory, or attention difficulty and impulsivity). We focus on these two sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality whereby items may present associations with multiple hierarchically-superior or substantively-related constructs. Additionally, as shown in our first study, construct-irrelevant psychometric multidimensionality (due to item wording, method effects, etc.) may also be present and can easily be controlled through the inclusion of method factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Eid et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marsh, Scalas, &amp; Nagengast, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychometric Multidimensionality due to the Co-Existence of Global and Specific Constructs</head><p>A first source of psychometric multidimensionality is related to the possibility that the items used to assess the multiple dimensions included in an instrument could reflect multiple hierarchicallyorganized constructs: Their own specific subscale, as well as more global constructs. A classical solution to this issue is provided by hierarchical (i.e., higher-order) CFA. In hierarchical CFA, each item is specified as loading on its specific subscale (a first-order factor), and each first-order factor is specified as loading on a higher-order factor (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rindskopf &amp; Rose, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Bifactor models provide an alternative to hierarchical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chen, West, &amp; Sousa, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 4 Holzinger &amp; Swineford, 1937;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Reise, Moore, &amp; Haviland, 2010)</ref>. For illustrative purposes, an ICM-CFA, a hierarchical-CFA, and a bifactor-CFA model are presented on the left side of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. A bifactor model is based on the assumption that a f-factor solution exists for a set of n items with one Global (G) factor and f-1 Specific (S) factors (also called group factors). The items' loadings on the G-factor and on one of f-1 substantive S-factors are estimated while other loadings are constrained to be zero; although these models may also incorporate additional method factors. All factors are set to be orthogonal (i.e., the correlations between the S-factors and between the S-factors and the G-factor are all constrained to be zero). This model partitions the total covariance among the items into a G component underlying all items, and f-1 S components explaining the residual covariance not explained by the G-factor. Bifactor models are well established in research on intelligence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Holzinger &amp; Swineford, 1937;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gignac &amp; Watkins, 2013)</ref>, and have also been successfully applied to noncognitive constructs such as quality of life (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Reise, Morizot, &amp; Hays, 2007)</ref>, attention disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Caci, Morin, &amp; Tran, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Morin, Tran, &amp; Caci, 2013)</ref>, or mood and anxiety disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gignac, Palmer, &amp; Stough, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Simms, Grös, Watson, &amp; O'Hara, 2008)</ref>. A bifactor model directly tests whether a global construct, reflected through the G-factor, exists as a unitary dimension underlying the answers to all items and co-exists with multiple more specific facets (Sfactors) defined by the part of the items that is unexplained by the G-factor. Thus, both hierarchical and bifactor models assume that there exists a global construct underlying answers to all items included in an instrument, whereas ICM-CFA simply assumes distinct facets without a common core.</p><p>Similarities have been noted between hierarchical and bifactor models, which both test for the presence of global and specific dimensions underlying the responses to multiple items. These similarities are related to the possibility of applying a <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schmid and Leiman (1957)</ref> transformation procedure (SLP) to a hierarchical model in order to convert it to a bifactor approximation. However, the SLP makes obvious that hierarchical models implicitly rely on far more stringent assumptions than bifactor models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jenrich &amp; Bentler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reise, 2012)</ref>. In particular, when a SLP is applied to a hierarchical model, the relation between an item and the G-factor from the bifactor approximation is represented as the indirect effect of the higher-order factor on the item, as 'mediated' by the first-order factor. More precisely, each item's first-order factor loading is multiplied by the loading of this first-order factor on the second-order factor, which in turns yields the loadings of this item on the SLP-estimated G-factor. The second term in this multiplication is thus a constant as far as the items associated with a single first-order factor are concerned. Similarly, the relations between the items and the SLP-estimated S-factors are reflected by the product of their loadings on their first-order factor by the squared root of the disturbance of this first-order factor (corresponding to the regression path associated with the unique part of the first-order factor). This second term is also a constant and reflects the unique part of the first-order factor that remains unexplained by the higher-order factor (for worked examples, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gignac, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jenrich &amp; Bentler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reise, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The SLP makes explicit that higher-order models rely on stringent proportionality constraints: Each item's association with the SLP G-factor and S-factors are obtained by multiplying their first-order loadings by constants. These constraints imply that the ratio of G-factor to S-factors loadings for all items associated with the same first-order dimension will be exactly the same. Although these constraints may hold under specific conditions, they are unlikely to hold in real-world settings involving complex instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Reise, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yung, Thissen, &amp; McLeod, 1999)</ref>. These constraints are one reason why true bifactor models tend to provide a much better fit to the data than hierarchical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brunner, Nagy, &amp; Wilhelm, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reise, 2012</ref>; but also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Murray &amp; Johnson, 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, Jenrich and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Bentler (2011)</ref> demonstrated that, when the population model underlying the data corresponds to a bifactor model without meeting the SLP proportionality constraints, the SLP generally fails to recover the underlying bifactor structure of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychometric Multidimensionality due to the Fallible Nature of Indicators</head><p>A second source of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality that is typically neglected within the traditional ICM-CFA framework is that items are very seldom perfectly pure indicators of the constructs they are purported to measure. Rather, they tend to be fallible indicators including at least some degree of relevant association with constructs other than the main constructs that they are designed to measure. More precisely, items are known to incorporate a part of random measurement error, which is traditionally assessed as part of reliability analyses and modeled as part of the items' uniquenesses in EFA or CFA. However, items also tend to present some degree of systematic association with other constructs (a form of measurement error usually assessed as part of Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 6 validity analyses) that is typically expressed through cross-loadings in EFA but is constrained to be zero in ICM-CFA. Although not limited to this context, this phenomenon tends to be reinforced when the instruments includes multiple factors related to conceptually-related and partially overlapping domains. Particularly in these contexts, ICM assumptions might be unrealistically restrictive. Still, no matter the content of the instrument that is considered, most indicators are likely to be imperfect to some extent and thus present at least some level of systematic associations with other constructs. This reality is made worse when the instrument also includes items designed to directly assess hierarchically-superior constructs (e.g., global self-esteem, intelligence, or externalizing behaviors) usually specified as separate subscales which should also logically present direct associations with hierarchically inferior items/subscales (e.g., math self-concept, memory, impulsivity). In the absence of a bifactor model specifically taking hierarchical relations into account, cross-loadings are to be expected as a way to reflect these hierarchically-superior constructs. However, even in a bifactor model taking hierarchically-superior constructs into account, cross-loadings can still be expected due to the fallibility of indicators, particularly in the presence of partially overlapping domains (e.g., peer and parent self-concepts, verbal intelligence and memory, impulsivity and attention difficulties).</p><p>When real cross-loadings are forced to be zero in ICM-CFA, the only way for them to be expressed is through the inflation of the estimated factor correlations. Indeed, even when the ICM-CFA model fits well in the first place (see <ref type="bibr">Marsh, Liem, Martin, Morin, &amp; Nagengast, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Marsh, Nagengast et al., 2011)</ref>, factor correlations will typically be at least somewhat inflated unless all cross-loadings are close to zero. Interestingly, simulations studies showed that EFA usually results in more exact estimates of the true population values for the latent factor correlations than CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Lüdtke, Nagengast, Morin, &amp; Von Davier, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schmitt &amp; Sass, 2011)</ref>. Even when the true population model corresponds to ICM-CFA assumptions, EFA still results in unbiased parameter estimates. These observations seem to argue in favor of EFA as providing a more realistic and flexible measurement model for multidimensional instruments.</p><p>Unfortunately, EFA has been superseded by the methodological advances associated with CFA/SEM and by the erroneous assumption that EFA was unsuitable to confirmatory studies. However:</p><p>This assumption still serves to camouflage the fact that the critical difference between EFA and Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 7</p><p>CFA is that all cross loadings are freely estimated in EFA. Due to this free estimation of all cross loadings, EFA is clearly more naturally suited to exploration than CFA. However, statistically, nothing precludes the use of EFA for confirmatory purposes <ref type="bibr">(Morin, Marsh et al., 2013, p. 396)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Asparouhov and Muthén (2009)</ref> recently developed ESEM, which allows for the integration of EFA within the overarching SEM framework, making methodological advances typically reserved to CFA/SEM available for EFA measurement models <ref type="bibr">(Marsh, Morin, Parker, &amp; Kaur, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>. Further, when ESEM is estimated with target rotation, it becomes possible to specify a priori hypotheses regarding the expected factor structure and thus to use ESEM for purely confirmatory purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Browne, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Integrated Test of Multidimensionality</head><p>A comprehensive test of the structure of many multidimensional measures apparently requires the consideration of the two sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality described above. The assessment of a hierarchically-organized construct, especially when coupled with the inclusion of subscales specifically designed to represent the global construct of interest, would typically argue in favor of bifactor or hierarchical models. However, both bifactor and hierarchical models typically neglect item cross-loadings due to the fallible nature of indicators as providing a reflection of one, and only one, construct, which are likely to be expressed through the inflation of the variance attributed to the G-factor (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Murray, &amp; Johnson, 2013)</ref>. These expected cross-loadings thus apparently argue in favor of ESEM. However, a first-order ESEM model will likely ignore the presence of hierarchically-superior constructs, which will end up being expressed through inflated cross-loadings. In sum, it appears that a bifactor-ESEM or a hierarchical-ESEM may be needed to fully capture the hierarchical and multidimensional nature of instruments incorporating both sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality.</p><p>Unfortunately, it has typically not been possible to combine these two methodological approaches into a single model. For instance, hierarchical models have generally been specified within the CFA framework. The estimation of hierarchical ESEM models needs to rely on suboptimal two-step procedures where correlations among the first-order factors are used to estimate the higherorder factor. This leads to higher-order factors that are a simple re-expression (an equivalent model) Alternative Models. All analyses were conducted with Mplus 7.11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2013)</ref>, based on the robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator providing standard errors and fit indices that are robust to the Likert nature of the items and violations of normality assumptions. Full Information robust Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation was used to handle the small amount of missing data at the item level (M = 0.646%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Enders, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Graham, 2009)</ref>. We first contrasted ICM-CFA, hierarchical-CFA (H-CFA), bifactor-CFA (B-CFA), ESEM, hierarchical ESEM (H-ESEM), and bifactor-ESEM (B-ESEM) representations of the underlying structure of the answers provided to the full SDQ-I (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> for simplified illustrations of these models). In the ICM-CFA model, each item was only allowed to load on the factor it was assumed to measure and no cross-loadings on other self-concept factors were allowed. This model included 11 correlated factors representing the previously described SDQ-I subscales. In the H-CFA model, these 11 factors were specified as being related to a single higher-order CFA factor, with no residual correlations specified between the 11 first-order factors. In the B-CFA model, all items were allowed to simultaneously load on one Gfactor and on 11 S-factors corresponding to the a priori self-concept factors measured by the SDQ-I, with no cross-loadings allowed across S-factors. The G-factor and all S-factors were specified as orthogonal in order to ensure the interpretability of the solution in line with bifactor assumptions that the S-factors reflect the part of the items' variance that is not explained by the G-factor, while the Gfactor reflects the part of the items variance that is shared across all items (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reise, 2012)</ref>. Then, these models were first contrasted with an 11-factor ESEM representation of the SDQ-I estimated based on oblique target rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Browne, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Target rotation seemed particularly appropriate as it allows for the pre-specification of target and nontarget factor loadings in a confirmatory manner. According to the most common specification of target rotation, all cross-loadings were "targeted" to be close to zero, while all of the main loadings were freely estimated. An H-ESEM model was then estimated from this model using ESEM-Within-CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>. In this model, all 11 first-order factors were specified as related to a single higher-order factor, with no residual correlations between the 11 first-order factors. Finally, a B-ESEM model was estimated in line with typical bifactor assumptions using orthogonal bi-factor target rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Reise, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Reise et al., 2011)</ref>, which ensured comparability with the B-CFA 1 . In this model, all items were allowed to define a G-factor, while the 11 S-factors were defined from the same pattern of target and non-target factor loadings that was used in the first-order ESEM solution.</p><p>Construct-Irrelevant Multidimensionality. The SDQ-I includes a total of 12 negatively worded items <ref type="bibr">(items 6, 12, 17, 21, 23, 30, 33, 37, 47, 61, 65, and 75, italicized</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">in Table 1</ref>), which were reversed coded prior to the analyses to facilitate interpretation. To take into account the methodological artifact due to the wording of these items (i.e., construct-irrelevant psychometric multidimensionality), all models included a method factor underlying all negatively-worded items (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marsh, Scalas et al., 2010)</ref>. In line with typical specifications of method factors and to ensure that all models remained comparable, this method factor was modeled as an orthogonal CFA factor defined strictly through the negatively-worded items. Furthermore, the items used to assess the various academic subscales are strictly parallel (e.g., "I am good at Math"; "I am good at German"; "I am good at all school subjects"). Thus, a priori correlated uniquenesses among matching indicators of the academic subscales were also included to the models. This inclusion reflects the idea that the unique variance of these items (i.e., uniquenesses, reflecting construct-irrelevant sources of influences and random error) is likely to be shared among items with parallel wordings (i.e., due to convergent sources of construct-irrelevant influence; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marsh, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marsh, Abduljabbar et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Generally, the inclusion of ex post facto correlated uniquenesses as a way to improve model fit should be avoided and has been labeled as a "disaster" for research <ref type="bibr">(Schweizer, 2012, p.1)</ref>. Even when legitimate a priori controls are required (such as in the present study), method factors should be preferred to correlated uniquenesses. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Schweizer (2012)</ref>, method factors explicitly estimate construct-irrelevant sources of variance, whereas correlated uniquenesses simply partial them out -bringing no new information to the model. In this study, it was not realistic to include ten additional method factors reflecting the parallel wording of the items used to assess the academic subscales (i.e., five items per academic competence subscale, all with parallel wording, and five items per academic affect subscale, also with parallel wording). However, parallel wording is more naturally suited to correlated uniquenesses than negative wording. Furthermore, this provides an occasion to illustrate the implementation of both forms of control in the proposed framework.</p><p>The control of these sources of construct-irrelevant psychometric multidimensionality is particularly important in the application of the integrative framework proposed here. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Murray and Johnson (2013)</ref> recently showed that bifactor models (the same argument applies to ESEM) are particularly efficient at absorbing unmodeled complexity (e.g., correlated uniquenesses, crossloadings), which may in turn inflate the fit of these models relative to models not taking this complexity into account. The inclusion of these methodological controls of a priori method effects, as well as the comparison of ESEM and CFA, and bifactor and non-bifactor models, allow us to control for this possibility. All models including these a priori methodological controls systematically provided a better fit to the data than models without them. However, including these controls had no impact on the results or the final model selection (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> in the online supplements).</p><p>Measurement Invariance. The measurement invariance across gender of the final retained model was then investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Meredith, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Millsap, 2011)</ref>. In the least restrictive model (configural invariance), the same pattern of associations between items and factors, and the same number of factors, were estimated for males and females with no added equality constraints. A second model in which all factor loadings (and cross-loadings) on the substantive and methodological factors were constrained to be invariant across groups (weak measurement invariance) was then estimated. This model is an essential prerequisite to any form of gender-based comparison based on the SDQ-I.</p><p>In the third step, a model where both the factor loadings and items' intercepts were constrained to be invariant across groups (strong measurement invariance) was estimated. This model represents a prerequisite to valid latent means comparisons across groups. A fourth model in which the factor loadings, items' intercepts and items' uniquenesses were constrained to be invariant across groups (strict measurement invariance) was estimated. Although not a requirement for the present study where comparisons are based on latent variables, this steps is an essential prerequisite to gender-based comparisons based on manifest (aggregated) scale scores. Then, to ensure that the measurement model was indeed fully invariant across groups, we also verified whether the correlated uniquenesses included between the parallel-worded items for the academic subscales were also invariant across groups. Two additional steps were tested in which further invariance constraints were specified at the level of the factor variances/covariances and latent means in order to further investigate possible gender-based differences in the association between self-concepts facets, variability, and latent means.</p></div>

(2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Millsap (2011)</ref>.</p><p>Model Evaluation. Given the known oversensitivity of the chi-square test of exact fit and of chi-square differences tests to sample size and minor model misspecifications (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Marsh, Hau, &amp; Grayson, 2005)</ref>, we relied on common goodness-of-fit indices and information criteria to describe the fit of the alternative models: the comparative fit index (CFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bentler, 1990)</ref>, the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tucker &amp; Lewis, 1973)</ref>, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Steiger, 1990)</ref> with its confidence interval, the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akaike, 1987)</ref>, the Constant AIC (CAIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bozdogan, 1987)</ref>, the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Schwartz, 1978)</ref>, and the samplesize adjusted BIC (ABIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sclove, 1987)</ref>. According to typical interpretation guidelines (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Hau, &amp; Wen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2005)</ref>, values greater than .90 and .95 for the CFI and TLI are considered to be respectively indicative of adequate and excellent fit to the data, while values smaller than .08 or .06 for the RMSEA support respectively acceptable and excellent model fit. Similarly, in comparing nested models forming, for instance, the sequence of invariance tests, common guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002)</ref> suggest that models can be seen as providing a similar degree of fit to the data (thus supporting the adequacy of invariance constraints) as long as decreases in CFI remain under .01 and increases in RMSEA remain under .015 between less restrictive and more restrictive models. It has also been suggested to complement this information by the examination of changes in TLI (with guidelines similar to those for CFI) that may be useful with complex models due to the incorporation of a penalty for parsimony <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>. As articulated by <ref type="bibr">Cheung and Lau (2012, p. 169)</ref> "One pitfall of this approach is that the ΔCFI has no known sampling distribution and, hence, is not subject to any significance testing. These cutoff values may thus be criticized as arbitrary." Although the information criteria (AIC, CAIC, BIC, ABIC) do not, in and of themselves, describe the fit of a model, a lower value reflects a better fit to the data of one model in comparison to a model with higher values so that in a set of nested models the best fitting model is the one with the lowest value.</p><p>It is important to note that these descriptive guidelines have so far been established for CFA.</p><p>Although previous ESEM applications have generally relied on similar criteria (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Grimm, Steele, Ram, &amp; Nesselroade, 2013)</ref>, their adequacy for ESEM still has to be more thoroughly investigated. In this regard, it has been suggested that indicators including a correction for parsimony (i.e., TLI, RMSEA, AIC, CAIC, BIC, ABIC) might be particularly important in ESEM given that the total number of estimated parameters is typically much larger than in CFA <ref type="bibr">(Marsh, Lüdtke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, although the efficacy of the proposed descriptive guidelines for the comparison of nested invariance models has been validated in CFA for tests of weak, strong, and strict measurement invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002)</ref>, they appear to be of questionable efficacy for tests of latent mean invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fan &amp; Sivo, 2009)</ref>. In addition, these indices still appear to show sensitivity to design conditions and model complexity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fan &amp; Sivo, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2007)</ref>, calling into question the generalizability of these guidelines outside of the conditions considered in previous simulation studies and, importantly, the CFA framework. Although information criteria (AIC, CAIC, BIC, ABIC) appear to represent a less "subjective" alternative, their known dependency to sample size creates a confounding: Given a sufficiently large sample size, these indicators will always support more complex alternatives (see <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2005)</ref>. In sum, all of these interpretation guidelines (be they related to goodness-of-fit indices or information criteria) should not be treated as "golden rules" or used for inferential purposes, but only as rough guidelines for descriptive model evaluation and comparison that should also take into account parameters estimates, statistical conformity and theoretical adequacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fan &amp; Sivo, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., , 2005))</ref>. This is also the approach generally advocated in ESEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Grimm et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table 1 (top section) presents the goodness-of-fit indices and information criteria associated with the models. The ICM-CFA solution (CFI = .921; TLI = .916; RMSEA = .033) provides an acceptable degree of fit to the data, whereas both the H-CFA and the B-CFA appear to be suboptimal in terms of fit (CFI and TLI &lt; .90 and higher values on the information criteria). The ESEM solution provides an acceptable (TLI = .947) to excellent (CFI = .963; RMSEA = .026) degree of fit to the data, and an apparently better representation of the data than the ICM-CFA model according to improvement in fit indices and a decrease in the values of the AIC and ABIC. The B-ESEM model provides an excellent degree of fit to the data according to all indices (CFI = .970; TLI = .956; Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 16 RMSEA = .024), and a slightly better level of fit to the data and lower values for the information criteria than all other models. The more rigid H-ESEM does not fit the data as well as either ESEM or the B-ESEM (higher information criteria, lower fit indices). Based on this information, the B-ESEM model appears to provide the best representation of the data. However, as mentioned before, this information on model fit should be considered as a rough guideline only, and the final model selection should remain conditional on a detailed examination of the parameter estimates and theoretical conformity of the various models. Thus, before moving to a description of the B-ESEM model, we first start with a comparison of the ICM-CFA and ESEM to investigate the presence of constructrelevant psychometric multidimensionality due to the fallible nature of indicators and the presence of conceptually-related constructs. We then contrast the ESEM and B-ESEM to investigate constructrelevant psychometric multidimensionality due to hierarchically-superior constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESEM versus CFA.</head><p>The ICM-CFA and ESEM solutions differ in their factor correlations (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) with much lower factor correlations for ESEM (|r| = .006 to r = .648, M = .237) than ICM-CFA (|r| = .106 to r = .815, M = .376). ESEM thus results in a clearer differentiation between the self-concept factors than ICM-CFA. Interestingly, simulation studies showed that ESEM tends to provide a better representation of the true correlations between factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Lüdtke et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schmitt &amp; Sass, 2011)</ref>, leading to the recommendation that ESEM should be retained when the estimated factor correlations are substantially reduced in comparison to ICM-CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>. Here, the highest correlations involve either the global self-esteem factor -supporting the need for a bifactor representation -or associations between conceptually close constructs (such as peer and appearance self-concepts, or math competence and affect) -apparently supporting the theoretical adequacy of ESEM. Parameter estimates from these models are reported in the online supplements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S2</ref>).</p><p>An examination of the ESEM parameter estimates reveals well-defined factors due to substantial target factor loadings (varying from |λ| = .014 to .907; M = .606). Furthermore, the more hierarchically superior constructs (global self-esteem: target |λ| = .239 to .668, M = .491; general academic competence: target |λ| = .014 to .382, M = .286; general academic affect: target |λ| == .211 to .605, M = .503) tend to be less well defined than the other factors (target |λ| = .350 to .917, M = .664), supporting the need for a bifactor model. Similarly, as expected, multiple non-target crossloadings are also present, providing additional support for the ESEM solution. The majority of the more substantial non-target cross-loadings (&gt; .200) involve hierarchically-superior (global self- esteem, and general academic competence or affect) or conceptually-related constructs (e.g., peer and appearance self-concepts); and are particularly pronounced between the academic affect and competence subscales associated with the same domain. These results provide clear evidence that both sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality are present in the SDQ-I, supporting the need to rely on ESEM and suggesting the appropriateness of exploring B-ESEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESEM versus B-ESEM.</head><p>As previously noted, B-ESEM provides a slightly better fit to the data (according to both fit indices and lower values for the information criteria) than ESEM. The parameter estimates from this model are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The B-ESEM solution shows that the G-Factor is well-defined by the presence of strong and significant target loadings from most of the SDQ-I items (|λ| =.118 to .691, M = .444), which is impressive for a G-factor defined by 76 items designed to tap into different domains. In particular, the items designed to specifically assess global self-esteem all present elevated target loadings on this G-factor (|λ| =.320 to .610, M = .490). Over and above this G-factor, the S-factors related to SDQ-I subscales theoretically located at the lower level of the selfconcept hierarchy are also well-defined through substantial target loadings (|λ| =.307 to .809, M = .567), suggesting that they do indeed tap into relevant specificity and add information to the selfconcept G-factor. In contrast, and supporting the appropriateness of a B-ESEM representation of the data, the items associated with most of the hierarchically superior subscales apparently present either no (general academic competence: target |λ| = -.011. to .099, M = .066, all non-significant at p ≤ .05) or low levels (global self-esteem: target |λ| =.101 to .411, M = .310; general academic affect: target |λ| = .174 to .418, M = .354) of meaningful residual specificity once the G-factor is taken into account.</p><p>However, at least in regard to the global self-esteem and general academic affect subscales the target loadings on the S-Factors (14 out of 15 possible loadings) remain significant, supporting the need to control for this content specificity in the model, which may reflect in part the presence of additional Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 18 self-concept domains not covered in the <ref type="bibr">SDQ-I (e.g., arts, biology, spirituality;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marsh, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Vispoel, 1995)</ref>. This explanation is not sufficient to explain why the target loadings are so much weaker on the general academic competence S-factor than the global self-esteem and general academic affect Sfactors. A possible explanation for this difference appears related to the fact that the global academic competence items present more numerous, and stronger, cross-loadings involving domain-specific Sfactors than the items related to global self-esteem and general academic affect (also see subsequent discussion of cross-loadings). It would be possible for applied researchers to pursue a post hoc modification of this model by taking out the general academic competence S-factor and allowing global academic competence items to contribute solely to the G-factor. This alternative representation would be in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brunner et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brunner et al. ( , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brunner et al. ( , 2010</ref>) "Nested Marsh/Shavelson model". 2   Further examination of the B-ESEM solution reveals that, outside of the academic area, few items present meaningful non-target cross-loadings. Some of these cross-loadings support previous results showing partial conceptual overlap between physical appearance on the one hand and peer self-concept or physical ability on the other hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arens et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marsh, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh &amp; Ayotte, 2003)</ref>. For example, some physical appearance items show substantial cross-loadings on the physical ability (e.g., Item 46: "I have a good looking body"; cross-loading = .219) or peer self-concept (e.g., Item 38: "Other kids think I am good looking"; cross-loading = .281) scales. Similarly, one peer selfconcept item also displays a substantial cross-loading on the physical appearance scale (Item 36: "I am easy to like"; cross-loading = .232). However, non-target cross-loadings appear more pronounced within the academic area. Thus, multiple items from the competence subscales present small to moderate cross-loadings on their affect counterparts, and vice-versa. For instance, items of math competence reveal cross-loadings on math affect (|λ| =.230 and .347, M = .314), and items of math affect demonstrate cross-loadings on math competence (|λ| =.253 and .298; M = .275), while the target loadings still suggest that these factors are properly defined (math competence: |λ| =.557 to .630; M = .599; math affect: |λ| = .644 to .763; M = .689). Similar results are observable for the German affect and competence subscales, as well as for the general academic competence and affect subscales, although these more general factors are not as well-defined as the domain-specific math and German Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 19 subscales. These results confirm the distinction between competence and affect components in the academic area, but also show that the items still present a high level of specificity over and above their competence or affect nature. This explains the previously reported elevated correlations between the affect and competence subscales associated with a single domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arens, Yeung, Craven, &amp; Hasselhorn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh &amp; Ayotte, 2003)</ref>. No such pattern of non-target cross-loadings between competence and affect factors can be observed across the German and math domains supporting the strong differentiation of academic self-concept into math and verbal domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Möller et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the items forming the general academic competence and affect factors also present substantial non-target cross-loadings on their German and math counterparts, a result in line with the hierarchical nature of self-concept.</p><p>Measurement Invariance. We now turn to tests of invariance across gender of the final B-ESEM model (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The model of configural invariance provides an acceptable fit to the data (CFI = .960; TLI = .942; RMSEA = .028). From this model, invariance constraints across gender were progressively added to the factor loadings (weak invariance), items' intercepts (strong invariance), items' uniqueness (strict invariance), correlated uniquenesses for parallel-worded items, latent variances and covariances, and latent means. None of these constraints resulted in a decrease in model fit exceeding the recommended cut-off scores for the fit indices (ΔCFI and ΔTLI &lt; .01; ΔRMSEA &lt; .015), supporting the invariance of the B-ESEM factor structure across gender. Invariance is also generally supported by the information criteria, with the CAIC and BIC showing consistent decreases (or at least very low increases) up to the inclusion of invariance constraints on the latent variances and covariances. A more careful examination reveals a single major difference between the conclusions that would have been reached through an examination of the changes in fit indices (suggesting complete measurement invariance), and the conclusions that would have been reached through an examination of the information criteria. Indeed, the information criteria all increased when invariance constraints were imposed on the items' intercepts, thus suggesting that a solution of partial invariance of items' intercepts could be investigated; something that we illustrate in the next study. This reinforces the imprecise nature of these guidelines, the importance of anchoring decisions in multiple sources of information <ref type="bibr">(Marsh et al., 2004)</ref>, and the need for further simulation studies in this area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 20</head><p>However, when invariance constraints are imposed to the latent means, all information criteria show increased values. This increase in the values of the information criteria, coupled with <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fan and Sivo's (2009)</ref> observation that changes in goodness-of-fit indices tend to be untrustworthy indicators of latent mean invariance, suggests that latent means may not be invariant across gender. The exploration of latent means reveals that, when boys' latent means are fixed to zero for identification purposes, girls' latent means (expressed in SD units) are significantly higher than those of the boys on the German competence (M = .408, p ≤ .05), and German affect (M = .243, p ≤ .05) S-factors.</p><p>Conversely, girls' latent means are significantly lower than boys' on the physical abilities (M = -.606, p ≤ .01), and math competence (M = -.420, p ≤ .01) S-factors. No gender differences are apparent on the G-factor, as well as on the global self-esteem, peer, parent, appearance, academic competence and affect, and math affect S-factors. These results follow gender stereotypes and replicate those from previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Marsh, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh &amp; Ayotte, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Extended Illustration Based on a Simulated Data Set</head><p>In order to provide a simpler and more complete pedagogical example of the use of the framework presented here, we rely on a simulated data set based on a known population model. A complete set of annotated input codes used to simulate the data and to estimate all models used in this study are provided in the online supplements. Interested readers can use these inputs to simulate their own data set and try their hand at estimating a wide variety of models. The parameter estimates for the measurement part (factor loadings and items' uniquenesses) of the population model used to simulate the data are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S3</ref> of the online supplements, and the complete population model is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. To keep the model simpler than in Study 1, we simulated a population model including one global factor well-defined by 12 items, which also define three S-factors. These factors were specified as orthogonal in line with typical bifactor assumptions. Each S-factor is defined mainly through a total of 4 items (items X1 to X4 define mainly S-Factor S1; items Y1 to Y4 define mainly S-Factor S2; items Z1 to Z4 define mainly S-Factor S3). We simulated the data so that one of the S-Factors (i.e., S-Factor S3) was more weakly defined than the other S-factors through lower target factor loadings <ref type="bibr">(.300 to .500, versus .550 to .650</ref> for the other S-factors). Furthermore, each item was simulated has having a very small (-.100 or .100) or small (.150 or .200) non-target cross-loading on one additional S-factor. All non-target cross-loadings were kept under the boundaries of what is typically considered negligible in EFA/ESEM applications <ref type="bibr">(Marsh, Lüdtke et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>We simulated the data using a multiple-group set up, using two groups including 800 participants each, in order to be able to illustrate tests of measurement invariance. This also allowed us to use the grouping variable as a predictive (exogenous) covariate, so as to illustrate the MIMIC approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jöreskog &amp; Goldberger, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marsh, Tracey, &amp; Craven, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Muthén, 1989)</ref>. The population model was simulated with invariant factor loadings, invariant items' uniquenesses, invariant factor variances (set to be equal to 1), and invariant relations between constructs. One item was simulated as having a non-invariant intercept (illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> as a direct effect of the grouping variable on item Y2). Latent mean differences across groups were simulated on the G-factor and the S-Factor S1. Apart from these differences, all other means and intercepts were set to be zero.</p><p>We simulated one additional CFA factor (defined by items W1 to W4) as an outcome variable, specified as influenced by the grouping variable, the G-Factor, and the S-Factor S2. Thus, the full model includes an indirect effect of the grouping variable on the outcome factor as mediated by the Gfactor. This population model aimed at providing an illustration of all possible predictive relationships among the constructs. One factor (S1) was specified as being influenced by the grouping variable but having no influence on the outcome variable. One factor (S2) was specified as having an effect on the outcome but as not being influenced by the grouping variable. One factor (G) was specified as being influenced by the grouping variable while also having an effect on the outcome variable. Finally, the last factor (S3), which is more weakly defined than the others, was specified as being unrelated to the other constructs. Using the data simulation input provided in the online supplements, it would be easy for interested readers to define their own predictive model at the population level.</p><p>For readers preferring a description of the simulated data set that is more in line with applied research, it is easy to find suitable examples. Thus, the binary grouping variable can easily reflect gender, or cultural groups. The G-and S-factors can reflect any construct that is well suited to bifactor representations. For instance, the G-Factor could reflect a global level of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) while the S-factors could reflect more specific levels of Inattention, Hyperactivity, and Impulsivity going over and above global ADHD levels and be used to define Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 22 diagnostic subtypes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Morin, Tran et al., 2013)</ref>. Alternatively, the G-factor could reflect either global Intelligence or Internalizing Disorders, whereas the S-factors could define specific cognitive strengths (e.g., Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gignac &amp; Watkins, 2013)</ref> or symptoms (e.g., Dysphoria, Suicidality, Social Anxiety, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Simms et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the outcome variable could, for example, reflect later levels of academic achievement or attainment, life satisfaction, or psychological well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses and Results</head><p>Because the data was simulated to follow multivariate normality assumptions and without missing data, all analyses were conducted using Mplus 7.11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2013)</ref> maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. We start the analyses by a comparison of ICM-CFA, bifactor-CFA (B-CFA), ESEM, and bifactor-ESEM (B-ESEM) representations of the underlying structure of the scores on the indicators of the main "instrument" (i.e., items X1 to X4, Y1 to Y4, and Z1 to Z4), without taking the grouping variable or the outcome into account. These models are specified as in the previous study (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and in line with the population model (X1 to X4 are used to define one factor, Y1 to Y4 a second factor, and Z1 to Z4 a third factor). A first-order (CFA, ESEM) model with 3 correlated factors is mathematically equivalent to a hierarchical (CFA, ESEM) model including the same 3 first-order factors used to define a single higher-order factor. Indeed, converting a 3-factor first-order model to a hierarchical model simply involves replacing three factor correlations by three higher-order factor loadings and thus results in an empirically equivalent model in terms of degrees of freedom and fit to the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hershberger &amp; Marcoulides, 2013)</ref>. For this reason, we do not investigate hierarchical models, but still report annotated inputs to illustrate their estimation in the online supplements. This allows us to focus on the comparisons between ICM-CFA and ESEM, and between first-order and bifactor models, that are critical to the framework presented here.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents the goodness-of-fit indices and information criteria associated with the models. Both the ICM-CFA and B-CFA solutions provide an acceptable degree of fit to the data according to the CFI (.937 and .960) and TLI (.919 and .937), but not the RMSEA (RMSEA = .109 and .096). In contrast, both the ESEM and B-ESEM models provide an excellent fit to the data (CFI = .996 and 1.000; TLI = .991 and .999; RMSEA = .036 and .013), higher values for the information Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 23 criteria and non-overlapping RMSEA confidence intervals in comparison with the ICM-CFA/B-CFA models. Although both the ESEM and B-ESEM models provide an excellent fit to the data, the fit of the B-ESEM model is better based on an improvement in fit indices (particularly the ΔRMSEA = -.023), a decrease on the AIC, BIC, and ABIC, and non-overlapping RMSEA confidence intervals. This information suggests that the B-ESEM model should be retained as providing the best representation of the data. However, as mentioned previously, this final model selection should remain conditional on a detailed examination of the parameter estimates and theoretical conformity.</p><p>As we are here using simulated data, theory cannot be used to help in guiding this decision (see previous study for an illustration), but knowledge of the population model confirms the adequacy of this decision. However, before interpreting the B-ESEM model, we start with a comparison of ICM-CFA and ESEM to assess construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality due to the fallible nature of the indicators. We then contrast ESEM and B-ESEM to investigate construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality due to hierarchically-superior constructs.</p><p>ESEM versus CFA. The ICM-CFA and ESEM solutions differ in their factor correlations (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>) with lower factor correlations for ESEM (|r| = .475 to r = .629, M = .542) than ICM-CFA (|r| =.516 to r = .731, M = .620), supporting the superiority of ESEM versus ICM-CFA. Here, knowing that the population-generating model is orthogonal alerts us to the fact that these models do not provide a full representation of the construct-relevant multidimensionality present in the scale.</p><p>Parameter estimates from the ICM-CFA and ESEM models are reported in the online supplements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">S4</ref>). An examination of the ESEM parameter estimates reveals well-defined factors due to substantial target factor loadings (varying from |λ| = .642 to .941; M = .810). Similarly, as expected, multiple non-target cross-loadings are also present (|λ| = .009 to .310; M = .100), providing additional support to the ESEM solution. Although it is not possible to substantively interpret the non-target cross-loadings with simulated data, these results provide clear evidence that construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality linked to the fallible nature of the indicators simultaneously reflecting more than one construct content is likely to be present in the data, thus supporting the need to rely on ESEM. The superiority of B-ESEM in terms of fit to the data further suggests the appropriateness of investigating for the presence of a second source of construct-relevant Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 24 multidimensionality due to the presence of hierarchically-superior constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESEM versus B-ESEM.</head><p>The parameter estimates from the B-ESEM model are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. This B-ESEM solution shows that the G-Factor is well-defined by the presence of strong and significant target loadings from all items (|λ| = .466 to .791, M = .664). Over and above this G-factor, the S-factors are also well-defined through substantial target factor loadings (|λ| = .353 to .691, M = .523), suggesting that they do indeed tap into relevant specificity and add information to the G-factor -although the S-Factor S3 appears to be slightly more weakly defined (target |λ| = .353 to .583, M = .464) than S-factors S1 and S2 (target |λ| = .477 to .691, M = .691). Further examination of the B-ESEM solution reveals that significant non-target cross-loadings are still present, thus supporting the value of a B-ESEM solution over a B-CFA solution. However, these non-target cross-loadings remain generally smaller (|λ| = .005 to .176; M = .073) than those estimated in ESEM (|λ| = .009 to .310; M = .100), showing that the bifactor operationalization allows for a more precise distribution of the various sources of construct-relevant multidimensionality present in the instrument.</p><p>The Multiple-Group Approach to Measurement Invariance. The results from the tests of measurement invariance of the final retained B-ESEM model are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The model of configural invariance provides an excellent fit to the data (CFI = .999; TLI = .997; RMSEA = .021).</p><p>From this model, invariance constraints across groups were progressively added to the factor loadings (weak invariance), intercepts (strong invariance), uniquenesses (strict invariance), latent variances and covariances, and latent means. Adding invariance constraints on the factor loadings does not result in a decrease in model fit exceeding the recommended cut-off scores for the fit indices (ΔCFI and ΔTLI &lt; .01; ΔRMSEA &lt; .015), and results in lower values for the information criteria, supporting the weak invariance of the B-ESEM model. However, adding invariance constraints on the items' intercepts results in a decrease in RMSEA exceeding the recommended value (ΔRMSEA = .018) and higher values on the AIC, BIC, and ABIC, suggesting that the strong invariance of the B-ESEM model may not fully hold across groups. For this reason, we explored a model of partial invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Byrne, Shavelson, &amp; Muthén, 1989)</ref>. Based on the modification indices associated with the model of strong invariance and an examination of the parameter estimates associated with the model of weak Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 25 invariance, we decided to relax the invariance constraint of item Y2 across groups, resulting in a model of partial strong invariance. When compared to the model of weak invariance, this model results in a decrease in fit that remained lower than the recommended cut-off scores for the fit indices (ΔCFI and ΔTLI &lt; .01; ΔRMSEA &lt; .015) and in lower values for the information criteria, supporting the adequacy of this model. When the parameters estimates from this model are examined, they show that group 2 (M = .104) tends to present higher levels than group 1 (M = -.177) on item Y2 to a degree that is in line with the specifications of the population-generating model (specifying a difference of .300 on item Y2). The results further support the strict invariance of the model, as well as the invariance of the latent variances and covariances (ΔCFI and ΔTLI &lt; .01; ΔRMSEA &lt; .015; lower values for the AIC, CAIC, BIC, ABIC). However, adding invariance constraints on the latent means results in an increase on the information criteria and the highest changes in fit indices observed so far (ΔCFI = -0.008; ΔTLI = -.010; ΔRMSEA = +.026). The results further show that when latent means are fixed to zero in group 1, latent means (in SD units) are significantly higher in group 2 on the G-Factor (M = .455, p ≤ .01) but lower on the S-Factor S1 (M = -.509, p ≤ .01). No differences are apparent on the S-Factors S2 or S3. These results are in line with the population model (specifying opposite differences of .500 on the G-factor and S-Factor S1).</p><p>The MIMIC Approach to Measurement Invariance. The multiple-group approach to measurement invariance provides a general framework for tests of measurement invariance when the grouping variable has a small number of discrete categories and the sample size for each group is reasonable. This approach can easily be extended to tests of longitudinal measurement invariance (for a pedagogical illustration using ESEM, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>. Nevertheless, this approach might not be practical for continuous variables (e.g., SES, IQ level, age), multiple contrast variables (e.g., gender, cultural groups, experimental/control groups) and their interactions, or small sample sizes. In such situations, a more parsimonious MIMIC approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jöreskog &amp; Goldberger, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marsh et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Muthén, 1989</ref>) might be more appropriate. A MIMIC model is a regression model in which latent variables are regressed on observed predictors that can be extended to test potential non-invariance of item intercepts, that is, differential item functioning (DIF, monotonic DIF in the case of intercept non-invariance). <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marsh, Nagengast et al. (2013)</ref> extended this approach to Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 26 investigate the loss of information due to categorizing continuous variables (to convert them to grouping variables for more complete tests of measurement invariance) through the separate estimation of a MIMIC model in each of the groups formed by the categorization of the continuous predictors. However, while the MIMIC model is able to test monotonic DIF, it implicitly assumes the invariance of the factor loadings (non-monotonic DIF). Although MIMIC models can be extended, through the incorporation of tests of latent interactions between predictors and factor scores, to tests of non-monotonic DIF, this extension is not yet available within the ESEM or B-ESEM frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barendse, Oort, &amp; Garst, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barendse, Oort, Werner, Ligtvoet, &amp; Schermelleh-Engel, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The MIMIC model is more parsimonious than the multiple-group approach as it does not require the estimation of a separate model in each group, which makes it more suitable to smaller samples. The MIMIC approach also allows for the consideration of multiple independent variables, some or all of which can be continuous, and their interactions -something that is typically difficult to properly manage in multiple-group analyses. Monotonic DIF is evaluated by the comparison of three nested MIMIC models. In the first (null effect) model, the predictors have no effect on the latent means and items' intercepts. In the second (saturated) model, the predictors are allowed to influence all items' intercepts, but not the latent means. The third (invariant) model assumes the invariance of items' intercepts across levels of the predictors, which are allowed to influence all latent means but not items' intercepts. When the fit of the second and third models is better than the fit of the first model, the predictors can be assumed to have an effect. Comparing the second and third models tests whether the effects of the predictors on the items are fully explained by their effects on the latent means. Monotonic DIF is demonstrated when the fit of the second model is greater than the fit of the third model. Tests of partial invariance may then be pursued by including the direct effects of the predictors on the intercepts over and above their effects on the latent means.</p><p>The results from MIMIC models where the grouping variable was treated as a predictor of the latent factors are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The null effects model provides an acceptable fit to the data according to commonly used interpretation guidelines (CFI and TLI &gt;.95; RMSEA &lt; .06), suggesting limited effects of the grouping variable. However, both the saturated and invariant models provide an improved level of fit to the data (ΔCFI and ΔTLI = + .008 to .027, ΔRMSEA = -.021 to -.046, and lower values for all of the information criteria). This suggests that the grouping variable must have an effect, at least on the latent means. When these two models are contrasted, the fit of the saturated model appears to be better than the fit of the invariant model according to the TLI (ΔTLI = + .010), RMSEA (ΔRMSEA = -.025), and the information criteria. This suggests that the effects of the grouping variable are not limited to the latent means, but also extend to some of the items' intercepts (providing evidence of monotonic DIF). Examination of the modification indices associated with the invariant model and of the parameter estimates from the saturated model suggests that DIF is mainly associated with item Y2 (which we know to be the case based on the known population values).</p><p>Allowing for direct effects of the grouping variable on Y2 resulted in a fit to the data that was equivalent to the fit of the saturated model (ΔCFI and ΔTLI = 0, and ΔRMSEA = -0.003) and in lower information criteria. Detailed results from this model reveal (in line with known population values) that participants' levels on the G-factor (b = .455; β = .222, p &lt; .001; R 2 = .049) and item Y2 (b = .278; β = .131, p &lt; .001; R 2 = .740) tended to be higher in the second group, while levels on the S-Factor S1 tended to be lower in the second group (b = -.509; β = -.247, p &lt; .001; R 2 = .061).</p><p>Predictive Models. All models considered so far can easily be extended to test predictive relationships between constructs. To illustrate tests of predictive relationships, we simulated a data set including a grouping variable specified as predicting the B-ESEM factors (i.e., an exogenous predictor), and one additional latent CFA factor specified as being predicted by the B-ESEM factors (i.e., a distal outcome). These variables thus form the predictive system illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. More precisely, the relations among these constructs were simulated according to a partially mediated predictive system such that the effect of the exogenous predictor on the distal outcome are both direct, and indirect, being mediated by the effect of the exogenous predictor on the G-factor from the set of B-ESEM factors, which in turn also predicts the distal outcome. Mediation occurs when some of the effects of an independent variable (IV; here the exogenous predictor) on the dependent variable (DV; here the distal outcome) can be explained in terms of another mediating variable (MV; here the B-ESEM factors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(MacKinnon, 2008)</ref>. A mediator is thus an intervening variable accounting for at least part of the relation between an exogenous predictor and a distal outcome such that the exogenous predictor influences the distal outcome indirectly through the mediator(s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 28</head><p>Given the objective of the current paper to illustrate a psychometric framework allowing for the analysis of sources of construct-relevant multidimensionality present in a measurement model, our main objective here is to illustrate how this psychometric framework can be used in the estimation of predictive models. However, in the interest of space, we assume that readers are reasonably familiar with tests of mediation conducted within the SEM framework and only expand on issues that are specific to the bifactor-ESEM context. Readers not familiar with mediation testing and wishing to improve their knowledge in this area may consult a number of user-friendly introductions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hayes, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jose, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">MacKinnon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">MacKinnon, Fairchild, &amp; Fritz, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Typically, tests of mediation involve contrasting two models to verify whether the mediation is complete, or whether direct effects of the exogenous predictor(s) on the distal outcome(s) remain significant over and above their effects on the mediator(s). The fit statistics associated with these two models are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The fully mediated model, where the exogenous predictor is allowed to influence the B-ESEM factors (as well as item Y2 based on the results from the MIMIC model) and the B-ESEM factors are allowed to influence the distal outcome, present a satisfactory level of fit to the data (CFI and TLI &gt;.95; RMSEA &lt; .06). However, the fit of the partially mediated model, including an additional relation between the exogenous predictor and the distal outcome, is better according to lower values for the RMSEA (ΔRMSEA = -0.018) and all information criteria. The parameter estimates from this model are in line with the population-generating model and show significant effects of the exogenous predictor on the G-factor (b = .453; β = .221, p &lt; .001; R 2 = .049), the S-factor S1 (b = -.507; β = -.246, p &lt; .001; R 2 = .060), and the distal outcome (b = .270; β = .210, p &lt; .001), as well as significant effects of the G-factor (b = .279; β = .445, p &lt; .001) and the S-factor S2 (b = .207; β = .322, p &lt; .001) on the distal outcome (R 2 =.404). These results suggest that the effects of the exogenous predictor on the distal outcome are partially indirect and mediated through the effect of the exogenous predictor on the G-factor.</p><p>It is well documented that bootstrapped confidence intervals (CI) are the most efficient manner for testing the significance of indirect (mediated) effects (represented as the product of the IVMV and the MVDV path coefficients) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cheung &amp; Lau, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">MacKinnon, Lockwood, &amp; Williams, 2004)</ref>. Unfortunately, bootstrapping is not yet implemented in ESEM or B-ESEM, which represents another limitation of the way these models are currently implemented. However, these tests can easily be implemented using the ESEM-Within-CFA (EWC) approach described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al. (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">also</ref>  <ref type="bibr">see Marsh, Nagengast et al., 2013</ref>, as well as the input files provided here in the online supplements). To implement this method, one needs to use the start values provided as part of the final predictive ESEM or B-ESEM model, to add the constraints required for identification purposes, and to re-estimate this model while requesting bootstraped estimation (see the online supplements for details of implementation). When our final model is re-estimated using this method and requesting bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals, the results confirm that the indirect effect of the exogenous predictor on the distal outcome, as mediated by the G-factor, is significant as indicated by a bias-corrected bootstrapped 95% CI excluding 0 (indirect effect = b = .127; 95% CI = .088/.174).</p><p>Another limitation of current implementations is that all factors forming a single set of ESEM or B-ESEM factors (i.e., a set of factors is defined as a group of factors defined by the same collection of items allowed to have their main loadings or cross-loadings on all factors included in the group) are required to be simultaneously related to other variables in the same manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. Attempts to estimate a model where the factors forming a single set are specified as having a different pattern of relations to other constructs (e.g., the exogenous predictor predicts S1 and G, but not S2 and S3; or including a regression between S1 and the outcome, but a correlation path between S2 and the outcome) would simply fail and produce a warning saying that the model has been misspecified. In the present study, this means that the exogenous predictor needed to be allowed to simultaneously predict the G-factor and the 3 S-factors. In turn, the G-factor and the 3 S-factors was simultaneously allowed to predict the distal outcome factor. Although this was not necessary in the present application, the EWC method could have been used to circumvent this limitation. To do so, one would simply need to use the start values from the final ESEM or B-ESEM measurement model, to add the constraints required for identification purposes, and to replace the factor correlations linking the ESEM/B-ESEM factors to the other variables by the required predictive paths. We provide a sample input in the online supplements illustrating the implementation of this method to estimate only the predictive paths depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Integrative Framework to Investigate Source of Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality</head><p>This study illustrated an overarching psychometric approach of broad relevance to investigations of many complex multidimensional instruments routinely used in psychological and educational research. More precisely, we showed how an integration of classical (CFA), emerging (ESEM) and "rediscovered" (bifactor) models provides a general framework (bifactor-ESEM) for the investigation of two sources construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality related to (a) the hierarchical nature of the constructs being assessed (i.e., the co-existence of global and specific components within the same measurement model) and (b) the fallible nature of indicators which tend to include at least some degree of association with non-target constructs. We argue that the first source of construct-relevant multidimensionality naturally calls for bifactor models, while the second source of construct-relevant multidimensionality rather calls for ESEM (rather than CFA). Thus, when both sources of multidimensionality are present, then a bifactor-ESEM model should be preferable. Such integrated models have only recently be made available and had yet to be systematically applied to the investigation of complex measurement instruments.</p><p>The first step in the application of the proposed framework starts with a comparison of firstorder ICM-CFA and ESEM models to assess the presence of construct-relevant multidimensionality due to the fallible nature of the indicators and reinforced by the presence of conceptually-related or overlapping constructs. Given that bifactor models tend to absorb un-modeled cross-loadings through the estimation of inflated global factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Murray &amp; Johnson, 2013)</ref>, it is important that the application of this framework always starts with a comparison of ESEM versus ICM-CFA models. In agreement with previous recommendations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>, we argue that this first comparison should routinely be conducted in the investigation of the measurement structure of any multidimensional instrument. In the examples provided in this manuscript, ESEM solutions provided a better fit to the data when compared to ICM-CFA models. The superiority of ESEM was further corroborated by the observation of lower factor correlations, resulting in more clearly differentiated factors. In line with previous recommendations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>, applied studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marsh et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Marsh, Lüdtke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Morin &amp; Maïano, 2011)</ref>, and simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Lüdtke et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schmitt &amp; Sass, 2011)</ref>, these Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 31 observations converge in supporting the superiority of the ESEM solution -at least in the data sets considered here. As previously reinforced, decisions regarding the appropriateness of alternative models to represent sources of construct-relevant multidimensionality should not be taken in disconnection from a detailed examination of parameter estimates and substantive theory. The ESEM results from Study 1 showed that all factors were clearly defined by the expected pattern of target loadings and non-target cross-loadings, with stronger cross-loadings between conceptually-related or hierarchically-ordered scales. This last observation suggested the presence of construct-relevant multidimensionality involving hierarchically-superior constructs.</p><p>The second step in the application of the proposed framework involves the comparison of first-order versus bifactor and higher-order solutions (relying on ESEM or CFA depending on the results from the first step), in order to assess the presence of construct-relevant multidimensionality due to the presence of hierarchically-superior constructs. Although we argued that the first step of this framework should be routinely applied to the investigation of any multidimensional instrument, this second verification should only be conducted when substantive theory and the results from the first step suggest that this second source of construct-relevant multidimensionality may be present in an instrument. In the examples considered here, the bifactor-ESEM was retained as providing the best fitting representation of the data after verification of theoretical (in Study 1) and empirical (in both studies) conformity of the parameter estimates. Indeed, in the bifactor-ESEM solutions, the G-factors were well-defined and clearly supported the presence of a global factor emerging from answers to the full set of items. It is true that, in Study 1, the inclusion of items specifically designed to assess global self-conceptions made the SDQ-I uniquely well suited to this illustration. However, the application of bifactor models is in no way dependent on the presence of items directly tapping into a global construct (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gignac &amp; Watkins, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Morin, Tran et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Simms et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Meaning of the Alternative Models</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality: Items as Fallible Indicators of a Single</head><p>Construct. A common idea in applied research is that good indicators need to provide a perfect reflection of a single construct, and that cross-loadings will inherently and irremediably change the meaning of the constructs that are estimated. Rather, following <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al. (2014)</ref>, we argue here that a completely pure item that has no cross-loadings or other sources of non-random specificity is a convenient fiction -at best an impossible ideal and at worst a potentially serious distortion of reality that undermines the valid interpretation of the data. Seeking such ideals, absolute truths, and other golden rules in psychometrics that obviate subjective interpretations <ref type="bibr">(Marsh et al., 2004)</ref> is not inherently bad. However, applied researchers need to understand that pure items do not exist in reality and will be rejected in a purely statistical sense when evaluated within a sufficiently broad framework (with large Ns and a sufficiently large number of items and factors). Of course, misfit associated with cross-loadings might be sufficiently trivial to be ignorable -providing an appropriate balance between complexity and parsimony -but support for such claims should be based on empirical results.</p><p>The simple observation that many items are inherently expected to include construct-relevant multidimensionality explaining their association with multiple constructs shows that this requirement for pure indicators relies on a logic that inherently flawed. For example, in the assessment of anxiety and depression (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gignac et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Simms et al., 2008)</ref>, cross-loadings are expected due to the fact that some symptoms are inherently part of both disorders, such as insomnia and psychomotor agitation. Our illustration based on the SDQ-I also provides interesting examples. For instance, "I have a good looking body" (an indicator of physical appearance self-concept) had a significant nontarget cross-loading on physical ability self-concept, which could be related to the fact that athletic bodies tend to be perceived as more attractive. Similar examples are numerous and show that crossloadings do not "taint" the constructs, but rather allow the constructs to be estimated using all of the relevant information present at the indicator level. Remember that, according to the reflective logic of factor analyses, the factors are specified as influencing the indicators, rather than the reverse. Thus, small cross-loadings should be seen as reflecting the influence of the factor on the construct-relevant part of the indicators, rather than the indicators having an impact on the nature of the factor itself. It should be kept in mind that this interpretation applies to relatively small cross-loadings that are in line with theoretical expectations, whereas any model showing large and unexplainable cross-loadings or cross-loadings larger than target loadings should be re-examined.</p><p>Furthermore, factor correlations tend to be substantially biased when non-zero cross-loadings are constrained to be zero (as shown in our simulated data set, as well as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Lüdtke et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schmitt &amp; Sass, 2011)</ref>. This suggests that it is the exclusion of these cross-loadings that can drastically change the meaning of the constructs. This clearly underlines the importance for applied research to consider this additional source of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality even when the initial ICM-CFA model appears to fit the data well <ref type="bibr">(Marsh, Liem et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Marsh, Nagengast et al., 2011)</ref>. As noted by <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al. (2014, p. 104)</ref>: "If the fit and parameter estimates (e.g., latent factor correlations) for the ICM-CFA do not differ substantially from the corresponding ESEM, on the basis of parsimony researchers should retain the CFA model".</p><p>Alternatively, when the fit of the ESEM solution is acceptable, higher than the fit of the ICM-CFA, and ESEM results in lower estimates of the factor correlations, then ESEM should be preferred.</p><p>It is true that rotational indeterminacy raises additional questions. Indeed, any ESEM solution depends on the rotation procedure that is selected so that factors correlations and non-target crossloading can be directly increased or decreased by changing the rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Morin, &amp; Maïano, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schmitt &amp; Sass, 2011)</ref>. With this in mind, simulation studies still show that, notwithstanding this issue, ESEM tends to provide factor correlation estimates that are closer to true population values, even if they are themselves imperfect due to rotational indeterminacy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Lüdtke et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schmitt &amp; Sass, 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, even when the true population model corresponds to ICM-CFA, ESEM still tends to adequately recover true population values. In this paper, we elected to rely on target rotation, which provides a confirmatory approach to ESEM (see <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2014)</ref> and allows the analyst to specify the expected pattern of associations between items and factors. Furthermore, when bifactor-ESEM models are specified as orthogonal (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reise, 2012)</ref>, these concerns are somehow diminished. However, the reader should keep in mind that even for bifactor-ESEM, the selection of an orthogonal (versus oblique) rotation is itself a choice and subject to rotational indeterminacy (see Endnote 1 and Jenrich &amp; Bentler, 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality: Hierarchically-Superior Constructs.</head><p>Although our main focus is on bifactor models as a method of choice to model construct-relevant multidimensionality due to the presence of hierarchically-superior constructs, we also contrasted these models with hierarchical models in t study 1. The SLP (described earlier) makes obvious that both models estimate some form of global factor based on the covariance shared among all items, as well Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 34 as variance components reflecting specificity associated with groupings of items that remain unexplained by the global factor (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al., 2006)</ref>. However, there are critical differences between the two approaches. Statistically, the strict proportionality constraints that are at play in hierarchical models limit their flexibility and practical applicability <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brunner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jenrich &amp; Bentler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reise, 2012)</ref>. In line with this affirmation, the hierarchical-CFA and hierarchical-ESEM systematically provided the worst fit to the data of all models estimated in the first study. Substantively, the difference between these models is even more pronounced. As shown in our illustration based on simulated data, even when the true underlying population model follows bifactor assumptions, it is possible for alternative first-order CFA or ESEM models to provide a satisfactory level of fit to the data through the simple "absorption" of this hierarchical structure via inflated factor correlations and/or item cross-loadings. However, these alternative models are substantively erroneous in that they completely ignore the underlying global construct that underlies responses to all indicators. In psychiatric measurement, <ref type="bibr">Morin, Tran et al. (2013, p.</ref> 2) note that "an important question has to do with whether a primary dimension <ref type="bibr">(e.g., depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc.)</ref> does exist as a unitary disorder, including specificities (i.e., as represented by a bifactor model), or whether these specificities rather define a set of distinct facets without a generic common core (i.e., represented by a classical CFA model)". Fortunately, a detailed assessment of parameter estimates, theory, and statistical indices allowed us to pick the proper model in this simulated data study, although the fit of the alternative models generally proved satisfactory according to typical interpretation guidelines. Clearly, future simulation studies should investigate more thoroughly the efficacy of the various goodness-of-fit indices and information criteria in selecting the proper model amongst the alternative representations considered here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 35</head><p>This study was designed to illustrate an overarching psychometric framework for the investigation of construct-relevant multidimensionality related to the fallible nature of the imperfect indicators typically used in applied research, and to the assessment of hierarchically-superior constructs within the same instrument. Although our results supported the use of bifactor-ESEM, we do not claim that this specific psychometric representation will necessarily generalize to all instruments that are routinely used in psychological, educational, and social sciences research.</p><p>However, we anticipate that this specific combination (i.e., bifactor-ESEM) may prove to be quite important to consider when working with complex multidimensional measures. More generally, we argue that the full framework proposed here should be routinely applied to studies of complex instruments, especially those that include a separate subset of items specifically designed to assess hierarchically-superior constructs. In these contexts, we believe that typical solutions of modeling these items as a separate subscale, or simply of excluding them, should no longer be seen as adequate as it ignores the inherently hierarchical nature of the assessed constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endnotes</head><p>1 Bifactor estimation relies on orthogonal factors to ensure interpretability of the results. However, alternative models may be estimated where the S-factors are allowed to correlate to one another, although these models often pose interpretation and/or convergence problems. In B-CFA (or CFA more generally), orthogonal models are more parsimonious than comparative models based on oblique factors, and thus provide a different fit to the data. However, in ESEM or B-ESEM, oblique or orthogonal rotations have equivalent covariance implications and thus are statistically equivalent models with identical fit to the data. To ensure comparability with typical bifactor applications, as well as between B-CFA and B-ESEM, we relied on orthogonal rotation. However, exploring alternative procedures confirmed that our main conclusions were unaffected by this choice.</p><p>2 An ESEM model including f factors is empirically impossible to distinguish from a B-ESEM model including f-1 S-factors: Both are equivalent, have the same degrees of freedom, and produce the same chi-square, fit indices, and information criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hershberger &amp; Marcoulides, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">MacCallum, Wegener, Uchino, &amp; Fabrigar, 1993)</ref>. The reason for this is that in ESEM, each item is allowed to load on all factors. So, in a B-ESEM model including f S-factors and one G-factor, each item is in fact Construct-Relevant Multidimensionality 36 allowed to load on f +1 factors. This makes an ESEM model including f factors impossible to distinguish from a B-ESEM model including f-1 S-factors as both, in the end, will estimate the loadings of all items on a total of f factors. In fact, differences in results between these two solutions can be attributed to the inherent rotational indeterminacy of any EFA/ESEM application (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Morin &amp; Maïano, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Morin, Marsh et al., 2013)</ref>. For this reason, we recommend starting all comparisons by contrasting an ESEM model including f factors with a B-ESEM model including the same number of S-factors (i.e., only differing by the addition of the G-factor). Whenever the results from both models provide an adequate and similar level of fit to the data, then the results from the B-ESEM model should be systematically inspected in order to verify whether it makes sense to drop one of the S-factor including items that should theoretically relate only to the G-factor.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F1 X1 X2 X3 Y1 Y2 Y3 Z1 Z2 Z3 F2 F3 ESEM F1 X1 X2 X3 Y1 Y2 Y3 Z1 Z2 Z3 F2 F3 ICM-CFA F1 X1 X2 X3 Y1 Y2 Y3 Z1 Z2 Z3 F2 F3 HF Hierarchical-CFA F1 X1 X2 X3 Y1 Y2 Y3 Z1 Z2 Z3 F2 F3 Hierarchical-ESEM HF S1 X1 X2 X3 Y1 Y2 Y3 Z1 Z2 Z3 S2 S3 Bifactor-CFA G S1 X1 X2 X3 Y1 Y2 Y3 Z1 Z2 Z3 S2 S3</formula><p>Bifactor      </p></div>
