<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has become a key multivariate analysis technique that human resource management (HRM) researchers frequently use. While most disciplines undertake regular critical reflections on the use of important methods to ensure rigorous research and publication practices, the use of PLS-SEM in HRM has not been analyzed so far. To address this gap in HRM literature, this paper presents a critical review of PLS-SEM use in 77 HRM studies published over a 30-year period in leading journals. By contrasting the review results with state-of-the-art guidelines for use of the method, we identify several areas that offer room of improvement when applying PLS-SEM in HRM studies. Our findings offer important guidance for future use of the PLS-SEM method in HRM and related fields.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, human resource management (HRM) scholars have increasingly turned their attention to understanding the complex interrelationships that constitute the HRM black box (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Banks and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kepes, 2015, Chowhan, 2016)</ref>. The emergence of progressively more complex models in HRM underlines the critical importance of developing advanced analytical methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Wright, Gardner, Moynihan and Allen, 2005)</ref>. Structural equation modeling (SEM) has become a widely used method when investigating such models' relationships, for example, those that determine the impact of HRM practices on attitudinal and behavioral HR outcomes, as well as on organizational performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baluch, Salge and</ref><ref type="bibr">Piening, 2013, Buonocore and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Russo, 2013</ref>). SEM's ability to simultaneously estimate the direct, indirect (e.g., mediating), and moderating effects of multiple constructs while accounting for measurement error has enabled researchers to examine relationships that would otherwise be difficult to disentangle and study.</p><p>Partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM) is often used across different management disciplines, including organization research <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Sosik, Kahai and Piovoso, 2009)</ref> and strategic management <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Sarstedt, Pieper and Ringle, 2012a)</ref>. PLS-SEM estimates the parameters of a set of equations in a structural equation model by combining principal components analysis and regression-based path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mateos-Aparicio, 2011)</ref>. The method offers various advantages for researchers using cause-effect relationship models to explain, or predict, a particular construct, such as job satisfaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Buonocore and Russo, 2013)</ref>, turnover intentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brunetto, Teo, Shacklock and Farr-Wharton, 2012)</ref>, and expatriation behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Schlägel and Sarstedt, 2016)</ref>. These advantages include its ability to (1) handle very complex models with many indicators and constructs, (2) estimate formatively specified constructs, (3) handle small sample sizes with the required level of care, and (4) derive determinate latent variable scores, which can be applied in subsequent analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Richter, Cepeda Carrión, Roldán and Ringle, 2016)</ref>. PLS-SEM thus overcomes several of covariance-based SEM's (CB-SEM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Jöreskog, 1978)</ref> well-known limitations, particularly in research settings characterized by complex research models and limited data.</p><p>The growing number of articles using PLS-SEM in business research <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Sarstedt, Hopkins and Kuppelwieser, 2014)</ref> and the controversy regarding its advantages and limitations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Goodhue, Lewis and Thompson, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Marcoulides, Chin and Saunders, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">, Rönkkö and Evermann, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">, Sarstedt, Hair, Ringle, Thiele and Gudergan, 2016)</ref> call for a critical review of the way the method is used in the HRM field. Reflecting critically on the use of PLS-SEM is crucial, as this could reveal important avenues for improvement, thereby helping authors develop and complete their studies, as well as helping them evaluate the work of others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sanders, Cogin and</ref><ref type="bibr">Bainbridge, 2014, Rosopa and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kim, 2017)</ref>. The ensuing implications are not only relevant for HRM researchers, but extend to other fields of business research that increasingly use the PLS-SEM method (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Nitzl, 2016)</ref>. This is the first paper to systematically examine how PLS-SEM has been applied in HRM research, with the aim of providing important guidance and, where applicable, opportunities for course correction in future applications. We first discuss PLS-SEM's utility for HRM research across universal, contingency, configurational, and contextual modes of theorizing. Next, we offer a set of guidelines for the appropriate application of PLS-SEM. We then use these guidelines to assess how PLS-SEM is used in the top journals for HRM and employment relations research. Our review of 77 studies published over a 30-year period, from 1985 to 2014, reveals that there is considerable variation in the way PLS-SEM is applied in HRM research. The review also highlights several areas that offer room for improvement in future HRM studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORIZING IN HRM AND PLS-SEM</head><p>Reference to empirical HRM research being "seriously under-theorized" is relatively consistent <ref type="bibr">(Fleetwood and Hesketh, 2008, p. 126)</ref>. HRM literature generally draws on four dominant theorizing modes that differ regarding the complexity characterizing the resultant models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Delery and</ref><ref type="bibr">Doty, 1996, Martín-Alcázar, Romero-Fernandez and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sánchez-Gardey, 2005)</ref>, namely a universalistic, contingency, contextual, and configurational mode. HRM models following the universalistic perspective are the simplest in terms of the model complexity. These models infer that the relationships between independent and dependent variables are universal across the population of employees and independent of any other contextual factors. PLS-SEM is appropriate for assessing such universalistic associations within the HRM context. However, HRM scholars are moving from universalistic to more multifaceted HRM models, such as those based on the contingency, contextual, and configurational perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Martín-Alcázar, Romero-Fernández and Sánchez-Gardey, 2008)</ref>. Contingency approaches usually result in more complex models, because they consider interactions rather than the simple direct relationships that characterize universalistic models (Van de <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ven and Drazin, 1985)</ref>. An example of contingency reasoning is the extent to which line management development conditions the impact that strategic HRM partners have on high performance work system implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buonocore and Russo, 2013)</ref>. While PLS-SEM can assess contingency arguments-either through moderation analysis, or the use of multigroup analysis-it is important to understand such contingency's nature. <ref type="bibr">Boyd, Takacs Haynes, Hitt, Bergh and Ketchen (2012)</ref> point out that, when the contingency argument concerns the slope of the difference, the appropriate modeling approach is to analyze the moderating effect. Whereas factor indeterminacy limits factor-based SEM's usefulness for moderation analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hair, Black, Babin and Anderson, 2010)</ref>, PLS-SEM is particularly suitable, as the method has practically no limitations when integrating one or more interaction term(s) into the path model. However, when running a moderation analysis, researchers must carefully choose a suitable approach to compute the interaction term <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Henseler and Chin, 2010)</ref> and employ bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) confidence intervals when interpreting their results (Aguirre-Urreta and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Rönkkö, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>When the focus of the argument concerns differences in the strength of an association conditional on a certain contingency variable, a suitable modeling procedure compares groups that differ in respect of a specific contingency variable. PLS-SEM enables such comparisons by combining measurement invariance testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Henseler, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2016b)</ref> and various types of multigroup analysis, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chin and Dibbern's (2010)</ref>  Similar to contingency approaches, contextual perspectives imply that environmental factors influence HRM practices. A contextual approach highlights, for example, the relevance of social, cultural, and institutional influences for HRM decisions and effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Martín-Alcázar et al., 2005)</ref>. While much research in this area employs qualitative methods, there have been calls to use more advanced quantitative techniques when studying contextual effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Martín-Alcázar et al., 2005)</ref>. For example, research on HRM practices has used SEM to investigate the impact of context on cultural factors, such as hierarchical distance (Triguero-Sánchez, Peña-Vinces and Sánchez-Apellániz, 2013), and on socio-political factors, such as unionization <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Thommes and</ref><ref type="bibr">Weiland, 2010, Innocenti, Pilati and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Peluso, 2011)</ref>. With its capacity to undertake moderation and multigroup analyses, PLS-SEM offers the means to employ this contextual analysis approach in HRM. Furthermore, PLS-SEM allows for estimating models that researchers hypothesize as having (multiple) mediating effects, either in isolation, or in combination with moderators in mediated moderation, or moderated mediation, models <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Nitzl, Roldán and Cepeda Carrión, 2016)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brunetto et al. (2012)</ref> apply PLS-SEM to research the mediating effect of affective commitment on the relationship between employee engagement and turnover intentions.</p><p>The configurational mode of HRM theorizing involves patterns of factors that jointly relate to certain other factors in more complex models. The configurations of a range of HRM practices can embody synergistic effects and higher-order interactions that cannot be easily represented in traditional contingency models <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Doty and Glick, 1994)</ref>. Similar to the universalistic perspective, a simple configurational argument implies that one configuration of HRM practices, which is always independent of contextual contingencies, will produce a certain outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Marler, 2012)</ref>. In contrast, aligned with the contingency perspective, an extended configurational conceptualization implies that, for example, depending on a particular industry type, a certain bundle of HRM practices will enhance organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Subramony, 2009)</ref>. Owing to its flexibility regarding model specification, PLS-SEM proves suitable to assess configurations' impact on HRM practices. By adopting methods, such as the formation of indices, to proxy a range of practices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Shaw, Dineen, Fang and Vellella, 2009)</ref> previous measures could only inadequately take a configurational approach in HRM research. More recent studies have adopted the use of formative measures to depict bundles of HRM practices (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Triguero-Sánchez et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Bello-Pintado, 2015)</ref>. PLS-SEM is particularly suitable in this regard, because it allows for the estimation of formatively specified measurement models without limitations <ref type="bibr">(Becker, Rai and Rigdon, 2013a)</ref>, which have become increasingly popular in the social sciences.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> Furthermore, higher-order constructs-as frequently used in PLS-SEM studies in other fields (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Ringle, Sarstedt and Straub, 2012)</ref>-allow for the simultaneous modeling of constructs on different levels of abstraction. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Konradt, Warszta, and Ellwart's (2013)</ref> examination of the influence that the process fairness has on applicants' pursuit intentions, recommendation intentions, and intentions to reapply, they consider process fairness as a higherorder construct formed by three lower-order components: formal characteristics, explanation, and interpersonal treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLS-SEM GUIDELINES FOR HRM</head><p>When using PLS-SEM, researchers need to be conversant with the method and its appropriate application. Prior research has produced several guidelines and recommendations on how to use PLS-SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Haenlein and Kaplan, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Gefen and Straub, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Chin, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Lowry and Gaskin, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Henseler, Hubona and Ray, 2016a</ref><ref type="bibr">, Sarstedt, Ringle and Hair, 2017b)</ref>, including several edited volumes (e.g., Esposito Vinzi, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chin, Henseler and Wang, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Abdi, Chin, Esposito Vinzi, Russolillo and Trinchera, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Latan and Noonan, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Avkiran and Ringle, 2018)</ref>, and textbooks on the method (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garson, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Ramayah, Cheah, Chuah, Ting and Memon, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hair, Hult, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle and Gudergan, 2018)</ref>. The set of guidelines presented in this section is aimed at helping HRM researchers use PLS-SEM better when assessing data and evaluating estimation results. The guidelines were derived by merging PLS-SEM fundamentals with findings from recent PLS-SEM methodological improvements (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2018)</ref> and with best practice in other fields using this method (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Peng and Lai, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Kaufmann and Gaeckler, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Nitzl, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Ali, Rasoolimanesh, Sarstedt, Ringle and Ryu, 2018)</ref>. Our guidelines are based on four aspects of a structured PLS-SEM analysis process (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) that prior research on the use of PLS-SEM identified as relevant: (1) determining the research goal, (2) structural model specification, (3) measurement model specification, and (4) results evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=== INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE ===</head><p>When following these guidelines, HRM researchers, however, need to be aware of the recent controversies surrounding the method: Some researchers oppose the method, arguing that PLS-SEM is not a (factor-based) latent variable method, lacks goodness-of-fit measures, and produces biased parameter estimates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Rönkkö and Evermann, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">, Rönkkö, McIntosh and Antonakis, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">, Rönkkö, Antonakis, McIntosh and Edwards, 2016)</ref>. However, this view has been criticized for ignoring PLS-SEM's measurement philosophy and analytical goals, which differ fundamentally from those of CB-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rigdon, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, Sarstedt et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Rigdon, Becker and Sarstedt, 2017a)</ref>, thus rendering any comparison of the two SEM types as "comparing apples with oranges" <ref type="bibr">(Marcoulides et al., 2012, p. 725)</ref>. In estimating the construct measures, CB-SEM follows a common factor model approach. The underlying statistical assumption is that the variance of a set of indicators can be perfectly explained by the existence of one unobserved variable (the common factor) and individual random error. PLS-SEM on the other hand follows a composite model approach in linear combinations of indicators define composites, which represent that conceptual variable of interest in the statistical model <ref type="bibr">(Sarstedt et al., 2016, Rigdon, Sarstedt and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ringle, 2017b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Henseler et al. (2014, p. 184</ref>) note that defining factorbased results obtained from CB-SEM as true, but composite-based PLS-SEM results as universally false, is a "very restrictive view of SEM." Recent research echoes this objection, calling for a more holistic understanding of the interplay between measurement conceptualization, operationalization, modeling, and estimation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Sarstedt et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hair, Hollingsworth, Randolph and Chong, 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, Nitzl and Chin, 2017)</ref>. Nevertheless, to preempt potential criticism, HRM researchers should take this debate and the different positions into consideration when choosing an appropriate SEM method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining the Research Goal</head><p>Early in the research process, HRM researchers develop an understanding of the type of model they will be investigating and the purpose of this investigation. PLS-SEM was initially designed to allow the exploration of models in an effort to develop theory. <ref type="bibr">Wold (1985, pp. 590)</ref> envisioned a discovery-oriented process, "a dialogue between the investigator and the computer."</p><p>In other words, instead of following a deductive approach of creating and testing a specific model, the researchers would critically review the initial results and improve the model further by means of an inductive approach. The inductive improvement process, deductively tested in several iterations, leads to a final model that better matches the theory with the data than the earlier models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLS-SEM enables researchers to address a broad range of research questions by (1)</head><p>allowing for estimating formatively specified measurement models <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Sarstedt et al., 2016)</ref>, ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) handling non-normal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cassel, Hackl and Westlund, 1999)</ref>, and (3) working effectively with a wide range of sample sizes <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, Sarstedt and Thiele, 2017c)</ref>, which is often an issue in HRM research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Vermeeren et al., 2014)</ref>. Hence, HRM research endeavoring to assess complex theories and incorporate models with an explanatory and/or predictive focus should employ PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Rigdon, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model Specification</head><p>In the structural model, researchers establish links between constructs through a set of paths, which usually reflects the hypotheses. The relationships between constructs can capture direct, indirect (mediated), and interaction (moderated) effects. For example, the path between employee performance (Y4) and turnover (Y7) in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> exemplifies a direct relationship. The link between employee performance (Y4) and turnover (Y7) through commitment (Y6) is an example of an indirect relationship. Here, changes in commitment potentially mediate employee performance's effect on turnover. A moderation effect occurs when a construct affects the strength, or the direction, of the relationship between two other constructs. We could argue, for example, that rewards (Y5) moderate the relationship between employee performance (Y4) and commitment (Y6). This effect is modeled via an interaction term (Y4 x Y5), which is similar to a contingency logic. When considering mediation and moderation simultaneously in this example, the researcher creates a moderated mediation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Nitzl et al., 2016)</ref>. PLS-SEM is also capable of investigating higher-order models, which have become increasingly relevant in HRM studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Teo, Le Clerc and Galang, 2011)</ref>, particularly in configurational models. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the construct employee performance (Y4) represents a higher-order construct formed by three lower-order components, which, in this case, are: ability (Y1), motivation (Y2), and opportunity (Y3). Higher-order constructs improve the model parsimony and allow for a more nuanced analysis of dimension-specific effects on subsequent constructs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Edwards, 2001)</ref>. Importantly, HRM researchers need to explicitly justify that using a higher-order model is appropriate in their study, and to clearly conceptualize the higher-and lower-order components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=== INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE ===</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model Specification</head><p>In addition to the structural model, HRM researchers need to detail the measurement models. An important step in this regard is deciding on the measurement mode (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer, 2001)</ref>. One of PLS-SEM's strengths when doing so is its capacity to handle formatively specified measurement models without limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cenfetelli and</ref><ref type="bibr">Bassellier, 2009, Becker et al., 2013a)</ref>. As noted in our discussion of configurational HRM models above, many management studies use reflective indicators, but for a range of HRM constructs, such as bundles of HRM practices, formative measures may be more appropriate. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, commitment (Y6) is measured by using reflective indicators constituting the consequences of employees' commitment; the following are examples of the scale items: "I would be very happy to spend the rest of my career with this organization," or "I feel a strong sense of belonging to this organization." Conversely, the rewards construct (Y5) is measured by using formative indicators representing different aspects of rewards, such as salary increments, annual bonuses, and promotions. Given the considerable biases that result from measurement model misspecifications (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Diamantopoulos and Siguaw, 2006)</ref>, HRM researchers need to verify whether each construct within the model requires a reflectively or formatively specified measurement model. PLS-SEM also allows for the use of nominal, ordinal, and interval-scaled measures in predictor constructs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Haenlein and Kaplan, 2004)</ref> and for incorporating single-item measures. However, single items exhibit significantly lower levels of predictive validity than multi-item scales (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Diamantopoulos, Sarstedt, Fuchs, Wilczynski and Kaiser, 2012)</ref>, which is particularly problematic when using a prediction-based method such as PLS-SEM. HRM researchers using PLS-SEM should therefore generally opt for multi-item scales.</p><p>Determining valid construct measures-taking decisions concerning higher-order, formative measures rather than reflective ones into account, as well as single-item measures rather than multi-item ones-complements specifying the path model. Once the path model has been specified, researchers turn their attention to the criteria related to the model evaluation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stage 1: Evaluating Measurement Models</head><p>When evaluating measurement models, researchers need to distinguish between reflectively and formatively specified constructs. An initial assessment to help distinguish between the formative and reflective modes can draw on PLS-SEM's confirmatory tetrad analyses. If a researcher has used reflectively measured constructs, the indicator loadings should be examined. Standardized loadings over 0.70 are desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chin, 2010)</ref>. HRM researchers can subsequently investigate the internal consistency reliability by ensuring that Cronbach's a, rA, and the composite reliability are more than 0.70 and below 0.95 <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017b</ref>; Chapter 4).</p><p>However, the results of these three reliability assessments usually differ, with Cronbach's a representing the most conservative criterion, the composite reliability the most liberal one, and the rA an approximately exact reliability measure of the PLS-SEM composites. Researchers should also assess the convergent validity. The average variance extracted (AVE) is a suitable criterion for this purpose. If the AVE is above 0.50, the construct explains an average of at least 50 percent of its items' variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chin, 1998)</ref>. Measurement models with formative indicators require a different approach to measurement evaluation. The first step involves carrying out a redundancy analysis to test the convergent validity of the formatively measured construct. Second, HRM researchers need to assess the collinearity between the indicators, which is the source of well-known issues in regression-based analyses, like those carried out by PLS-SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mason and Perreault, 1991)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collinearity assessment usually involves computing each item's variance inflation factor (VIF).</head><p>There are different standards of acceptable VIF values, such as 10.00 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sarstedt and Mooi, 2014</ref>; Chapter 7), with lower values being better. However, until future PLS-SEM research identifies a suitable VIF threshold, researchers should adhere to the more conservative rules of thumb, such as 3.33 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Diamantopoulos and Siguaw, 2006)</ref>, or 5 <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, researchers should investigate the indicator weights' significance and relevance, using bootstrapping to derive the p values as well as BCa confidence intervals (Aguirre-Urreta and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Rönkkö, 2018)</ref>. When running bootstrapping, researchers need to (1) use the no sign change option (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Streukens and Leroi-Werelds, 2016</ref>) and (2) draw a sufficiently high number of bootstrap samples, which must be at least as large as the sample size. Although an initial assessment of 500 bootstrap samples suffices, the final analysis should draw on 5,000, or preferably 10,000, bootstrap samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Streukens and Leroi-Werelds, 2016)</ref>. Depending on whether the indicator weights are significant, researchers also need to examine the indicator loadings-see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cenfetelli and Bassellier (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 5</ref>) for more detailed guidelines on formative measurement model evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stage 2: Evaluating Structural Models</head><p>Once HRM researchers have assessed that the measurement model is satisfactory, Stage 2 involves the structural model's evaluation. A useful first step in this assessment is to analyze the path coefficients; the evaluation is similar to that of the regression coefficients. Analogous to the indicator weight analysis, the use of bootstrapping techniques allows for assessing each coefficient's significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Tenenhaus, Esposito Vinzi, Chatelin and Lauro, 2005)</ref>. HRM researchers should, as part of this assessment, also evaluate the total effects; that is, the summative effects of the direct and indirect relationships on a specific endogenous construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albers, 2010)</ref>. When following this step, researchers should assess the R 2 values of all the endogenous constructs as a measure of the model's in-sample predictive power. A rough rule of thumb is that R 2 values of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 are respectively weak, moderate, and strong <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. In a third step, researchers should evaluate the model's predictive power further by means of the Q 2 value. This value is obtained by means of the blindfolding procedure, which omits a part of the data matrix, estimates the model parameters, and predicts the omitted part by using the previously computed estimates. The smaller the difference between the predicted and the original values, the greater the Q 2 value and, thus, the model's predictive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chin, 1998)</ref>. Since the sample structure remains largely intact, the Q 2 measure can only be partly considered a measure of an out-of-sample prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rigdon, 2012)</ref>; "Fundamental to a proper predictive procedure is the ability to predict measurable information of new cases" <ref type="bibr">(Shmueli, Ray, Velasquez Estrada and Chatla, 2016, p. 4553)</ref>. As a remedy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shmueli et al. (2016)</ref> developed the PLSpredict procedure for generating holdout sample-based point predictions on an item, or construct, level, which HRM researchers should use in future PLS-SEM studies Research has introduced goodness-of-fit measures for PLS-SEM, such as the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), the root mean square residual covariance (RMStheta), the normed fit index (NFI; also referred to as the Bentler-Bonett index), the non-normed fit index (NNFI; also referred to as the Tucker-Lewis index), and the exact model fit test <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lohmöller, 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Henseler et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Dijkstra and Henseler, 2015)</ref>. However, contrary to CB-SEM, whose users rely heavily on goodness-of-fit measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cliff, 1983)</ref>, PLS-SEM constitutes a predictionoriented approach to SEM, which emphasizes the predictive accuracy of models grounded in well-developed causal explanations. <ref type="bibr">Jöreskog and Wold (1982, p. 270)</ref> refer to this interplay when labeling PLS-SEM "causal-predictive," meaning that when the structural theory is strong, the path relationships can be interpreted as causal. Against this background, <ref type="bibr">Sarstedt et al. (2017b)</ref> conclude that "validation using goodness-of-fit measures is also relevant in a PLS-SEM context but less so compared to factor-based SEM. Instead, researchers should primarily rely on criteria that assess the model's predictive performance."</p><p>Finally, the assessment of the data structure's heterogeneity is an important issue that HRM researchers need to address when evaluating PLS-SEM results <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ratzmann, Gudergan and Bouncken, 2016)</ref>. Multigroup (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Matthews, 2018)</ref> and moderator analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Henseler and Fassott, 2010)</ref> allow for analyzing known or assumed sources of heterogeneity (i.e., analysis of observed heterogeneity). Nevertheless, researchers also need to address the issue of possibly unknown and unobserved heterogeneity. In the presence of critical levels of unobserved heterogeneity, the PLS-SEM results can be highly misleading on the aggregate data level <ref type="bibr">(Becker, Rai, Ringle and Völckner, 2013b)</ref>. PLS-SEM-based latent class methods, such as finite mixture PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hahn, Johnson, Herrmann and Huber, 2002)</ref>, help the researcher detect and treat critical levels of unobserved heterogeneity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Peng and Lai (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kaufmann and Gaeckler (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapters 4 and 5)</ref> explain in detail how to systematically analyze observed and unobserved heterogeneity in PLS-SEM analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REVIEW OF PLS-SEM RESEARCH IN HRM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approach</head><p>Our review includes all HRM and employment relations articles published between 1985 and 2014 in journals appearing on the 2007 and 2010 versions of the Association of Business Schools (ABS) list <ref type="bibr">(Harvey, Kelly, Morris and Rowlinson, 2010)</ref>. We used the ABS list as the basis for our review coverage, because it is the only internationally recognized journal list that categorizes journals as HRM, or employment relations, types. Earlier research also used this list as the basis for reviewing HRM research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Almond and Gonzalez Menendez, 2012)</ref>. We included all HRM and employment relations journals with an ABS quality rating of 2, 3, or 4, because their articles are fully refereed according to recognized standards and conventions. We also included relevant articles in similar journals dedicated to organizational studies, management, and psychology, which a panel of seven HRM researchers considered as falling within the HRM field. Table <ref type="table">OA1</ref> in the Online Appendix shows the journals included in this initial list. While not presented as a census of all relevant HRM-related research, the resulting publication list amply reflects mainstream HRM research.</p><p>Initially, we filtered the papers in our list of selected journals to identify those using PLS-SEM. Following prior PLS-SEM reviews in related business research disciplines (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Peng and Lai, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Kaufmann and Gaeckler, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Nitzl, 2016)</ref>, we carried out a full text search in the EBSCO Business Source Premier, ProQuest ABI/INFORM, JSTOR, and SciVerse SCOPUS databases, using the search terms "partial least squares" and "PLS." In addition, we searched each journal's online library. This search ensured that we had identified all the journal articles that met the two selection criteria. Since some of the organizational studies, management, and psychology journals are interdisciplinary and therefore cover functional areas outside the HRM field, a panel of HRM experts screened the articles from these journals to ensure that only those that fit within the HRM discipline were included. The panel comprised seven academics from Australasia, Europe, and the USA who identified themselves as HRM researchers. Articles were only included if at least three panel members identified them as falling within the HRM field.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">OA2</ref> in the Online Appendix shows all the HRM studies included in our review.</p><p>We evaluated 77 studies with a total of 114 PLS path models against the five key elements that underpin the guidelines outlined above according to the: (1) reasons for using PLS-SEM, (2) data characteristics, (3) model characteristics, (4) results evaluation, and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) reporting (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hair et al., 2012b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Nitzl, 2016</ref>). 2 Two researchers with a strong background in PLS-SEM research and with prior experience of PLS-SEM assessment, coded each article with more than 80 percent agreement. Where there was disagreement, a third researcher's input was sought to arrive at an agreement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reasons for Using PLS-SEM</head><p>Of the 77 studies, a total of 65 (84.4 percent) offered arguments for choosing PLS-SEM in their analysis (Table <ref type="table">OA3</ref> in the Online Appendix). The key reasons are: small sample size ( <ref type="formula">51</ref>2 Throughout this article, we use the term "studies" when we discuss the 77 journal articles and use the term "models" when discussing the 114 PLS path models estimated in these papers. studies, 66.2 percent), non-normal data (33 studies, 42.9 percent), theory development (20 studies, 26.0 percent), and use of categorical variables (15 studies, 19.5 percent). Especially with regard to the latter two main arguments, HRM research differs from other business research disciplines, in which these aspects are far less emphasized (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2012b)</ref>.</p><p>In many instances, PLS-SEM works efficiently with small sample sizes when other methods fail <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Rigdon, 2016)</ref>, but numerous studies have long called such analyses' legitimacy into question <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Marcoulides and Saunders, 2006)</ref>. For example, using common factor model data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Goodhue et al. (2012)</ref> have shown that PLS-SEM suffers from increased standard deviations, decreased statistical power, and reduced accuracy (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marcoulides et al., 2012)</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2017c)</ref>, using composite model data, have confirmed these results, but only with regard to measurement model estimates. In the structural model, biases are generally marginal, quickly converging to zero as the sample size increases. As with any other statistical method, PLS-SEM's performance depends on the nature of the population (e.g., with regard to the survey variables' variance) and the quality of the sample. Even the most sophisticated statistical methods cannot offset badly designed samples <ref type="bibr">(Sarstedt, Bengart, Shaltoni and Lehmann, 2017a)</ref>. Similarly, recent research has critically commented on non-normal data as the sole argument for using PLS-SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Reinartz, Haenlein and Henseler, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Goodhue et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Rigdon, 2016)</ref>, because CB-SEM offers a wide range of estimators whose distributional requirements range from strict to weak to almost none. Furthermore, standard maximum likelihood estimation-as commonly used in CB-SEM-has proven extremely robust regarding violations of its underlying distributional assumptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Reinartz et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>To summarize, choosing PLS-SEM mainly for sample size and data distribution reasons is not justified <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Rigdon, 2016)</ref>. Researchers should instead underline their model's and analyses' predictive focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rigdon, 2012)</ref>, or the data's composite-model-based nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Sarstedt et al., 2016</ref>)-if applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Characteristics</head><p>HRM PLS-SEM studies have a mean sample size of 142.5 (Table <ref type="table">OA4</ref> in the Online Appendix), which is lower than in other business research disciplines, such as hospitality management (mean=332; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ali et al., 2018)</ref>, management information systems (mean=238.1; <ref type="bibr">Ringle et al., 2012), marketing (mean=211.3;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2012b)</ref>, operations management (mean=246; Peng and Lai, 2012), strategic management (mean=154.9; <ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2012a)</ref>, and supply chain management (mean=274.4; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kaufmann and Gaeckler, 2015)</ref>. This finding is a cause for concern given the recent calls to abandon the small sample size argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Goodhue et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Rigdon, 2016)</ref>. Most models (102; 89.5 percent) meet the "ten-times" rule to determine the minimum sample size requirements for estimating a PLS path model. On average, the 12 models (10.5 percent) that did not meet this criterion fell 52.8 percent short of the recommended sample size.</p><p>Although the "ten-times" rule allows researchers to gauge the minimum requirements for a PLS-SEM sample <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>, it neglects important issues related to statistical power.</p><p>Researchers should run power analyses that account for model structure, expected effect sizes, and significance level to determine the necessary sample size (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Marcoulides and Chin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kock and Hadaya (2017)</ref> suggest the use of the inverse square root method and the gamma-exponential method to determine the minimum sample size. These approaches' recommended sample sizes are typically higher than those implied by the "ten times" rule.</p><p>None of the studies reports skewed data, or kurtosis, or other criteria that corroborate the non-normality of data arguments. This finding is surprising, since the non-normality of data is the second most prevalent cited reason for using PLS-SEM (42.9 percent of all studies). Moreover, only eight studies (7.01 percent) provide information about missing values, but, except for two studies, do not indicate the missing data treatment used. Finally, none of the studies uses holdout samples, even though this procedure helps substantiate the stability and generalizability of the model estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cepeda Carrión, Henseler, Ringle and</ref><ref type="bibr">Roldán, 2016, Shmueli et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>These results indicate that, in PLS-SEM-based HRM research, there is potential to improve the descriptive statistics' presentation and the data characteristics' analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Characteristics</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> depicts the reviewed path models' characteristics. Almost half of the models used reflectively and formatively specified measurement models (49 models; 43.0 percent). While no model used only formative measures, many only used reflective measures (47 models; 41.2 percent). Eighteen models (15.8 percent) did not provide any information about the measurement mode employed, which is problematic given the vast differences between reflective and formative measurement models' evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=== INSERT TABLE 1 HERE ===</head><p>On average, the path models include 7.8 latent variables, which is comparable to the number of path models found in PLS-SEM reviews in related disciplines (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Kaufmann and Gaeckler, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Ali et al., 2018)</ref>, but much higher than the number of latent variables found in publications using factor-based SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Shah and Goldstein, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, PLS path models employ a relatively large number of structural model path relations (mean = 8.8) and include a greater average number of indicators across all measurement models (mean = 35.0). Reflectively specified measurement models include, on average, 4.5 indicators, whereas formatively specified measurement models include 4.3. This finding is surprising given that formatively specified measurement models should represent the entire population of indicators relevant for measuring the construct and therefore normally comprise more indicators.</p><p>As such, the finding casts doubt on whether the measurement models used in many PLS-SEMbased HRM studies cover the entire scope of the conceptual variables' content domain. Finally, 87 of 114 PLS path models (76.3 percent) used single-item constructs. This finding is alarming, because studies using single items may have weak predictive validity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Diamantopoulos et al., 2012)</ref>. HRM researchers consequently often sacrifice predictive power for simplistic measurements, which is particularly problematic in a PLS-SEM context. Since PLS-SEM constitutes a prediction-oriented approach to SEM, lower predictive power fosters type II errors in the structural model evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model evaluation</head><p>The results of our review imply that there is some room for improvement in terms of evaluating reflective measures, as not all models report their measures of reliability and validity (Table <ref type="table">2;</ref><ref type="table"></ref> Panel A). Specifically, 73 models (76.0 percent) address indicator reliability, 80 models (83.3 percent) provide internal consistency reliability results, and 77 models (80.2 percent) evaluate convergent validity. Finally, only 61 models (63.5 percent) assess discriminant validity. Future PLS-SEM studies should specifically consider the HTMT criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref> to assess discriminant validity, which had not been proposed when the reviewed studies were carried out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=== INSERT TABLE 2 HERE ===</head><p>Models investigating formative measures (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>; Panel B) focus on the relevance of the indicator weights (9 models; 18.4 percent), their significance (10 models; 20.4 percent), and the collinearity (8 models; 16.3 percent). Our review reveals that HRM researchers usually overlook fundamental guidelines and fail to assess formative measures adequately. In particular, none of the studies used redundancy analysis to examine the convergent validity of the formatively measured constructs. In addition, it is concerning that, in 32 models (65.3 percent), researchers used criteria proposed for reflective measurement model assessment to evaluate formative measures. Finally, none of the studies made use of confirmatory tetrad analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gudergan, Ringle, Wende and Will, 2008)</ref> to test the mode of measurement. In light of these findings, HRM researchers should pay greater attention to established guidelines for evaluating formatively specified measurement models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cenfetelli and</ref><ref type="bibr">Bassellier, 2009, Hair et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model evaluation</head><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> summarizes the review results of the structural model evaluations in HRM studies. Eight models (7.0 percent) report <ref type="bibr">Tenenhaus et al.'s (2005)</ref> goodness-of-fit index, which, however, offers no indication of the model fit <ref type="bibr">(Henseler and Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>. Other goodness-of-fit measures, such as SRMR, or NFI, were not used. Criteria used to assess the models' predictive quality include the R² (94 models; 82.5 percent), the f 2 effect size (6 models; 5.3 percent), the predictive relevance Q² (8 models; 7.0 percent), and the q² effect size (0 models; 0.0 percent).</p><p>Our findings suggest that, in HRM studies, there is room for improving the assessment of models' predictive quality. While researchers routinely consider in-sample predictive power, they pay little attention to out-of-sample predictive power proxy assessment that uses the Q 2 statistic.</p><p>Given that researchers commonly seek to generalize their results beyond the sample, this statistic, just like <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shmueli et al.'s (2016)</ref> PLSpredict procedure, should become part of every HRM researcher's toolkit when working with PLS-SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>=== INSERT TABLE 3 ===</head><p>Before assessing the structural model's predictive power, researchers typically examine the standardized path coefficients to assess the extent to which the data reflect the hypothesized relationships. Almost all of the investigated models (113; 99.1 percent) report t or p values in their assessment of the path coefficients' significances. Future HRM PLS-SEM studies should also consider bootstrap confidence intervals, as these offer additional information on a coefficient estimate's stability. <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2017b)</ref> suggest using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals (also see Aguirre-Urreta and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Rönkkö, 2018)</ref>. Despite their usefulness for gaining a more complete picture of the relevance of a construct's antecedents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albers, 2010)</ref>, only a very few researchers considered the total effects in their analyses (6 models; 5.3 percent).</p><p>Finally, researchers should check for heterogeneity, which, if not considered, can compromise PLS-SEM results' validity <ref type="bibr">(Becker et al., 2013b)</ref>. The results in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> show that only a few studies (19 studies; 24.7 percent) account for observed heterogeneity by undertaking multigroup analyses, while none assesses unobserved heterogeneity by using finite mixture PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hahn et al., 2002)</ref>, or other latent class procedures <ref type="bibr">(Ringle, Sarstedt, Schlittgen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Taylor, 2013, Ringle, Sarstedt and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Schlittgen, 2014)</ref>. We expect researchers to address heterogeneity's validity threats by making more use of multigroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Sarstedt, Henseler and Ringle, 2011)</ref> and moderator analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Henseler and Fassott, 2010)</ref>, supplemented by measurement invariance assessment, which has only recently been proposed in a PLS-SEM context <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Henseler et al., 2016b)</ref>. Moreover, we expect examining unobserved heterogeneity to be a standard assessment procedure in PLS-SEM studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reporting</head><p>A critical issue for PLS-SEM applications relates to decisions regarding computational options, which can significantly impact the results. The reporting practices in current HRM research reveal scope for improvement in several respects (Table <ref type="table">OA5</ref> in the Online Appendix). For instance, none of the studies provided information on the PLS-SEM algorithm's settings (e.g., weighting scheme, stop criterion, sampling weights). Moreover, while researchers reported determining the significance of path coefficients by carrying out resampling techniques in almost every study, only 51 of the 77 studies (66.2 percent) stated the method used (e.g., bootstrapping, or jackknifing), and only 15 studies (19.5 percent) reported the exact parameter settings (e.g., number of bootstrap samples, sign change options, confidence interval type).</p><p>Researchers also should report the software they used to estimate the path model, which only 42 of the 77 studies (54.5 percent) did. A total of 20 papers reported that they used PLS Graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chin, 2003)</ref>, while 19 mentioned the use of SmartPLS <ref type="bibr">(Ringle, Wende and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Will, 2005, Ringle, Wende and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Becker, 2015)</ref>, and only three reported using either PLS-GUI, VisualPLS, or XLSTAT.</p><p>Finally, reporting must include the covariance/correlation matrix of the indicator variables and constructs to allow readers to validate the study findings. In 68 of the 77 studies (88.3 percent), researchers did so, which is an excellent outcome compared to other fields (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2012a)</ref>. However, HRM researchers should improve their reporting practice by routinely including both matrices in an (online) appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>PLS-SEM allows HRM researchers to estimate and assess complex models, while imposing relatively few restrictions in terms of data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gefen, Rigdon and Straub, 2011)</ref>. Our review of 77 studies published in a 30-year period not only confirms the high relevance of the PLS-SEM method for HRM studies, it also reveals that there is variation in the way PLS-SEM is applied in HRM research, which offers scope for improvement. In particular, HRM researchers using PLS-SEM should improve the results reporting and the assessment of formative measurement models, which have become increasingly important in social science research and are well-aligned with certain configurational approaches in HRM research. The assessment of formative measurement models should not only center on potential collinearity issues and the significance of weights, but should also consider more recently developed practices, such as establishing convergent validity, or analyzing formative indicators' loadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cenfetelli and Bassellier, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, HRM researchers should account for the most recent developments in PLS-SEM-related methodological research. A recent research stream explores the interplay of measurement theory and model estimation in PLS-SEM vis-à-vis CB-SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Sarstedt et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Henseler, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, Rigdon et al., 2017b)</ref>. We expect these efforts, as called for by <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rigdon (2012)</ref>, to further PLS-SEM's emancipation from CB-SEM. Another stream deals with the development of novel methods for dealing with measurement invariance <ref type="bibr">(Henseler et al., 2016a)</ref>, estimating and evaluating higher-order models (van Riel, Henseler, Kemény and Sasovova, 2017), using fit measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Henseler et al., 2014)</ref>, and assessing PLS-SEM results based on newly developed predictive performance criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Shmueli et al., 2016)</ref>. These advanced techniques allow HRM researchers a more nuanced modeling of theoretical concepts and their complex relationships.</p><p>Future research should address extensions of the PLS-SEM method that allow for exploring longitudinal, panel, and multilevel data structures, which are particularly relevant for HRM researchers <ref type="bibr">(Shen, 2016, Saridakis, Lai and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Cooper, 2017)</ref>. These extensions could employ the latent variable scores obtained from PLS-SEM as variables in longitudinal studies or multilevel models. In addition, future research could consider PLS-SEM's predictive abilities in combination with simulation models. Initial research in this direction has introduced new predictive evaluation criteria <ref type="bibr">(Shmueli et al., 2016, Sharma, Sarstedt, Shmueli, Thiele and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kim, 2017)</ref> and uses PLS-SEM outcomes to initialize agent-based simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Schubring, Lorscheid, Meyer and Ringle, 2016)</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Finally, HRM researchers are advised to assess discriminant validity. Much research relies on the Fornell-Larcker criterion and cross loadings when investigating discriminant validity (e.g.,Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle and Mena, 2012b), but<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Henseler, Ringle and Sarstedt (2015)</ref> have shown that these criteria perform poorly in terms of disclosing discriminant validity problems. Instead, researchers should use the HTMT criterion, which is defined as the mean value of the indicator correlations across constructs (i.e., the heterotrait-heteromethod correlations) relative to the (geometric) mean of the average correlations of the indicators measuring the same construct. High HTMT values indicate a problem with discriminant validity. Based on simulation and previous research,<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Henseler et al. (2015)</ref> recommend that HTMT values should not exceed 0.90 if the path model includes constructs that are conceptually similar (e.g., cognitive job satisfaction and affective job satisfaction). When the constructs are conceptually more distinct, a more conservative, threshold value of 0.85 is recommended. Finally, researchers should use a bootstrapping procedure to determine whether the HTMT value is statistically significantly lower than one.</figDesc></figure>
