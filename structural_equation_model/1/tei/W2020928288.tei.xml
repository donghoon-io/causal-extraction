<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) has been proposed as an extension to structural equation modeling for analyzing data with nested structure. We have begun to see a few applications in cross-cultural research in which MSEM fits well as the statistical model. However, given that cross-cultural studies can only afford collecting data from a relatively small number of countries, the appropriateness of MSEM has been questioned. Using the data from the International Social Survey Program (1997; N = 15,244 from 27 countries), we first showed how Muthén's MSEM procedure could be applied to a real data set on cross-cultural research. Given a small country-level sample size (27 countries) we then demonstrated that results on the individual level were quite stable even when using small individual-level sample sizes, whereas the group-level parameter estimates and their standard errors were affected unsystematically by varying individual-level sample sizes. Use of the findings for cross-cultural research and other areas with limited numbers of groups are discussed.</p><p>Cross-cultural research has initiated many studies on how and why people behave differently across nations. Culture has been widely used as a variable to explain many cross-national behavioral and psychological differences. Conceptually speaking, multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) seems to be the immediate choice of statistical model for a variety of research questions in cross-cultural research. However, MSEM may require large group-level samples of about 100</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hox &amp; Maas, 2001)</ref><p>. This requirement is next to impossible for cross-cultural research, as there are only 200 countries in the world, many of which are small and developing, and it is costly and timely to collect cross-national data. This may be one of the reasons applications of MSEM in cross-cultural research are rare, even though multilevel models have been introduced into cross-cultural research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chao, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">van de Vijver &amp; Leung, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Another possible reason why MSEM in not popular in cross-cultural research is that the model is often seen as complicated and esoteric to many applied-oriented researchers. The statistical techniques of MSEM have been available for more than a decade (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldstein &amp; McDonald, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">B. O. Muthén, 1989)</ref>, but its implementation remained quite daunting to researchers. Recent developments in structural equation modeling (SEM) packages, such as LISREL <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1996)</ref>, EQS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bentler, 1995)</ref>, and Mplus (L. K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2001)</ref>, have, however, eased some of the more complicated aspects of MSEM.</p><p>To shed some light on the applicability of MSEM to cross-cultural research, this study has two objectives. First, MSEM is applied in a typical cross-cultural data set making use of procedures introduced by B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Muthén (1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén ( , 1994) )</ref> that can be applied in nearly all SEM software. By showing that MSEM can now be applied with ease, we hope to demonstrate its usefulness and encourage crosscultural researchers to use the model. Second, to provide some hints on the sample size issue when applying MSEM on cross-cultural research, the performance of MSEM is investigated by varying different sample sizes of individual-level data. By showing the effects of different sample sizes, we hope to provide some practical suggestions for cross-cultural research as well as other areas in which the number of groups may be limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MULTILEVEL STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING Levels Issues in Data Analysis</head><p>Human behavior is complicated and multilevel in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Klein, Tosi, &amp; Cannella, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kozlowski &amp; Klein, 2000)</ref>, prompting considerable debate in many disciplines (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">House, Rousseau, &amp; Thomas-Hunt, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Klein, Dansereau, &amp; Hall, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rousseau, 1985)</ref>. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Klein et al. (1999)</ref>, human behavior is primarily studied within a micro-macro framework, with neither approach fully recognizing the multilevel nature of the data.</p><p>Generally, there are three approaches to analyzing data with nested structures: disaggregation, aggregation, and multilevel models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hofmann, 1997)</ref>. The first approach is one in which only individual-level data are used in the analysis. In cross-cultural literature, disaggregation factor analysis is termed pancultural factor analysis, factor analysis based on only individual-level data disregarding the country grouping <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Triandis et al., 1986)</ref>. Many researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hofmann, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref> criticized this approach as the random sampling assumption required by most statistical techniques is often violated. The standard errors of parameter estimates are underestimated and the test statistics are inflated; that is, Type I errors are much higher than the nominal values <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. Thus, conclusions based on analyzing disaggregated data are usually incorrect.</p><p>The second approach is to aggregate data generated from an individual level into the group level. The aggregated data are used in the analysis only. This type of analysis is also known as ecological analysis. The most famous example in cross-cultural research is <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hofstede's (1980)</ref> ecological factor analysis on data from 117,000 samples of 53 nations and regions. Based on the factor analysis on the country means, Hofstede proposed four cultural dimensions, which are frequently used to explain cross-cultural differences in a variety of disciplines. However, this approach has several problems. First, the resulting sample size is much smaller than the original individual-level data. Second, aggregated data may not always be a fair representation of group-level data <ref type="bibr">(Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000)</ref>. Third, information provided from the aggregated means may ignore potentially meaningful individual-level variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hofmann, 1997)</ref>, such as intracultural variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Au, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Au &amp; Cheung, 2005)</ref> or within-group dispersion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Klein, Conn, Smith, &amp; Sorra, 2001)</ref>. Fourth, researchers may commit ecological fallacy, a logical fallacy inherent in making causal inferences from group-level data to individual-level behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Robinson, 1950)</ref>. Hence, B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén (1994)</ref> concluded that factor analysis based on aggregated data is often misleading, if not incorrect.</p><p>The third approach is multilevel models. These models incorporate individual and group-level data and differentiate group-level and individual-level effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. Similar to the applications of the hierarchical linear model to regression in the context of the multilevel model, MSEM is a direct generalization of SEM in the context of the multilevel model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bentler &amp; Liang, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldstein &amp; McDonald, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Muthén's Model</head><p>The most general approach to estimating multilevel data is full information maximum likelihood (FIML) because of its asymptotic optimality, meaning its estima-tors have the smallest possible standard errors among other estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bentler, 2001)</ref>. However, FIML is computationally demanding to use practically, especially when applied to unbalanced data (i.e., unequal group size). The model specifications with the conventional SEM software can also be very tedious <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bentler, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">B. O. Muthén, 1989)</ref>. To offset this, B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Muthén (1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén ( , 1994) )</ref> proposed a simpler estimator called Muthén's maximum-likelihood-based (MUML) estimator. 2  The MUML estimator is probably the most widely used procedure for applied researchers conducting MSEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Duncan, Alpert, &amp; Duncan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dyer et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kaplan, &amp; Elliott, 1997a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, 1997b)</ref> because it can be easily implemented in nearly all SEM software packages without modifications. Empirical findings suggest that the MUML estimator gives similar results as FIML estimators with rough approximations to the correct chi-square test statistics and standard errors of parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hox, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hox &amp; Maas, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McDonald, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">B. O. Muthén 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">B. O. Muthén , 1994))</ref>. Thus, we use the MUML estimator to illustrate the procedures of MSEM in this study.</p><p>In analyzing multilevel data, observed scores at the individual level y gi are decomposed into a between-group component y g , which equals the aggregated group mean, and a within-group component y w , which equals the centered score from the corresponding group mean. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y gi = y g + y w (1)</formula><p>Because y g and y w are uncorrelated, the total population covariance matrix (Σ T ) can be decomposed into a between-group population covariance matrix (Σ B ) and a pooled within-group population covariance (Σ W ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Σ T = Σ B + Σ W (2)</formula><p>and their sample estimates are S T , S B and S PW , where PW = pooled within-group: and MULTILEVEL STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING 601 2 LISREL 8.54 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(du Toit &amp; du Toit, 2001)</ref> and EQS 6 beta version <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bentler, 2001)</ref> use an FIML and an Expectation Maximization algorithm for MSEM, respectively. Mplus 2.14 (L. K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2001)</ref> uses the MUML estimator "with robust standard errors and chi-square tests of model fit specifically derived for unbalanced data" (p. 380).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 1 1 ( 1) ( )( ) (3) Ng G T g i g i g i S N y y y y - = = ¢ = - - - åå 1 1 ( 1) ( )( ) (4) G B gg g g S G N y y y y - = ¢ = - - - å</formula><p>where G and N are the total number of group and sample sizes, respectively. B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Muthén (1989)</ref> showed that S T and S PW are the consistent and unbiased estimators for Σ T and Σ W , and S B is a consistent and unbiased estimator of</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Σ W + cΣ B , (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>where c is a function of the group sizes, c is the common group size for balanced data. For unbalanced data, it is close to the mean of the group sizes when a large number of groups is used. S T , S B , and S PW can be calculated using standard statistical packages or SEM software. 3 Then S B and S PW can be modeled as a two-group SEM problem with suitable cross-group constraints. Because S PW is an unbiased estimator of Σ W, we can propose a within-structure model Σ W (θ) on S PW directly. As S B is a weighted sum of Σ W and Σ B , a between-and a within-structure model Σ W (θ) and Σ B (θ) are required at the same time to model S B properly. Because the within-structure model is the same in S B and S PW , appropriate cross-group constraints are required. B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Muthén (1989)</ref> suggested a four-step procedure before analyzing MSEM.</p><p>Step 1: Conventional structural equation model of the total sample covariance matrix. In this analysis, the multilevel nested data structure is ig- nored and conventional structural equation model is fitted. The purpose of this step is to detect obvious misspecifications of the proposed model. However, the goodness of fit of the model should not be interpreted on its own, especially for data with large intraclass correlations, large class sizes, or highly correlated variables.</p><p>Step 2: Estimation of between-group variation. If the between-group variations are not present (i.e., Σ B = 0), MSEM can be simplified into conventional SEM. However, as suggested by B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén (1994)</ref>, an easier way to check if Σ B = 0 is to estimate the intraclass correlation or ICC(1) for each item, which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">602 CHEUNG AND AU 2 2 1 1 [ ] [ ( 1 ) ] ( 7 ) G g g c N N N G - = = - - å</formula><p>3 EQS 6, LISREL 8.54, and Mplus 1 (or later versions) can create the between-and within-group covariance matrices easily. Other statistical packages, such as SPSS or SAS, can also be used to calculate the within-and between-group covariance matrices. (8)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">B B W σ σ σ + 1 1 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( 5 ) Ng G PW gi g gi g g i S N G y y y y - = = ¢ = - - - åå</formula><p>where σ B 2 and σ W 2 are the between-and within-group variances, respectively. If ICCs(1) for the variables are not large, conventional SEM analyses are generally reasonable and unbiased <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Julian, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Step 3: Estimation of pooled within-group structure. S PW is used to estimate the pooled within-group structure because it is an unbiased estimator of Σ W . Then the proposed factor structure at the individual level, Σ W (θ), can be proposed to fit the S PW .</p><p>Step 4: Estimation of between-group structure. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chan (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Klein and Kozlowski (2000)</ref>, and B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén (1994)</ref>, among others, the aggregated variables may not have the same meaning as those in the individual-level data; hence, the between-structure model may not be the same as that of the within-structure model. From Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">6</ref>, the MUML estimate of</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Σ B is c -1 (S S B P W 2 2 - ).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The MUML estimate of Σ B is frequently not positively definite, which is usually required by most estimation methods. B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén's (1994)</ref> experience suggested that the analysis of S B or the estimate of Σ B based on Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">9</ref>gives similar results. Thus, S B can be used as a convenient substitute for the MUML estimate in most cases.</p><p>Analysis of multilevel structural equation model. Based on the results from the previous steps, MSEM can be proposed and analyzed with a two-group SEM approach. By analyzing S B and S PW simultaneously, model fit and parameter estimates can be assessed. If the proposed model does not fit the data, standard model modification steps can be used to search for a more meaningful and better fitted model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Issues in MSEM</head><p>When applying a sophisticated statistical method, such as MSEM, practical issues are usually of concern. A fundamental issue is the minimum sample sizes required at the individual and group levels. Because MSEM is quite new, only a few studies have investigated its sample size requirements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hox and Maas (2001)</ref> assessed the robustness of the MUML estimator in unequal groups and small sample sizes at both individual and group levels with a simulation study. They found that problems would occur for small, inadequate group-level samples. They suggested that the group-level sample size should be at least 100 for good performance of the MUML estimator.</p><p>Illustrated examples using MSEM in the literature vary a lot in the sample sizes employed. For instance, B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén (1994)</ref> used a data set with 3,724 students nested within 197 classes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Duncan et al. (1998)</ref> analyzed 1,076 adolescents from 450 households, and <ref type="bibr">Kaplan and</ref><ref type="bibr">Elliott (1997a, 1997b)</ref> analyzed 1,165 students from 356 schools. These studies satisfy the suggestion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hox and Maas (2001)</ref>. However, there are still some studies that do not fulfill the suggestion of group-level sample size larger than 100. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heck (2001)</ref> used 384 participants from 56 groups, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hox (1993)</ref> used only 187 children from 37 families.</p><p>The issue of small group-level sample size becomes even more critical when applying MSEM to cross-cultural research because the cultural-level sample size is always small, whereas the individual-level sample size is comparatively large. For instance, the exploratory analyses on comparing the country and individual factor structures conducted by van de Vijver and Poortinga ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) involved 39 regions and 47,871 respondents, and van Hemert, van ve Vijver, Poortinga, and Georgas's ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) study used a data set with 25,922 respondents from 24 countries. The MSEM study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dyer et al. (1997)</ref> consisted of 1,817 respondents from 17 countries. It is easy to observe that the typical group-level sample size is around 20 to 40, whereas the individual-level sample size can be as large as 100 to 1,000 per country in cross-cultural research.</p><p>Although the group-level sample size is quite small in cross-cultural research, it is unclear whether the large individual-level sample size is beneficial to the overall performance of MSEM, especially the performance at the group level. Regarding multilevel regression, some researchers suggest a trade-off between sample sizes at different levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cohen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mok, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Raudenbush &amp; Liu, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1993)</ref>. That is, increasing individual-level sample size may reduce the group-level sample size requirement. The idea is that increasing individual-level sample size may increase the precision on the estimates of the group means. Thus, S B will be closer to its population value given the same number of group-level samples. Although most findings suggest that increasing the group-level sample size is more beneficial than increasing the individual sample size (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hox &amp; Maas, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1993)</ref>, it is not clear whether the large individual-level sample size in cross-cultural research will help the group-level model fit or parameter estimates in MSEM. Moreover, most of these suggestions on minimum sample sizes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hox &amp; Maas, 2001)</ref> were based on simulation studies with artificial data. The effects of sample sizes on real data are hardly known. To shed light on this issue, we selected several subsamples of individuals that are different in size from a real data set and tested the performance of the MUML estimator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ILLUSTRATION WITH REAL DATA Data and Sample</head><p>A data set from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP, 1997) was used to demonstrate the use of MSEM on cross-cultural research. The complete sample without missing data included 15,244 full-time employees from 27 countries. The sample size per country is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Data collection in most countries used probability-based samples of adults, and a few countries used quota sampling. The questionnaires were specially designed to measure work-oriented variables, such as importance and perception of work attitudes. Thus, it is most suitable for comparing work-related attitudes across countries. Other researchers have successfully used data sets from ISSP for a variety of purposes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blanchflower &amp; Freeman, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 1999)</ref>, suggesting that the data are of good quality. This data set is also typical of those generated from other large-scale studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abramson &amp; Inglehart, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">House, Javidan, Hanges, &amp; Dorfman, 2002)</ref>. If anything, its sample sizes, at both the individual and group level, tend to be small in comparison to other studies. Implications derived from this example are likely to be generalizable to those with similar sample sizes in cross-cultural research. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, we conceptualized a five-factor model on job attitudes based on the work attitude literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karasek, 1979)</ref>. These factors were measured by 14 items:</p><p>Job prospects (F1)-job security (v1), high income (v2), advancement (v3). Job nature (F2)-interesting job (v4), independent work (v5), flexible working hours (v6).</p><p>Citizenship behaviors (F3)-job helps people (v7), useful to society (v8).</p><p>Organizational commitment (F4)-work harder to help the firm (v9), proud working with the firm (v10), stay with the firm even with higher pay by other firms (v11).</p><p>Intention to quit (F5)-days absent in last 6 months (v12), likely to find another job (v13), worry of losing job (v14).</p><p>Three factors, namely job prospects (F1), job nature (F2), and citizenship behaviors (F3), were proposed to influence intention to quit (F5) indirectly through organizational commitment (F4), with organizational commitment acting as the mediator. Detailed item descriptions can be found in ISSP <ref type="bibr">(1997)</ref>. Instead of using a confirmatory factor analytic model as an illustration, we used a full structural equation model because a model with structural relations is more useful in cross-cultural research.</p><p>The individual-level structure model was transformed into the country-level structure model by the direct consensus model, which "uses within-group consensus of the lower level units as the functional relationship to specify how the construct conceptualized and operationalized at the lower level is functionally isomorphic to another form of the construct at the higher level" <ref type="bibr">(Chan, 1998, p. 237</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Klein et al., 2001)</ref>. In direct consensus models, high internal agreement is required and consistent with the need of high intraclass correlation in MSEM.</p><p>To study the effects of sample sizes on MSEM, we randomly selected subsamples without replacement with different sample sizes (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500) from each country. Then, we fitted the model already proposed. In this resampling procedure, the number of countries was fixed but the individual-level sample varied. This is quite similar to the actual data collection in cross-cultural research in which it is much more difficult to collect country-level data than it is to recruit individual participants within a particular country. Because the sample sizes are unbalanced (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), some countries do not have enough data for large samples (e.g., N = 400). This unbalanced sample size situation is also realistic in cross-cultural research in which the samples collected are usually unbalanced across countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Application of MSEM With the Four-Step Data Preparation Process</head><p>Step 1: Conventional structural equation model of the total sample covariance matrix. First, we fitted the model ignoring the nested structure of the data with EQS 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bentler, 2001)</ref>. The proposed model fit the data inadequately, χ 2 (70) = 3,474, p &lt; .001, N = 15, 217, the comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.89, Bentler-Bonett Normed Fit Index (NFI) = 0.89, and root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.057. By ignoring the nested structure of the data, we know little from the rejection of the proposed model. It may be due to the nested structure of the data or because the proposed model does not fit the data adequately, or even both reasons. Moreover, as suggested by B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén (1994)</ref> these results should not be interpreted on their own.  Step 2: Estimation of between-group variation. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the total covariance matrix and the ICC(1) of the variables. The ICC(1) of the variables ranged from .02 (days absent in last 6 months, v12) to .22 (high income, v2). These indicate that the country variation can account for 2% to 22% of the variance of the variables. After reviewing a number of studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">James (1982)</ref> found that ICC(1) values ranged from .00 to .50 with a median value of .12. Bliese (2000) criticized James's approach as overestimating both the range and median of ICC(1) because eta-squared was equated with ICC(1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bliese (2000)</ref> put the typical values at between .05 and .20 based on his experience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>607</head><p>On the other hand, B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén's (1994)</ref> experience with survey data suggested that common values of ICC(1) ranged from .00 to .50. The differences among them may be due to the difference of their disciplines. Moreover, the ICC(1) may underestimate the true intraclass correlation because of the individual-level measurement error (B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén, 1994)</ref>. Our ICC(1) results (.02-.22) are quite typical of others' findings. The results indicate that the data are not independent. MSEM is necessary for making valid statistical inferences.</p><p>Step 3: Fitting pooled-within structure model. By using EQS 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bentler, 2001)</ref> the total covariance matrix was partitioned into pooled within-and between-sample covariance matrices (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The square root of the ad hoc estimator constant or the scaling parameter (c in Equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>) was 23.66. By analyzing S W , the proposed model fitted the data marginally well, χ 2 (70) = 2,820, p &lt; .001, N = 15, 217, CFI = 0.91, NFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.051. These results are consistent with the general findings that analyzing S W gives better results than analyzing S T .</p><p>Step 4: Fitting between structure model. As the sample of group level is not large (G = 27), analyzing S B alone may not be adequate. Hence, this analysis is integrated into the MSEM.</p><p>Step 5: Fitting multilevel structural equation model. The MSEM fitted the data reasonably well with χ 2 (140) = 2,956, p &lt; .001, N = 15, 217, CFI = 0.90, NFI = 0.90, and especially RMSEA = 0.036. These results show that the proposed model fits better under a multilevel framework. The parameter estimates and standard errors of parameter estimates are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>Several observations are made. When comparing MSEM with SEM ignoring the nested structure, the reduction of chi-square is large (∆χ 2 = 518) when compared to the loss of degrees of freedom (∆df = 70). Although the formal chi-square difference test is not appropriate in testing their significance, it is not difficult to see that MSEM fits better than SEM ignoring the nested structure by checking their chi-squares and other goodness-of-fit indexes. Note. The lower and upper matrices are the pooled within-sample and between-sample correlation matrices, respectively. WS and BS stand for the pooled within-sample and between-sample standard deviations, respectively.</p><p>Second, the parameter estimates for the pooled within sample and between sample are not necessarily the same. For instance, v13 (likely to find another job) and v14 (worry of losing job) are good indicators for the intention to quit at the individual level, but they are not good indicators at the country level, as they are not statistically significant. Indeed, the construct of intention to quit is problematic at the country level as none of its indicators are significant. This provides some indication to further investigate the applicability of intention to quit at the country level. The negative relation between organizational commitment and intention to quit at the individual level suggests that people with higher organizational commitment are less likely to quit their jobs. However, this relation does not hold at the country level. On the other hand, the relation between job prospects and citizenship behaviors is stronger at the country level than at the individual level. There- .534 (0.011) -.325 b (0.180)</p><p>Note.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Effects of Sample Size</head><p>The goodness-of-fit indexes of the models with different sample sizes are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. First, as expected, the χ 2 test statistics are directly related to sample size. The differences between small individual-level sample size (N = 50 per country) and large individual-level sample size (N = 500 per country) in terms of goodness-of-fit indexes are not large. What is interesting is that the sample size per country can be as small as 50, yet the results are still comparable with other large sample size conditions.</p><p>Second, the patterns of the goodness-of-fit indexes across group sizes suggest that MSEM is better suited when the individual-level sample size increases. One speculation is that the model fit depends on the between and within models. When the individual-level sample size increases, the within model becomes more stable and fits better. Thus, the overall model fit also increases.</p><p>Third, by comparing the goodness-of-fit indexes across different sample sizes per country, they suggest that CFI and RMSEA are insensitive to the sample sizes used, whereas NFI is relatively insensitive to the sample size. However, before concluding that CFI, RMSEA, and NFI can be routinely used in MSEM with small group sizes, more empirical studies are required. Moreover, there are one or two inadmissible estimates (negative variance of the error terms) in the between-structure model, whereas there is no inadmissible estimate in the within-structure model in all sample sizes. The inadmissible estimates in the between-structure model are likely due to the small group sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hox &amp; Maas, 2001)</ref>. It seems that increasing individual-level sample size may not help much in preventing inadmissible estimates at the group level.  The parameter estimates and their standard errors for the pooled-within and between models are shown in Tables <ref type="table">6</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>. When comparing the parameter estimates and their standard errors for the pooled-within model in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, several results are observed. First, the parameter estimates of the pooled-within analysis are quite comparable with each other even when the sample size is small (N = 50 per country). There are only a few discrepancies across the sample sizes. For instance, the structural paths from job security (F1) to organizational commitment (F4) and job nature (F2) to organizational commitment (F4) are nonsignificant at N = 50 and N = 100 per group but are all significant at N ≥ 200. This indicates that large individual-level sample size is still preferable even though other goodness-of-fit indexes are similar. The standard errors of the parameter estimates are also consistently smaller when the sample sizes get larger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="612">CHEUNG AND AU</head><p>For the parameter estimates and their standard errors in the between-group analysis in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>, no consistent pattern emerges when increasing the individual-level sample sizes. Some parameter estimates, for instance, (v1, F1) and (v2, F1), turn out to be larger when the sample size per group increases, whereas other parameter estimates, for instance, (v11, F4), become smaller when the sample size per group increases. The increase of Level 1 sample sizes can have different effects on the parameter estimates and standard errors on Level 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</head><p>By using the data from ISSP (1997), we showed how B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Muthén's (1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén's ( , 1994) )</ref> procedure could be applied in EQS for analyzing multilevel data. We demonstrated that MSEM can be used to analyze a cross-cultural data set when the group-level sample size is relatively small. It may also be useful in such a situation for other kinds of groups, such as school districts and training programs. Further analysis resulted in an observation concerning application. With respect to model fit, parameter estimates, and their standard errors at the individual level, the required sample sizes for individual level need not be very large. The model fit of sample sizes of 100 or even 50 per country is quite comparable with 500 or even more per country. Consistent with statistical theory, of course, larger sample sizes still result in smaller standard errors at the individual level.</p><p>One important finding is that using different individual-level sample sizes has a nonsystematic impact on the parameter estimates and their standard errors at the group level. In other words, increasing the individual-level sample size does not necessarily benefit the parameter estimates and their standard errors at the group level. Hence, researchers should not increase sample sizes at the individual level and hope that they can help the estimates at the group level. The current findings indicate that statistical inferences at the individual level for MSEM are quite good even with a small number of countries. However, it is not clear whether statistical inferences at the group level can be drawn properly in cross-cultural research when a small number of countries are used.</p><p>Although it may not be possible to increase the number of countries in cross-cultural research, one possible resolution might be to increase the group-level sample size by using regions instead of countries as the sampling unit. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Au (1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Au &amp; Cheung, 2005)</ref> and others, people differ considerably within one country and this difference varies from city to city (or region to region) within the same country. Thus, it may be more theoretically and practically appealing to define cities (or regions) as the group level unit for cross-cultural research.</p><p>Before concluding, one limitation of this study should be addressed. Because the data set was based on a large-scale study collaborated on by researchers in different countries, the resultant individual-level sample sizes were varied. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hox and Maas (2001)</ref>, unbalanced sample sizes may also influence the performance of MSEM. Further studies are required to clarify the unbalanced sample size issues in cross-cultural research.</p><p>All in all, MSEM is a powerful tool for the study of cross-cultural research. It provides superior estimation to other models that ignore the nested data nature, and it requires only simple programming in common SEM packages. Even though the group-level sample size issue needs further investigation, MSEM is still a viable tool that will hopefully become more popular for testing complex multilevel models and theories in cross-cultural research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>FIGURE 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE1A multilevel structural equation model on intention to quit with organizational commitment as the mediator.
