<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has become a key method in international marketing research. Users of PLS-SEM have, however, largely overlooked the issue of endogeneity, which has become an integral component of regression analysis applications.</p><p>This lack of attention is surprising, given that the PLS-SEM method is grounded in regression analysis for which numerous approaches for handling endogeneity have been proposed. To identify and treat endogeneity, and create awareness of how to deal with this issue, this study introduces a systematic procedure that translates control variables, instrumental variables, and Gaussian copulas into a PLS-SEM framework. We illustrate the procedure's efficacy by means of empirical data, and offer recommendations to guide international marketing researchers on how to effectively address endogeneity concerns in their PLS-SEM analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The ambition to make causal claims is fundamental to international marketing research. Consider, for example, a sampling of recent research questions addressed in articles published in Journal of International Marketing: Is coopetition between foreign and local partners good or bad for international joint venture performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Shu et al. 2017</ref>)? How do strategic fit between host-home country similarity and exploration exploitation strategies impact firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Peng Cui et al. 2014</ref>)? Do macroenvironmental factors such as cultural dimensions and globalization forces moderate the relationship between product diversification and market value of large international firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Qiu et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tianjiao 2014</ref>)?</p><p>Analyzing such research questions requires a research design that randomly assigns corporations or customers to different experimental conditions, and then tests for differences among the groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Antonakis et al. 2010)</ref>. However, like in many other fields of scientific inquiry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Clougherty et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sande and Ghosh 2018)</ref>, researchers in international marketing seldom undertake randomized controlled experiments. This is not surprising, given that such experiments are prohibitively expensive, or simply impossible to conduct, due to managers and firms' unwillingness to be randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bascle 2008)</ref>.</p><p>As a consequence, researchers typically rely on survey-based primary data or secondary data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Nakata and Huang 2005)</ref> in which independent variables cannot be exogenously manipulated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Clougherty et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, opportunities for endogeneity to be present are widespread throughout international marketing empirical research designs and data contexts. As <ref type="bibr">Deng (2016, p. 1)</ref> notes, "endogeneity is pervasive and sometimes inevitable in international business and marketing Bollen 2009), there is a paucity of research on this topic in partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wold 1982</ref>) whose usage has recently gained momentum in international marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Richter et al. 2016</ref>) and business research in general (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ali et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Nitzl 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ringle et al. 2018)</ref>. Some researchers even claim that PLS-SEM does not allow for addressing endogeneity at all (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antonakis et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">McIntosh et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rönkkö and Evermann 2013)</ref>. This assertion is astonishing and inaccurate given that PLS-SEM is grounded in regression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lohmöller 1989</ref>, Chapter 2), for which numerous approaches for handling endogeneity exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ebbes et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Park and Gupta 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Staiger and Stock 1997)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Benitez et al. (2016)</ref> recently made an advance in this direction by combining the standard PLS-SEM algorithm with the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method, but did not consider variables that control for endogeneity's sources.</p><p>Overall, research has not yet developed a comprehensive framework that (1) considers the multitude of approaches applicable in PLS-SEM and (2) offers guidelines for assessing endogeneity in this context. It is therefore not surprising that PLS-SEM applications do not use approaches for assessing endogeneity. Specifically, our review of articles published in the tenyear period between 2008 and 2017 in the Journal of International Marketing, International Marketing Review and the Journal of International Business Studies-the three highest ranked international marketing journals in <ref type="bibr">Hult et al.'s (2009)</ref> journal ranking-shows that none of the 43 reviewed PLS-SEM studies tested for endogeneity (Table <ref type="table">A1</ref> in the Appendix).</p><p>Addressing this gap in research, this study explains and illustrates how to deal with endogeneity in PLS-SEM-based international marketing studies. Based on a discussion of endogeneity's roots and consequences, we focus on omitted variables as the principal, and most commonly examined, source of endogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bascle 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Clougherty et al. 2016</ref>). 1 We then describe the different methods of (statistically) responding to endogeneity in regression models and translate these to a PLS-SEM context. Based on the above-mentioned discussion, we offer a systematic procedure for identifying and treating endogeneity in PLS-SEM and illustrate its use in an empirical example of corporate reputation, a concept frequently examined in international marketing and business research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREATING ENDOGENEITY IN REGRESSION MODELS</head><p>While endogeneity can have various roots, such as measurement errors, simultaneous causality, common method variance, and (un)observed heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bascle 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">McIntosh et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Papies et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sande and Ghosh 2018)</ref>, endogeneity problems most often arise from omitted variables that correlate with one or more independent variable(s) and the dependent variable(s) in the regression model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bijmolt et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rossi 2014</ref>). Omitting such variables induces a correlation between the corresponding independent variables and the dependent variables' error term <ref type="bibr">(Wooldridge 2010)</ref>. That is, the independent variables then not only explain the dependent variable, but also the error in the model.</p><p>Consider the following regression model where 検 represents the dependent variable, x1 and x2 are independent variables, 紅 待 the intercept, 紅 怠 and 紅 態 the regression coefficients of x1 and x2, and 綱 the error term:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">検 = 紅 待 + 紅 怠 捲 怠 + 紅 態 捲 態 + 綱,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Let us assume that the independent variable x2 is uncorrelated with 綱 (i.e., x2 is exogenous), whereas x1 is endogenous since it is correlated with the error term 綱 (i.e., 系剣懸(捲 怠 , 綱) 塙 0).</p><p>Hence, endogeneity occurs in this regression model example. Note that this terminology, which is used in the endogeneity literature <ref type="bibr">(Wooldridge 2010)</ref>, should not be confused with the terms used for the explanation of PLS path models with exogenous (i.e., independent) and endogenous (i.e., dependent) constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chin 1998</ref>). In the following, and in line with the literature, we refer to endogenous and exogenous to identify variables that endogeneity does (not) impact; we use dependent and independent to identify constructs that explain other constructs in the PLS path model, or are explained by them.</p><p>A straightforward way of handling, or at least reducing, endogeneity is to specify a set of control variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bernerth and Aguinis 2016)</ref> accounting for a part of the dependent variable's variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ebbes et al. 2017)</ref>. While carefully chosen control variables often alleviate endogeneity problems substantially <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref>, the success of this endeavor depends on the researcher's ability to</p><p>(1) identify relevant control variables, and (2) collect corresponding data. Furthermore, specifying a great number of control variables does not necessarily account for all of endogeneity in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bascle 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Reeb et al. 2012</ref>) and contradicts the basic philosophy of Occam's razor (i.e., the principle of parsimony) upon which the scientific discipline rests.</p><p>Despite their careful selection of control variables, researchers also need to apply a statistical approach to address endogeneity, if there could be a potential endogeneity problem. Two broad statistical approaches have been developed to examine the presence of endogeneity: instrumental variable and instrumental variable-free approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrumental Variable Approaches</head><p>In econometrics and other areas of applied research, the instrumental variable (IV) approach is the technique of choice when dealing with endogeneity (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bound et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Staiger and Stock 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Villas-Boas and Winer 1999)</ref>. This approach uses information in additionally specified independent variables (called IVs) to decompose the endogenous independent variables' variance into two parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bascle 2008</ref>): The exogenous part, which does not correlate with the error term, and the endogenous part, which still correlates with the error term. The estimation of the regression model then only uses the exogenous part, which endogeneity does not affect, to provide unbiased and consistent regression estimates. The IV approach is usually implemented by means of the 2SLS algorithm. This algorithm's first stage involves regressing an independent variable on an IV, followed by computing the predicted values from this equation and using them as input for re-estimating the original model in the second stage.</p><p>To illustrate the approach, consider the regression model example given in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>. Let us assume that the independent variable x1 is endogenous, whereas x2 is exogenous. The first stage of the IV approach involves regressing the endogenous variable x1 on the exogenous variable x2</p><p>and the IV z:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">捲 怠 = 紘 待 + 紘 怠 権 + 紘 態 捲 態 + 耕.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, 紘 待 represents the intercept, 紘 怠 the regression coefficient of z, 紘 態 the regression coefficient of 捲 態 , and 耕 the error term. Estimating Equation 2 yields predicted values of x1 (i.e., 捲 賦 怠 ), which express the exogenous part of the independent variable 捲 怠 . In the second stage, we replace 捲 怠 in the original regression model (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) with 捲 賦 怠 to estimate the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">検 = 紅旺 待 + 紅旺 怠 捲 賦 怠 + 紅旺 態 捲 態 + 綱旺.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Endogeneity occurs when there is a significant difference between 紅 怠 (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and 紅旺 怠 (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>), with the latter representing the influence of the independent variable's exogenous part on y. To test for this difference, researchers use the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hausman 1978)</ref>. If the test indicates a significant difference between the 紅 estimates, researchers should revert to the endogeneity-corrected estimates (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>).  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>).</p><p>To work effectively, the IVs must meet two criteria: the instrument relevance criterion and the exclusion restriction. First, according to the instrument relevance criterion, the correlation of each IV with the endogenous variable should be strong, which means that the IV's effect 紘 怠 on the dependent variable 捲 怠 in Equation 2 must be pronounced and significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>If it is not, the corrected 紅 coefficient estimates (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) may be considerably biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rossi 2014)</ref>. But as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bound et al. (1993)</ref>  adequacy. In contrast, situations with multiple endogenous variables require considering at least the same number of IVs to ensure that the approach draws on an identified, or over-identified, model <ref type="bibr">(Murray 2006b)</ref>.</p><p>Second, according to the exclusion restriction for evaluating IVs when examining endogeneity, each IV should not be correlated with the error term in the original regression model <ref type="bibr">(Murray 2006b)</ref>. This requirement cannot be assessed statistically unless the researcher specifies more IVs than endogenous variables. In this case, the Sargan test and the Hansen's J test allow testing for significant correlations between the IVs and the error term <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bascle 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wooldridge 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Rejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation, however, does not help to verify which of the IVs are endogenous <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref>. While this test provides some empirical substantiation when the first stage model is over-identified, researchers should primarily rely on theoretical arguments when assessing the IVs' adequacy (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Murray 2006a</ref>).</p><p>Research has proposed the control function approach, a modification of the 2SLS method, which also leverages IVs to control for endogeneity. Specifically, the control function approach draws on the first stage regression (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) to obtain the fitted residuals (捲 賦 怠 伐 捲 怠 ), which are then included in the original model to obtain correct(ed) estimates of the coefficients. Furthermore, to interpreting the significance of the fitted residuals requires running the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref>. That is, if a coefficient is significant, researchers should revert to the endogeneity-corrected estimates.</p><p>The control function approach is particularly advantageous when estimating regression models with discrete dependent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Petrin and Train 2010)</ref>. However, such model types currently cannot be estimated in PLS-SEM since the standard algorithm requires the dependent constructs to be continuous <ref type="bibr">(Lohmöller 1989, Chapter 4)</ref>. For linear models as typically estimated in PLS-SEM, the control function approach yields exactly the same results as the 2SLS approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrumental Variable-Free Approaches</head><p>When considering the IV approach, identifying conceptually fitting IVs is very challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rossi 2014)</ref>, especially in light of the data constraints characterizing a typical research project.</p><p>Research has suggested instrument-free approaches that do not require IVs to be specified as a solution. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Park and Gupta (2012)</ref> introduced the Gaussian copula approach, which controls for endogeneity by directly modeling the correlation between the endogenous variable and the error term by means of a copula. Another instrument-free approach, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ebbes et al. (2005)</ref>, is conceptually similar to the IV approach in that it splits an endogenous variable into an exogenous and an endogenous part. However, this latent instrumental variables (LIVs) approach does not draw on an observed variable, but generates an unobserved (i.e., latent) IV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ebbes et al. (2005)</ref> assume that the latent instrument is discrete with at least two categories, separating the sample into L latent categories. As such, the LIV approach belongs to the class of normal mixture models with L components <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref> whose model parameters can be identified for 詣 &gt; 1 and non-normality of the endogenous regressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ebbes et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The LIV approach can be used in a PLS-SEM context, but a fundamental challenge in its application is the selection of the number of categories L. A priori, this number is unknown but has a substantial effect on the results. While <ref type="bibr">Papies et al. (2016, p. 609)</ref> suggest that "the researcher fits at least 詣 = 2, 3, 4 and 5," there is no clear guidance regarding the desired stability of the estimates in order to vary L and, hence, regarding this parameter's final choice. At the same time, while the statistical software R facilitates the use of the Gaussian copula approach, current software support for the LIV approach is limited because models can only include one independent and one dependent variable (REndo package version 1.3). As these two issues limit the LIV approach's applicability, we focus on the Gaussian Copula approach, which allows correcting for endogeneity in the absence of IVs.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of (1) the control variable approach, (2) the IV approach, and (3) two types of IV-free approaches (i.e., Gaussian copula and LIV) when dealing with endogeneity in PLS-SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADDRESSING ENDOGENEITY IN PLS-SEM</head><p>Procedure PLS-SEM is a statistical method to estimate path models with latent variables <ref type="bibr">(Lohmöller 1989, Chapter 2;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wold 1982)</ref>. Unlike factor-based SEM, which considers constructs as common factors that explain the covariation between the associated indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Jöreskog 1978)</ref>, PLS-SEM is a composite-based approach to SEM that uses linear combinations of indicator variables to represent conceptual variables in a statistical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Henseler et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sarstedt et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>PLS-SEM estimates the parameters of a set of equations in a structural equation model by combining an approach similar to principal components analysis with regression-based path analysis. Specifically, the PLS-SEM method uses partial regressions to estimate the path coefficients between the latent variables and their indicators in the measurement models, as well as between the latent variables in the structural model; for instance, <ref type="bibr">Lohmöller (1989, Chapter 2)</ref> and give an introduction to the PLS-SEM algorithm. Approaches for dealing with endogeneity in regression models can therefore be readily transferred to PLS-SEM. However, contrary to regression analysis, in which the approaches use the (observed) indicator variables as input, their implementation in PLS-SEM draws on the composite scores obtained after the algorithm's convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lohmöller 1989</ref>, Chapter 2). 2 Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref> illustrates our systematic procedure for dealing with endogeneity in PLS-SEM. The following sections discuss each step in greater detail.</p><p>=== Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref> about here === Stage 1 of the procedure requires checking if testing for endogeneity is necessary. Specifically, the meaningfulness of considering endogeneity in PLS-SEM depends on whether researchers use the method for predictive or explanatory modeling purposes. In predictive modeling, the purpose of the analysis is to predict new or future observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Shmueli 2010)</ref>. Here, the main concern is predicting the case values of the dependent variables, rather than (causally) interpreting the structural paths. Controlling for endogeneity is not useful in this case, as it may reduce the model's predictive power <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ebbes et al. 2005)</ref>. Conversely, in explanatory modeling, which involves "the use of statistical models for testing causal explanations," <ref type="bibr">(Shmueli 2010, p. 290)</ref> controlling for endogeneity is crucial in order to adequately test hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In practice, however, researchers using PLS-SEM generally balance prediction and explanation in that they expect their model to have high predictive accuracy, while also being grounded in well-developed causal explanations <ref type="bibr">(Sarstedt et al. 2017a</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gregor (2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 626)</ref> refers to this interplay as explanation and prediction theory, noting that this approach "implies both understanding of underlying causes and prediction, as well as description of theoretical constructs and the relationships among them." Such a setting may require the consideration of endogeneity, depending on whether explanation (i.e., testing theory) or prediction (e.g., to derive managerial recommendations) prevail in a certain research project.</p><p>Stage 2 of the procedure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>) uses existing theory and prior research findings to identify potential endogeneity issues a priori. If prior research adequately theorized, detected, and treated endogeneity issues in a specific research context, this knowledge should be applied when proposing a PLS path model and collecting data. This typically involves including control variables in the model, or gathering data on IVs for an ex post assessment, using the IV approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ebbes et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Reeb et al. 2012</ref>). Thus, if prior research suggested that endogeneity is an issue, or the results cast doubt that all the endogeneity sources have been detected, researchers should also test whether endogeneity substantially affects the model estimates.</p><p>To do so, Stage 3 of the procedure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>) applies the Gaussian copula approach. estimates and specify the reason(s) for not addressing the potential endogeneity issues as a limitation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Gaussian copula approach in PLS-SEM</head><p>To illustrate the Gaussian copula approach in PLS-SEM, consider a simple path model with one dependent latent variable Y1, explained by two independent latent variables X1 and X2. Each of the latent variables is measured using three indicators. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows this simple path model.</p><p>The hexagons represent composites formed by linear combinations of the indicator variables, as indicated by the arrows linking the indicators and the composites. These arrows do not necessarily correspond to the measurement model specification, which can be reflective or formative <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Sarstedt et al. 2016</ref>). However, we use this illustration because PLS-SEM forms </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">桁 = 紅 待 + 紅 怠 隙 怠 + 紅 態 隙 態 + 綱<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Let us assume that the independent variable X1 is thought to be correlated with the error term (綱)</p><p>of the dependent variable Y, and may therefore induce an endogeneity problem in the estimation of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>.</p><p>The Gaussian copula approach requires the composite scores of the endogenous construct X1 to be non-normally distributed. If this requirement is met, the Gaussian copula of X1 can be calculated as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Papies et al. 2016)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">潔 茅 = 貸怠 (茎(隙 怠 )),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 茎(捲) is the empirical cumulative density function and 貸怠 is the inverse normal cumulative density function. Next, the copula is included as an additional independent variable that controls for the correlation between the error term and the endogenous independent construct in the regression model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">検 = 紅 待 + 紅 怠 嫗 捲 怠 + 紅 態 嫗 捲 態 + 紅 戴 潔 怠 茅 + 綱旺 (6)</formula><p>To attend to the endogeneity problem, estimating Equation 6 yields the new path coefficients 紅 怠 嫗 and 紅 態 嫗 .</p><p>To determine whether endogeneity is at a critical level, researchers need to assess the copula coefficient's (紅 戴 ) significance using bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hausman 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Park and Gupta 2012)</ref>. A significant coefficient indicates a critical level of endogeneity. If the copula coefficient is significant, researchers can assume that an endogeneity issue is presenteven though treated by including the copula in the regression model (Equation <ref type="formula">6</ref>). If the coefficient is not significant, no critical endogeneity issue affects the regression results.</p><p>While the standard Gaussian copula approach assumes a single endogenous variable, Park and Gupta (2012) also discuss the case of modeling multiple endogenous variables simultaneously.</p><p>Doing so requires creating the copula for each individual endogenous variable and adding all copulas to the original model. The procedure separately computes all the Gaussian copulas of the specified endogenous variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Park and Gupta 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Variables in PLS-SEM</head><p>If the Gaussian copula approach indicates a significant degree of endogeneity, researchers should use control variables to identify its sources. The introduction of control variables should always be grounded in strong theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bernerth and Aguinis 2016)</ref>. That is, researchers should be explicit (rather than implicit) regarding the role of control variables in the analysis and potentially even match the hypotheses precisely to their choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Spector and Brannick 2010)</ref>. Typical examples of control variables used in international marketing models include a company's location, age, size, export experience, years of global experience, percentage of products sold overseas, number of countries entered, and cultural distance (e.g., Peng <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Cui et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Shu et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The use of control variables in PLS-SEM is analogous to regression models. More precisely, control variables are included as single-item constructs in a PLS path model. Each control variable is then linked to the dependent latent variable whose predictor constructs have been identified (or are assumed to be) as possibly exhibiting endogeneity. Note that criticism of the use of single-item constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Diamantopoulos et al. 2012)</ref> does not apply to control variables, as they usually represent observable characteristics. However, if the control variables represent unobservable concepts (e.g., cultural dimensions), they need to be measured by means of multiple items. Finally, the interpretation of the control variables' effect is also analogous to regression models and depends on each control variable's measurement scale, which can be categorical or metric in PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hair et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Once specified, researchers need to use bootstrapping to assess the control variables' significance. Similar to the analysis of interaction effects in PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hair et al. 2017</ref>; Chapter 7), the assessment of significant control variables should use the f 2 effect size to also consider their relevance. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chin (1998)</ref> f² values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 suggest small, moderate, and substantial effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Instrumental Variable Approach in PLS-SEM</head><p>Implementing the IV approach in the context of PLS-SEM requires adjusting the final stage of the PLS-SEM algorithm. In its original form, this stage uses the composite scores obtained after convergence as input to run a series of ordinary least squares regressions that estimate the structural model path coefficients. Instead of using ordinary least squares regressions, however, this stage now uses 2SLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Benitez et al. 2016)</ref>. When implementing the IV approach in PLS-SEM, researchers need to ensure that they include at least one IV per endogenous variable.</p><p>Analogous to regression analysis, the IV approach's implementation requires researchers to find IVs that are highly correlated with the independent variables (instrument relevance), but are uncorrelated with the dependent variable's error term (exclusion restriction). In international marketing, previous regression-based models used IVs such as the organization quality, brand quality, environmental causes, brand strength <ref type="bibr">(Swoboda and Hirschmann 2017)</ref>, exposure to a multinational companies' marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Swoboda and Hirschmann 2016)</ref>, and export memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Souchon et al. 2016</ref>). However, the identification of suitable IVs is highly context-specific and the most challenging step in the analysis (e.g., Larcker and Rusticus 2010). <ref type="bibr">Angrist and Pischke (2009, p. 17)</ref> argue that finding good IVs requires "a combination of institutional knowledge and ideas about processes determining the variable of interest," especially as there is no true test for their quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rossi 2014)</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate the implementation of the IV approach in PLS-SEM, consider the simple model in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> with the construct X1 possibly exhibiting endogeneity. We now introduce an IV (i.e., Z1), measured by three indicators, that correlates strongly with the construct X1, but not with the error term of Y1 in the original model. Thereafter, we create and estimate the model shown in Next, a 2SLS analysis uses the composite scores of X1 and X2, obtained from the first model (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), and the composite scores of Z1, derived from the second model (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>Specifically, we regress X1 on Z1 and X2 to obtain 隙 侮 怠 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">隙 侮 怠 = 紘 待 + 紘 怠 傑 怠 + 紘 態 隙 態 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We first assess the IV's strength by comparing the R² values of the first stage regression (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>) with and without the IV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model and Data</head><p>To illustrate our procedure for identifying and treating endogeneity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>), we draw on a corporate reputation model originally presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eberl (2010)</ref>. The goal of this model is to explain the effects of competence (COMP) and likeability (LIKE), which represent corporate reputation's two dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Sarstedt et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Schwaiger 2004)</ref>, on customer satisfaction (CUSA), and ultimately on customer loyalty (CUSL). This model has been used to illustrate aspects of the PLS-SEM method (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hair et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hair et al. 2018)</ref> and has also been frequently applied in an international marketing context. 3 For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Zhang and Schwaiger (2012)</ref> use this model to study the differentiating effects of corporate social responsibility and other antecedent dimensions on corporate reputation in three Western countries (Germany, the USA, and the UK) and in China. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Radomir and Alan (2018)</ref> apply this model to contrast the effects of service quality and relationship investment on corporate reputation assessments of Romanian and UK consumers. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Walsh et al. (2009)</ref> developed and validated a variant of this model using cross-country data, which features prominently in the international marketing literature. For example, several researchers have used this model to analyze the moderating effect of institutional country differences <ref type="bibr">(Swoboda et al. 2016</ref>) and cultural dimensions <ref type="bibr">(Swoboda and Hirschmann 2017)</ref> on the relationship between corporate reputation and customer loyalty.  <ref type="bibr">2004</ref>). However, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eberl (2010)</ref>, who elaborates on the causal effects of corporate reputation's two components (i.e., COMP and LIKE) on CUSA and CUSL, we consider our analysis primarily explanatory in nature. Hence, following Stage 1 of the procedure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>), we continue by applying the Gaussian copula approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application of the Gaussian copula approach in PLS-SEM</head><p>Before initiating the Gaussian copula approach, to meet its assumptions, we first verify if the variables, which potentially exhibit endogeneity, are non-normally distributed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>). We do so by running the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Lilliefors correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sarstedt and Mooi 2014)</ref> on the standardized composite scores of COMP, LIKE, and CUSA, which the PLS path model estimation provides. The results show that none of the constructs has normally distributed scores, which allows us to consider them endogenous in the Gaussian copula analysis.</p><p>Next, we create three regression models in which we consider the independent constructs COMP (model 1), LIKE (model 2), and CUSA (model 3) as possibly exhibiting endogeneity. In addition, to simultaneously account for multiple endogenous variables when applying the Gaussian copula approach, we create four regression models that include all possible combinations of multiple endogenous variables in this PLS path model example: LIKE and COMP (model 4), LIKE and CUSA (model 5), COMP and CUSA (model 6), and LIKE, COMP, and CUSA (model 7).</p><p>We use the constructs' standardized composite scores to compute the Gaussian copula of the partial regressions in the structural model. To cross-validate the results, we used two different statistical software packages, which returned the same results: STATA 14 (StataCorp 2015) and the REndo package of the R program <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gui et al. 2017</ref>). To implement STATA, we used specific commands (1) to compute the Gaussian cumulative distribution function, (2) to create the copula as the inverse of the Gaussian normal cumulative distribution function, and (3) to calculate the model that includes the Gaussian copula. Since the REndo package does not currently support the computation bootstrap standard errors, we used our own R code and the boot package <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Canty and Ripley 2017)</ref> to run this part of the analyses.</p><p>The results in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> show that only one Gaussian copula (i.e., cCUSA) is significant (p &lt; 0.1) when treating one endogenous variable, which points to a potential endogeneity issue. Including the significant Gaussian copula in the model changes the effect of CUSA on CUSL by 0.073 units (from 0.509 to 0.582), which points to a potential endogeneity problem for CUSA (model 3).</p><p>Similarly, cCUSA is also significant in the CUSA models in combination with LIKE (model 5, p &lt; 0.1), COMP (model 6, p &lt; 0.05), and LIKE and COMP (model 7, p &lt; 0.1). This confirms the possibility of CUSA being endogenous. 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application of the control variable approach in PLS-SEM</head><p>Following Stage 3 of the procedure for identifying and treating endogeneity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>), we next include control variables in the model, which from a theoretical perspective, are likely to influence customers' loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eberl 2010)</ref>. The first control variable (serviceprovider) distinguishes between large, globally operating mobile phone services providers (serviceprovider=1; n(1) = 251) and smaller, locally operating competitors (serviceprovider=2; n(2) = 85). In addition, we include a second control variable (servicetype), which is relevant from a service marketing perspective and distinguishes between customers with a contract and those with a prepaid plan.</p><p>Analyzing the impact of the two control variables, both separately and jointly, shows that neither has a significant influence on the CUSL construct. Specifically, the servicetype variable has a -0.003 effect (sig.=0.917; f²=0.000), and the serviceprovider variable has a -0.038 effect (sig.=0.319; f²=0.003) on CUSL when included separately. Including both control variables simultaneously changes the results only marginally. As none of the control variables identifies a source of endogeneity, we continue with the procedure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>) by running the IV approach on the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application of the IV approach in PLS-SEM</head><p>The application of the IV approach in the context of our model requires selecting an IV that is correlated with COMP, CUSA, and LIKE. At the same time, the IV needs to be uncorrelated with the omitted determinants of customer loyalty and, hence, be uncorrelated with CUSL's error term. Our implementation of the IV approach uses customers' perceived switching costs as an IV. Switching costs comprise the time, money, and effort that consumers expect to expend when changing the service provider. In the mobile phone market, switching costs come primarily in the form of transfer costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Klemperer 1987</ref>) when ending a relationship with one provider and starting a new one with another. Specifically, the implementation and configuration of the new relationship require the customer to invest time, effort, and other assets, while ending an old service may also require procedural tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Ray et al. 2012)</ref>. Hence, in terms of the instrument relevance criterion, it is reasonable to assume that the perceived switching costs correlate with the customers' satisfaction and reputation assessments, because significant transfer costs limit their freedom to configure the business relationship. Given the manifold factors that influence loyalty, arguing that perceived switching costs are uncorrelated with omitted variables that affect customer loyalty (exclusion restriction) is more difficult. However, research has identified customers' variety seeking tendency-that is, the "tendency of individuals to seek diversity in their choices of services or goods" <ref type="bibr">(Kahn 1995, p. 139</ref>)-as a major determinant of customer loyalty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Berné et al. 2001)</ref>. Since this tendency is a psychological trait that is independent of individuals' preference structures and is stable over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Menon and Kahn 1995)</ref>, variety seeking is probably unrelated to customers' perception of the switching costs. Network quality is another key determinant of customer loyalty that is relevant for the context of our study (e.g., in terms of coverage, stability, and voice quality; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lim et al. 2006)</ref>. Network quality can differ substantially, especially in rural areas, and cannot be fully observed a priori. Poor network coverage will have a strong negative effect on customer loyalty, independent of the customers' perception of the switching costs. 5   We use an extended version of <ref type="bibr">Jones et al.'s (2000)</ref> scale and measure the switching costs by using four reflective indicators (switch1 to switch4), each measured on a five-point Likert scale.</p><p>For our analysis, we extract all (standardized) composite scores from the SmartPLS 3 software.</p><p>We subsequently run the IV approach by using STATA's ivregress method (StataCorp 2017), as well as the statistical software R with its AER package <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kleiber and Zeileis 2017)</ref>, to validate the results. Both programs provide the same results. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the results of the analysis for the IVs.</p><p>To assess if the IV is strong (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>), we use the weakID test's F-value, which compares the R² values of the first stage regression with and without the IV. We consider three models, each of which considers another predictor construct of CUSL as likely to exhibit endogeneity (i.e., LIKE, COMP, and CUSA). The results in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> show that including the IV significantly increases the Including switching costs as an IV does not explain the endogeneity problem's origin. More specifically, the IV correction of CUSA increases the corresponding point estimate to above one, further indicating that the switching costs construct is not a suitable IV.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1 st stage</formula><p>Following the procedure in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we should therefore examine the results of the Gaussian copula approach. Specifically, researchers should reinterpret the results that assume CUSA is endogenous, since including CUSA's significant Gaussian copula in the model changes the relationship of CUSA on CUSL from 0.509 to 0.582 (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). This finding is in line with prior research, which has theoretically and empirically substantiated endogeneity problems with customer satisfaction, especially its relationship to customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ivanov et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, this analysis also illustrates that, in the context of our empirical example, considering endogeneity does not, from a theory testing perspective, change any conclusions drawn from the model estimation.</p><p>To summarize, by carrying out the procedure shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>, we identified a potential endogeneity issue based on the Gaussian Copula results. However, we have not been able to explain the problem by the available control and instrumental variables. Thus, in this kind of situation the researcher should report the Gaussian Copula approach's solution, acknowledging that the findings do not reveal the origins of the endogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>While addressing endogeneity has become an integral component of regression-based analyses in international marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jean et al. 2016)</ref>, users of the PLS-SEM method have overlooked this issue. A potential reason for this disregard is the predictive nature of PLS-SEM, which, if taken into full consideration when using the method, renders endogeneity irrelevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ebbes et al. 2011</ref>). However, researchers conventionally use PLS-SEM to test formal hypotheses, which corresponds to an explanation perspective, while simultaneously deriving managerial implications, which follows a prediction perspective. Endogeneity becomes an important concern, therefore, depending on whether researchers emphasize explanation or prediction in their analyses.</p><p>Similar to scholars who have applied PLS-SEM in international marketing and other disciplines, methodological researchers have also failed to consider endogeneity in PLS-SEM, with some authors suggesting that endogeneity cannot be accounted for in a PLS-SEM framework (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antonakis et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rönkkö and Evermann 2013)</ref>. Such notions are astonishing, since PLS-SEM is a regression-based technique, which makes common approaches for identifying and treating endogeneity accessible in this specific methodological context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Benitez et al. (2016)</ref> took a first step in this direction by combining the standard PLS-SEM algorithm with the 2SLS method without, however, considering actual IVs that allow for decomposing the independent variables' variance into endogenous and exogenous parts. Broadening the scope of their research, this study introduces a systematic procedure for identifying and treating endogeneity in PLS-SEM that takes into account the most recent statistical developments in the literature on endogeneity. Specifically, implementing the Gaussian copula approach addresses the significant concerns associated with identifying strong and valid IVs. Moreover, combining this novel approach with the inclusion of control variables and the classic IV approach enables a comprehensive assessment of endogeneity when applying PLS-SEM for explanatory purposes.</p><p>Our application of the procedure to empirical data discloses endogeneity in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eberl's (2010)</ref> corporate reputation model, which has been frequently used in different variations in international marketing and international business research (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Swoboda et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Zhang and Schwaiger 2012)</ref>. Our analysis suggests that the CUSA construct is subject to endogeneity but control variables or IVs were not able to handle this problem. Correcting for endogeneity using the Gaussian copula approach leads to a pronounced change in the model estimates, while nevertheless leaving the general conclusions intact.</p><p>We hope this article will be the starting point for future PLS-SEM research on endogeneity.</p><p>Researchers may endeavor to introduce bootstrapping-based approaches to test the strength of an ways for a benchmarking study of the Gaussian copula and LIV approaches in the context of PLS-SEM. In these regards, a Monte Carlo simulation study, in which prespecified levels of endogeneity bias the parameter estimates, would allow for comparing the IV and IV-free approaches' efficacy regarding identifying and treating endogeneity.</p><p>Recent PLS-SEM developments, such as the consistent PLS-SEM approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dijkstra and Henseler 2015)</ref>, which allows for mimicking factor-based SEM results, and the introduction of model fit criteria into PLS-SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Henseler et al. 2014</ref>) may help researchers with specific explanatory research goals. The next logical step is to extend PLS-SEM's capabilities to address endogeneity issues in empirical international marketing research when using consistent PLS-SEM to estimate models on the grounds of common factor model data <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rigdon et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sarstedt et al. 2016)</ref>. This kind of advancement should be straightforward in terms of our research findings, since the consistent PLS-SEM method uses the composite scores obtained from a standard PLS-SEM-based estimation as input.</p><p>Future research should also explore other approaches to detect endogeneity problems in PLS-SEM. Research has brought forward a number of latent class techniques such as finite mixture PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hair et al. 2018)</ref>, PLS prediction oriented segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Becker et al. 2013)</ref>, and PLS iterative reweighted regression segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Schlittgen et al. 2016)</ref> to uncover unobserved heterogeneity. <ref type="bibr">Sarstedt et al. (2017b)</ref> recently introduced a systematic procedure for identifying and treating unobserved heterogeneity in PLS path models. Combining several latent class techniques, the procedure enables researchers to (1) check if unobserved heterogeneity has a critical impact on the results, (2) decide on the number of latent segments to retain from the data, and (3) recover the segment-specific model estimates. However, future research needs to assess the interplay between the various sources of heterogeneity on the one hand and endogeneity on the other and develop guidelines to assess if endogeneity is at a non-critical level in the segmentspecific solutions.</p><p>It would be particularly interesting to also consider the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of regression models (fsQCA; Woodside 2013). A joint consideration of these techniques may allow researchers to better assess and control for endogeneity embedded in unobserved heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ivanov et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Schlittgen et al. 2016)</ref>. Moreover, in this study we did not address how to deal with endogeneity issues in PLS path models that include interaction terms, which are used, for example, in PLS-SEM-based moderator analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hair et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Henseler and Chin 2010)</ref>. As international marketing researchers frequently apply such analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jin et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leonidou et al. 2017)</ref>, future studies should use insights from research on regression analysis (e.g., by using special 2SLS analyses to account for interaction terms and IVs or the control function approach; see, for example, Sande and Ghosh 2018) to furnish recommendations on how to adequately address this issue in PLS-SEM.</p><p>Finally, in its standard form PLS-SEM does not support estimating longitudinal or panel data without limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Roemer 2016)</ref>. Once the PLS-SEM method advances in these directions, assessing the efficacy of other approaches for handling endogeneity, such as the lagged variable approach et al. 2016), the cross-lagged correlation procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Tyagi and Wotruba 1993)</ref>, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arellano-Bond (1991)</ref> estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kumar and Pansari 2016)</ref>, and the Granger causality test <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Filipescu et al. 2013)</ref>, would be particularly interesting. Relatedly, extending the PLS-SEM algorithm to accommodate binary dependent variables would provide an opportunity to consider endogeneity methods specific to such model settings, such as the control function approach and its extensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Garen 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wooldridge 2015)</ref>. These kinds of advances would be particularly beneficial for international marketing research, which frequently relies on longitudinal and panel data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kumar and Pansari 2016)</ref>, as well as binary outcome variables (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Obadia et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Westjohn et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>48  This implementation is similar to other methodological extensions, such as finite mixture PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hair et al. 2018)</ref>, which uses composite scores as input for mixture regressions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>composites from the indicator variables to represent the conceptual variables in the model estimation. === Insert Figure 2 about here === Model estimation in PLS-SEM draws on a three-stage approach that belongs to the family of (alternating) least squares algorithms (Mateos-Aparicio 2011).

The algorithm converges when the indicator weights change only marginally from one iteration to the next. Stages 2 and 3 use the final composite scores from Stage 1 as input for a series of ordinary least squares regressions. These regressions produce the final indicator loadings, indicator weights, and path coefficients, as well as related elements, such as the indirect and total effects, and R 2 values (e.g., Sarstedt et al. 2017a). With reference to our example, the final stage of the PLS-SEM algorithm entails regressing Y on X1 and X2 to estimate the structural model path coefficients 紅 怠 and 紅 態 :</figDesc></figure>
