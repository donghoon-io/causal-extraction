<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is of methodological importance to see how seemingly unrelated statistical methods can be linked together. Consider the classic example of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression. Before the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cohen (1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cohen &amp; Cohen, 1975)</ref>, "the textbooks in 'psychological' statistics treat[ed multiple regression, ANOVA, and ANCOVA] quite separately, with wholly different algorithms, nomenclature, output, and examples" <ref type="bibr">(Cohen, 1968, p. 426)</ref>. Understanding the mathematical equivalence between an ANOVA (and analysis of covariance, or AN-COVA) and a multiple regression helps us to comprehend the details behind the general linear model.</p><p>Another important example in social statistics has been the development of structural equation modeling (SEM; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bentler, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bollen, 1989</ref>; Jo ¨reskog &amp; So ¨rbom, the findings" (p. 3). It is also known as research synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cooper &amp; Hedges, 1994)</ref>, the combining of information <ref type="bibr">(National Research Council, 1992)</ref>, and systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Petticrew &amp; Roberts, 2006)</ref>. It has become the standard methodology in synthesizing research findings in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences.</p><p>Meta-analysis and SEM have their own traditions and terminologies. They are usually treated as two unrelated topics in the literature. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Stapleton and Leite (2005)</ref> reviewed 55 SEM course syllabi; none of them mentioned meta-analysis as a topic. Few SEM books discuss meta-analysis as a topic relevant to SEM. 1 In the literature on meta-analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hunter and Schmidt (2004)</ref> briefly mentioned a procedure of combining meta-analytic and SEM techniques, which was called meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM; M. W. L. <ref type="bibr">Cheung &amp; Chan, 2005, in press</ref>). 2 However, MASEM is limited to combining correlation matrices and covariance matrices. The pooled correlation or covariance matrix is then used to estimate a structural model. It is not intended to synthesize other effect sizes such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hedges's (1981)</ref> d, the standardized mean change for repeated measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Becker, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Morris &amp; DeShon, 2002)</ref>, or the odds ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Haddock, Rindskopf, &amp; Shadish, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The primary objective of this article is to propose a model to integrate meta-analysis into the SEM framework. Fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects meta-analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hedges, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998</ref>) can be formulated as structural equation models. In other words, SEM can be directly used to conduct a meta-analysis. For the sake of discussion, in this article this new approach is called SEM-based meta-analysis. This article contributes to the methodological development of a new area of research by integrating meta-analysis and SEM.</p><p>Apart from being of methodological interest, SEM-based meta-analysis also has several practical benefits for applied researchers who are conducting a meta-analysis. As many state-of-the-art techniques have been implemented in many SEM packages, these techniques are readily accessible to researchers by using the SEM-based meta-analysis. Specifically, this article will show how SEM-based meta-analysis can be used to handle missing covariates, to quantify the heterogeneity of effect sizes, and to address the heterogeneity of effect sizes with mixture models in a meta-analysis. Another benefit of the proposed approach is that mathematical models of meta-analysis can be easily translated into path diagrams in the SEM-based meta-analysis. Path diagrams preserve all of the necessary components in the mathematical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Curran &amp; Bauer, 2007)</ref>. They provide an alternative and accurate presentation of the mathematical aspect of a meta-analysis. SEM-based meta-analysis may make meta-analytic techniques more accessible to applied researchers.</p><p>This article is organized as follows. The next section contains a brief review of the various meta-analytic models.</p><p>A model for integrating meta-analysis into SEM is then presented. A data set from <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hox (2002)</ref> is used to demonstrate the equivalence between conventional meta-analytic techniques and SEM-based meta-analysis. Finally, future directions on this approach and related issues are discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixed-Effects Models</head><p>Effect sizes are quantitative indices that summarize the results of a study. Common effect sizes include Hedges's d, the correlation coefficient (and its Fisher's z transformed score), and the odds ratio. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fleiss (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Rosenthal (1994)</ref> have provided comprehensive summaries of many effect sizes and their estimated sampling variances.</p><p>Models without any covariate. The simplest analysis in a meta-analysis involves pooling a series of independent effect sizes using a fixed-effects model. In this article, I denote y i as a generic effect size in the ith study. y i is usually expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y i ϭ ␤ Fixed ϩ e i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ␤ Fixed and e i are the population effect size and the sampling error in the ith study, respectively. e i is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a known variance of i 2 .</p><p>1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2004)</ref> presented a unified latent variable modeling approach to multilevel, longitudinal, IRT, and structural equation models as well as many extensions. An example of meta-analysis was discussed in pp. 299 -307. Conventional meta-analytic techniques (not based on SEM) were presented as the framework of analyses.</p><p>2 MASEM can be illustrated by using an example from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Becker (1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Becker ( , 1995) )</ref> of combining independent studies that addressed the predictability of mathematics aptitude from spatial ability and verbal ability. Correlation matrices among these variables from four studies were synthesized with the generalized least squares method. A linear model was then fitted on the pooled correlation matrix by using mathematical aptitude as the dependent variable and spatial ability and verbal ability as the independent variables. Besides fitting regression models on the pooled correlation matrix, MASEM has been extended to fit path models, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Becker, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Becker &amp; Schram, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">S. F. Cheung, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Furlow &amp; Beretvas, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hafdahl, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Shadish, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Viswesvaran &amp; Ones, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Conventionally, researchers have synthesized correlation matrices with meta-analytic techniques (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Becker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004)</ref>, whereas the pooled correlation matrix is fitted in SEM. M. W. L. <ref type="bibr">Cheung and Chan (2005, in press</ref>) proposed an SEM approach to conducting MASEM. Both synthesizing correlation matrices and fitting SEM on the pooled correlation matrix are conducted in the SEM framework.</p><p>The weighted effect size ␤ ˆFixed under the fixed-effects model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">␤ ˆFixed ϭ iϭ1 k w i y i iϭ1 k w i (2)</formula><p>where w i ϭ 1/ i 2 is the weight and k is the total number of studies. The sampling variance s ˆFixed 2 of ␤ ˆFixed is computed by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s ˆFixed 2 ϭ 1ր iϭ1 k w i .</formula><p>(3)</p><p>If the population effect sizes are homogeneous, ␤ ˆFixed is an unbiased estimate of the population effect size. Moreover, ␤ ˆFixed has the smallest sampling variance of all possible weighted estimators when the sampling variances are truly known. Because i 2 is usually estimated, the accuracy of s ˆFixed 2 in estimating the sampling variance of ␤ ˆFixed depends on how accurate the estimated value of i 2 is (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hedges, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985)</ref>. After the averaging, it is of interest to test whether the weighted effect size ␤ ˆFixed is statistically significant. We may compute a test statistic</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Z 1 ϭ ␤ ˆFixed /s ˆFixed . (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>Under the null hypothesis H 0 : ␤ Fixed ϭ 0, the test statistic Z 1 has an approximate standard normal distribution.</p><p>Combining estimates of effect sizes across studies with the fixed-effects model is appropriate only when the effect sizes are homogeneous <ref type="bibr">(National Research Council, 1992)</ref>; otherwise, the estimated standard error on the weighted mean under the fixed-effects models is smaller than its true value when the effect sizes are heterogeneous. To test the homogeneity of the effect sizes, we may compute a Q statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cochran, 1954)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Q ϭ iϭ1 k w i ͑ y i Ϫ ␤ ˆFixed ͒ 2 .</formula><p>(5)</p><p>Under the null hypothesis H 0 : ␤ 1 ϭ ␤ 2 ϭ . . . ϭ ␤ k , the Q statistic has an approximate chi-square distribution with (k Ϫ 1) degrees of freedom. However, this does not necessary mean that fixed-effects models should never be used whenever the effect sizes are heterogeneous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hedges and Vevea (1998)</ref> pointed out that fixed-effects models are still appropriate even if the effect sizes are heterogeneous when the researchers are interested in only this collection of studies. This is what they call a conditional inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models with covariates.</head><p>Besides estimating a common effect size, study characteristics may be used as covariates to model the variability among the effect sizes. Study characteristics can be in the form of categorical covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hedges, 1982a)</ref> and continuous covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hedges, 1982b)</ref>. A weighted least squares (WLS) approach is usually used to model the variability among the effect sizes with covariates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985)</ref>. It would be more convenient to express the model in matrix notation</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">y ϭ X␤ ϩ e, (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">)</formula><p>where y is a k ϫ 1 vector of effect sizes, ␤ is a p ϫ 1 vector of regression coefficients including the intercept, e is a k ϫ 1 vector of residuals, and X is a k ϫ p design matrix including ones in the first column. Because the effect sizes are assumed to be independent, the covariance matrix of the residuals V e is a diagonal matrix, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V e ϭ diag[ 1 2 , 2 2 , . . . , k 2 ]</formula><p>. The vector of the estimated regression coefficients via WLS is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">␤ ˆϭ ͑X T V e Ϫ1 X͒ Ϫ1 X T V e Ϫ1 y,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">V e Ϫ1 ϭ diag[1/ 1 2 , 1/ 2 2 , . . . , 1/ k 2 ]</formula><p>and the asymptotic covariance matrix of ␤ ˆis</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">V ˆ␤ ˆϭ ͑X T V e Ϫ1 X͒ Ϫ1 .

The above test can easily be modified to test hypotheses on some of the elements in ␤, for instance, the regression coefficients excluding the intercept <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>After testing the significance of all (or some) regression coefficients, we may want to construct an approximate Z test to test the significance of an individual regression coefficient under H 0 : <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> where (V ˆ␤ ˆ)ii is the sampling variance of ␤ ˆi.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">␤ i ϭ 0, Z 2 ϭ ␤ ˆi/ ͱ͑V ˆ␤ ˆ͒ii ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random-Effects Models</head><p>Fixed-effects models assume that the population effect sizes share a common value. Many researchers have argued that studies are not direct replications of each other. It is expected that there will be differences in the population effect sizes due to differences with the samples and methods used across studies. Thus, random-effects models should be more appropriate (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Research Council, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Besides the sampling error, random-effects models include variations in the population effect sizes. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hedges and Vevea (1998)</ref>, the most important issue in determining a fixed-effects versus a random-effects meta-analysis is the nature of the inferences desired. Inferences based on fixed-effects models can be applied only to those studies that have been included in the analysis, whereas inferences based on randomeffects models can be generalized beyond the studies in the analysis. Researchers should consider which model is more appropriate for their research questions.</p><p>Models without any covariate. The random-effects model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">y i ϭ ␤ Random ϩ u i ϩ e i , (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where ␤ Random , u i and e i are the "super" population effect size, the study specific effect, and the sampling error in the ith study, respectively. In fixed-effects models, there is only one source of variation, the sampling variance i 2 . In contrast, there are two sources of variation in a random-effects model-the sampling variance and the between-studies variance component, 2 ϭ var(u i ). In the meta-analytic literature, i 2 and ( 2 ϩ i 2 ) are known as the conditional and the unconditional variance, respectively.</p><p>One common estimator of 2 , which is based on the quadratic form of the Q statistic in Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>, was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">DerSimonian and Laird (1986)</ref>. Their estimator is</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ˆDL 2 ϭ Q Ϫ ͑k Ϫ 1͒ c , (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">)</formula><p>where Q is the statistic of the homogeneity test, k stands for the number of studies, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">c ϭ ¥ iϭ1 k w i Ϫ (¥ iϭ1 k w i 2 )/(¥ iϭ1 k w i ).</formula><p>When the estimated value is negative, it is truncated to zero. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hedges (1983)</ref> also proposed an estimator of 2 based on the unweighted method of moments. Maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimations may also be used in estimating 2 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Viechtbauer, 2005</ref>, for an empirical comparison of these estimators).</p><p>Once the variance component is estimated, the weighted effect size ␤ ˆRandom under the random-effects model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">␤ ˆRandom ϭ iϭ1 k w ˜iy i iϭ1 k w ˜i , (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where w ˜i ϭ 1/( i 2 ϩ ˆ2) is the weight. The sampling variance s ˆRandom 2 of ␤ ˆRandom is estimated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">s ˆRandom 2 ϭ 1ր iϭ1 k w ˜i. (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">)</formula><p>As ˆ2 is always nonnegative, s ˆRandom 2 is always larger than s ˆFixed 2 unless ˆ2 is zero. Models with covariates. It is sometimes of theoretical interest to include study-specific covariates in random-effects models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Overton, 1998)</ref>. These are generally known as mixed-effects models, and they are also widely known as meta-regression in medical research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berkey, Hoaglin, Mostellar, &amp; Colditz, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thompson &amp; Higgins, 2002)</ref>. Mixed-effects models include both fixed and random effects. The fixed effects are the regression coefficients due to the study-specific covariates, whereas the random effects are the unexplained study-specific effects after controlling for the covariates. The model in matrix notation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">y ϭ X␤ ϩ I k u ϩ e, (<label>15</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">)</formula><p>where y is a k ϫ 1 vector of effect sizes, ␤ is a p ϫ 1 vector of fixed-effects regression coefficients including the intercept, u is a k ϫ 1 vector of study-specific random effects with u ϳ N(0, I k 2 ), e is a k ϫ 1 vector of residuals, X is a k ϫ p design matrix that includes ones in the first column, and I k is a k ϫ k identity matrix. Because the effect sizes are assumed to be independent, the conditional covariance matrix of the residuals V e is a diagonal matrix, that is, V e ϭ diag[ 1 2 , 2 2 , . . . , k 2 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Raudenbush (1994)</ref> proposed a method of moments estimator on 2 under the mixed-effects meta-analysis. When ˆ2 is available, a WLS with Equations 7 and 8 can be used to obtain the parameter estimates and their asymptotic covariance matrix by using a new weight, w ˜i ϭ 1/( i 2 ϩ ˆ2). Besides using the method of moments, multilevel models may also be used to analyze random-and mixed-effects meta-analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hox, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hox &amp; de Leeuw, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Konstantopoulos &amp; Hedges, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Raudenbush, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. From a mathematical point of view, the model in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">15</ref>is the most general model of all of the models that have been mentioned thus far. By dropping the term I k u, fixed-effects meta-analyses with or without covariates are special cases of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">15</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transforming Data to Achieve Identically Distributed Errors</head><p>Fixed-effects models. A WLS regression is frequently used to analyze a fixed-effects meta-analysis by using w i ϭ 1/ i 2 as the weight (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985)</ref>. The WLS criterion F WLS to be minimized in order to obtain the parameter estimates is</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">F WLS ϭ ͑y Ϫ X␤͒ T V e Ϫ1 ͑y Ϫ X␤͒.

After the transformation, e* is assumed to be distributed with a known identity matrix I k .</p><p>It should be noted that the same transformation with W 1/ 2 is applied regardless of whether the model is a fixed-or random-effects one because the conditional variance i 2 is the same under both fixed-and random-effects models.</p><p>Mathematically, under fixed-effects models a metaanalysis using WLS with weights and one using an OLS regression on the transformed data are equivalent. For random-effects models, the transformed errors are assumed to be conditionally identically distributed with a unit variance. Transformation allows us to have effect sizes that are assumed to be conditionally identically distributed with a unit variance and to exclude the weights from the analysis. In other words, studies in a meta-analysis can be treated as subjects in a structural equation model. This transformation is the basis for the following SEM approach.</p></div>

There is no need to make any corrections of the sort mentioned in footnote 3. Second, the intercept of y* is fixed as 0 because the weighted effect size is now represented by ␤ ˆ0. This constraint is crucial when applying the SEM-based meta-analysis. The ␤ ˆ0 (and its SE ˆ) was 0.550 (0.065). The z statistic was 8.465.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random-Effects Models</head><p>Models without any covariate. Because ML is usually used as the estimation method in SEM, ML was used to estimate the variance component in order to compare the results of the conventional meta-analysis and the SEMbased meta-analysis. Issues relating to the use of different estimation methods in estimating the variance component are discussed later. A random-effects model with an intercept model was fitted. The ML estimate of 2 reported in MiMa was 0.135, whereas the weighted effect size (and its SE ˆ) was 0.579 (0.105). The z statistic was 5.520. Thus, the weighted effect size is statistically significant under the random-effects model.</p><p>A random-effects meta-analysis can be formulated as a single-level analysis with random slopes in SEM.

The regression coefficient (and its SE ˆ) for weeks was 0.139 (0.036). There are some minor differences in the estimated standard errors between MiMa and Mplus. It is speculated that the differences are due to the iterative procedures and the convergence criteria used in MiMa and Mplus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extensions of the SEM-Based Meta-Analysis</head><p>In the above examples, I have shown how SEM can be used as a framework for conducting a meta-analysis. Researchers with basic SEM knowledge may find the proposed approach useful. This may stimulate more SEM researchers into applying meta-analytic techniques in their research. However, meta-analysts may wonder whether this new approach brings additional benefits beyond those that can be obtained by carrying out a conventional meta-analysis. In this section I demonstrate how many state-of-the-art techniques implemented in SEM packages can be directly applied to meta-analyses. These include mixture modeling, the bootstrap method, handling missing covariates with the full information maximum likelihood (FIML), and computing new parameters based on other parameters.</p><p>Most of these techniques are available in the literature; researchers may implement them to suit their needs. However, implementing their own procedures may not be practical for researchers who lack a programming background. The SEM approach can be applied using the Mplus code set out in the Appendix. It is hoped that SEM-based metaanalysis may provide a favorable alternative to conducting advanced meta-analyses. In addition, SEM-based metaanalysis allows researchers to apply more than one technique in the same meta-analysis. For example, a researcher may want to handle missing covariates and to conduct a mixture model in the same analysis. This may not be a trivial task under a conventional meta-analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Handling Missing Covariates</head><p>Study characteristics are usually used as covariates in a meta-analysis. Because the primary studies are conducted by different researchers with different research objectives, it is quite common for different study characteristics to be reported. This could create missing data on covariates of interest to the meta-analyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Pigott, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Pigott, , 2001))</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cooper and Hedges (1994)</ref> have called missing data "perhaps the most pervasive practical problem in research synthesis" (p. 525). <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rubin (1987)</ref> defined three types of missingness mechanism. The missingness on a variable, say Y, is said to be missing completely at random (MCAR) if the missingness is unrelated to the value of Y itself or to the values of any other variables in the model. This assumption may be rather strong in applied settings. A considerably weaker assumption is missing at random (MAR). MAR means that the missingness on Y is unrelated to the value of Y after controlling for other variables in the analysis. The missingness on Y is said to be not missing at random (NMAR) if the missingness on Y is related to the value of Y itself. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rubin's (1987)</ref> definitions have been directly adopted for meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Pigott, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Sutton &amp; Pigott, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sutton,</ref>  Abrams, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Jones, Sheldon, &amp; Song, 2000)</ref>. In the context of missing covariates, MCAR means that the missingness of a covariate is unrelated to the value of that covariate or of other variables. MAR means that the missingness of a covariate may be related to other variables, for instance, the effect size or other covariates, whereas NMAR means that the missingness of a covariate is related to the value of that covariate.</p><p>As researchers are not very likely to fail to report a study characteristic, for example, mean age of the participants, because of the value of that covariate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Sutton and Pigott (2005)</ref> stated that "the assumption that [study-level covariates] are MCAR or MAR may be reasonable and standard missing-data methods may suffice in some situations" (p. 235). It should be noted that the missingness on the effect sizes, for example, a correlation coefficient between job satisfaction and performance, is likely to be NMAR. If the effect sizes are nonsignificant, they are less likely to be reported or published. This is known as publication bias, which is beyond the scope of this article (see <ref type="bibr">Rothstein, Sutton, &amp; Borenstein, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pigott (2001)</ref> summarized several conventional methods of handling missing covariates in a meta-analysis. These include listwise deletion, mean substitution, and pairwise deletion. However, these methods are generally not recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002)</ref>. Pigott suggested using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and multiple imputation (MI) to handle missing covariates. In order to handle missing covariates in a regression analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Little (1992)</ref> suggested employing MI and ML methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Schafer and Graham (2002)</ref> also recommended using the FIML method, which has been implemented in many SEM packages, and MI to handle missing data with MCAR and MAR. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref>Assuming conditional multivariate normality in the data, the casewise log-likelihood of the observed data under the FIML method is obtained by maximizing the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">log L i ϭ K i Ϫ 1 2 log͉ i ͉ Ϫ 1 2 ͑z i Ϫ i ͒ T i Ϫ1 ͑z i Ϫ i ͒,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where K i is a constant that depends on the number of complete data points for the ith case, z i is the observed complete vector including the independent and the dependent variables, and i and ⌺ i are the implied population mean and covariance matrix for the ith case, respectively (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arbuckle, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Enders, 2001b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Enders, , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neale, 2000)</ref>. The overall log-likelihood of the N cases (studies in the context of meta-analysis) is ¥ iϭ1 N log L i . The ML estimates are obtained by maximizing this likelihood function. Because the number of observed data in z i is allowed to be different across subjects, missing data can be easily handled.</p><p>The evidence from empirical studies supports the contention that FIML performs better than such conventional methods as listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, and mean imputation in handling missing data when the missingness is either MCAR or MAR (see M. W. L. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cheung, 2007b, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Enders, 2001a</ref>, for some empirical findings on a comparison of methods of handling missing covariates in the context of a latent growth model and a regression analysis). When the missingness is NMAR, none of the above methods is unbiased (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schafer, 1997)</ref>. However, the bias of the FIML is still less than that resulting from listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, and mean substitution <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Jamshidian &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">B. Muthe ´n, Kaplan, &amp; Hollis, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Because both FIML and MI are asymptotically equivalent (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Graham, Olchowski, &amp; Gilreath, 2007)</ref>, one may wonder whether the FIML method available in SEM packages is preferable to MI for handling missing covariates. There are two advantages to using FIML. First, the results based on MI are asymptotically equivalent to those based on FIML. More explicitly, they are equal only when the number of imputations in MI approaches infinity. It is generally suggested that three to five imputations are sufficient to obtain excellent results in MI (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Schafer &amp; Olsen, 1998)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Graham et al. (2007)</ref> have recently shown that a few imputations might not be sufficient. They concluded that "in sum, our simulations results show rather clearly that FIML is superior to MI, in terms of power for testing small effect sizes, unless one has a sufficient number of imputations" (p. 212).</p><p>Second, SEM assumes conditional normality on the dependent variables conditional on the observed covariates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">B. Muthe ´n, 2004b)</ref>. The observed covariates do not need to be normally distributed. Dummy and ordinal variables may also be used as observed covariates (see Jo ¨reskog &amp; So ¨rbom, 1996, for some examples of the utilization of dummy variables in running ANOVA and multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA] in SEM). When using FIML in SEM, the transformed covariates do not need to be multivariate normal. In contrast, multivariate normality is assumed for all variables in MI (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schafer, 1997</ref>, for a discussion on the effect of nonnormality on MI).</p><p>To illustrate the procedures for analyzing missing covariates, 5 out of 20 studies were deleted in the covariate weeks (the data marked with the symbol # in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The missingness was qualified as MCAR. Three analyses (the listwise deletion analysis, the FIML analysis, and the MI analysis with 100 imputations) based on the fixed-effects model were conducted. 6 The parameter estimates (and their SE ˆs) of the intercept and the weeks for the listwise deletion analysis were Ϫ0.313 (0.226) and 0.152 (0.036), respectively. The z statistics were Ϫ1.385 and 4.212. The parameter estimates (and their SE ˆs) of the intercept and the weeks for the MI analysis were Ϫ0.315 (0.200) and 0.149 (0.033), respectively. The z statistics were Ϫ1.575 and 4.579. Regarding the FIML analysis, the parameter estimates (and their SE ˆs) of the intercept and the weeks were Ϫ0.316 (0.208) and 0.150 (0.034), respectively. The z statistics were Ϫ1.521 and 4.405.</p><p>When compared to the results of the full sample, the parameter estimates and their standard errors based on the sample with missing covariates are smaller (in absolute values) and larger, respectively. This is expected because some information will have been lost due to the missing data. The standard errors based on the MI and the FIML analyses were slightly smaller than those based on the listwise deletion analysis because in an MI or FIML analysis it is not necessary to throw out the whole case in the presence of missing values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantifying Heterogeneity in a Meta-Analysis</head><p>Quantifying heterogeneity is essential in a meta-analysis (Huedo-Medina, Sa ´nchez-Meca, Marı ´n-Martı ´nez, &amp; Botella, 2006). When the estimated variance component is small, the results based on a fixed-effects and a random-effects model are similar. Some researchers may choose to use randomeffects models only if the effect sizes are heterogeneous. This approach is called the conditional random-effects model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998)</ref>. One problem with using the Q statistic to quantify heterogeneity is that the Q statistic depends on the number of studies in a meta-analysis. When the number of studies increases, the Q statistic also increases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Higgins and Thompson (2002)</ref> proposed three indices to quantify heterogeneity. Two of them are described here. The first is the H 2 index,</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">H 2 ϭ Q k Ϫ 1 . (<label>24</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_38">)</formula><p>The second is the I 2 index,</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">I 2 ϭ H 2 Ϫ 1 H 2 . (<label>25</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_40">)</formula><p>When I 2 is negative, it is truncated to zero. The H 2 and I 2 indices can be interpreted as the relative excess in Q statistic per degree of freedom and the proportion of the total variation due to the heterogeneity between studies, respectively. Higgins and Thompson further put forward the following formula to construct an approximate confidence interval (CI) on ln(H):</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">exp͑ln͑H͒ Ϯ Z ␣ SE͑ln͑H͒͒, (<label>26</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">)</formula><p>where Z ␣ is the (1 Ϫ ␣/2) quantile of the standard normal distribution and</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">SE͑ln͑H͒͒ ϭ Ά 1 2 ln͑Q͒ Ϫ ln͑k Ϫ 1͒ ͱ2Q Ϫ ͱ2k Ϫ 3 if Q Ͼ k ͱ 1 2͑k Ϫ 2͒ ͩ 1 Ϫ 1 3͑k Ϫ 2͒ 2ͪ if Q Յ k .</formula><p>The CI of the I 2 index may be transformed from the CI of the H 2 index by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">25</ref>. Because the I 2 index is easier to interpret, it was used in this illustration. The Q statistic for the 20 studies was 49.585 (df ϭ 19), p Ͻ .001. The calculated I 2 index and its 95% CI were 0.617 and (0.378, 0.764), respectively. Therefore, 62% of the variation of the effect sizes is due to the population heterogeneity, whereas 38% of the variation is due to the sampling error. So far, in all of the illustrations of the SEM-based metaanalysis, the error variance of y* was always fixed at 1. By so doing, the correct SE ˆs can be directly obtained from the output. The error variance of y* is set free in estimating the Q statistic. The ML estimate of the error variance of y* in the fixed-effects model without any covariate is ˆe* 7 It should be noted that k instead of (k Ϫ 1) is used in the ML estimator.

On the I 2 index, the 95% Wald and bias-corrected bootstrap CIs were (0.379, 0.854), and (0.263, 0.774), respectively. These CIs are comparable to the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Higgins and Thompson (2002)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Addressing Heterogeneity With Mixture Models</head><p>As researchers tend to accept that population effect sizes are heterogeneous, addressing heterogeneity properly is an important issue in meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Thompson &amp; Sharp, 1999)</ref>. One common approach to handling heterogeneity is the use of random-or mixed-effects models. Random-effects models assume that the population effect sizes are distributed with an unknown variance that needs to be estimated.</p><p>An alternative approach to handling heterogeneity is to use finite mixture models <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(McLachlan &amp; Peel, 2000)</ref>. Finite mixture models assume that the effect sizes are drawn from several distinct unobserved populations. Given the same population, the effect sizes are homogeneous within that population. They are useful for identifying hidden populations. Several researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bo ¨hning, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bo ¨hning, , 2005;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Thomas, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Xia, Weng, Zhang, &amp; Li, 2005)</ref> have extended mixture models to handle the heterogeneity of effect sizes in meta-analysis. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref> The basic procedure is to conduct a fixed-effects meta-analysis with covariates. When there is still large residual heterogeneity after controlling for the covariates, mixture models along with the covariates are used to identify the number of the hidden populations. On the basis of the predicted classes, researchers may check whether any consistent patterns are shown in these classes.</p><p>Mixture models have been integrated into some SEM packages such as Mplus and Mx (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lubke &amp; Muthe ´n, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">B.

By using the SEM-based meta-analysis, mixture models can be easily accessible to meta-analysts. One advantage of using an SEM package such as Mplus to conduct mixture modeling is that multiple random starting values can be easily generated. Multiple maxima of the likelihood often exist in mixture models <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(McLachlan &amp; Peel, 2000)</ref>. Multiple random starting values may be used to minimize the chance of having local maxima.</p><p>Recall that the Q statistic and the ˆ2 in the SEM-based meta-analysis are 49.585 (df ϭ 19) and 0.132, respectively, whereas the estimated variance component after controlling for the covariate weeks is only 0.023, which is nonsignificant. As a demonstration, I did not include the covariate weeks in the mixture analyses; otherwise, one single class would be found after controlling for the covariate weeks. In this illustration, three mixture models based on two, three, and four mixtures were fitted. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> shows the graphical model where c is a latent categorical variable. The model implies that different classes of effect sizes may have different ␤ ˆ0. Posterior class probabilities may be used to predict the studies into classes (see L. K. Muthe ´n &amp; Muthe ´n, 2007).</p><p>The predicted class memberships are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Regarding the four-class solution, only three classes were estimated. Thus, only two-and three-class solutions were considered. There are several indices that may be used to compare solutions with a different number of mixtures (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">McLachlan &amp; Peel, 2000)</ref>. One common statistic is the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Schwartz, 1978)</ref>. The model with the smallest BIC is preferred. The BICs for the two-and three-class solutions were 85.521 and 89.250, respectively. Another statistic is the adjusted likelihood ratio test (aLRT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lo, Mendell, &amp; Rubin, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lubke and Muthe ´n (2007)</ref> have recently shown that the aLRT performed very well in identifying the number of classes. The aLRT in comparing the two-and three-class solutions was 1.939 (p ϭ .060). This indicates that the three-class solution is not better than the twoclass solution. Based on the BIC and aLRT, it seems that the two-class solution is sufficient.</p><p>The weighted effect sizes (and their SE ˆs) for the two-class solution were 0.463 (0.084) and 1.602 (0.161). These estimates would be slightly different from those obtained by running two separate analyses on the predicted classes. The reason for this is that group membership is treated as a latent variable in a mixture model, whereas it is treated as fixed and known in running two separate analyses. By checking the two-class solution, Studies 19 and 20 were classified as belonging to a different class from other studies. The Q statistics and their p values for these two classes were 26.6 (df ϭ 17, p ϭ .06) and 0.4 (df ϭ 1, p ϭ .52), respectively. This also supports the argument that the two-class solution is good enough to account for the heterogeneity when no covariate is included. The data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> were actually generated from a population model y i ϭ 0.15‫ء‬Weeks i ϩ e i with a mean effect size of 0.6 across all studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hox &amp; de Leeuw, 2003)</ref>. Conceptually speaking, each level of the covariate weeks can be considered as a class, and the classes are separated by 0.15 units. Some may expect to find as many classes as the number of levels in the covariate weeks, that is, eight classes in this example. However, the number of classes identified in a model depends on the class separation and the within-class sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lubke &amp; Neale, 2006</ref>). In this particular example, the class separation (0.15 units in each class) is not large enough and the number of studies within a particular level is also quite small. Thus, only two classes were identified.</p><p>Lubke and Muthe ´n (2007) also investigated the performance of the factor mixture models via a computer simulation. One general finding was that the parameter estimates are still very good even for a small degree of separation among the classes, whereas the correctness of class predictions depends on the degree of separation among the classes. This means that the estimated regression coefficients were very good. However, the predicted class membership may be inaccurate if the population effect sizes are similar among the classes. Because applications of mixture models in meta-analysis are relatively new, further studies may be needed to address the empirical performance of this approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Future Directions</head><p>The present article proposes a model to integrate metaanalysis into the SEM framework. By applying an appropriate transformation to the data, studies in a meta-analysis can be treated as subjects in a structural equation model. The illustrations demonstrated the equivalence between conventional meta-analysis and SEM-based meta-analysis. Many state-of-the-art techniques available in SEM can be directly applied to meta-analysis. Integrating meta-analysis into SEM opens several new research directions for methodological development. The following is a brief discussion of some possible directions for future research, as well as related issues that will require further exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Assessment With Chi-Square Test Statistics and Goodness-of-Fit Indices</head><p>Thus far, the homogeneity of the effect sizes was tested based on the conventional Q statistic in meta-analysis (Equations 5 and 27). The likelihood ratio (LR) or chisquare statistic is the fundamental test statistic in SEM. An LR statistic may also be derived to test the homogeneity of effect sizes. Let us consider a fixed-effects model without any covariates. The model for the transformed data in an SEM-based meta-analysis can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">y* ϭ X*␤ Fixed ϩ e*,<label>(28)</label></formula><p>where X* ϭ W 1/ 2 1 and ␤ Fixed is a population effect size.</p><p>Under the null hypothesis that all effect sizes are equal, the error variance of e* is exactly 1. In the SEM-based metaanalysis, this model is fitted by fixing the error variance of e* at 1. It is labeled as Model 0 here and its associated chi-square statistic is 0 2 (2). If the null hypothesis is incorrect, the estimated variance of e* in Equation 28 will be larger than 1. This is because the study-specific effect is combined with the error variance. This model may be fitted in SEM-based meta-analysis by freeing the estimated variance of e*. It is labeled as Model 1 here with its associated chi-square statistic 1 2 (1). Under the null hypothesis H 0 : e* 2 ϭ 1, a chi-square difference test may be used to compare these two nested models: ⌬ 2 ϭ 0 2 Ϫ 1 2 with ⌬df ϭ 1. Because the null hypothesis H 0 : e* 2 ϭ 1 is tested on a boundary condition, we have to adjust the critical value in order to conduct a better test. If the observed p value is larger than 2␣, we reject the null hypothesis at the ␣ level. 9 Regarding our example in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the chi-square statistics for Models 0 and 1 are 0 2 (2) ϭ 14.453 and 1 2 (1) ϭ 3.027, respectively. The chi-square difference test is ⌬ 2 (1) ϭ 11.426, p Ͻ .001. Recall that the Q statistic for this example is 49.585 (df ϭ 19), p Ͻ .001.</p><p>Although the above LR statistic may also be used to test the homogeneity of effect sizes, the Q statistic is preferred to the LR statistic in the context of meta-analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Viechtbauer (2007b)</ref> compared several statistics in testing the population heterogeneity. These included the Q statistic, the LR tests based on ML and REML, and the Wald and score tests. Generally, the Q statistic was found to have the best control over the Type I error rate and to have reasonable statistical power.</p><p>One of the reasons for the above observation may be due to the fact that the Q statistic has an exact chi-square distribution, even for two studies where the within-study sample sizes are sufficiently large. However, the LR statistic must rely on both a large within-study sample size and a large number of studies. Furthermore, large sample sizes (number of studies) are required for the valid application of LR statistics. This is clear when integrating meta-analysis into the SEM framework; studies in a meta-analysis become subjects in an SEM analysis.</p><p>Besides formal chi-square statistics, many goodness-offit indices are available in SEM. Much research has been devoted to the issue of how to assess the model fit using goodness-of-fit indices (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bollen &amp; Long, 1993)</ref>. Many goodness-of-fit indices such as the comparative fit index (CFI) and the nonnormed fit index (NNFI) use an independence model (a model in which all of the variables are uncorrelated) as the reference model for comparison. A null model on the transformed data is not interpretable in a meta-analysis. Thus, many goodness-of-fit indices may not be well defined in the context of meta-analysis. Because using SEM to conduct a meta-analysis is a new approach, future research is definitely needed to explore whether or not the rich knowledge on model fitting techniques in SEM is applicable to meta-analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods of Estimating the Variance Component</head><p>Method of moments is usually used to estimate the variance component (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">DerSimonian &amp; Laird, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998)</ref>. There are several appealing reasons for using this method. First, close-form formulas are usually available; no iterative procedure is required. Second, it is distribution free. The first and the second moments are used to estimate the variance component and its standard error, respectively (see <ref type="bibr">Biggerstaff &amp; Tweedie, 1997, for the details)</ref>.</p><p>Maximum likelihood (ML or REML) methods are the preferred choices when more complicated meta-analyses are involved. For example, ML methods are used to handle missing data and to handle heterogeneity with mixture models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bo ¨hning, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bo ¨hning, , 2005))</ref>. It is well known that the estimated variance component in ML is negatively biased, especially in small samples, whereas REML may be used to correct the bias. Because the number of studies in a metaanalysis may be relatively small, meta-analysts should be cautious about applying the SEM-based meta-analysis if their research interest is to estimate and compare the variance components of the random effects.</p><p>The REML estimate of the variance component can be approximated by multiplying the ML estimate by k/(k Ϫ p), where k is the number of studies and p is the number of fixed effects (p is 1 in the random-effects model and p is 1 plus the number of covariates in the mixed-effects models; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Overton, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Viechtbauer, 2005)</ref>. This approximation can be easily obtained in the SEM approach, as many SEM packages allow us to compute functions of other parameters.</p><p>It is also possible to use the variance component estimate based on the method of moments (or the REML) in the SEM-based meta-analysis. Once the estimated variance component (based on the REML or the method of moments) is available, it may be used to fix the variance of u (m in Figures <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>) in the SEM-based meta-analysis. However, it should be remembered that this is just an approximation. Further research may be necessary to address how different estimation methods can be implemented in the SEM-based meta-analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robust Standard Errors on the Variance Component</head><p>When the research questions are directly related to the variance component, meta-analysts are interested in testing the significance of the variance component (Viechtbauer,   9 It may not be obvious that the null hypothesis H 0 : e* 2 ϭ 1 is tested at a boundary. The H 0 : 2 ϭ 0 in a conventional metaanalysis is equivalent to H 0 : e* 2 ϭ 1 on the transformed data in an SEM-based meta-analysis, whereas H 1 : 2 Ͼ 0 in a conventional meta-analysis is translated into H 1 : e* 2 Ͼ 1 in an SEMbased meta-analysis. Because 2 cannot be negative, e* 2 cannot be smaller than 1, theoretically. Because of the boundary condition, the ⌬ 2 is distributed as a 50:50 mixture of a degenerate random variable with all of its probability mass concentrated at zero and a chi-square random variable with 1 degree of freedom. One simple strategy to correct for this issue is to use 2␣ instead of ␣ as the alpha level. Thus, we should reject the null hypothesis when the observed p value is larger than .10 for ␣ ϭ .05. Readers may refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Viechtbauer (2007b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Stoel, Galindo-Garre, Dolan, and van den Wittenboer (2006)</ref> for a discussion on this issue in the context of meta-analysis and SEM. The estimates of 2 can sometimes be negative because of the sampling fluctuation. As there is a 1:1 mapping between 2 in a meta-analysis and e* 2 in an SEM-based meta-analysis, the estimates of e* 2 can also be smaller than 1 in some cases.</p><p>2007b) or in constructing approximate CIs on the variance component <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Viechtbauer, 2007a)</ref>. Although estimating the variance component with the method of moments does not assume normality of the effect sizes, testing and constructing CIs on the variance component requires such an assumption. Moreover, the testing and constructing of CIs on the weighted effect size with the standard error estimated by Equation 14 also rely on the assumption of normality on the part of the effect sizes. In other words, most methods, including the method of moments, ML, and REML, implicitly or explicitly assume normality of the effect sizes or of the variance component.</p><p>The assumption of the normality of the effect sizes has been called into question. Several robust procedures have been suggested in meta-analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Demidenko, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sidik &amp; Jonkman, 2006)</ref>. One approach is to use a parametric and nonparametric bootstrap (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams, Gurevitch, &amp; Rosenberg, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Takkouche, Cadarso-Suarez, &amp; Spiegelman, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van den Noortgate &amp; Onghena, 2005)</ref>. For the parametric bootstrap, the parameter estimates are used as population values to generate the CIs of interest while the data are resampled with replacement to generate the CIs of interest in the nonparametric bootstrap (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Davison &amp; Hinkley, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>The robustness of test statistics and standard errors against nonnormality is also an important topic of research in SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Yuan &amp; Bentler, 2007)</ref>. Most SEM packages have implemented some form of robust statistics that behaves better under nonnormality. As meta-analysis becomes integrated in SEM, it is of interest to see how well these robust standard errors work in the context of meta-analysis. Moreover, many SEM packages have functions to conduct bootstrapping. It is also of practical interest to explore the usefulness of the bootstrap technique in meta-analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Final Remark on Modeling Meta-Analytic Data in SEM</head><p>This article presents a SEM-based approach to conducting meta-analysis. Readers should be reminded that data in meta-analyses are usually more complex in terms of conceptualization and data collection than data in primary studies. Inexperienced readers may wrongly conclude that once the appropriate transformation described in this article has been made and the study results in a meta-analysis have become subjects in a structural equation model, there is no difference between applying SEM to primary data versus meta-analytic data in any phase of the research process. 10  Similar concerns have also been raised about the usefulness of path diagrams in SEM and multilevel models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Curran &amp; Bauer, 2007)</ref>. Many SEM packages, for example, AMOS, EQS, Mx, and LISREL, allow the use of path diagrams as input. Inexperienced users may fit ill-formulated models because fitting a model is similar to drawing a path diagram. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Curran and Bauer (2007)</ref> "firmly believe <ref type="bibr">[d]</ref> that the advantages of model diagrams vastly outweigh their potential weakness" (p. 296). I also strongly believe that the advantages of using the SEM approach to conducting a meta-analysis also outweigh its potential misuse by inexperienced researchers. This article highlights the fact that applied researchers can access several advanced statistical techniques in meta-analysis via some popular SEM packages. Instead of spending time in implementing these algorithms, applied researchers may now focus on the proper applications of these techniques.</p><p>Finally, I have to emphasize that a meta-analysis is more than just a statistical analysis. In this article, I have mainly focused on the statistical methods of meta-analysis. There are, however, other design and conceptual issues that are specific to meta-analysis. For example, studies are usually not direct replicas of each other (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2000)</ref>. It is sometimes difficult to define what a population is. It is also generally agreed that the published data are usually biased against nonsignificant findings (see <ref type="bibr">Rothstein, Sutton, &amp; Borenstein, 2005)</ref>. Special care is required to handle meta-analytic data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cooper and Hedges (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lipsey and Wilson (2001)</ref> provided a complete treatment of issues related to meta-analysis. Readers are strongly advised to consult their works before conducting a metaanalysis.</p><p>To summarize, this article provides a start to integrating meta-analysis into the SEM framework. It is hoped that this new line of research will benefit both meta-analysts and researchers in SEM. As many SEM packages are becoming more and more powerful, some of these new developments will prove useful to meta-analysts. A unified framework may one day be available to researchers who conduct metaanalysis, SEM, and other types of statistical analysis.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .Figure 3 .</head><label>123</label><figDesc>Figure1.

They have to be adjusted by SE ˆ͑␤ ˆj͒ correct ϭ SE ˆ͑␤ ˆj͒ reported / ͱMS e , where SE ˆ͑␤ ˆj͒ reported is the standard error on ␤ ˆj reported by the statistical packages and MS e is the mean square error (see<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Konstantopoulos &amp; Hedges, 2004)</ref>. The reason for this is that the error is assumed to be distributed with a known variance in a meta-analysis. However, the error variance is still estimated in a WLS or OLS regression. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the SE ˆs by rescaling the error variance to a fixed value.</p></note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_3"><p>Other SEM packages such as EQS<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bentler, 2004)</ref> andLIS- REL (Jo ¨reskog &amp; So ¨rbom, 1996)  may also be used to conduct a fixed-effects meta-analysis. As a random slope analysis is required for a random-and mixed-effects meta-analysis, Mplus and Mx are required for these analyses. The complete data set, the Mplus code, and the output are available at my website (http://courses.nus .edu.sg/course/psycwlm/internet/).</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5" xml:id="foot_4"><p>Different SEM packages use slightly different algorithms to obtain the ML estimates in the presence of missing data. Amos, LISREL, and Mx directly implement Equation 23, whereas Mplus (B. Muthe ´n, 2004b) and EQS</p></note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8" xml:id="foot_6"><p>Mixture models have also been extended to general mixedeffects models (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hall &amp; Wang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Verbeke &amp; Lesaffre, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Wang, Schumitzky, &amp; D'Argenio, 2007)</ref>. Because mixedeffects meta-analysis is a special case of general mixed-effects models, it is possible to modify these models for mixed-effects meta-analysis. However, researchers have to consider two practical issues. First, not all mixed-effects packages are capable of fitting mixed-effects meta-analysis because the Level 1 variances are fixed as known values in a mixed-effects meta-analysis (see<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hox, 2002</ref>, for a discussion). Second, multiple maxima of the likelihood often exist in mixture models<ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(McLachlan &amp; Peel, 2000)</ref>. Researchers have to generate multiple random starting values in order to minimize the chance of local maxima.</p></note>
