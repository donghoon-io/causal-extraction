<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has provided the universities and other educational institutions a significant opportunities to support both face-to-face and remote course delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fletcher, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ngai, Poon, &amp; Chan, 2007</ref>). E-learning environments reduce the cost of provision and therefore increase revenues for academic institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Saadé &amp; Bahli, 2005)</ref>. They also afford students with more study flexibility and improve their learning experience and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Nora &amp; Snyder, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the perceived benefits of e-learning mentioned above, the efficiency of such tools will not be fully utilized if the users fail to use the system. Therefore, the successful implementation of e-learning tools depends on whether or not students are willing to adopt and accept the technology <ref type="bibr">(Clay, Rowland, &amp; Packard,</ref> use of web-based learning system (e.g. Blackboard) by students and instructors is mandatory in education. It is, therefore, clear that both students and instructors from Lebanon are exposed to web-based learning system literacy differently. For this reason, it may influence the way they think about, feel about and view e-learning in education.</p><p>In the technology acceptance and adoption literature, a considerable number of models have been applied (e.g., the theory of reasoned action (TRA), the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)) to investigate and explore the determinants of user's behaviour towards adoption and using information technology. Among these models, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davis, 1989)</ref> is the most frequently cited and influential model for explaining technology acceptance and adoption. Since it has been developed, TAM has been extensively used, tested, and extended to explain technology adoption and success in a number of application areas e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bagozzi, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yousafzai, Foxall, &amp; Pallister, 2007a)</ref> and in e-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Park, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Saeed &amp; Abdinnour-Helm, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Teo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yi-Cheng, Chun-Yu, Yi-Chen, &amp; Ron-Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhang, Zhao, &amp; Tan, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>User acceptance and usage behaviour towards technology can be influenced by a variety of factors such as cultural, individual differences and social influence. The limitation of TAM in explaining these factors in addition to the inconsistences in previous studies limit its applicability. Additionally, many TAM studies focus on Western/developed countries while TAM has not been widely tested within non-western/developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Teo, Luan, &amp; Sing, 2008)</ref>. Additionally, TAM showed bias when tested in nonwestern countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(McCoy, Everard, &amp; Jones, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Srite, 2006)</ref> and the applicability of TAM less clear in the educational settings as much of the research has been carried out in non-educational contexts.</p><p>In an attempt to increase the explanatory power of TAM, moderator factors such as individual differences potentially play an important role in the explanation of TAM's limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis, 2003)</ref>. For example, when including gender and experience in TAM2, the explanatory power increased from 35% to 53% <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. Furthermore, after testing eight models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> found that the predictive validity of six models was increased significantly after the inclusion of the moderating variables. Users may hold different perceptions based on their individual differences about e-learning technologies; understanding of such different perceptions is therefore essential for policy makers to provide better design and features. Despite finding many examples of the use of TAM in the Information Systems literature, thus far little published research includes moderator factors in technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Yousafzai et al., 2007a)</ref> especially in the case of acceptance of e-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Castañeda, Muñoz-Leiva, &amp; Luque, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>To address these limitations, this study will extend TAM to include two constructs, social norms and quality of work life <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kripanont, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zakour, 2004</ref>) and a set of individual differences (age, gender, educational level and experience) as moderators <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref> in order to enhance the understanding of the e-learning users. Specifically, our research will empirically investigate the factors that affect the acceptance and use of e-learning in the developing world, particularly in Lebanon as a cultural context. Second, this study also investigates the role of a set of individual differences as moderator (e.g., age, gender, experience, educational level) in an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents and explains our research model and describes the research hypotheses in detail. The data collection method, analysis and results are then   <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000)</ref>. SN is defined as a per-198 son's perception that most people who are important to him or 199 her think he or she should or should not perform the behaviour 200 in question <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980)</ref>. SN was studied in some 201 research as an antecedent of BI and in other studies as an anteced-202 ent to PU. However, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> argue the influence 203 of SN is very complex. This view is supported by the fact that there 204 has been some inconsistency in the literature about the influence 205 of SN on the intention to use the technology. For example, many researchers found a significant impact of SN on BI <ref type="bibr">(Lucas &amp; Spitler, 207 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Van Raaij &amp; Schepers, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> 208 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh 209 et al., 2003)</ref>, while a number of others failed to find any impact 210 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chau &amp; Hu, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dishaw &amp; Strong, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lewis, Agarwal, &amp; 211 Sambamurthy, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Davis (1989)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kripanont, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Srite &amp; karahanna, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> 236 <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zakour, 2004</ref>). However, it has not previously been considered 237 within an educational context and the current study therefore 238 explores whether it plays a role within this context. In this paper, 239 QWL is defined in terms of students' perception and belief that 240 using the technology will improve their quality of work life such 241 as saving expenses when downloading e-journals, or in communi-242 cation when using email to communicate with their instructors 243 and friends. Generally speaking, a mismatch between students 244 and the impact of technology on their lives can be disadvantageous 245 for both students and institutions which in turn affect their behav-246 ioural intention to use the web-based learning systems. Thus, the inclusion of this construct was due to the economic gains and increases in opportunities for advancement in students' lives and it is expected that the higher the QWL the better the acceptance of the technology. This is especially important in our study due to the fact that QWL is more dominated in the feminine cultures such as Lebanon, compared to masculine ones such as USA and England. In addition, we propose that understanding the relationship between QWL and BI is an important goal, in order to satisfy the various needs of the students and in return eliciting favourable behavioural intention. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zakour (2004)</ref>, the include of QWL in TAM will help in better understanding the technology acceptance by users and conclude that future research should highly consider this construct due to its importance. Therefore, it is hypothesised that:</p><p>H4. QWL will have a positive influence on student's behavioural intention to use the web-based learning system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Behavioural intentions for using an e-learning system</head><p>One of the major differences between TAM and earlier theories of acceptance is the presence of behavioural intention (BI). BI is considered to be an immediate antecedent of usage behaviour and gives an indication about an individuals' readiness to perform a specific behaviour. In TAM, both PU and PEOU influence an individual's intention to use the technology, which in turns influences the usage behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. There is considerable support in literature for the relationship between BI and usage behaviour in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. This has recently been extended to the e-learning context <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chang &amp; Tung, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McCarthy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Park, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Saeed &amp; Abdinnour-Helm, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Walker &amp; Johnson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yi-Cheng et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhang et al., 2008)</ref>. In addition, the path from BI to AU is significant in the TAM, DTPB, and TPB and models. BI has a large influence on AU. However, it is worth mentioning that when individuals have prior experience with using the technology, the effect of BI is more predictive on AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995b)</ref>. In the context of this research and similar to previous studies, this research considered both BI and AU as dependent variables in the theoretical framework. It is expected that BI will have a direct influence in predicting the usage behaviour of students to accept and use the Blackboard system in the future (Self-reported usage measures).</p><p>Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:   <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lymperopoulos &amp; Chaniotakis, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> 300 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. For PU, research reported that experience 301 significantly moderated the relationship of PU and BI <ref type="bibr">(Taylor &amp; 302 Todd, 1995b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref> with the relationship stronger 303 for experienced users. Additionally, the moderating effect of experi-304 ence on the relationship between PEOU and BI is clear and constant 305 in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 306 2000)</ref>. Generally speaking, when users have prior knowledge in 307 using the technology, this will provide the users with a more robust 308 base to learn as users will relate their incoming information with 309 what their already know <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990)</ref>. In other words, 310 experienced users will perceive that PEOU is not a major issue when 311 learning a new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al., 312 2003)</ref>. In contrast, inexperienced users with no prior knowledge 313 will prefer to use the technology which is easy to use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>314</head><p>With respect to SN, experience was also found to significantly 315 moderate the relationship between SN on BI <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 316 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venkatesh and Davis (2000)</ref> argued that the influence of 317 SN on BI will decrease over time. Where users already have exten-318 sive experience, the role of SN will be expected to be lower as users 319 are more able to draw on their own past experiences to shape their 320 perception rather than the opinions of others <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh &amp; Davis,</ref><ref type="bibr">321</ref> 2000; <ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Karahanna,</ref><ref type="bibr">Straub,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 322</ref> Chervany (1999) found that inexperienced users are more driven 323 by SNs more than experienced users. It is expected that the rela-324 tionship will be stronger for inexperienced users in computers 325 and internet since they will be more sensitive to their colleagues' 326 opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. Therefore, we propose the follow-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Walker &amp; Johnson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang, Wu, 343 &amp; Wang, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Yousafzai, Foxall, &amp; Pallister, 2007b)</ref>. Venkatesh 344 et al. <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref> reported that age was an important moderator within 345 their UTAUT model. They found that within an organizational context, the relationship between performance expectancy (similar to PU) and BI was stronger for younger employees, while the relationship between effort expectancy (similar to PEOU) and SN was stronger for older employees in accepting and using the technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Morris and Venkatesh (2000)</ref> found the same moderating effects of age. It could be that age increased the positive effect of SN due to greater need of affiliation e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burton-Jones &amp; Hubona, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Morris &amp; Venkatesh, 2000)</ref>. Correspondingly and since QWL also perceive the benefit of technology, it is expected that the relationship between QWL and BI will be stronger for younger users. Therefore, in the context of this study, it is expected that the effect of age on the relationship between PEOU, SN and BI will be stronger for older students, while the influence of PU on BI will be stronger for younger students. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:</p><p>H7a, b. The relationship between (PU, QWL) and BI is moderated by age such that the relationship is stronger for younger users than for older users.</p><p>H7c, d. The relationship between (PEOU, SN) and BI is moderated by age such that the relationship is stronger for older users than for younger users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Educational level</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational level like other individual factors has been studied</head><p>as an antecedent of PU or PEOU <ref type="bibr">(Agarwal &amp; Prasad, 1999)</ref> and as a moderator that may affect the relationship between main determinates and behavioural intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burton-Jones &amp; Hubona, 2006)</ref>. In particular, educational level was found to influence the relationships between PEOU, PU, <ref type="bibr">SN and BI (Burton-Jones &amp; Hubona, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mahmood, Hall, &amp; Swanberg, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rogers, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sun &amp; Zhang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zakaria, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Venkatesh, Morris, and Ackerman (2000)</ref> found a positive correlation between the level of education and PU, Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burton-Jones and Hubona (2006)</ref> suggested that higher education level leads to positive association with PU and more educated users are less sensitive to PEOU since it will reduce the computer anxiety and improve the overall attitude. On the other hand, educational level was also found to negatively affect the social influence on behaviour when adopting new technology in an organization as both education and experience will empower the users <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burton-Jones &amp; Hubona, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lymperopoulos &amp; Chaniotakis, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The moderating impact of educational level on the relationship between quality of life and behavioural intention has not been investigated in literature. Nevertheless, it is expected that educational level will have an impact on the relationship between QWL and BI such that the relationship will be stronger for students with higher educational level. The rationale is that students who have higher level of education will perceive the benefits of e-learning system and value the impact of this system on their career.</p><p>Despite mixed results, however the moderating role that educational level can play on the adoption and acceptance of technology is indisputable (see meta-analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mahmood et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sun and Zhang (2006)</ref>). Hence, in the context of this study, it is expected that the relationships between (PU, QWL) and BI will be stronger for users with higher educational level, while the relationships between (SN, PEOU) will be stronger for users with lower educational level. We thus propose the following hypotheses:</p><p>H8a, b. The relationship between (PU, QWL) and BI is moderated by educational level such that the relationship is stronger for users with higher level of education than users with lower level of education.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gefen &amp; Straub, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">He &amp; Freeman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Morris &amp; Venkatesh, 414</ref> 2000; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> 415 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wang et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al. 416 (2003)</ref> found that the explanatory power of TAM significantly 417 increased to 52% after the inclusion of gender as a moderator. More 418 specifically, gender was found to have a moderating impact on the 419 influence of PU, PEOU, QWL, SN, on BI and AU. 420 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> found gender to influence the relation-421 ship between PU and BI, with the relationship significantly stronger 422 for men compared to women. Their findings are consistent with lit-423 erature in social psychology, which emphasizes that men are more 424 ''pragmatic'' compared to women and highly task-oriented 425 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Minton, Schneider, &amp; Wrightsman, 1980)</ref> and usually have a 426 greater emphasis on earnings and motivated by achievement needs 427 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hoffmann, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005)</ref> which is directly 428 related to usefulness perceptions. Their argument is also supported 429 by other researchers e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Srite &amp; Karahanna, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Terzis &amp; 430</ref> Economides, 2011; <ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000)</ref>. In contrast, in an 431 educational context <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wang et al. (2009)</ref> did not find any moderating 432 effect of gender on the relationship between performance expec-433 tancy (similar to PU) and BI. Accordingly, it is also expected that 434 gender will also affect the relationship between QWL and BI since 435 it is focused on the benefits of the technology and this is more 436 related men than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kripanont, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>437</head><p>In terms of the moderating impact of gender on the relationship 438 between PEOU and BI, it is expected to be stronger for women 439 compared to men. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al.

In addition, the four individual differences variables Experience, Age (1 = less than or equal 22, 2 = greater than 22), Educational level (1 = postgraduate, 2 = undergraduate) and Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female) and Experience (1 = some experience, 2 = Experienced) were adapted based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venkatesh and Davis (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>The analysis of the research was conducted in two phases. The first phase examined the descriptive statistics of the measurement items and mainly involved the analysis of the measurement model to examine reliability and validity of the model. The second phase involved the analysis of the structural model and hypothesis testing. Also the descriptive statistics showed that the majority of participants indicate positive responses to the constructs that are measured in this study (see Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). All means were greater than 5 for the independent variables (PEOU, PU, SN and QWL) and 4.21 for the dependent variables (BI and AU). This result was unexpected as the previous literature suggests that Web-based learning system in Lebanon is still in its infancy (Baroud &amp; Abouchedid, Q5 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nasser &amp; Abouchedid, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">UNDP, 2002)</ref>. A plausible expla-524 nation could be that the majority of the Lebanese students already 525 perceive the benefits of using the e-learning system on their learn-526 ing experience and performance. that should be considered in order to assess the model goodness-536 of-fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hair et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kline, 2005)</ref>. First, it was determined using 537 the minimum fit function v 2 . However, as the v 2 was found to be 538 too sensitive to sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>, the ratio of the v 2 539 static to its degree of freedom (v 2 /df) was used, with a value of less 540 than 3 indicating acceptable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carmines &amp; McIver, 1981)</ref>. These  <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the level of acceptance fit and the fit indi-546 ces for the Lebanese sample after the improvement in model fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Sample descriptive analysis</head><p>The results of the CFA have shown the good measurement model fit to the data for the proposed model for the sample (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Therefore, the next step is to assess convergent validity, discriminant validity in addition to reliability in order to evaluate that the psychometric properties of the measurement model are adequate.</p><p>To estimate the reliability and convergent validity of the factors within the proposed model, composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) were used (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hair et al. (2010)</ref> suggest that the CR value should be greater than 0.6 and that the AVE should be greater than 0.5. As can be shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, the average extracted variances were all above 0.511 and above 0.672 for CR. Therefore, all factors have adequate reliability and convergent validity. Additionally, with the exception of AU, the total AVE of the average value of variables used for the research model is larger than their correlation value, thus there were discriminant validity issues. However, since AU is measured by two items only, deleting one of the variables might cause un-identification problems, therefore we established discriminant validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">The structural model analysis</head><p>The same criteria used for the measurement model was also used to measure the goodness-of-fit for the proposed model. The estimated values of fit indices have shown the good structural model fit to the data for the proposed research model in this study (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). This is clear from the table that all values were in the recommended range. The relationships between constructs were tested after supporting the validity and reliability of the measurement model. Structural equation modeling using AMOS 18.0 was used to test all the direct hypothesized relationships and the moderating effects of the individual variables.</p><p>As can be shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, all the direct hypotheses were supported. Firstly, PEOU and PU are the two factors that directly affect the behavioural intention whereas PEOU (c = 0.194 ⁄⁄⁄ ) is the most significant determinant compared with PU (c = 0.143 ⁄⁄ ) towards using Blackboard, supporting H1 and H2. This means that students like to use the system if it's easy to use and also if they have good feelings about the usefulness of Blackboard in enhancing their productivity and knowledge. Moreover, the influence of colleagues and instructors on students' behavioural intention to use the system was found to have a high significance, SN (c = 0.114 ⁄⁄⁄ ) supporting H3. Moreover, BI were also influenced by the quality of work life (ß = 0.445 ⁄⁄⁄ ), supporting H4. Furthermore, the results also shows that Actual Usage is influenced by the behavioural intention (c = 0.583 ⁄⁄⁄ ) which supports H5.</p><p>As can be shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>, the results of the multi-group analysis have shown that most of hypothesized relationships of the moderating effect of individual differences were supported. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref> presents the results of the analysis and a summary of the results is discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Our research question of this study focused on the impact of individual differences of students on the acceptance and usage of web-based learning systems in Arab cultures, particularly in Lebanon as a cultural context and Blackboard as a web-based learning system. A conceptual model that extends the TAM to include social norms and quality of work life constructs as main dominants was proposed. This model incorporated a set of individual differences of students as moderators to overcome the limitation of TAM. Not surprisingly, all the direct relationship between PEOU, PU, SN, and QWL with BI were supported with 43.2% of the model variance explained. QWL was found to be the most important factor in predicting intention to use the system. This research is therefore the first to find empirical support for these relationships in the Leba-610 nese context. While these results are very close to traditional 611 TAM as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Davis (1989)</ref> they also suggest that there </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Experience</head><p>Experience was found to moderate the relationships between PU_BI, PEOU_BI and SN_BI (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>). The relationship between PU and BI was stronger for experienced users, supporting previous findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Taylor and Todd (1995b)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand the relationship between PEOU and BI was stronger for less experienced users. Again this is consistent with previous studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000)</ref>. The relationship between SN and BI was also stronger for less experienced users, supporting the previous findings of other researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. Our findings suggest that less experienced students are more likely to use the system if it easy to use and if they believe others think they should use the system. On the contrary, experienced users will form their perception towards using a new technology based on their previous knowledge that they gained from using similar technologies in the past <ref type="bibr">(Morris &amp; Venkatesh, 2000)</ref> and will be less influenced by the views of others or the perceived ease of use of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Age</head><p>As expected, age was found to moderate the relationships between PEOU_BI, SN_BI and QWL_BI. These results indicate that there still exist significant generational gaps despite the rapid growth in internet use among older users. In particular, the relationship between QWL_BI was stronger for younger students. This suggests that QWL is a more salient factor for the younger users.</p><p>On the other hand, the relationships between SN_BI and PEOU_BI were stronger for older students. These results indicate that older students are driven by the ease of use of the web-based learning system and also highly influenced by other's opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref> compared to younger students. This may be due to the fact that older users have lower computer self-efficacy than younger users and also affiliation needs increase with age e.g. <ref type="bibr">(Morris &amp; Venkatesh, 2000)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burton-Jones &amp; Hubona, 2006)</ref>. In contrast, younger students are less driven by ease of use and less influenced by other's opinions. Contrary to previous research and our hypotheses, no moderating role of age was found on the relationship between PU_BI, which means that no matter what age group a student belonged to, those who have are higher on PU will have better intention to use the e-learning system.  that when the education level of users increases, their intention 685 to use web-based learning systems increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calisir et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Educational level</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>686</head><p>However, contrary to our hypotheses and previous research e.g. 687 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burton-Jones &amp; Hubona, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al., 2000)</ref>, no moder-688 ating effect of educational level was found on the relationship 689 between PU_BI and QWL_BI. This effect may be due to having a 690 study population who are all at a very similar educational level. The results (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>) showed that gender moderates the rela-693 tionships between PU_BI, SN_BI, and QWL_BI. In terms of the mod-694 erating effect of gender on both PU_BI and QWL_BI, our results</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>695</head><p>indicate that the relationships were stronger for male users. Our 696 results are consistent with literature in social psychology, which 697 emphasizes that men are more ''pragmatic'' compared to women 698 and highly task-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Minton et al., 1980)</ref> and usually have a 716 <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>, no moderat-717 ing effect of gender were found on the relationship between PEOU  in user technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. This study 736 concludes that age, gender, experience and educational level play 737 an important role between the key determinants and users' intentions towards using the web-based learning systems in the Lebanese context. Specially, this study replicated the findings of previous research e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Morris et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wang et al., 2009)</ref> but in the Lebanese context regarding the relationship between PU, PEOU, SN and BI. However, there is inconclusive evidence in previous research of whether it actually affects the relationship between the QWL and BI. Our results suggest that the relationship was found to be stronger users who are younger in age, males in gender, and more experienced in using computers and internet. Our result differs from those of <ref type="bibr">Kriponant (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Srite and Karahanna (2000)</ref> who failed to support these relationships. Therefore, this study is one of the first that succeeded to support the moderating role of those individual differences on the relationship between QWL and BI.</p><p>In contrast to the majority of studies that consider behaviour in western societies, our study supports TAM's reliability and validity in an educational context in the developing world and more specifically in Lebanon. TAM has been criticised for showing bias in a cross-cultural context e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(McCoy et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Straub et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, many TAM studies focus on Western/developed countries, while TAM has not been widely tested within non-Western/developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Teo et al., 2008)</ref>. Consequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teo (2008)</ref> emphasizes on the importance of testing TAM in different cultures as it is argued that when Davis developed the TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davis, 1989)</ref> From a practical point of view, QWL has been found to be the most important construct in explaining the causal process in the model. Therefore, for e-learning this construct is more relevant than the traditional PU and PEOU conceptualizations. The demonstration that quality of work life is important in the e-learning context also suggests that system designers should pay attention to providing systems that address this concern and that educators should explain the benefits of e-learning in terms that relate to this construct. Additionally, this finding should inspire not only organizations but also the government in promoting the importance of introducing a new technology on the quality of work life.</p><p>In terms of behavioural beliefs (PEOU and PU), the results shows that PEOU contributed the most to behavioural intention compared to the PU. These findings are noticed more within respondents who are females, less-skilled in using technology, lower in educational level. In this context, it is therefore believed that students who find the system useful in their learning process and also find the system easy to use are more likely to adopt the system. The results also suggest that training is crucial for individuals who belong to the first segment mentioned above; however it is not necessary for the other one, since those users will form their perceptions about using the web-based learning system on the ease of use of the system no matter how useful the system is. Therefore, in order to attract more users of e-learning, instructors should improve the content quality of their web-based learning systems by providing 805 sufficient, up-to-date content that can fit the students' needs. In 806 order to promote the ease of use of such systems, system designers 807 should provide a system which promotes ease of use.</p></div>

Firstly, our sample frame was based on convenience sampling technique and included participants studying at two private universities and their views may differ from those who study at other universities. Thus, generalizability of the findings should be treated with caution. Additionally the age range of the sample is somewhat limited but that is representative of higher education.</p><p>Secondly, our study investigated the impact of moderating factors in a mandatory environment within one context.

Further work could also consider different user groups (e.g., students with disability, children)</p><p>and/or different organizational contexts (e.g., High schools or public institutions) to explore the validity of the model in different contexts.</p><p>Thirdly, future research may extend our study to integrate other potential constructs of interest to the education community such as university and government support, or self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000)</ref> in order to increase the explained variance of TAM. In addition, further research could consider another set of individual differences such as culture and more specifically individual-level cultural variables since acceptance of technology by end-users is an individual-level concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Srite &amp; Karahanna, 2006)</ref> only then a more complete picture of the dynamic nature of individual technology may begin to emerge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>The main objective of this study is to examine how a set of individual differences (e.g., age, gender, educational level and experience) of users can affect users' perceptions about adopting e-learning tools in Lebanon. All the individual differences variables were integrated as moderators into an extended TAM. This study has successfully supported, both theoretically and empirically, the ability of TAM to be a useful theoretical framework for better understanding the student's acceptance of e-learning technology within the Lebanese context.</p><p>While we found support for the traditional TAM constructs of PU and PEOU in predicting BI towards using web-based learning system, we found that QWL was a stronger predictor than either of these in this educational context.

They found that SN will play a larger role in collectivist cul-220 tures than individualist cultures. This research assumes that SN 221 will play an important role in predicting BI and those students will 222 be highly influenced by their colleagues and instructors. The ratio-223 nale is based on the cultural index which is proposed by Hofstede 224 (1980). He indicated that power distance (PD) and Masculinity 225 (M/F) are high and Individualism (I/C) is low in Lebanon. Therefore, 226 based on the inconsistencies of the above findings and the impor-227 tance of SN in establishing behavioural intention towards adoption 228 and acceptance of a technology and its impact on PU, and in an 229 attempt to overcome the limitation of TAM in measuring the 230 influence of social environments (Teo, 2009), it is hypothesised: 231 H3. SN will have a positive influence on student's behavioural 232 intention to use and accept the e-learning technology.233 2.3. Quality of Work Life (QWL) 234 QWL was included due to its proposed importance in technol-235 ogy acceptance</figDesc></figure>

Sampling and survey administration 460 The target sample for this survey was Lebanese web-based 461 learning system users, studying full or part time for Masters or 462 undergraduate degrees (in a number of disciplines) at two univer-463 sities located in Beirut. Participation was on a voluntary basis and no financial incentive was offered. The current study, as the majority of empirical research in technology acceptance, has used a nonprobability convenience sampling technique as it enables the researcher to collect data from the participants based on their availability. It also helps the researcher to improvise with the resource available for the research especially when there is lack of time and financial resources. A total of 1000 self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the students, the number of returned questionnaires were 640 indicating a 64% response rate.</figDesc></figure>

Therefore, from the 614 empirical validity of TAM across cultures perspective, TAM was 615 found to be accepted within the Lebanese culture in the field of 616 e-learning acceptance. Interestingly, based on the relationship 617 with intention to use, the findings in the study show that perceived 618 ease of use has a greater effect on intention to use the Blackboard 619 system, compared to perceived usefulness. This result contradicts 620 with the original TAM model. In light of these results, the manage-621 ment should provide on-line and off-line training to enhance the 622 students' skills in using the system. 623 Our results also indicate that some of moderating factors were 624 not supported while some others were found to have a significant 625 effect on the relationship between the four determinants and 626 behavioural intention to use the web-based learning system.

From the theoretical point of view, the core outcomes 727 of this research is to develop a conceptual research model that 728 allow a better understanding of the factors that affect the accep-729 tance of e-learning technology in Lebanon, and to study the impact 730 of a set of moderators; namely individual characteristics; on the 731 relationship between those factors and behavioural intention to 732 use the technology. Therefore, this study adds to the few studies 733 that take into account a set of individual factors (age, experience, 734 gender and educational level) and highlight their important role 735</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_14"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, he did not take into consideration the un-biased reliability of TAM in cross-cultural settings. Our results revealed that e-learning is well accepted in Lebanon despite potential problems mentioned earlier. Additionally, our results indicate that the TAM holds across cultures, therefore other Lebanese researchers can apply findings from previous research to local studies. Our research extends the TAM to examine the impact of social influence and perceived quality of work life on the acceptance of technology and added a further step to the studies that take into account the social factors in technology acceptance and adoption. A significant contribution of this work is to demonstrate the relevance of quality of work life as an antecedent to behavioural intention within the context of e-learning adoption. This variable has previously been suggested as potentially important but had not been included in empirical work on TAM, nor had it been investigated in relation to e-learning acceptance in Lebanon. The results of our study validate and confirm that quality of work life is an important consideration in the study of e-learning adoption.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_15"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>significant findings of the individual factors provide an important insight. All the major and different individual factors should be considered simultaneously only then a more complete picture of the dynamic nature of individual technology may begin to emerge.Although TAM and other user acceptance models have been validated empirically, research continues to add social factors to increase the explanatory power of such models. This study moves in that direction. By including social norms and quality of work life as main determinants in addition to a set of individual differences, we can describe and understand how the students make their decisions about using and adopting web-based learning systems. We hope that future research can build on the findings of this research and offer greater insights on the social and individual factors rather than simply the technological solution.</figDesc></figure>
