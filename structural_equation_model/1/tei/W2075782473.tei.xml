<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The study of mediation has a long tradition in the social sciences and a relatively more recent one in epidemiology. The first school is linked to path analysis and structural equation models (SEMs), while the second is related mostly to methods developed within the potential outcomes approach to causal inference. By giving model-free definitions of direct and indirect effects and clear assumptions for their identification, the latter school has formalized notions intuitively developed in the former and has greatly increased the flexibility of the models involved. However, through its predominant focus on nonparametric identification, the causal inference approach to effect decomposition via natural effects is limited to settings that exclude intermediate confounders. Such confounders are naturally dealt with (albeit with the caveats of informality and modeling inflexibility) in the SEM framework. Therefore, it seems pertinent to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and ( parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference. Here we investigate: 1) how identification assumptions affect the specification of SEMs, 2) whether the more restrictive SEM assumptions can be relaxed, and 3) whether existing sensitivity analyses can be extended to this setting. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children  (1990-2005)  are used for illustration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The epidemiologic literature on causal inference is alight with contributions dedicated to the study of mediation. (A PubMed search for articles on mediation analysis in epidemiology produced 118 "hits" for articles published in 2012 and 110 "hits" for articles published in 2013.) The topic owes its origins, however, to an older body of literature that is well known in the social sciences. This school is often referred to as the "Baron and Kenny approach" (1, 2) but is linked to Sewall Wright's path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> and its extension, structural equation models (SEMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. It includes several important publications that are less well known in the epidemiologic literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Contributions from the causal inference school have formalized and generalized notions intuitively developed in the SEM school, first by defining (using potential outcomes) precisely what is meant by direct and indirect effects, then by giving clear assumptions under which they can be identified, and lastly by generalizing the statistical methods available for carrying out such analyses to allow for nonlinearities, interactions, discrete outcomes, and semiparametric estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>With a few notable exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, the literature on natural direct and indirect effects focuses predominantly on nonparametric identification, which leads to the strong assumption of "no intermediate confounders"-that is, that no confounders (measured or unmeasured) of the mediator and outcome may be affected by the exposure. By relying on parametric models, however, such confounders are naturally dealt with in the SEM framework. Therefore, it is pertinent and timely to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and ( parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference to reconcile the 2 approaches in this particular context.</p><p>In this article, we review how paths are traced in order to derive direct and indirect effects in simple linear SEMs which include intermediate confounders but exclude nonlinearities, and show their equivalence to the definitions based on potential outcomes. We then investigate how different parametric assumptions for identification of the natural effects in the presence of intermediate confounders affect the specification of an extended SEM that includes nonlinearities. We further investigate whether the usual SEM assumption of "no omitted influences" of any pair of variables in the system can be relaxed when estimation of the natural effects is the goal. Finally, we widen existing sensitivity analyses to the setting with intermediate confounding, exploiting the SEM framework.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Settings and aims</head><p>We will discuss settings involving an exposure X, an outcome Y, a mediator M, background confounders C of 1 or more of the relationships X-Y, M-Y, and X-M, and intermediate confounders L of the M-Y relationship (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The aim is to separate the causal effect of X acting along pathways that include M from the causal effect of X acting along other pathways that do not involve M (the indirect and direct effects, respectively).</p><p>For simplicity, we let X be a binary variable and assume that observations are not affected by missingness or measurement error.</p></div>

For mediation analysis, these are: M(x), the potential value of M if X had been set, possibly counter to fact, to the value x; Y(x, m), the potential value of Y if X had been set to x and M to m; and Y(x, M(x′)), the composite potential value of Y if X had been set to x and M to M(x′).</p><p>Several definitions of direct and indirect effects have been proposed, with the choice depending on the causal question being addressed.

Intuitively, this is an indirect effect, since it captures the part of the effect of X on Y that is transmitted by M. There is no equivalent complement of CDE(m) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assumptions</head><p>In the absence of intermediate confounders. Identification of these estimands is possible if certain assumptions hold. Those most commonly invoked are specific versions of no interference, consistency, and conditional exchangeability.</p><p>Briefly, in the setting with no intermediate confounders and for CDE(m), the assumption of no interference states that an individual's outcome is not influenced by the exposure status of another person <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> and also that the mediator value for one individual has no effect on the outcome in another.</p><p>The assumption of consistency states that Y(x, m) equals Y among subjects with observed exposure level X = x and mediator level M = m <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. The assumption of conditional exchangeability states that once individuals are stratified according to confounders C, their allocation to X is essentially "random" within these strata, and once they are stratified according to X and C, their allocation to M is essentially random within those strata. More formally, conditional exchangeability states that YðxÞ⊥ ⊥ XjC and Yðx; mÞ⊥ ⊥ MjC; X, implying no X-Y confounding conditionally on C and no M-Y confounding conditionally on C and X <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>.

Equations 2 and 3 are known as the mediation formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</p><p>In the presence of intermediate confounders. Identifying CDE(m) in the presence of intermediate confounders L can be achieved by adapting the assumption of no unaccounted M-Y confounding to include conditioning on L ðYðx; mÞ⊥ ⊥ MjC; X; LÞ and updating identification formula 1 (equation 1) to include the contribution via L. This is commonly referred to as the G-computation formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(Web Appendix, part B).</formula><p>In contrast, identification of the natural effects, PNDE and TNIE, additionally involves some parametric restrictions on the relationships among X, M, L, and Y. Originally the restriction was stated by <ref type="bibr">Robins and Greenland (11)</ref> as no X-M interaction at an individual level. Alternatively, Petersen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> suggested assuming that, conditional on C, the CDE does not vary with M(0). Under either of these additional parametric assumptions, PNDE and TNIE are identified by formulae that are extensions of equations 2 and 3. (Identification can also be obtained under certain "no-3-way-interaction" assumptions when the exposure is randomly assigned <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> or under no average L-M interaction in a nonparametric SEM with mutually independent errors (29).)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation</head><p>Several approaches have been proposed for the estimation of these estimands, with standard errors typically obtained by sandwich estimation or bootstrapping ( for a review, see Vansteelandt <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>). Among them, an extension of Robins' (47) G-computation that incorporates the mediation formula posits regression models for each of the (conditional) expectations/probabilities/densities in the identifying equations, estimates their parameters (e.g., using maximum likelihood), and then plugs these estimates into the sums/integrals above <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49)</ref>. When the G-computation formula is too cumbersome to be evaluated analytically, the integration can be approximated through Monte Carlo simulation (47, 50) (see <ref type="bibr">Appendix 2)</ref>. The advantage of this approach is efficiency when all models are correctly specified, as well as flexibility. Essentially any combination of types (binary/categorical/ continuous) of outcomes, mediators, and intermediate confounders can be modeled with little restriction on the assumed models, although the resulting complexities are a drawback <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>To lessen the reliance on parametric modeling assumptions, many alternative semiparametric estimation approaches have been suggested, in particular G-estimation of structural nested models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, doubly and multiply robust methods that combine 1 or more of these approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>, and multiply robust methods based on targeted maximum likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SEM framework</head><p>Unlike the above, the definitions of direct and indirect effects given in the SEM literature depend on the specification of a particular statistical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. In the setting of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (with single C and L), the following model for continuous Y, M, and L could be specified:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L ¼ γ 0 þ γ x X þ γ c C þ ϵ l M ¼ α 0 þ α x X þ α l L þ α c C þ ϵ m Y ¼ β 0 þ β x X þ β m M þ β l L þ β c C þ ϵ y ; 8 &lt; :<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where X and C are exogenous variables (no equations are specified for them), Y, M, and L are endogenous variables, and ϵ l , ϵ m , and ϵ y are mean-zero error terms, uncorrelated with each other and with the exogenous variables. This is a linear path model for the joint distribution of Y, M, and L (4, 52). Sequentially replacing the expression for L into the equation for M and that for M into the equation for Y, we obtain the reduced form of model 4 (equation 4):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">X Y M L C β x β m β c α x α c γ x γ c β l α l</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">Y ¼ ðβ 0 þ α 0 β m þ α l β m γ 0 þ β l γ 0 Þ þ ðβ x þ α x β m þ α l β m γ x þ β l γ x ÞX þ ðβ c þ α c β m þ β l γ c þ α l β m γ c ÞC þ ðβ m ϵ m þ α l β m ϵ l þ β l ϵ l þ ϵ y Þ:</formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">Here (β x + α x β m + α l β m γ x + β l γ x</formula><p>) is taken to represent the total causal effect of X on Y. It can be partitioned into the direct (not mediated by M) and indirect (mediated) effects of X by tracing the paths in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> that make up the total effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. The indirect effect is found by multiplying the parameters along each of the (directed) paths from X to Y that include M and summing them; here, this is (α x β m + γ x α l β m ). The direct effect is the sum of the remainder, (β x + γ x β l ). This is a more general version of the product of coefficients method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53)</ref>.</p><p>Tracing the paths is possible only when the models for the endogenous variables are linear and do not include any interactions or other nonlinearities, although generalizations to settings with binary outcomes (via logit or probit regression) have been suggested, with standardization of the estimated parameters used to deal with their differences in scale across models <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. Other approaches within the SEM framework (i.e., without relying on counterfactuals) have also been proposed for general link functions and for models with interactions and other nonlinearities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>, but these are only approximate and do not explicitly deal with settings with intermediate confounding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assumptions and estimation</head><p>Depending on the author, the identifying assumptions given in the SEM literature vary in detail, but essentially they are (5, 7, 8, 52, 56):</p><p>1. Correct temporal order between X, L, M, and Y. 2. "No omitted influences" (8), or "no lack of self-containment" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, or "no other hidden relevant causes" (52). 3. Correct functional forms of each equation in the model. 4. Accurate measurements of all of the observed variables. 5. Error terms that are uncorrelated with each other and with the exogenous variables.</p><p>The first 2 assumptions are structural, that is, causal, meaning that the regression equations fully reflect the underlying datagenerating process and that they justify the apportioning of the mediation effects described above <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>. For settings with intermediate confounders, "no omitted influences" is a stronger assumption than the conditional exchangeability assumption invoked in the causal inference literature, since it also involves no L-Y confounding.</p><p>The last 3 assumptions are statistical. The first refers to the linearity and additivity of the relationships among the variables, the second to the reliability of the available data, and the third to the behavior of the error terms. Requiring the error terms to be uncorrelated with each other and with the exogenous variables guarantees unbiased estimation of the model's parameters via least squares. These estimated parameters can then be combined to obtain estimates of the direct and indirect effects, with measures of their precision obtained via the delta method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> or bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>. Importantly, departures from the statistical assumptions have repercussions for the structural ones. Correlated error terms-or correlated error terms and exogenous variables-would indicate departures from the structural assumption of no omitted relevant variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. Departures from the assumption of accurate measurements of the observed variables would lead to biased estimates of the model parameters and consequently of the mediation parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, the SEM literature does not mention the assumptions of no interference and consistency invoked by the causal inference literature, even though both are required for the estimated parameters to be interpreted as causal <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSIGHTS</head><p>The causal inference estimands are defined in generality, although identification is achieved only parametrically when intermediate confounding is present. The SEM estimands are derived from specific parametric structural models that naturally include intermediate confounders. The 2 approaches are therefore very different, but they converge under certain scenarios.

Although these equivalences apply only to linear SEMs that have no interactions or other nonlinear terms involving X, M, and L, closed-form solutions for the causal estimands above are not restricted to these simple models. Appendix 1 shows the closed-form solutions obtained for a more general linear SEM:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L ¼ γ 0 þ γ x X þ γ c C þ ϵ l M ¼ α 0 þ α x X þ α l L þ α c C þ α xl XL þ ϵ m Y ¼ β 0 þ β x X þ β l L þ β ll L 2 þ β m M þ β mm M 2 þ β c C þ β xl XL þ β xm XM þ ϵ y ; 8 &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; :<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>where the residual terms are uncorrelated with each other and the explanatory variables in their equations and have constant variances σ 2 l , σ 2 m , and σ 2 y , respectively. Parametric G-computation of the causal estimands above can then be achieved by combining the relevant estimated parameters of the assumed SEM, leading to what we refer to as estimation by combination (see Appendix 2 for its implementation in Mplus (Muthén and Muthén, Los Angeles, California); this implementation is more general than those in the papers by <ref type="bibr">Valeri and VanderWeele (15)</ref> and Emsley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>, which deal only with settings without L). Comparing the results obtained from analytical (i.e., bycombination) and Monte Carlo G-computation allows evaluation of the extent of the Monte Carlo error, as illustrated in the example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Understanding the assumptions required for parametric identification</head><p>Identifiability of the natural direct and indirect effects in the presence of intermediate confounding involves some parametric restrictions on the relationships among X, M, L, and Y. Specifically, Robins and Greenland <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> proposed the assumption of no individual X-M interaction-formally, that Yð1; mÞ À Yð0; mÞ is the same for all m. For settings in which parametric models for Y, M, and L are specified via linear regression, this can be formally examined.</p><p>For example, consider model 5 (equation 5). Assuming it is correctly specified, we see that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Yð1;mÞÀYð0;mÞ ¼ β x þ β l ðLð1ÞÀLð0ÞÞ þβ ll ðLð1Þ 2 ÀLð0Þ 2 Þ þβ xl Lð1Þþβ xm m ¼ β x þ β l γ x þ β ll fγ 2 x þ 2γ x ðγ 0 þ γ c C þϵ l Þg þβ xl ðγ 0 þ γ x þ γ c C þ ϵ l Þþβ xm m;</formula><p>and thus the Robins and Greenland assumption holds if and only if β xm ¼ 0: Note that, had our model for Y included a term in LM, the Robins and Greenland assumption would also have constrained its coefficient (β lm ) to be zero (in line with the constraint proposed by Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele (29)).</p><p>Petersen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> propose the alternative identifying assumption that, within levels of C, the CDE does not vary with M(0).

Thus, given this particular model, we have 2 options in the presence of intermediate confounders: Either we identify the PNDE and TNIE under the assumption that β xm = 0 or we identify them under the assumption that β ll = β xl = 0. Hence, examining the significance of these parameters in an associational model for Y that contains all of these terms should aid in the selection of identification assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equivalence in assumptions</head><p>As we stated above, there is an interesting difference with regard to the identifying assumptions invoked by the 2 approaches when the model involves intermediate confounders. Under the SEM, all of the error terms are assumed to be uncorrelated with each other, a scenario which would not be satisfied were the L-Y relationship affected by unmeasured confounding, given C and X (represented by U in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). This is not a restriction invoked by the causal inference framework (as it concerns only confounding of X-Y, X-M, and M-Y).</p><p>However, when the focus is identification of mediation effects within the SEM framework, the assumption of no L-Y confounding is actually not required once the parametric assumptions discussed above are made (for a justification based on the theory described by Wermuth and Cox <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>, see part C of the Web Appendix and-for a simpler setting-Moerkerke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref>; also see Pearl <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref>). Thus, there is no contradiction in fitting a SEM without assuming no L-Y confounding.</p></div>

The parameters of model 6 (equation 6) are not identified because β m and ρ are collinear, whereas the parameters of model 7 (equation 7) are.</p><p>Similarly to Imai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>, we focus on ρ′ and interpret it as a measure of the strength of any unmeasured M-Y confounding that would imply an indirect effect of zero. Estimating ρ′ is straightforward: Model 7 is fitted and the residuals are calculated, with their sample correlation being ρ0 . A confidence interval for ρ0 is then obtained by bootstrapping (Stata code (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) given in Appendix 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>To illustrate the advantages of fitting SEMs when studying mediation, we analyze data on eating-disorder behaviors in adolescent girls. An adolescent eating-disorder study was carried out as part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a birth cohort study of babies born between 1990 and 1992 in the South West of the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>. It involved data on eating-disorder behaviors collected by parental questionnaire on nearly 3,000 girls when they were around age 13.5 years. This information was used to identify 3 (standardized) latent scores for disordered eating patterns via factor analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>. For illustration, we use one of these latent dimensions, "bingeing or overeating," as the outcome of interest and study whether the influence of high maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m) 2 ; coded &gt;25 for high and ≤25 for low) is mediated by the daughter's BMI in childhood ( prospectively calculated from measurements taken at about age 7 years).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maternal BMI Bingeing or Overeating</head><p>Childhood BMI Maternal Mental Illness, Maternal Education Birth Weight M. It appears that there is little evidence to reject β xm = 0 (P = 0.76), while the evidence for β xl and β ll being nonzero is greater (P = 0.08 and P = 0.01, respectively), suggesting that the Robins and Greenland assumption may be more plausible in this example. We nevertheless report the estimates of the mediation effects obtained under both assumptions in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> (see also Web Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The results suggest a strong mediated effect of high maternal BMI on "bingeing or overeating" via childhood BMI, with a smaller direct effect capturing all other pathways. It appears therefore that more than 60% of the total effect of maternal overweight is transmitted via the daughter's own size in childhood and not via other pathways, including birth weight, implicating a contribution of childhood environmental factors. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> also highlights the closeness of the results obtained using Monte Carlo Gcomputation and G-computation via estimation by combination; however, this required the size of the Monte Carlo sample to be increased to 100,000.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses show that a noncausal residual correlation between childhood BMI and "bingeing or overeating" would have to be very large, at least equal to 0.324 (95% confidence interval: 0.287, 0.361), to remove the path mediated by childhood BMI.</p></div>
