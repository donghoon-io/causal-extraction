<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The development of statistically efficient and computationally practicable estimation methods for the analysis of structural equation models with multiple nonlinear effects has been called for by substantive researchers in psychology, marketing research, and sociology. But the development of efficient methods is complicated by the fact that a nonlinear model structure implies specifically nonnormal multivariate distributions for the indicator variables. In this paper, nonlinear structural equation models with quadratic forms are introduced and a new Quasi-Maximum Likelihood method for simultaneous estimation of model parameters is developed with the focus on statistical efficiency and computational practicability. The Quasi-ML method is based on an approximation of the nonnormal density function of the joint indicator vector by a product of a normal and a conditionally normal density. The results of Monte-Carlo studies for the new Quasi-ML method indicate that the parameter estimation is almost as efficient as ML estimation, whereas ML estimation is only computationally practical for elementary models. Also, the Quasi-ML method outperforms other currently available methods with respect to efficiency. It is demonstrated in a Monte-Carlo study that the Quasi-ML method permits computationally feasible and very efficient analysis of models with multiple latent nonlinear effects. Finally, the applicability of the Quasi-ML method is illustrated by an empirical example of an aging study in psychology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the last two decades, structural equation modeling (SEM) has become a common statistical tool for modeling relationships between variables which cannot be observed directly, but only with measurement error. The relationships between these unobservable, latent variables are formulated in structural equations, and they are measured with errors by indicator variables in a measurement model. By the development of software packages for covariance structure analysis such as Amos <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arbuckle 1997)</ref>, EQS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bentler 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bentler &amp; Wu 1993)</ref>, LISREL <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, 1996a)</ref>, or Mplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Muthén &amp; Muthén 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2001)</ref>, SEM has become available to a large community of researchers.</p><p>While ordinary SEM incorporates linear relationships among latent variables, models with nonlinear structural equations have recently attracted increasing attention. Several researchers have called for estimation methods for nonlinear latent variable models, and numerous substantive theories in education and psychology call for analysis of nonlinear models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ajzen &amp; Madden 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cronbach 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cronbach &amp; Snow 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Karasek 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lusch &amp; Brown 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Snyder &amp; Tanke 1976)</ref>. Also, a need for nonlinear extensions of ordinary SEM has been expressed from a methodological perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aiken &amp; West 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Busemeyer &amp; Jones 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cohen &amp; Cohen 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jaccard, Turisi &amp; Wan 1990)</ref>, and different ad-hoc estimation approaches have been developed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hayduk (1987)</ref> established the estimation of an elementary interaction model with one latent product term proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kenny and Judd (1984)</ref>. Using LISREL 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom 1989)</ref>, they formed products of indicators for measuring the latent product term. Two-step LISREL approaches for this elementary model were proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moosbrugger, Frank, and Schermelleh-Engel (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ping (1995</ref><ref type="bibr">Ping ( , 1996a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ping ( , 1996b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ping ( , 1998) )</ref> who implemented a stepwise LISREL procedure by estimating the measurement model in a first step and the parameters of the structural equation in a second step.</p><p>Other approaches aim at estimating the nonlinear model within the framework of covariance structure analysis. The technique of forming products of indicators was improved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jaccard and Wan (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jöreskog and Yang (1996</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">), and Yang Jonsson (1997)</ref> who used nonlinear parameter constraints for estimation of the elementary interaction model under LISREL 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom 1996a)</ref>. Simulation studies show that the LISREL-ML estimation procedure can be used for parameter estimation of the elementary interaction model (Yang Jonsson 1997), but applicability seems to be limited to elementary quadratic or cross-product models because of instable sampling characteristics of the covariance matrices which include covariances of products of indicators. Also, the distributional assumptions of LISREL-ML are violated for a nonlinear structural equation model, and standard errors and χ 2 -statistics can be erroneous and require an adjustment for bias <ref type="bibr">(Yang-Wallentin &amp; Jöreskog 2001)</ref>. Moreover, simulation studies for the elementary interaction model indicate that the LISREL parameter estimators do not have maximum efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Klein &amp; Moosbrugger 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schermelleh-Engel et al. 1998)</ref>.</p><p>As an alternative to covariance structure analysis, a two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation technique has been developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bollen (1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bollen ( , 1996) )</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bollen and Paxton (1998)</ref> using instrumental variables for estimating an elementary quadratic or interaction model, but, although no distributional assumptions are violated for this method, simulation studies showed that 2SLS estimators are substantially less efficient when compared to alternative estimation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Klein &amp; Moosbrugger 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schermelleh-Engel et al. 1998)</ref>. Using Bayesian estimation techniques, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arminger and Muthén (1998)</ref> proposed a computationally intensive method and demonstrated it for elementary models with one latent product term. <ref type="bibr">Blom and Christoffersson (2000)</ref> developed an estimation method based on the empirical characteristic function of the distribution of the indicator variables. But both approaches seem to be limited to elementary models because of their computational burden.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wall and Amemiya (2000)</ref> developed a two-step methods of moments (2SMM) technique for a general polynomial structural equation model. In the first step, the parameters of the measurement model are estimated by using a factor analytical technique. In the second step, conditional moments of products of latent variables under the condition of certain indicator variables are calculated and a methods of moments procedure using these conditional moments is applied to estimate the parameters of the structural equation. In particular, the assumption of normally distributed latent variables can be relaxed with this technique when distribution-free factor score estimators are used in the first step. Wall and Amemiya illustrate the 2SMM estimation technique with simulation studies for a quadratic and a cubic linear structural equation model with one latent independent variable measured with high reliability. In theory, the 2SMM approach can be generalized to more complex nonlinear latent variable models. But it needs to be investigated how much the non-simultaneous, two-step estimation procedure and the choice of a complex nonlinear model affect the efficiency of the 2SMM estimators in cases with low to medium reliable indicator variables.</p><p>With the LMS (latent moderated structural equations) method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Klein and Moosbrugger (2000)</ref> introduced a maximum likelihood estimation technique for latent interaction models with multiple latent product terms. In the LMS method, the latent independent variables and the error variables are assumed to be normally distributed. The distribution of the indicator variables is approximated by a finite mixture distribution and the loglikelihood function is maximized by use of the EM algorithm. In contrast to non-ML estimation methods, LMS also allows for likelihood ratio model difference tests which can test for the significance of one or several nonlinear effects simultaneously. Simulation studies for the elementary interaction model indicate that LMS provides efficient parameter estimators and a reliable model difference test, and they show no indication of bias of standard errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Klein 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Klein &amp; Moosbrugger 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schermelleh-Engel et al. 1998)</ref>. But, although models with multiple latent product terms can be analyzed with the LMS method, the method can become computationally too intensive for models with three or more product terms involved in the structural equation and many indicator variables involved in the measurement model.</p><p>In this paper, a Quasi-ML estimation method for structural equation models with quadratic forms is proposed. It has been developed for the efficient estimation of more complex nonlinear structural equation models, which cannot be analyzed with the LMS method because of the computational burden involved by a more complex nonlinear model structure. The development of an ML estimation procedure for a nonlinear structural equation model is confronted with the fact that the distribution of a polynomial of normal variates is nonnormal in general, which entails a nonnormal multivariate distribution for the indicator variables. For the Quasi-ML method proposed in this paper, an appropriate transformation is carried out which reduces the number of nonnormally distributed components of the original indicator vector to one nonnormally distributed component of the transformed indicator vector. After this transformation, the model is treated as a variance function model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carroll, Ruppert &amp; Stefanski 1995)</ref>, and mean and variance functions for the nonlinear model are calculated. A quasilikelihood estimation principle is applied and the nonnormal density function of the indicator vector is approximated by a product of an unconditionally normal and a conditionally normal density function. A Quasi-ML estimator is established by maximizing the loglikelihood function based on the approximating density function. Simulation studies show that the Quasi-ML estimates are very close to the Maximum Likelihood estimates given by the LMS method, and the Quasi-ML estimators are almost as efficient as the ML estimators. Also, the Quasi-ML estimator is substantially more efficient than the 2SMM estimator.</p><p>The contents of this paper are as follows. In section 2 (Structural Equation Models with Quadratic Forms), we introduce a general structural equation model with a quadratic form of latent variables. In section 3 (Quasi-ML Estimation Procedure), the transformation of the indicator vector, the calculation of mean and variance functions, and the Quasi-ML estimation procedure is developed. In section 4 (Simulation Studies), the finite sample properties of the Quasi-ML estimators with respect to bias and efficiency are examined, and the Quasi-ML model difference test is evaluated. In section 5 (Empirical Example), the applicability of the proposed Quasi-ML method to the analysis of empirical data sets is illustrated by an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS WITH QUADRATIC FORMS</head><p>In this section, a structural equation model with a general quadratic form of latent independent variables (predictor variables) is introduced. The elementary interaction model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kenny and Judd (1984)</ref> with one latent interaction effect and the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Klein and Moosbrugger (2000)</ref> with multiple interaction effects but no quadratic effects are special cases of the model specified here. The model we propose here covers structural equations with a polynomial of degree two of predictor variables, and it is a special case of the general polynomial structural equation model described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wall and Amemiya (2000)</ref>. We propose the following structural equation model with a quadratic form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">η t = α + Γ ξ t + ξ t ´ Ω ξ t + ζ t , t = 1,...,N,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where η t is a latent dependent variable (criterion variable), α is an intercept term, ξ t is a (n × 1) </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">vector of latent predictor variables, Γ is a (1 × n) coefficient matrix, Ω is a symmetric (n × n) coefficient matrix,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">x t = t t δ + ξ x Λ , t = 1,...,N,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">y t = t t ε + η y Λ , t = 1,...,N,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where x t is a (q × 1) vector of observed indicators of ξ t , Λ x is a (q × n) factor loading matrix, and δ t is a (q × 1) vector of measurement errors. Similarly, y t is a (p × 1) vector of observed indicators of η t , Λ y is a (p × 1) factor loading matrix, and ε t is a (p × 1) vector of measurement errors. The error vectors δ t and ε t are assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Ε(δ t ) = 0, Ε(ε t ) = 0, a diagonal covariance matrix Cov(δ t , δ t ´) = Θ δ , a diagonal covariance matrix Cov(ε t , ε t ´) = Θ ε , Cov(δ t , ξ t ´) = 0, Cov(δ t , ε t ´) = 0, and Cov(ε t , ξ t ´) = 0, Cov(ζ t , δ t ´) = 0,<label>and</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">Cov(ζ t , ε t ´) = 0.</formula><p>It is further assumed that the identifiability of the measurement model for the xvariables is guaranteed by certain restrictions on the parameters of the measurement model. For the identification of the measurement model for the y-variables, it is assumed that y 1t is a scaling indicator with loading λ y11 = 1. It is further assumed without loss of generality that the yvariables have zero mean, which implies that α = -tr(ΩΦ). This restriction does not limit the applicability of the model in practice. The nonlinear structural equation implies that the vector y t is nonnormally distributed in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jöreskog &amp; Yang 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Klein &amp; Moosbrugger 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">QUASI-ML ESTIMATION PROCEDURE</head><p>The major characteristic of a nonlinear structural equation model lies in the fact that the latent dependent variable η t given by the structural equation (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) is nonnormally distributed in general, which also implies that the vector y t of indicator variables is nonnormally distributed.</p><p>The distribution type of η t has been investigated for special cases in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gurland 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Imhof 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Shah 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Press 1966</ref>), but, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Johnson and Kotz (1970)</ref> point out, these representations of the nonnormal density function are neither theoretically nor practically useful because of their complicated structure. The characteristic function of η t or y t can be expressed in closed form <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Srivasta &amp; Khatri 1979</ref>), but it is not possible to derive the density function from the characteristic function by integrating out the transform variable, because the integral cannot be solved in an analytically closed form.</p><p>The Quasi-ML estimation procedure developed in this section is based on an approximation of the nonnormal density function f(x, y) of the indicator vector (x t ´, y t ´)´ by a nonnormal density f*(x, y), which is a product of a normal and a conditionally normal density. This approximation makes use of the concept of variance function models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carroll et al. 1995)</ref>, where the mean and variance function of a dependent variable conditional on the independent variables is specified.</p><p>The maximization of the quasi-loglikelihood function derived from the approximating density f*(x, y) yields the Quasi-ML parameter estimates.</p><p>The organization of the remainder of this section is as follows. In In the Quasi-ML method proposed in this paper, the model parameters of the nonlinear structural equation model are simultaneously estimated by maximization of an approximating quasiloglikelihood function. For the estimation of the model parameters, we apply the concept of quasi-likelihood estimation in variance function models <ref type="bibr">(Carroll et al. 1995, pp. 269-272)</ref>. This is based on the idea that the conditional distribution of (y 1 | x = x, u = u) is approximated by a normal distribution.

In the first Monte-Carlo study, the new method is compared to three alternative techniques, the LMS method <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Klein 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Klein &amp; Moosbrugger 2000)</ref>, the LISREL-ML method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jöreskog &amp; Yang 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Yang Jonsson 1997)</ref>, and the 2SMM approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wall &amp; Amemiya 2000)</ref>. In the second Monte-Carlo study, a model with four latent nonlinear effects demonstrates the general applicability of the new Quasi-ML method to complex nonlinear latent variable models.

In particular, the interaction parameter ω 12 is estimated less efficient by LISREL-ML and 2SMM:</p><p>For LISREL-ML, the MC-SD of 12 ω ˆ is 71.3 % larger than for LMS, and for 2SMM the MC-SD of 12 ω ˆ is 47.9 % larger than for LMS. For 12 ω ˆ, the results in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> imply that the relative efficiency of 2SMM compared to Quasi-ML is 60 % and the relative efficiency of 2SMM is 46 % compared to LMS.</p><p>In the Monte-Carlo study, the estimation of standard errors was also investigated for the Quasi-ML method by calculating the 95 % coverage. The coverage of the true model parameter by the estimated 95 % confidence interval was 91.8 % for γ 1 , 94.2 % for γ 2 , and 94.4 % for ω 12 . For evaluating the deviation of the coverage for γ 1 from the nominal 95 % it must be noted that the predictor ξ 1 is measured with a very low reliability only. Overall, the results indicate that the estimated Quasi-ML standard errors can be used for the construction of confidence intervals for the parameter estimates.</p><p>In the scope of the Monte-Carlo study carried out for the elementary model, the results lead to the conclusion that, given that the normality assumption for the x-variables is met, the Quasi-ML estimators are very close to the LMS estimators, and the Quasi-ML method can be expected to be almost as efficient as LMS. The results further indicate that LISREL-ML and 2SMM cannot be expected to be optimally efficient methods for the estimation of latent interaction effects in situations where the x-variables have only low reliability. Other Monte-Carlo studies carried out by the authors but not reported here show that the differences in efficiency between Quasi-ML, LMS, and 2SMM become smaller when the reliability of the x-variables is higher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Monte-Carlo Study of Multiple Interaction Model</head><p>For a Monte-Carlo study of an interaction model with multiple nonlinear effects, the following structural equation model was selected:</p><p>( ) This model has four latent predictor variables ξ 1t , ξ 2t , ξ 3t , ξ 4t and one latent criterion variable η t .</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">              ξ ξ ξ ξ γ γ γ γ + α = η t t t t t 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 (8) ( ) t t t t t t t t t ζ +               ξ ξ ξ ξ               ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ξ ξ ξ ξ +</formula><p>It includes four latent nonlinear effects among the predictor variables. The following parameter values were selected for the structural parameters: α = -0.18, γ 1 = 0.40, γ 2 = 0, γ 3 = 0.20, γ 4 = 0.50, ω 12 = 0.10, ω 13 = 0.30, ω 23 = -0.40, ω 44 = 0.30, ψ = 0.30. The structural coefficients ω 12 , ω 13 , ω 23 , ω 44 were selected to have opposite signs, and it is of particular interest in this study how precisely the Quasi-ML method estimates and separates multiple nonlinear effects of opposite signs. The five latent variables were measured by two indicator variables each. Variable ξ 1t was measured with reliabilities .77 and .55, ξ 2t with reliabilities .77 and .62, ξ 3t with reliabilities .77 and .68, ξ 4t with reliabilities .77 and .73, and η t was measured with reliabilities .86 and .79. The entries of the covariance matrix Φ of the four predictor variables are given by φ 11 = 1.00, φ 21 = 0.50, φ 22 = 1.00, φ 31 = 0.50, φ 32 = 0.80, φ 33 = 1.00, φ 41 = 0, φ 42 = 0, φ 43 = 0.20, φ 44 = 1.00.</p><p>The specified model has 35 parameters and 10 indicator variables. 500 replications of data sets with sample size N = 500 were generated, and each of the 500 data sets was analyzed with the Quasi-ML approach. The sample size of N = 500 gives a ratio of only 14.3 observations per parameter for the selected model which can be regarded as a critically low ratio for a latent variable model with four simultaneous nonlinear effects. The estimation results for the structural parameters are given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>Estimation results of a Monte-Carlo study for a complex interaction model (Equation <ref type="formula">17</ref>). The columns give for the structural coefficients: the true value, the mean (M) of parameter estimates, the standard deviation (MC-SD) of parameter estimates, and the mean of the estimated standard errors (Est-SE) over 500 replications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>N = 500</head><p>Quasi-ML Method In the Monte-Carlo study, the distributions of the estimators of the structural coefficients showed no substantial deviation from normality. For the structural parameters of Γ and Ω in particular, the skewness of the estimates ranged from -0.25 to 0.25, and the kurtosis ranged from -0.02 to 0.30. Also, the means (M) of the estimates in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> show no substantial bias for the structural parameters.</p><p>For every data set, the Quasi-ML method also estimates the standard errors for the parameter estimates. The means of these estimated standard errors (Est-SE) were computed and compared to the standard deviation of the estimates (MC-DC). The results show no sign of substantial bias for the estimated standard errors, except a small underestimation for ω 12 <ref type="bibr">(-11.3%)</ref>. But it should be noted that ω 12 is the coefficient of the latent product term ω 12 ξ 1 ξ 2 which models a very small interaction effect with Var(ω 12 ξ 1 ξ 2 )/Var(η t ) = 0.01. Additionally, the 95 % coverage was calculated (see Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The reported values for the 95 % coverage are very close to the nominal value of 95 %. Thus, the results of Table <ref type="table">2</ref> support the Quasi-ML method and confirm that multiple latent linear, interactive, and quadratic effects, unless they are of a very small size, can be individually detected and estimated with the Quasi-ML method for the nonlinear structural equation model (Equation <ref type="formula">17</ref>) and the sample size N = 500 examined in this study.</p><p>Besides the estimation of standard errors, the Quasi-ML method has the capability to execute model difference tests, which allow for a simultaneous testing of latent effects. To evaluate the performance of the Quasi-ML model difference test, the combined statistical hypothesis that at least one of two parameters ω 12 and ω 13 is different from zero was examined. The performance of the Quasi-ML method was investigated for the combined hypothesis in an additional simulation study. In this study, the simulated model was specified as above, but with ω 12 and ω 13 set to zero. 500 data sets of sample size N = 500 were generated and analyzed with the Quasi-ML method. In the results of the Monte-Carlo study, the test statistic was significant in 3.8 % of the cases when computed for a nominal significance level of 5%. This result indicates that for the model complexity and sample size selected for this study, there is no inflation of Type I error of the model difference test, and the Quasi-ML method allows for a reliable testing of simultaneous latent interaction effects. Also, when the performance of the model difference is compared to the estimation of standard errors, the Monte-Carlo study suggests that in a fairly complex model as selected here, the model difference test seems to provide an evenly reliable instrument for statistical inference on structural coefficients than the standard errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE</head><p>This section covers an empirical example of an aging study in psychology for an interaction model with two latent product terms and seven indicator variables. The empirical data set was collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Thiele (1998)</ref> who investigated age-related effects of coping strategies and the maintaining of well-being for middle-aged males. Specifically, Thiele examined the effect of subjectively perceived fitness (ξ 1t ), objective fitness (ξ 2t ), and flexibility in goal adjustment (ξ 3t ) on the level of complaining about one's mental or physical situation (η t ). He formulated the interaction hypotheses that the linear effect of flexibility in goal adjustment on the complaint level is high when individuals have low values on the fitness scales, but that it is neutralized for individuals with high values on the fitness scales. For persons with a high level of subjective fitness, the flexibility of goal adjustment is supposed to have only a small or negligible effect on complaint level, whereas for persons with a low perceived availability of bodily resources, the flexibility of goal adjustment is expected to be an important factor for the level of complaining.</p><p>The interaction hypotheses can be modeled by including appropriate product terms (ξ 1t ξ 3t and </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ξ 2t ξ 3t )</formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">ζ +           ξ ξ ξ           ω ω ω ω ξ ξ ξ +           ξ ξ ξ γ γ γ + α = η 3 2 1 23 13 23 13 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 . (9)</formula><p>The subjectively perceived fitness (ξ 1t ) refers to the self-evaluation of the effectiveness with which one's body is functioning. It was measured by a split scale (x 1 , x 2 ) of self-concept of bodily efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Deusinger 1998)</ref>. The objective fitness (ξ 2t ) refers to the objective level of fitness. It was measured by lung volume (x 3 ). Flexibility in goal adjustment (ξ 3t ) addresses the fact that individuals are more or less willing to adapt their goals to the limits given by their individual physical situation or health condition, which refers to the coping style of a person. The latent predictor variable ξ 3t was measured by splitting a flexibility scale from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brandstädter and Renner (1990)</ref> into two subscales (x 4 , x 5 ). The complaint level (η t ) was measured by two indicators (y 1 : psychological complaints, y 2 : psychovegetative complaints) given by the complaint inventory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Degenhardt and Schmidt (1994)</ref>. A data set of sample size N = 302 was examined for the seven indicator variables. The univariate skewness of the five x-variables was between -0.33 and 0.01, their univariate kurtosis was between -0.07 and 0.30. The indicator variables y 1 and y 2 were nonnormal with univariate skewness of 1.09 and 0.72, respectively; their univariate kurtosis was 0.89 and 0.43, respectively.</p><p>The data were z-standardized and analyzed with the Quasi-ML method. The parameter estimates for the measurement model gave the following reliabilities for the observed variables: .92 for x 1 , .59 for x 2 , 1.00 for x 3 , .99 for x 4 , .36 for x 5 , .67 for y 1 , and .74 for y 2 . The estimated correlations between the three ξ-variables were between -0.08 and 0.25. Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</p><p>Parameter estimates, estimated standard errors, and standardized parameter estimates for the structural equation parameters provided by the Quasi-ML method.</p><p>The negative signs of γ 1 , γ 2 , and γ 3 indicate the expected negative relationship between the latent variables ξ 1t , ξ 2t , ξ 3t , and η t : High values for subjective or objective fitness and high values for flexibility in goal adjustment predict a low complaint level. The standard errors given in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> show that the parameters γ 1 , γ 2 , and γ 3 are significantly different from zero at the 5% Type I error level. The positive signs of ω 13 and ω 23 indicate the expected direction of the interaction between fitness and flexibility in goal adjustment: Conditional on high levels of subjective (ξ 1t ) or objective fitness (ξ 2t ), the effect of flexibility in goal adjustment (ξ 3t ) on complaint level (η t ) is low, that is, individual differences in complaint level cannot be predicted from individual differences in flexibility. Analogously, for low levels of subjective or objective fitness the A model difference test based on the likelihood-ratio test statistic confirms that the model with ω 13 as a free parameter and ω 23 fixed to zero fits the model significantly better than a linear model with both ω 13 and ω 23 fixed to zero. The chi-square value of this model difference test was χ 2 diff,df=1 = 9.58 with p-value less than 0.01. Setting further both ω 13 and ω 23 to be free parameters and comparing this model to the model where ω 13 is free and ω 23 is fixed to zero gives a chi-square value of χ 2 diff,df=1 = 0.56 for the likelihood-ratio test statistic, which is not significant at the 5% Type I error level.</p><p>The significant latent interaction effect between ξ 1t and ξ 3t can also be displayed graphically. For this purpose, factor scores for the ξ-variables were calculated by using the Quasi-ML parameter estimates for the measurement model of ξ t . A median-split of the ξ 1t factor scores was carried out, and the sample was split into one half with low ξ 1t factor scores and one half with high ξ 1t factor scores. For each of the two subsamples, the scores of y 2 were plotted against the factor scores of ξ 3t (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The variable y 2 was selected for the scatterplots because it has a higher reliability than variable y 1 . Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows that the subjectively perceived fitness (ξ 1t )</p><p>clearly moderates the relationship between flexibility in goal adjustment (ξ 3t ) and complaint level (η t ): For the subsample with low factor scores for subjective fitness (left graph), the correlation is substantial (corr(ξ 3 , y 2 ) = -0.34), whereas for the subsample with high factor scores for subjective fitness (right graph) the correlation is small (corr(ξ 3 , y 2 ) = -0.10).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Scatterplots for the factor scores of flexibility in goal adjustment (ξ 3t ) and the observed scores for complaint level (y 2 ), displayed for individuals with low factor scores for subjective fitness (left graph) and high scores for subjective fitness (right graph). A regression line has been added to both scatterplots. The analysis of the data set reveals that in the selected model subjectively perceived fitness both has a larger linear and interactive effect than objective fitness. Taking the high efficiency and the modeling capabilities of the Quasi-ML method into account, the new estimation method provides a reliable device for the analysis of structural equation models with multiple latent interaction effects.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>subsection 3.1 (Transformation of Indicator Vector), a transformation of the nonnormally distributed indicator vector (x t ´, y t ´)´ is carried out such that only one component of the transformed indicator vector is nonnormally distributed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SUMMARY</head><p>The Quasi-ML method proposed in this paper has been developed for an efficient and computationally feasible estimation of multiple nonlinear effects in structural equation models with quadratic forms. In the Quasi-ML approach, the nonnormal density function of the joint indicator vector is approximated by a product of a normal density and a conditionally normal density. It applies the concept of variance function models, and simulation studies for an elementary interaction model indicate that the Quasi-ML estimators are almost as efficient as ML estimators. Also, the simulation results suggest that the Quasi-ML method can be more efficient than the LISREL-ML method and the 2SMM method, particularly when a latent interaction model with low reliable indicator variables is analyzed. A second simulation study indicated that the Quasi-ML method is computationally feasible for a model with four simultaneous nonlinear effects and estimates interaction and quadratic effects very efficiently. Just as important, the Quasi-ML estimation of standard errors showed no substantial bias which supports precise significance testing of multiple nonlinear effects. Furthermore, the Quasi-ML method provides a test statistic for testing the significance of simultaneous effects in nested models. The applicability of Quasi-ML was demonstrated by an empirical example. Quasi-ML seems to be a very efficient, computationally feasible, and practically adequate approach, which is of particular relevance when rather complex structural equation models with several nonlinear effects are to be analyzed.</p></div>			</div>
