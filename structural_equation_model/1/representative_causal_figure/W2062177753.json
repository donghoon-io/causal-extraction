  "rationale": "Figure 2 explicitly refers to a \"Fitted nonspatial SEM model,\" which directly aligns with the paper's focus on structural equation modeling for theoretical causal relationships. The mention of \"Standardized path coefficients\" further indicates the depiction of directional causal influences between variables, a core characteristic of a causal model. While Figure 1 mentions SEM analysis, it describes a flowchart of the process rather than a model itself."
