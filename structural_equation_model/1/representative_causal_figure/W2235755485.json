  "rationale": "The abstract explicitly states that the paper tests three socio-cognitive models and analyzes the relationships among their postulated constructs using structural equation modeling. Figures 1, 2, and 3 all describe 'models predicting condom use' and indicate 'significant paths,' which strongly implies a visual representation of causal relationships and pathways between variables, characteristic of a causal model or DAG. Figure 1 is chosen as the first instance of such a description."
