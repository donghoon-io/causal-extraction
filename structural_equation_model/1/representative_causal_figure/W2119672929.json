  "rationale": "Figure 1 explicitly mentions a \"Structural equation model (SEM)\" and describes a \"factor model representing a single factor of verbal IQ, which was observed on four subscales.\" This implies a network of relationships where latent variables influence observed variables, aligning with the characteristics of a causal model. The other figures primarily describe decision trees or growth curve models without explicitly detailing causal pathways or mechanisms in the same way."
