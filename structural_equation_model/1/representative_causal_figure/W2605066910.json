  "rationale": "Neither caption explicitly uses terms like 'causal model,' 'DAG,' 'mediator,' or 'confounder.' While both describe 'regressions' and 'paths' between latent and manifest processes, implying directional relationships, they primarily focus on the technical aspects of continuous time structural equation modeling rather than theorizing a specific causal phenomenon. Therefore, neither figure strongly qualifies as a causal model in the context of scholarly theorizing."
