  "rationale": "Figure 2 explicitly refers to a \"Population model of the Monte Carlo experiment,\" which strongly implies a causal structure used to generate data for the experiment. This aligns with the concept of a causal model as it represents the underlying relationships being simulated and tested. In contrast, Figure 1 describes a \"Framework for determining quadratic effects in PLS path models,\" which is more methodological than a direct representation of a causal model."
