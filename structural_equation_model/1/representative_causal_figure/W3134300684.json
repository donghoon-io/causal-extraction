  "rationale": "Figure 2, titled \"Proposed research framework,\" is the most likely to represent a causal model. Research frameworks in scholarly papers typically illustrate the hypothesized relationships and pathways between variables, which aligns with the characteristics of a causal model. The other figures describe interaction effects or a deep ANN model, which are less indicative of a theoretical causal structure for the central research question."
