  "rationale": "Figure 2 is described as a \"Patient Satisfaction Model\" and Figure 1 as a \"Baseline Model of Retention in HIV Care, Adherence to HAART and HIV Suppression.\" Both captions imply a visual representation of relationships between variables, which is characteristic of a causal model. The abstract explicitly states the objective is to \"test, through structural equation modeling (SEM), a model of HIV suppression in which patient satisfaction influences HIV suppression indirectly through retention in HIV care and adherence to HAART.\" This directly aligns with the description of Figure 1, making it the most likely representation of the central causal model being theorized and tested in the paper."
