  "rationale": "None of the provided captions explicitly mention terms like 'causal model,' 'DAG,' 'mediator,' or 'confounder.' The captions describe specific scenarios within a proof or graph structures without indicating a causal modeling purpose. Therefore, no figure strongly qualifies as a causal model for theorizing a central research question."
