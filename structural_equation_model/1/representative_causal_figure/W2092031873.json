  "rationale": "Neither caption explicitly mentions causal relationships, directed acyclic graphs, or causal components like mediators or confounders. Both figures describe types of meta-analysis models, which are statistical models rather than explicit causal models for theorizing a phenomenon of interest. Therefore, no figure strongly qualifies as a causal model based on the provided criteria."
