Figure 1 refers to Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) representations, which are statistical modeling techniques for factor structures, not explicitly causal relationships or DAGs. There are no terms like 'causal model,' 'DAG,' 'mediator,' or 'pathways' to suggest a causal diagram."
