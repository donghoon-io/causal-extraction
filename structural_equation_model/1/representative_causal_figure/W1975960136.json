  "selected_index": 1,
  "rationale": "Figures 1 and 2 explicitly mention 'Path diagram results,' which strongly implies a visual representation of causal pathways and relationships, a core characteristic of causal models. While Figure 3 describes a 'conceptual process,' it lacks the explicit terminology of 'path diagram' or 'causal model' that Figures 1 and 2 provide. Given that both Figures 1 and 2 are equally strong, I will choose Figure 1."
