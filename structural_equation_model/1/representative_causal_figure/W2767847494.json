  "rationale": "None of the provided captions explicitly describe a causal model. Figure 1 refers to \"estimated models\" and uses terms like \"factor loadings\" and \"correlations,\" which are characteristic of structural equation modeling, but it does not explicitly state or imply a causal structure with directed acyclic paths or specific causal elements like mediators or confounders. Therefore, no figure strongly qualifies as a causal model based on the given criteria."
