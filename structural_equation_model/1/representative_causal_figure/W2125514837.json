  "rationale": "Neither caption explicitly mentions causal relationships, directed acyclic graphs, or terms like 'mediator' or 'confounder.' Both figures describe 'hierarchical models' and 'higher order models' which are typically structural models but not necessarily causal models in the sense of theorizing specific cause-and-effect pathways for a phenomenon of interest. Therefore, no figure strongly qualifies as a causal model based on the provided rules."
