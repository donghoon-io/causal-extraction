  "rationale": "None of the provided captions explicitly suggest a causal model. The abstract mentions 'relationships amongst unobserved constructs (i.e. independent, mediator, moderator, control and dependent variables)' which are components of causal models, but no figure caption directly refers to a visual representation of these relationships or a DAG. The figures seem to be about classifications, flowcharts, and challenges rather than theoretical causal structures."
