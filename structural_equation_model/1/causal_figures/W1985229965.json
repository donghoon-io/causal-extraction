Estimation requires that one of the indicator loadings of a construct be constrained to 1.0. No direct test of statistical significance is possible for this reference item. Statistical significance is determined by estimating an identical second model, with the indicator constraint of 1.0 moved to a different indicator. Thus, all standardized coefficients can be tested for significance, even though one item must always be constrained in any single estimation. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054729.g002",
