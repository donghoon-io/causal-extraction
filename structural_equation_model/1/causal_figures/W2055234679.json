        "caption": "Figure 1. Block diagram of the sparsity-aware maximum likelihood (SML) algorithm. The first and third blocks perform cross-validation to select optimal parameters r and l to be used in (3) and (4), respectively. The second block produces weights fwijg and error-variance estimate s\u03022 after solving (4). Finally, the fourth block takes data X and Y together with l, fwijg and s\u03022 and solves (3) to yield B\u0302, which represents the SML estimator for B in (1) revealing the genetic-interaction network. A more detailed description of the SML algorithm is given in Algorithm 1 in the Methods section. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003068.g001",
