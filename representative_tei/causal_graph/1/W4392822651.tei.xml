<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Wildfire forecasting is notoriously hard due to the complex interplay of different factors such as weather conditions, vegetation types and human activities. Deep learning models show promise in dealing with this complexity by learning directly from data. However, to inform critical decision making, we argue that we need models that are right for the right reasons; that is, the implicit rules learned should be grounded by the underlying processes driving wildfires. In that direction, we propose integrating causality with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that explicitly model the causal mechanism among complex variables via graph learning. The causal adjacency matrix considers the synergistic effect among variables and removes the spurious links from highly correlated impacts. Our methodology's effectiveness is demonstrated through superior performance forecasting wildfire patterns in the European boreal and mediterranean biome. The gain is especially prominent in a highly imbalanced dataset, showcasing an enhanced robustness of the model to adapt to regime shifts in functional relationships. Furthermore, SHAP values from our trained model further enhance our understanding of the model's inner workings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Wildfires present considerable risks to human safety and economic stability in affected regions and wildlife habitats. The risk is inflated by climate change, which aggravates wildfires, particularly in the vulnerable european ecosystems that this study targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Batllori et al., 2013)</ref>. Accurately predicting the highly favorable conditions for a wildfire is vital for effective disaster prevention and preparedness. Earth observation data is pivotal in fire danger assessment and forecasting, offering extensive meteorological and vegetation condition information closely related to wildfire occurrences <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pettinari &amp; Chuvieco, 2020)</ref>. The copious amount of data available lends itself well to sophisticated deep learning (DL) approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Camps-Valls et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Reichstein et al., 2019)</ref> for predicting wildfire danger <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Prapas et al., 2021)</ref>. Recent advancements have been made by taking multiple factors as model inputs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li et al. (2023)</ref> underscore the importance of delayed interactions between wildfires and climate patterns in the forecasting scenarios. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kondylatos et al. (2022)</ref> identified the most critical predictors of the next day's wildfire danger using explainable AI (xAI) methods. TeleVit <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Prapas et al., 2023)</ref> incorporates different local, global variables with teleconnection indices within a transformer-based architecture. However, these approaches do not explicitly model the information flow within the model. Consequently, the mechanism of how the variables interact and assist the final prediction is not considered during the model design and training procedure.</p><p>The application of causal inference in Remote Sensing enhances our understanding of processes in the Earth system and facilitates effective interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Runge et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Camps-Valls et al., 2023)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Pérez-Suay &amp; Camps-Valls (2018)</ref> propose an asymmetry-based approach that uses sensitivity criterion to address the causal direction between geoscientific variables. State-space method CCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tsonis et al., 2018)</ref> finds its applications in Ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sugihara et al., 2012)</ref>, land-atmosphere interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Díaz et al., 2022)</ref>, and identifying influencing factors in urban soil pollutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gao et al., 2023)</ref>. Integrating causal inference with DL architectures remains challenging Intricate causal relationship modeling among variables can support robust and reliable DL <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Schölkopf et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Varando et al., 2021)</ref>. In this work, we incorporate a causality graph into the GNN architecture, thereby capturing the information flow through graph learning techniques.</p><p>Our experimental results reveal that the causality-infused graph is a robust indicator of pertinent information, enhancing prediction quality. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017)</ref> values derived from our model reveal the memory effect of teleconnections in driving the wildfire danger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>In the Earth system, Synergistic Effects <ref type="bibr">(Runge et al., 2019a)</ref> are the combined effects of drivers making an impact that is greater than the simple sum of its parts. For instance, devastating wildfires are often related to dryness conditions, combustible materials, and an ignition source, but their impacts are subjected to threshold behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Reichstein et al., 2013)</ref>. Causal methods allow us to identify regime shifts in functional relationships triggered by extreme conditions <ref type="bibr">(Runge et al., 2019a)</ref>. We consider leveraging the causal graph and the message passing of a temporal GNN to capture the wildfire dynamics.</p><p>Given an input of local scale variables X l ∈ R B×C l ×L l and Oceanic and Climatic Indices (OCIs) variables X oci ∈ R B×Coci×Loci , where B is the batch size, C is the number of variables, and L is the time lag to the current time step t, our task is to predict the wildfire danger Y ⊂ {0, 1} ∈ R B in the future time step t + h, where h is the forecasting horizon.</p><p>GNNs extend DL to data with a graph structure. The two key components of GNNs are the adjacency matrix and node features. Given that causality is usually represented with graphs <ref type="bibr">(Runge et al., 2019b)</ref>, we create this adjacency matrix A ∈ R (C l +Coci)×(C l +Coci) from a causal graph. The strength of the causal link quantifies weights of A. The causal graph is the graphic representation of the causal relationship among the variables. Our selection algorithm to compute the causal graph is the PCMCI method <ref type="bibr">(Runge et al., 2019b)</ref>. The nodes in the time series causal graph represent the variables X j t at different lag times, and Pa(X</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">j t ) ∈ X - t = X t-1 , X t-2 , ... denotes the causal parents of variable X j t . A causal link X i t-τ → X j t exits if X i t-τ ∈ Pa(X j t ).</formula><p>Multiple factors, such as a temporal trend, geographical shifts, and vegetation type, can introduce non-stationary dependencies that act as confounders. Thus, the data is preprocessed to ensure the causal stationarity.</p><p>The preprocessing is detailed in Appendix B.1. However, due to finite sample length and partially unfulfilled standard assumptions of causal discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Pearl, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Spirtes et al., 2001)</ref>, spurious links can still exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Krich et al., 2020)</ref>. To validate the findings with domain knowledge, we employ link assumptions (Appendix B.2) to orient parts of the edges.</p><p>Regarding the vertices in GNN, each node represents the temporal feature of the given variable, which is extracted by a single layer LSTM <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref>. The node feature is updated by message transmission among neighboring nodes whose connectivity is defined within the adjacency matrix. The node feature is refined via multiple convolution layers with layer norm and activation. The graph pooling at the last layer of GNN gathers the global information from the whole graph. The details of the model are in Appendix A. The architecture is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>The dataset used is the SeasFire Datacube <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Karasante et al., 2023)</ref>, a global dataset spanning 21 years, featuring an 8-day temporal and 0.25 deg spatial resolution, containing crucial information on seasonal wildfire drivers, targets, and masks. We select three local weather variables Temperature at 2 meters -Mean (T2m), Total precipitation (TP), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and three Oceanic Climate Indices (OCIs) known to influence the test area, including North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation Index (AO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Müller-Plath et al., 2022)</ref>, and Nino 3.4 Anomaly (Nino34 anom) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brönnimann, 2007)</ref>. The time lag is 10 months for OCIs and 39 × 8 days for local variables. The target variable is a binary map of the burned areas. Additionally, we narrow the spatial coverage to Europe and test two cases with biome types "Mediterranean" and "Boreal" according to the static features of GFED regions and biomes. The causal graph contains seven nodes with the target variable included. The A masks out edges and nodes related to the target variable to avoid label leakage. The NNs use 2003 to 2015 data for training, 2016 to 2017 for validation, and 2018 to 2019 for testing. We compare our proposed model to the following baselines: 1) Long short-term memory (LSTM) <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref>. 2) Gated recurrent units (GRUs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cho et al., 2014)</ref>. 3) GNN CORR uses the correlation coefficient (CC)-based adjacency matrix computed from temporal features of variables. 4) GNN FULL uses a fully connected graph as the adjacency matrix. The model's performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). We test models' forecasting performance eight days in advance in the Mediterranean, and 1, 2, 8 × eight days in Boreal to explore their long-term capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</head><p>The model performance at the forecasting horizon of 8 days in the Mediterranean is listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The baseline AUPRC achieved by a Random classifier equals the fraction of positives <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Saito &amp; Rehmsmeier, 2015)</ref> in the dataset, which is around 1.1%. The causal GNN shows competitive performance with common time-series classification methods and improved performance over a fully connected and CC-based graph. This highlights the importance of removing spurious links during GNN training, where the redundant edges can lead to over-smoothed node features and degraded prediction accuracy. The prediction map Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, essentially looks like a fire danger map as in similar studies which approach fire danger forecasting as a classification task. It matches well the target burned areas in a given 8-day period of summer 2019, which is part of the test set. performance at different prediction horizons in Boreal is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>. The proportion of positive samples in this area is 0.0737%, a much more challenging case for all DL models. Our model achieves the best AUPRC at the short horizon. However, with the increasing horizons, the performance of Causal-GNN deteriorates with the rest of the models. The model's limited long-term forecasting capacity may be attributed to its static causal graph. Incorporating time-series graphs to account for time lags could potentially mitigate this issue. Understanding the choice of Causal-GNN helps to refine the model and verify its physical consistency. Thus, we conduct SHAP analysis on positive test samples in the Mediterranean. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, we notice that high temperatures increase wildfire danger. In areas where the VPD is low (&lt;0.7), the drier conditions correlate with an increased likelihood of wildfire. This relationship inverts while at the high VPD (&gt;0.7) part. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> is the absolute SHAP value of OCIs at various lags averaged over samples. The increased value on large lags signifies the memory effects of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns in driving future wildfires. For example, El Niño intensifies the wildfire danger, especially six to ten months in advance.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>This work proposes a DL framework that integrates the causal structure into the GNN training. The causal structure reveals the intricate interplay among variables and the temporal GNN, which takes the temporal feature of variables as nodes and weighted causal graph as connectivity, promoting the information exchange between variables that simulate both regional and larger-scale earth system dynamics. The evaluation of two cases with different vulnerable forest types shows promising results, especially when the dataset is highly imbalanced, indicating the robustness brought by causal knowledge. The gain over the CC-based method shows its efficacy in considering the synergistic effect and spurious link removal. xAI reveals the physically-consistent dependencies in the learned model. Our method paves the way to enhance process understanding and model trustworthiness.</p><p>Future efforts will focus on developing learnable causal graphs and examining the global variability. Additionally, we plan to explore regression of the burned area, with the goal to improve our understanding of different wildfire types and especially extreme events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A MODEL DETAILS AND HYPERPARAMETERS</head><p>The samples in the training and validation set are resampled so that the ratio of the number of negative samples (No fire) to positive samples (Fire) is 5 to 1. All learning rates are set as 1e-5 with a weight decay of 5e-6. Model weights are initialized using Xavier normalization. In the Causal-GNN, the temporal features of each input variable (channel-wise) are extracted by a single LSTM layer with the hidden state of dimension 256. The adjacency matrix is normalized to stabilize the graph learning. The temporal node feature is updated by a two-layer convolutional neural network with kernels K ∈ R 256×512×1×1 and R 512×256×1×1 , following LayerNorm and LeakyReLU. The Graph Pooling averages node features, leading to the final classification layer. This is a single linear layer with dimensions (256 and 2) for binary classification tasks. Confidence is determined by the softmax function of the positive prediction, and it is used to visualize the fire danger map in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>.</p><p>For the baselines, LSTM and GRUs project the input feature to a dimension of 256. We utilize an adjacency matrix A for the fully connected graph, wherein all elements are set to 1, indicating complete connectivity. The correlation coefficient-based graph employs PyTorch's corrcoef function to calculate the similarity among variables within the temporal feature space. All performance scores are reported as the mean of three runs with different seeds.</p></div>

We test two cases over the Europe area, which are located between 25 • N -75 • N, 13 • W -45 • E. We use the biomes 3.0 area and biomes 9.0 area of the gfed region 6.0 (EURO) to consider the fuel types of Europe's Mediterranean and Boreal biomes. Their geographical extension is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. </p></div>
