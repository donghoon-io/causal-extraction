<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Causal graph recovery is traditionally done using statistical estimation-based methods or based on individual's knowledge about variables of interests. They often suffer from data collection biases and limitations of individuals' knowledge. The advance of large language models (LLMs) provides opportunities to address these problems. We propose a novel method that leverages LLMs to deduce causal relationships in general causal graph recovery tasks. This method leverages knowledge compressed in LLMs and knowledge LLMs extracted from scientific publication database as well as experiment data about factors of interest to achieve this goal. Our method gives a prompting strategy to extract associational relationships among those factors and a mechanism to perform causality verification for these associations. Comparing to other LLM-based methods that directly instruct LLMs to do the highly complex causal reasoning, our method shows clear advantage on causal graph quality on benchmark datasets. More importantly, as causality among some factors may change as new research results emerge, our method show sensitivity to new evidence in the literature and can provide useful information for updating causal graphs accordingly.</p></div>

It enables reliable decision-making from complex data with entangled associations.</p><p>While it is usually expensive and infeasible to investigate causal effects by the golden standard-randomized experiments-researchers employ causal inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pearl, 2010)</ref> to estimate causal effects from observational data. There are two main frameworks for causal inference: the potential outcome framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rubin, 1974)</ref> and the structural causal model (SCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pearl, 1995)</ref>. Priori causal structures, usually represented as Directed Graphical Causal Models (DGCMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pearl, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Spirtes et al., 2001)</ref>, are often used to represent and analyze the causal relationships. These causal graphs help disentangle the complex interdependencies and facilitate the analysis of causal effects. Recovering causal graphs often relies on experts' knowledge or statistical estimation on experimental data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Spirtes and Glymour, 1991)</ref>. Causal Discovery (CD) algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Spirtes and Glymour, 1991)</ref> are the main statistical estimation-based methods that use conditional independence tests to assess associational relationships (called associational reasoning) for inferring causal connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Spirtes et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chickering, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Shimizu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sanchez-Romero et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, the reliability of these algorithms is affected by the quality of data, which can be compromised by issues such as measurement error <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>, selection bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bareinboim et al., 2014)</ref> and unmeasured confounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bhattacharya et al., 2021)</ref> (See Example A.1 in Appendix A.1). Additionally, CD algorithms often assume certain distribution, such as Gaussian about data, which may fail to accurately reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios.</p><p>To mitigate the limitations, Large Language Models (LLMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zhao et al., 2023)</ref> have recently been employed for causal graph recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhou et al., 2023)</ref>. There are two main streams of these work: 1) directly outputting causal graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Choi et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Long et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kıcıman et al., 2023)</ref>; 2) assisting in refining causal graphs generated by statistical estimation-based methods <ref type="bibr">Vashishtha et al. (2023)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ban et al. (2023)</ref>. Most work have a straightforward way of using LLMs. They directly query the causal relationship between each pair of variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Choi et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Long et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kıcıman et al., 2023)</ref> by prompting LLMs with the definition of causality, task details and description of the variables of interest. They require LLMs to have extensive domain knowledge and capabilities to perform complex causal reasoning. Whether LLMs have sufficient knowledge in specific domains or whether they have causal reasoning capabilities are questionable <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kandpal et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Zečević et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>An alternative approach is to exploit LLMs' capabilities on associational reasoning, e.g., querying the conditional independences (CIs) and recover causal graphs based on extracted associations using CD algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cohrs et al., 2023)</ref>. However, it remains difficult for LLMs to understand the CIs between variables, especially the independence conditioned on a large set of variables. <ref type="bibr">(Jiralerspong et al., 2024)</ref> tries to inject statistical CI results into LLMs to improve direct causal relationship query results, but the efficacy varies among datasets.</p><p>We propose the LLM Assisted Causal Recovery (LACR) method to address these challenges. LACR enhances the knowledge base of LLMs with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lewis et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borgeaud et al., 2022)</ref> for reliable associational reasoning. We retrieve highly related knowledge base from a large scientific corpus that contains valuable insight hidden in datasets about associational/causal relationships among variables. We further enhance the accuracy of LCAR's causal recovery results by aggregating the collective extracted information from related literature according the Wisdom of the Crowd principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grofman et al., 1983)</ref>. LACR also uses an associaitonal reasoning-based causal recovery prompt strategy which elaborately instructs the LLMs the mathematical intuitions behind conditional independence, and builds a surjection from conditional independences extracted by LLMs to causal relationships between variables. LACR is data-driven and dos not rely on task-specific knowledge for document retrieval or prompt design. It can serve as a causal graph recovery tool for generic tasks.</p><p>Our methodology provides a structured and systematic approach to inferring causal relationships, as it is grounded in a broader evidentiary base and subject to systematic validation. As LACR conducts associational reasoning on a reliable knowledge base, most of which provide evidences based on experimental data analysis, LACR largely overcomes the collection bias problem in statistical estimation-based CD algorithms. We discuss this in detail in Section 4 by pointing out the causal conflict between the well-known causal discovery results and recent research results extracted by LACR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our Contributions:</head><p>• We introduce a novel RAG-based causal graph recovery method that achieves better associational reasoning. The method shows its potential in accurate causal graph construction and overcoming data collection bias issues in traditional methods.</p><p>• We design an associational reasoning-based prompting strategy that reduce LLMs' task complexity to simple associational reasoning to improve the reliability of LLMs' results. The reliability gain further improve the quality of recovered causasl graphs.</p><p>• We conduct experiments in several well-known real-world causal graphs and demonstrate the efficacy of LACR. More importantly, based on the scientific evidence returned by our method, we show bias exists in the validation datasets widely used in the CD community, and suggest ways to improve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>In this section, we introduce the preliminaries of the directed graphical causal models (DGCM) and the causal graph recovery problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Directed Graphical Causal Models</head><p>A Directed Graphical Causal Model (DGCM) is a tuple M = ⟨G, P ⟩. In the model, G = ⟨V, E⟩ is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), also known as a causal graph, where the set of nodes</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = {v 1 , • • • , v n } represents random variables (with |V | = n), and E ⊆ {(v i , v j ) | v i , v j ∈ V, v i ̸ = v j } is a set of directed edges, also called causal edges, that encode causal relationships. Let Ḡ = ⟨V, Ē⟩ be the skeleton of DAG G, where each (v i , v j ) ∈ Ē</formula><p>is an undirected edge, and it indicates that one of</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(v i , v j ) and (v j , v i ) is in E. Let a sequence of distinct nodes ℓ = (v j 1 , v j 2 , • • • , v jm ) denote a path, such that for each i ∈ {1, 2, • • • , m -1}, (v j i , v j i+1 ) ∈ Ē. A path is a causal path from v j 1 to v jm if for each i ∈ {1, 2, • • • , m -1}, (v j i , v j i+1 ) ∈ E.</formula><p>The joint probability distribution of all variables is denoted by P . Note that we do not consider any variable other than those in V , that is, we assume there is no so-called latent or exogenous variable.</p><p>Constraints of causal graphs. A causal graph is subject to a series of constraints on variables' associational relationships. Especially, the causal edges specify the causal relationships between variables. Given</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(v i , v j ) ∈ E, v i is a direct cause of v j .</formula><p>That is, when holding the other variables constant, varying the value of v i triggers a corresponding change in the value of v j , but not vice versa. This causal relationship thus entails the associational relationship between the variables, i.e., their marginal probability distributions P (v i ) and P (v j ) are associated (or correlated), which does not have the direction attribute. Notice that two variables can be associated even though they do not have a direct causal relationship between each other. Typical examples are that two variables linked by a causal path, and two variables pointed to by two causal paths that have the same starting node (which is usually called a covariate). The precise constraints follow an assumption of the causal graph called the Causal Markov Assumption. Assumption 2.1 (Causal Markov Assumption). In any causal graph, each variable is independent of its non-descendants conditioned on its parents in the causal graph.</p><p>Therefore, the structure of a causal graph implies graphical constraints called d-separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pearl, 2000)</ref> that specify a conditional associational relationship between variables. In the rest of this paper, for any given variable pair v i , v j ∈ V , we constantly use V ′ to denote an arbitrary subset of V \ {v i , v j }, unless otherwise specified. Definition 2.2 (d-separation). A variable set V ′ blocks a path ℓ if (i) ℓ contains at least one arrowemitting variable belonging to V ′ , or (ii) ℓ contains at least one collider (variable v i is a collider if</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(v j i-1 , v j i ), (v j i+1 , v j i ) ∈ E) that does not belong to V ′ and has no descendant belonging to V ′ . If V ′ blocks all paths from v i to v j , V ′ is said to d-separate v i and v j .</formula><p>If V ′ d-separates v i and v j , then the joint probability distribution P encodes that the two variables are independent conditioned on V ′ . Assumption 2.1 is a necessary condition for the encoding of the associaitonal relationship constraints in P . On the other hand, the following faithfulness assumption is a sufficient condition that P encodes such constraints. Assumption 2.3 (Causal Faithfulness Assumption). A joint distribution P does not encode additional conditional associational relationships other than those consistent with G's d-separation information. We call such P is faithful to G.</p><p>We now formally define the constraints that follow distribution P faithful to causal graph G. Let α(ij | V ′ ) ∈ {0, 1} be the conditional associational relationship between variables v i , v j ∈ V conditioned on variable set V ′ . α(ij | V ′ ) = 0 denotes that v i and v j are independent conditioned on V ′ according to P , and α(ij</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">| V ′ ) = 1 denotes associated. We write α(ij) when V ′ = ∅.</formula><p>Then, by Assumptions 2.1 and 2.3 and Definition 2.2, we have that for</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v i , v j ∈ V : 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>We now start to introduce our LLM-based method, called large language model assisted causal recovery (LACR), that uses a prompt strategy elaborately designed following the process of a statistical estimation-based CD method, called the constraintbased causal graph construction (CCGC). We first show how CCGC works.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Constraint-based Causal Graph</head><p>Construction: From Data to Causation</p><p>Based on Assumptions 2.1 and 2.3, we are able to partially construct the causal graph G from a knowledge base KB that is faithful to G by a statistical estimation-based method. In a nutshell, KB can be but not limited to data, the LLM's background knowledge, and external documents. For more details, see Section 3.2.1. We take data as the KB in CCGC. A KB is called faithful to G if it estimates a joint distribution that is faithful to G.</p><p>The process of CCGC can be divided into two phases: the edge existence verification phase, which first constructs the skeleton, and the orientation phase, which determines the direction of each undirected edge. LACR only uses the CCGC-based prompt strategy to conduct the edge existence verification, and therefore, we only introduce the first phase of CCGC.</p><p>For each pair of variables v i , v j ∈ V , we verify the existence of the undirected edge in between (i.e., whether (v i , v j ) ∈ Ē or not) by statistically testing whether v i and v j can be d-separated by any variable set</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V ′ . Let αKB (ij | V ′ ) ∈ {0, 1} be an estimator of α(ij | V ′ ), based on KB. Next, based on a given KB that is faithful to G, we define ζ KB : V × V → {0, 1} as the causal edge existence mapping, such that ζ KB (ij) = 0 if ∃V ′ s.t. αKB (ij | V ′ ) = 0, otherwise ζ KB (ij) = 1.</formula><p>ζ KB (ij) = 0 implies that we estimate there is no edge between v i and v j , since the pair of variables can be d-separated by at least one variable set. See Appendix A.1 for an example of CCGC's process.</p><p>Compared with LACR, most existing LLMbased causal graph construction methods directly query LLMs the causal relationships. With the introduction of CCGC, we next illustrate the limited reliability of such methods.</p><p>Limited Reliability of Direct Causal Prompt. We name the prompt used in such direct query of causal relationships as the direct causal prompt. Examples include "Is A a cause of B?" and "Does the change of A cause the change of B", which are wildly used in related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kıcıman et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Choi et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Long et al., 2022)</ref>. Such prompt directly queries the causal edge existence (ζ KB (•)) and the causal direction.We argue that such direct prompting requires extensive causal reasoning capability from LLMs. The following proposition shows the high complexity hidden behind a direct causal prompt.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Proposition 3.1. Assuming that estimating αKB (ij | V ′ ) for a given V ′ needs O(1) time, inferring ζ KB (ij) requires O(2 n-2 ), where n = |V |. Proof. To verify if ζ KB (ij) = 0, by the definition of ζ(ij), we need to check whether there exists a variable set V ′ such that V ′ d-separates v i and v j . That is, α KB (ij | V ′ ) = 0.</formula><p>Then, the worst case is that we need to check every combination of</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V ′ ⊆ V \{v i , v j }, which needs O(2 n-2 ) time.</formula><p>We now start formally introducing the large language model assisted causal recovery (LACR) method, which first extracts the conditional associational relationships between variables, and determines the causal relationships following the process of CCGC (see Section 3.1). We implement such a process by a series of separated queries using the constraint-based causal prompt. The LACR consists of two steps: the edge existence verification (LACR 1) and orientation (LACR 2). See all of the original prompts in Appendix A.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">LACR 1: Edge Existence Verification</head><p>In this phase, we construct the skeleton of the causal graph, i.e., verifying the existence of each edge without clarifying its direction. We use LLMs to mine the statistical evidence to verify the conditional associational relationship between each pair of variables and determine the existence of a causal edge (recall Section 3.1), from the retrieved scientific documents (corresponding to documentbased query), LLMs' internal knowledge (corresponding to background-based query), and statistical estimation-based output. To achieve this target, we design a prompt strategy that encodes the statistical principles of CCGC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Constraint-Based Causal (CC) Prompt</head><p>In LACR, KB can be the LLM's background knowledge, external documents, and datasets. For each variable pair, namely v i and v j , we clarify their conditional associational relationship by mining the statistical evidence from KB. We conduct a chain of 4 queries to determine the final opinion of each piece of KB, namely, the background reminder, the association verifier, the association type verifier, and the association rechecker. However, if any KB does not contain sufficient information to determine the value of αKB (ij | V ′ ), we ask the LLM to give an answer UNKNOWN. We classify such knowledge bases as unusable, and they are discarded during the decision-making phase.</p><p>Background reminder. This prompt component helps the LLM to understand the full picture of the task, and avoid misinterpretation of variables' meaning. We aim to provide minimum external information about the task other than the names of the variables to the LLM. Therefore, we only give the full FACTOR list (i.e., the names of the variables), and specify the DOMAINS from which the variables are. For example, in the ASIA experiment dataset (see Section 4), all variables are from the domains of MEDICAL, BIOLOGY, AND SOCIAL SCIENCE. Finally, we ask the LLM to specify the meaning of each variable, as well as the interaction among them.</p><p>Association verifier. The component utilizes KR to verify the zero-order associational relationship between v i and v j , i.e., αKB (ij). The LLM is provided with an ASSOCIATION CONTEXT (an instruction of how to determine whether v i and v j is associated or not) and KB. Then, the LLM determines the relationship as ASSOCIATED (if</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">αKB (ij) = 1), INDEPENDENT (if αKB (ij) = 0),</formula><p>or UNKNOWN, based on the statistical evidence extracted from KB. If the decision is an association, the LACR goes to the next query.</p><p>Association type verifier. Upon determining AS-SOCIATED between v i and v j , we further need to determine whether this association is "indirect" or "direct", i.e., whether there exists V ′ that can dseparate v i and v j . Based on the given KB and reasoning, the LLM is asked to read an ACCUSA-TION TYPE CONTEXT (an instruction of how to judge whether the association is indirect or direct based on KB). Intuitively, the ACCUSATION TYPE CONTEXT illustrates that if the association between v i and v j is mediated by variables from V ′ , then, the association is indirect, otherwise it is direct. To align precisely with CCGC, the ACCUSATION TYPE CONTEXT further explains that "the association mediated by third variables" means that the association is eliminated if we control the third variables constantly. The LACR goes to the final query if the decision is an INDIRECTLY ASSOCIATED.</p><p>Association rechecker. Considering the potential that the LLM can return INDIRECTLY ASSOCIATED because it judges that the association between v i and v j is mediated by external variables that are not from V . Since we do not consider external variables, we ask the LLM to verify whether the set of mediating variables includes any from V \ {v i , v j }. If yes, the association type should be corrected to DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">The CC Prompt is Deterministic</head><p>Using the above prompt strategy, we demonstrate that the LLM's return can determine the existence of causal edges based on a given KB. We first specify that the LLM's return based on the above prompt must be one from set {INDEPENDENT, DI-RECTLY ASSOCIATED, INDIRECTLY ASSOCIATED, UNKNOWN}. If the return is UNKNOWN, the KB is unusable. Then, for each usable KB, we have the following proposition showing that each usable KB can make decision deterministically. Proposition 3.2. For each variable pair v i and v j , the mapping from the conditional associational relationship space of v i and v j to the return set of each usable KB is a surjection, and the mapping from the return set of each usable KB to the range of ζ ij , i.e., {0, 1}, is also a surjection. We first show the first half of the proposition, i.e., the mapping from the conditional associational relationship space between v i and v j , i.e., (α KB (ij | V ′ )) V ′ ⊆V \{v i ,v j } , to LLM's return space based on each usable KB, i.e., {INDEPEN-</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">DENT, DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED, INDIRECTLY AS- SOCIATED} is a surjection. Note that (α KB (ij | V ′ )) V ′ ⊆V \{v i ,v j } forms a 2 |V |-2 -dimensional vec- tor, recording α KB (ij | V ′ ) ∈ {0</formula><p>, 1} for all possible V ′ . We discuss three exclusive cases:</p><p>1. αKB (ij) = 0. That is, the zero-order conditional associational relationship between v i and v j is independent. This case is mapped to LLM return INDEPENDENT.</p><p>2. For all possible V ′ , αKB (ij | V ′ ) = 1. The case denotes that v i and v j are always associated conditioned on any possible V ′ , and therefore, this case is mapped to LLM return DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">αKB (ij) = 1 and ∃V</head><formula xml:id="formula_11">′ such that |V ′ | ≥ 1 and αKB (ij | V ′ ) = 0.</formula><p>In this case, controlling variables in V ′ , the statistical association between v i and v j is eliminated, and then it is mapped to LLM return INDIRECT ASSOCI-ATED.</p><p>We then show the second half of the proposition, i.e., the mapping from {INDEPENDENT,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED, INDIRECTLY ASSOCI- ATED} to {ζ KB (ij) = 0, ζ KB (ij) = 1} is a surjec- tion.</formula><p>If the return is DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED, the KB specifies that v i and v j cannot be d-separated, and therefore, it is mapped to ζ KB (ij) = 1. On the other hand, if LLM return is INDEPENDENT or IN-DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED, then, it indicates that V ′ exists that can d-separate v i and v j , where INDE-PENDENT corresponds to V ′ = ∅. Therefore, these two last cases correspond to ζ KB (ij) = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">LACR 1</head><p>With the above CC prompt, we are ready to introduce LACR 1 (Algorithm 1). We initialize the algorithm by setting the skeleton graph Ḡ as a complete undirected graph Ḡc , giving each variable pair v i , v j a pre-retrieved set of k relevant scientific documents as the documentbased knowledge base</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">DOC = {DOC ij = {DOC 1 ij , • • • , DOC k ij }} v i ,v j ∈V, s.t., v i ̸ =v j .

We slightly bias the decision towards ζKB (ij) = 0 by the setting of removing an edge if S ≤ 0, since generally, the LLM's decision biases towards DI-RECTLY ASSOCIATED. We use this biased setting because (1) almost KBs cannot load the evidence showing αKB (ij | V ′ ) for all possible V ′ , and (2) if most retrieved documents are unusable (no research report on v i and v j 's association), then, it is more possible that v i and v j are not associated. By the theory of the Wisdom of the Crowd, LACR's decision tends to be more accurate than querying a single knowledge base, and it can be improved by adding more relevant documents (see a detailed description in Appendix 3.2.3).</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Ḡ ← Ḡ\(v i , v</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LACR Expects To Enhance Skeleton Estimation Accuracy</head><p>The theory of Wisdom of the Crowd <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grofman et al., 1983)</ref> states that if (1) each individual voter can make the correct decision better than random decision (e.g., by a toss), and (2) voters make their decision independently, then, the accuracy of the collective decision made by simple majority monotonically increases with the number of voters. In LACR, each KB can be seen as a voter. Generally the above conditions tend to be guaranteed because (1) both BG and DOC have high quality and the delivered information is better than random information, and (2) different research papers deliver their results in a relatively independent way because of scientific integrity. Therefore, LACR's decision tends to be more accurate than querying single knowledge base, and it can be improved by adding more relevant documents.</p></div>

In LACR 2, we simply utilize direct query to LLM for the orientation task due to LLMs' high performance on causal orientation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kıcıman et al., 2023)</ref>. For each pair of adjacent variables in the skeleton, we use a two-step prompt strategy: Background reminder. Similar to LACR 1, we provide the main variables and the domain information of the task, and ask the LLM to clarify the variables' meanings, as well as their interaction.</p><p>Orienting. With the above clarification, we ask the LLM to thoroughly understand the given KB and a CAUSAL DIRECTION CONTEXT, that specifies that if variable A is the cause of variable B, then, the change of A's value causes a change of B's value, but not vice versa. Then, we ask the LLM to give its decision based on all of the above information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we first introduce the ground truth datasets and how we collect three research literature pools. Then we introduce the settings of our solution and baselines. Finally, we evaluate the pruning and orienting results, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiment Data</head><p>Validation datasets. We validate our method on four datasets (namely, ASIA, SACHS, and CORO-NARY). All datasets have reported causal graphs (see Appendix A.2) based on real-world data. It is worth noting that, we only limit the selection of validation datasets to real-world datasets because LACR uses a realistic knowledge base. ASIA <ref type="bibr">(lau, 1988)</ref>. The ASIA dataset has 8 nodes (from domains of medical, biology, and social sci-ence) and 8 edges, revealing the potential reasons and symptoms of lung diseases. SACHS <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sachs et al., 2005)</ref>. The SACHS dataset has 11 nodes (from the medical and biological domains) and 16 edges. It uncovers the interaction among proteins related to several human diseases. CORONARY <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Reinis et al., 1981)</ref>. The CORO-NARY dataset has 6 nodes (from the medical and biological domains) and 9 undirected edges, revealing the causal relationship among several potential reasons of coronary heart disease. We only use it to validate LACR 1 because the edges are undirected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experimental Settings</head><p>We use GPT-4o in the following experiments. Research document pool construction. In our experiment, we automatically build the pre-retrieved document set for each variable pair (Initialization in Algorithm 1) in two steps:</p><p>(1) Relevant paper search: We search 20 paper titles by querying "name[v i ] and name[v j ]" to the Google Scholar engine using the SerpApi (Ser-pApi), and rank the papers by Google Scholar's default relevance ranking.</p><p>(2) Paper download: Based on the aforementioned ranked paper title list, we use the PubMed API 1 to download the papers. For each paper title, we prioritize downloading the full document from the PubMed Central (PMC) database, and only download the abstract document from the PubMed database if the full version is not available in PMC. for each variable pair, we download up to 10 documents from the top of the ranked title list (note that some papers are unavailable in PubMed). Statistical causal discovery method. In the validation of LACR 1, additional to LLM, we also test the impact of injecting statistical estimation-based results into the decision-making phase. That is, adding point 1 (resp. -1) to score S if the statistical estimation-based method determines ζKB (ij) = 1 (resp. ζKB (ij) = 0) in Algorithm 1, where KB is numerical data. We use the Peter-Clark (PC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Spirtes et al., 2001)</ref> algorithm as the statistical estimationbased method. We import the data from the bnlearn package <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Scutari et al., 2019)</ref>. Baseline methods. We survey recent LLM-based causal graph construction methods, and for each dataset, we select the baseline method with the best performance. For each dataset, we present two types of baseline LLMs: baseline LLM1, which is a pure LLM-based method, and baseline LLM2, which is a hybrid method combining a statistical estimation-based and an LLM-based method. We do not compare LACR to any baseline method on the CORONARY dataset as the dataset's absence in such methods' validation.</p><p>Validation metrics. We measure LACR 1 and LACR 2 by different metrics. For LACR 1, we show the the adjacency precision (AP), the adjacency recall (AR), the F1 score, and the Normalized Hamming Distance (NHD), as follows. First, we count three attributes of each graph: true positive (TP): the number of edges that are successfully recovered, false positive (FP): the number of edges that are recovered but different from the ground truth graph, and false negative (FN): the number of edges that exist in the ground truth but not recovered in our constructed graph. Then, we compute AP: TP TP+FP , AR: TP TP+FN , F1: 2AP * AR AP +AR , and NHD: FP+FN n 2 , where n is the number of variables. Intuitively, NHD is the number different edges between two graphs, normalized by n 2 .</p><p>In the validation of LACR 2, we simply compute the True Edge Accuracy (TEA), i.e., the ratio of correctly oriented edges among all true positive edges in LACR 1's output skeleton.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation</head><p>We now first present observations based on experimental results for three datasets, which contains Edge Existence Verification (Section 4.3.1) and Orientation (Section 4.3.2), followed by a comprehensive analysis of the overall results (Section 4.3.3).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Observation on Edge Existence Verification</head><p>We present the performance of LACR 1 on causation existence verification with different knowledge bases KB in the section. The orienting performance will be shown in the next section. We have the following observations:</p><p>ASIA. We have three observations from the experimental results on the ASIA dataset. First, LACR 1 achieves the best performance when relying solely on BG. It successfully recovers the full skeleton and outperforms the high performance of the pure LLM method in <ref type="bibr">(Jiralerspong et al., 2024)</ref>. Second, adding retrieved documents into KB reduces performance (AP from 1 to 0.57, and F1 score from 1 to 0.73) according to the given ground truth in <ref type="bibr">(lau, 1988)</ref>. Third, by further aggregating the output of the PC algorithm, the F1 score increases from 0.73 to 0.86 compared to the ground truth in <ref type="bibr">(lau, 1988)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CORONARY (CORO).</head><p>The results differ notably from those based on the ASIA dataset, LACR 1 with only the LLM's background knowledge achieves the worst performance, with values of 0.625 for all of AP, AR, and F1 scores. By adding documents and the PC algorithm into KB, all metrics increase, reaching 0.875.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SACHS.</head><p>We have three observations from the results on the SACHS dataset. First, the best performance of LACR 1 is achieved using only the LLM's background knowledge, outperforming the baseline method (combined method of LLM and hybrid statistical methods of DirectLiNGAM). Second, adding documents as the knowledge base slightly decreases the F1 score by 0.01. Third, with the PC algorithm's output, the F1 score reduces to 0.46, which is worse than the baseline method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">LACR 2: Orientation</head><p>The results of LACR 2, shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, show that TEA is 1 (i.e., orienting all TP edges correctly) on both ASIA and SACHS, based on all KB. We can observe that, upon successfully recovering causal edges by LACR 1, the orientation accuracy is high, reaching 1 for all knowledge bases and all datasets. It demonstrates the efficacy of the orientation prompt as well as LLM's capability for causal orientation reasoning. We conjecture that the success of this task strongly depends on the rich evidence stored in the scientific literature, and the easy understandability of such evidence, compared to the extraction of associational relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Overall Results Analysis</head><p>By summarizing the overall performance of LACR, it is worth noticing the following points: LACR's performance tends to monotonically increase by taking more KB with high quality and readability. Observing LACR's performance on ASIA and CORONARY, we notice that our methods generally perform better with high-quality and readability of the input documents and statistical results. While we discuss the performance drop of LACR1 (DOC) on the ASIA dataset later, the overall trend coincides with the Condorcet theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Grofman et al., 1983)</ref> in voting theory, which suggests that aggregating diverse, high-quality inputs leads to better outcomes. LACR performs differently on tail and non-tail data. We observe that LACR performs better on ASIA and CORONARY datasets compared to the SACHS dataset. This is because the terms in ASIA and CORONARY are more common to LLMs during training. In contrast, SACHS mainly contains symbols with specific meanings in a specific area. Despite feeding scientific documents to LACR on all datasets, the lack of prior knowledge of these symbols in the training phase limits LLMs' understanding of their meanings, resulting in hallucinations. This has been observed in RAG-based legal research tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Magesh et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Updating on the current ground truth causal graphs is necessary. We found, through LACR's responses, strong evidence from domain research (see details in Appendix 4.4.1) indicating that an update to the ground truth causal graphs is necessary. For example, on the ASIA dataset, the ground truth being outdated led to reduced performance when using additional documents. Similarly, for the CORONARY dataset, the improvement in performance with added documents and the PC algorithm suggests that the ground truth for CORO-NARY is more current compared to ASIA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Refining the Ground Truth (ASIA and CORONARY)</head><p>The ground truth causal graph needs refinement because it is outdated and significantly differs from current SOTA domain knowledge. Additionally, we aim to determine if the LLM can identify new causal relationships based on SOTA literature. In this part, we present the observations and analyses on the refined ground truth causal graphs based on the refined ASIA and CORONARY datasets.</p><p>We first show the evidences returned by the LACR supporting the refinement of the ground truths in Section 4.4.1, and then we discuss how refined graph truth affects performance from three perspectives: causal inferring based on LLM'S background knowledge BG, external literature DOC, and statistic data PC in Section 4.4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Evidences of Ground Truth Refinement</head><p>ASIA Smoking and Tuberculosis In the documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wang and Shen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Horne et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gupta et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lindsay et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amere et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alavi-Naini et al., 2012)</ref> fed into LLM as the KB, strong evidence shows that Smoking and Tuberculosis are associated, and the association cannot be eliminated by controlling the other variables in the ASIA dataset. This conflicts against the conditional associational relationship between these two variables in the ground truth causal graph (Appendix A.2), since both of the only two paths have a collider, which indicates that Smoking and Tuberculosis are independent from each other. Based on the scientific evidence returned by LACR, a causal link exists between the two factors.</p><p>Bronchitis and X-ray Documents based on LACR's response, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jin et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ntiamoah et al., 2021)</ref> show that an association exists between Bronchitis and Positive X-ray. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref> further develops a deep-learning-based method to detect bronchitis directly from X-ray reports for children with age from 1-17 years old. The evidence shows an association between the two variables, and the association is not mediated by the variable "Smoking" as shown in the causal graph. Therefore, we add a causal edge between Bronchitis and X-ray in the ground truth causal graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CORONARY Strenuous Mental Work and Family Anamnesis Of Coronary Heart Disease</head><p>According to the ground truth causal graph skeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Reinis et al., 1981)</ref>, there is a direct causal relationship between variable Strenuous Mental Work and variable Family Anamnesis Of Coronary Heart Disease. However, according to the evidence returned by our method and the intuitive description in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Reinis et al., 1981)</ref>, we observe that this causal linkage should be removed with high probability. By (Edwards, 2000) (p.26), this edge is not intuitively expected though it is recovered by the Bayesian learning method. Additionally, non of LACR's responses suggests the direct association between the two variables, and moreover, it returns evidences showing the positive probability to remove the edge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wright et al., 2007)</ref> shows that people with Family Anamnesis Of Coronary Heart Disease are easier to react to mental stress from work by higher Systolic Blood Pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hintsa et al., 2010)</ref> shows that the association between psychosocial factors at work and coronary heart disease is largely independent from the Family Anamnesis Of Coronary Heart Disease.</p><p>Systolic Blood Pressure and Family Anamnesis Of Coronary Heart Disease LACR also returns evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barrett-Connor and Khaw, 1984)</ref> showing that Family Anamnesis of Coronary Heart Disease and Systolic Blood Pressure are associated even after the adjustment of several variables including Smoking. We therefore also add this edge between the two variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>We first address three technical limitations of the current version of LACR. The first is the paper search accuracy. The pre-retrieved document set needs high quality and relevance to provide relevant evidence. Therefore, we conjecture that using refined queries and other search engines can enhance the performance. The second limitation is LLMs' understanding on highly professional documents. Through our experiments, we found that LLMs' poor comprehension capability on specific domains, e.g., the SACHS dataset, limits LACR's performance. An optional solution is to fine-tune LLMs to better understand such documents. The third is the complexity of LACR. The method needs to query each variable pair (O(n 2 )), and for each variable pair, multiple documents need to be queried.</p><p>We then address other practical limitations. What comes first is the need of up-to-data practical validation datasets and causal graphs in causal discovery community. Many validation datasets are synthesized, which are not usable in such practical knowledge-based methods. The second practical limitation is the access of scientific papers. In our experiment, we focus on biomedical datasets for the accessibility of research papers in PubMed, however, the full contexts of most of the papers are not open accessible. It would open the possibility of overall better understanding of causal relationships if full documents are accessible in more research domains and broader scientific databases. <ref type="bibr">Yu Zhou, Xingyu Wu, Beicheng Huang, Jibin Wu, Liang</ref> Feng, and Kay Chen Tan. 2024.
