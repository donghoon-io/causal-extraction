<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Electronic collaboration is a pervasive concept that influences practically all human domains, from work to learning to entertainment; making possible the collaboration between two or more distant persons. To encourage the exploitation of this new phenomenon, we have to demonstrate its benefits using validated evaluating methods that ensure the reliability of its effects. However, e-collaboration environments are not just classical human-computer interfaces: the criteria for their evaluation include teleological properties like the collaboration goal, the tasks and also particular constraints like the connectivity, the used soft platform, the quality of services and the behavior of the collaboration members. Our research work attempts to propose a reusable e-collaboration evaluation method. To attain this goal, we began by carrying out some abstractions about e-collaboration sessions giving a more rigorous vision about these environments. Once this step accomplished, the evaluation work based on the previously cited vision can be started.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Generally, collaboration involves attractive exchanges and many motivated efforts producing results more interesting than individual work. By definition, this concept requires its participants to be in the same geographical site at the same time. But such constraint can't be accepted in the current ages of technological emergence that has broken all geographical and temporal barriers. Frequently two or more persons in different ends of the world have common interests and need to collaborate. This requirement must not be dropped due to its consequent constraints; it has to be supported by existing technologies to help participants producing interesting results promoting progress in the concerned domain. Today, a wide range of collaborative platforms is available offering services more and more sophisticated and adapted to all the needs. Despite all this technological wealth in perpetual growth, its exploitation is still limited and slowed by a poor reliability level. Unfortunately, in many cases, we notice that in order to attend a meeting of few hours; some people prefer spending time and money in travelling instead of using e-collaboration tools. It is true that passing from a real to a virtual environment, involves the introduction of some technological and psychological factors that could have, sometimes, negative effects on the collaborative work progress. Even if this risk is low, in high concurrency environments it can't be neglected; this explains the preference of classical meetings to virtual ones. To change the described behavior face to ecollaboration tools, we estimate necessary to resolve the existing reliability problem by evaluating rigorously these environments performances and progressively improve them.</p><p>The existing works on e-collaboration performance evaluation were not sufficient to reassure users as some of them are related to particular application domains and others present new ideas without any validation. Many works on ecollaboration are based on abstractions and present very theoretical ideas making them far from reality and difficult to apply to real cases. These findings motivated us to propose a new evaluating approach supposed to be easier to apply and based on the analysis of real scenarios. This paper will be organized as follows. In section 2, we position the reader in the context by summarizing most of the existing work on e-collaboration. In section 3, we present the different studied evaluation alternatives and we prove the choice of the proposed approach. In section 4, we describe the carried out scenario based analysis as well as the obtained results. In section 5, we present the proposed evaluation method based on the previously outlined abstractions and composed of two levels. Finally, in section 6, we explain more our method by applying it on a test scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. STATE OF THE ART</head><p>The beginnings of e-collaboration date from mid-1800s when the telegraph was invented. But this new tool wasn't sufficiently practical to diffuse largely the concept. The same occurred for the telephone in 1870. With the advent of the first commercial computers known under the name of mainframes, e-collaboration emerged and was more favored by the e-mail development. Afterwards, the creation of Wide Area Networks (WAN) and the development of personal computers encouraged the design of new technologies and platforms for this recent concept. Consequently, many key words appeared like: CMC (Computer Mediated Communication) and CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work) as new concepts and GDSS (Group Decision Support Systems) as a new mean enabling the increase of meeting efficiency. Many platforms were available like: Groupsystems, Teamfocus and Lotus Notes. The first research on e-collaboration were launched in the 70ties giving birth to the first papers on e-collaboration in the mid-1990s. The main topics consisted in finding technological solutions for e-collaboration problems and analyzing tool effects on group behavior in e-collaboration environments. These topics evolved over time and some of them were resolved while new ones appeared. In particular, performance evaluation was a research item treated by many works and it isn't resolved till now <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In the literature, many works propose performance evaluation methods for e-collaboration environments. They classify evaluations in four types according to their aim [2]: feasibility evaluation that is based on the cost, iterative evaluation that aims to improve collaborative platforms, comparative evaluation that compares systems and appropriateness evaluation that determines if a system is appropriate to a given organization's process.</p><p>Generally, in considered works, evaluation is carried out by: • Identifying significant metrics and measuring them <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. • Designing questionnaires reflecting the aspects to evaluate and exploiting them [2]. We note from the literature study the multiplicity of dispersed works generally without any validation <ref type="bibr">[6][7]</ref>. This explains the lack of standards for performance evaluation and the frequency of subjective statements on e-collaboration performance. The absence of rigorous evaluation works will not favor the concept improvement and its reliability. This problem has motivated the presented work aiming to propose an e-collaboration evaluation method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED APPROACH</head><p>Performance Evaluation is a wide term that concerns different works focused in varied aspects depending on the considered system as well as the aimed performance criteria. Our contribution has started with a study of different possible alternatives of evaluation and the choice of the most adapted approach to the e-collaboration context. The studied evaluation ideas can be summarized in the following points:</p><p>• Focus on the communication quality aspect by using formulas of networks performance evaluation;</p><p>• Consider only three important aspects in evaluation: communication support, interface and collaborators behavior;</p><p>• Start by an analysis of real e-collaboration scenarios permitting to produce general results representing all e-collaboration scenarios. These results are used to find a reusable evaluation solution.</p><p>We estimate that the first idea is not applicable to the considered scenarios which present many additional characteristics compared to simple networks. In fact, in machine networks, the computing speed and precision as well as the response time to requests are significant. But it is not the same case when the network's nodes are constituted by humans who collaborate under particular constraints aiming to attain some objectives.</p><p>For the second idea, despite the importance of previously cited aspects, we estimate that e-collaboration evaluation can't be reduced to a combination of separate network, Human-Machine-Interface and behavior evaluations as the whole is greater than the sum of parts.</p><p>The third idea is to start with an analysis of several real ecollaboration scenarios followed by successive abstractions permitting to produce a general model representing all ecollaboration scenarios. The proposed evaluation method would be based on the obtained model. This alternative seems more realizable and adequate to e-collaboration environments that are various, dynamic and strongly dependent on their contexts including objectives, progress conditions and the unpredictable human behavior.</p><p>IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SCENARIO BASED ANALYSIS</head><p>The evaluation task consists mainly on comparing obtained results with expected ones taking into account the environment's characteristics and constraints. This strong context's dependence makes the evaluation task more difficult; so it is inappropriate to use the classical and well known performance aspects like computing time results and accuracy to describe e-collaboration quality. Face to this subjective and particular environment, our idea consists in starting with an analysis of some real e-collaboration scenarios in order to detect their common aspects and carry out some abstractions to be able to product reusable results. To be more concrete, we present in the following, three examples of the considered scenarios, belonging to different contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Scenario examples</head><p>The first scenario is part of ELeGI (European Learning Grid Infrastructure) project involving students having to edit, design and produce a Spanish-language web-based newsletter, containing items of interest to the Spanishlanguage community. These collaboration members, have to decide what the scope of the content should actually be (e.g. sports, news, culture). Each group of four students is supervised by a tutor directing them in the different required tasks and evaluating their works at the end. Communications between participants are ensured by BuddySpace services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The second scenario aims to improve the business modeling language entitled BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation).</p><p>For each detected representation weakness or problem, the project participants, launch a discussion and collect proposed solutions, then an e-mail vote process is carried out to determine what solution will be retained <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The third scenario is supported by the Flashmeeting videoconferencing environment and consists of a virtual lirmm-00822885, version 1 -15 May 2013 meeting of a research team chaired by its dir supervise the work progress of each membe faced problems.
