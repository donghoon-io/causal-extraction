<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Event-Event Relation Extraction (ERE) is the task of identifying the relation between two events in texts. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, for any pair of events 1 , e.g., (Services, downtime), it shall make the classifications for which relation type it holds. Clearly, event pairs may be in the same sentence (SERE) <ref type="bibr">(Kadowaki et al., 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kadowaki et al., 2019b)</ref>, or scattered across the entire document (DERE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Phu and Nguyen, 2021)</ref>. In practice, DERE can benefit a wider range of applications, such as knowledge graph construction <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2019)</ref> and future event forecasting  <ref type="bibr">14,21,35,41,38 (6, 11)</ref> 6-2-Serv (6, 9)9-2-down (6,7)7-2-disrup (7, 24) 24-2-co (7, 14)14-4-dam (7, 12)12-3-dam 13-4-affected 14-4-damage</p><p>[2] Services on', "Egypt's", 'three telecom operators were disrupted in parts of Alexandria on Tuesday afternoon , and some users in Cairo experienced slower internet connections due to "downtime".</p></div>

Solid lines denote causal relations; some events and relations are omitted for clarity. The red boxes are indicator words for causal relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hashimoto, 2019)</ref> but it remains challenging due to the difficulty in long-text understanding.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to improve the reasoning ability among events spanning the entire document for DERE. Different from conventional methods, which build an event graph based on linguistic tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Phu and Nguyen, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Xu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zeng et al., 2021)</ref>, we focus more on the nature of document itself and do not rely on any prior knowledge. To do this, we highlight the following key questions:</p><p>• How to capture events' dependence that may be far away?</p><p>• Should we treat all event pairs equally considering the essential difference between SERE and DERE?</p><p>To address them, we propose a novel DERE model that learns Sparse EveNt representations for Discriminating Intraand intersentential Reasoning, namely SENDIR. Inspired by MAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(He et al., 2022)</ref>, we observe a different information density between sentences and documents -for an event, most parts of the document are irrelevant, leading to a low information density. By contrast, the sentence has a high density and usually contains related words as causal indicators. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, problem 3 causal ----→ damage 3 in the third sentence has clear causal word (due to) 2 , making the prediction much easier. While, for problem 3 causal ----→ damage 4 across the third and fourth sentences, there is no such pattern. This motivates us the design two modules as follows.</p><p>The goal of module 1 is to shorten the dependence distance among events to learn high-quality local and global context representations. The basic idea is to learn event-specific sentence embeddings as local features. Based on that, we further utilize sparse self-attention globally to skip irrelevant information. We have defined various types of attention masks to reflect specific dependence among sentences. In addition to conventional random sparse attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tay et al., 2021)</ref>, we have also explored Narrative, Flashback, Global→, Global←, and Banded attention, to reflect specific language bias according to human writing habits. We name this module sparse event representation learning, while these sparse attentions shall also benefit other long-text understanding tasks.</p><p>Module 2 aims to discriminate intra-and intersentential reasoning to help difficult cross-sentence events with relatively easy within-sentence-level events. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, it is easy to predict (problem 3 causal ----→ damage 3 ) with high confidence, which is part of the path problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3 causal ----→ damage 3 causal ----→ af f ected 4 causal ----→ damage 4</formula><p>for prediction of (problem 3 causal ----→ damage 4 ). Thus, for each event pair, we take the outputs of module 1 as intra-sentential features. We then enhance them with selected supportive event pairs to constitute possible reasoning chain, and utilize Gated Attention Unit (GAU) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hua et al., 2022)</ref> to conduct inter-sentential reasoning. Finally, we combine these two types of features with varying weights to differentiate their confidence and roles in ERE. Thus, we can improve the prediction of event pairs across sentences without hurting the performance of the pairs within a sentence.</p><p>We summarize the contributions as follows:</p><p>• We propose to discriminate intra-and intersentential reasoning considering the essential difference between SERE and DERE.</p><p>• We propose a novel DERE model SENDIR without any prior knowledge or external tools.</p><p>2 We use subscript to denote the sentence index.</p><p>• Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SENDIR. Further studies also verify our proposed sparse attentions and discriminative reasoning in long-text understanding.</p><p>2 Related Work</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sparse Event Representation Learning</head><p>SER explores various types of attention to capture long-distance dependence between sentences for high-quality document representation, which will be used to enhance the event representation. In specific, SER first learns event-specific sentence embedding as the local context. Based on them, we then apply sparse self-attention to skip irrelevant information as global contexts. Particularly, we introduce various types of long-distance dependency assumptions. Finally, we define event representations based on local and global contexts. We highlight the following differences and advantages of SER from the previous document representation:</p><p>(1) The global contexts taking sentences as nodes shortens the token-level distance between events.</p><p>(2) Well-designed sparse attention mechanism will bring useful language bias that further alleviates the difficulty of modeling long-distance dependence.</p><p>Event-specific Sentence Embedding. Given event and its sentence embeddings (i.e., e i,p and s p ), we use the event as a query and compute event-specific sentence embedding c i as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">w i = Softmax(s p e i,p ) c i = w i s p ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where c i is defined as local context of event e i,p , and w i is the trainable parameters. Sparse Attention Mask.</p><p>We apply selfattention technique to fuse information from the above event-specific sentence embeddings</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C 1 = [c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c N ] ∈ R N ×d as the global context.</formula><p>Note that N is the number of events rather than sentences, because each event has its own sentence embedding, even if two events are located in the same sentence.</p><p>Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Child et al. (2019)</ref>, we design the sparse mask matrix to deal with the long-distance dependency issue. We have designed six types of masks: Global→, Global←, Random, Banded, Narrative, and Flashback. Note that the assumptions behind them are not always true and we will give a discussion later. Their intuitive impression is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Formally, we define the mask matrix as G ∈ R N ×N , where each element G i,j ∈ {0, 1} denotes if the information of the j th event in the q th sentence e j,q can be seen by the i th event in the p th sentence e i,p . We define the following masks:</p><p>• Global→. We assume the events in the first several sentences (e.g., the first two sentences) are core topics of the document and should see all of the other events:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">G i,j = 1, if p &lt; 3, or q &lt; 3 0, otherwise .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>• Global←. We assume the events in the last several sentences (e.g., the last two sentences) are conclusion topics of the document and should see all of the other events:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">G i,j = 1, if p &gt; N -3, or q &gt; N -3 0, otherwise .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>• Random. Random sparse masks are usually used to increase the ability of non-local interactions-we randomly sample 20% matrix element as 0, and others are 1.</p><p>• Banded. We assume that the related information is narrowed down into neighbor sentences only. That is, each event can only see the events in neighbor sentences:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">G i,j = 1, if |p -q| &lt; 3 0, otherwise .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>• Narrative. We assume that the events are mostly described in narrative order, so that the former event can see the latter one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">G i,j = 1, if q -p &gt; 0 0, otherwise .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>• Flashback. We assume that events are sequentially written, and thus the latter one should see the former one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">G i,j = 1, if p -q &gt; 0 0, otherwise .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Discussion of sparsity assumptions. Due to the complexity of language, we have designed the above six types of attention masks to capture different linguistic biases. Although these masks have patterns suitable for specific settings, they also have unsuitable cases where the underlying assumptions shall fail. However, all of them are designed based on our core assumption -the information density in documents is lower than that in sentences. Thus, we capture long-distance dependence via the sparse attention mechanism. In the experiment (Section 4.7), we demonstrate that even the random attention mask can improve document-level performance, and other types of attention masks (e.g., Narrative) have achieved further improvements by introducing additional language bias. Event Representation. Given local context C and attention mask G, we now use selfattention <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> to obtain global context, which is further combined with local context as event representations. The global context</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">C = [c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c N ] ∈ R N ×d can be computed as follows: C = αC (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>where α is the sparse self-attention matrix and each element is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">   att i,j = (c i W i )(c j W j ) T √ d * G i,j α i,j = exp(att i,j ) z∈N -1 exp(att i,z ) , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>where d is the dimension of hidden states for scaling, W i and W j are the trainable parameters. To capture different representation subspaces, we also use multi-head attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. Now, we define the sparse contextualized event representation as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">e i = ReLU([e i , c i , c i ]W e ),<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where W e ∈ R 3d×d is the trainable parameters, and e i ∈ R d . Given each pair of events (e i , e j ), we define their representation as follows 3 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">v i,j = ReLU([e i + e j , |e i -e j |]W c ),<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where W c ∈ R 2d×d is the trained parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discriminating Intra-and inter-sentential Reasoning</head><p>Section 3.2 defines event pair representations based on local and global contexts. In this section, DIR takes them as intra-sentential features, indicating that they have not considered the event pairs in other sentences to form a reasoning chain. To further obtain inter-sentential features for each pair of events, we first select supportive event pairs for each event pair and use GAU <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hua et al., 2022)</ref> for information fusion. Then, we combine two types of features with different weights to differentiate two types of reasoning -the relatively easy intrasentential tasks can help cross-sentence relation identification without the loss of performance. First, instead of using all event pairs as supports, we assume that only the pairs sharing at least one common event can contribute to the reasoning chain. For example, given four events <ref type="bibr">(a, b, c, d)</ref> to predict the relation between (a, c), the event pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are clearly related, but (b, d) is clearly irrelevant. By stacking more layers, our proposed model can implicitly deal with longer reasoning chains, as any length of chains can be decomposed into several shorter chains. Take the chain a -→ b -→ c -→ d for predicting event pair (a, d) as an example, we indeed will use a -→ c and c -→ d as supportive evidence, while a -→ c shall be supported as illustrated above. This is, the longer chain has been decomposed into two sub-chains, modeled using multiple layers, and optimized jointly. Based on the assumption, we build a set of supportive event pairs for query (e i , e j ), T 1 = [v i,j , v i,1 , . . . , v N,j ]. Note that we include the representations of query event pair v i,j . Next, we utilize GAU to conduct reasoning over the sup-3 For clarity, we delete the index of the sentence. portive set as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">   T 2 = (U AV)W o U = T 1 W u , V = T 1 W v , Z = T 1 W z A = (ReLU((ZW q )(ZW k ) T + b)) 2 , (12) where W o , W u , W v , W z , W q , W k</formula><p>, and b are the trainable parameters, and T 2 = [v i,j , v i,1 , . . . , v N,j ] are the output event pair representations enhanced by reasoning chains. We take v i,j as the inter-sentential reasoning features of query (e i , e j ). Now, we are to combine two types of features with different weights. The basic idea is that event pairs within the same sentence is relatively easy to predict with high confidence, e.g., causal indicator words (e.g., due to or lead to) in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> provide clear patterns. We thus leverage intra-sentential features to facilitate the event pairs spanning different sentences. To avoid the harm of easier predictions, we assign higher weights to intra-sentential features if the event pair is within the same sentence. By contrast, we assign higher weights to inter-sentential features for events from different sentences to highlight the inter-sentential reasoning. Finally, the query event pair representations for relation between (e i , e j ) are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">o =      v i,j + β 1 v i,j , if p -q &lt; 0( ---→ inter) v i,j + β 2 v i,j , if p -q = 0(intra) v i,j + β 3 v i,j , if p -q &gt; 0( ← --- inter) ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where β 1 , β 2 , β 3 are the weights that highlight different type of features for different event distribution. We determine these hyper-parameters by the heuristic experiments. Note that we separate the two cases of events in different sentences:</p><p>---→ inter and ← --inter.</p><p>---→ inter indicates that the event pairs are located in narrative order, while ← --inter denotes a flashback order. The separation considers the different attention assumptions in Section 3.2, which captures various language biases. In experiments, we indeed found such a bias that ← --inter has a high probability of negative relation, we thus set β 3 = 0 and β 1 = 0.8, β 2 = 0.2 heuristically, but this may be varying in different scenarios.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Parameter Settings</head><p>We choose the most widely used BERT-base as basic PLMs, to avoid exhaustive parameter tuning. The learning rate is set to 1e -5 for pretraining and 1e -4 for others. We optimize our model with AdamW. We conduct the grid search to tune hyperparameters: the size of embedding is in {64; 128; 256; 512; 768}, where bold font denotes the best setup. The batch size for pre-trained model is set to 2. The dropout rate is set to 0.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Baseline</head><p>We compare SENDIR with state-of-the-art methods for Event Causal RE and Event Temporal RE. Event Causal RE. (1) KMMG <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Liu et al., 2020)</ref> that proposes a mention masking generalization and use external knowledge databases; (2) KnowDis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zuo et al., 2020)</ref> that investigates a data augmentation to solve the data lacking; (3) LSIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cao et al., 2021)</ref> that employ ConceptNet to capture the latent causal relational structure; (4) LearnDA <ref type="bibr">(Zuo et al., 2021b)</ref> that augments data to solve the data lacking; (5) LR+ and LIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gao et al., 2019)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Overall Performance</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and 2 show the overall performance on EventStoryLine, Causal-TB, and MATRES, respectively. We can see that: (1) SENDIR achieves better F1 scores on EventStoryLine and Causal-TB, it also has a competitive result on MATRES, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our model. (2) On the MATRES, SENDIR is slightly lower than SCS-EERE. Because event temporal RE is particularly sensitive to direction between events. (3) All models perform better on intra-sentence than inter-sentence in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. This is consistent with our claim that intra-sentence is easier to identify. (4) Particularly, SENDIR has much higher precision on intrasentence. Because the discriminative reasoning scheme alleviates the negative impacts of more difficult cross-sentence reasoning.</p><p>(5) On intersentence setting, the improvements are mainly from higher recall. We attribute this to the enhanced long-distance modeling ability and the supportive query set -it tends to find relation clues from broader contexts and other event pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Ablation Study</head><p>To further analyze SENDIR, we also conduct an ablation analysis to illustrate the effectiveness of our main modules. We show the results of the ablation study in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . SER. We examined the impacts of SER in Table 3. w/o Sparse Att, w/o Event Repre, and w/o SER denote that we gradually remove the key designs in Section 3.2: remove sparse attention mask, use local context only as event representations, and remove the entire SER module.</p><p>(1) w/o SER. The performance becomes sharply poor without SER, especially on intra-sentence. Specifically, the experimental results are reduced by 5.3%/2.2%/2.4% F1 on intra-sentence, intersentence, and intra+inter. This demonstrates that SER can capture high-quality document representation, and intra-sentence event pairs rely more on high quality event representation, so intra-sentence drops more. (2) w/o Sparse Att. The experimental results are reduced. Specifically, the sparse attention mask has a more significant impact on intrasentence, and this sparsity is the key to improving the quality of the document representation. We will do further analysis of multiple attention masks in Section 4.7. (3) w/o Event Repre. The main performance is the decline in inter-sentence, while intra-sentence is even slightly up. We attribute the reason that the inter-sentence relies more on global context and the intra-sentence relies more on local context. Moreover, the number of inter-sentence is much more than intra-sentence. Therefore, when inter-sentence drops, results of inter+inter drops, even though intra-sentence arises.</p><p>DIR. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, we can also observe the following insights. Note that w/o DIR, w/o Selection, and w/o Weight denote the deletion of our entire DIR module, taking all other event pairs as supports, and regarding intra-and inter-sentential reasoning the same by using the same weight 1. decrease on inter-sentence, which is consistent with the method's motivation and validates the DIR's effectiveness.</p><p>(2) w/o Selection. The experimental results are reduced. The major reason is that considering all event pairs as candidates will increase the noisy information.</p><p>(3) w/o Weight. The drop on intra-sentence is very significant. Because of the lack of distinction in cross-sentence reasoning, the over-reasoning of simple event pairs leads to poor results. And using different weights facilitates simple tasks and global enhancements. We will follow up with a detailed discussion in Section 4.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Effects of Weights</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, we show the performance of Intra+Inter with different values for β 1 ( ---→ inter) and β 2 (intra). The darker the color, the higher the F1 value. We did not include β 3 due to the serious bias in datasets (β 3 = 0 always leads to better results), which makes further investigation trivial. The darker the color, the higher the F1 value. We can find that: (1) The scores in the bottom right part is better than in other parts, where the weight of inter-sentence increases and the weight of intra-sentence decreases. This agrees with our assumption that inter-sentential event pairs rely more on cross-sentence reasoning than intra-sentential event pairs. (2) In general, the performance of the right part is better than the left. There are two reasons: first, as the weight of inter-sentence increases, we highlight more cross-sentence reasoning, which improves the performance of intersentence; second, there are far more inter-sentence than intra-sentence, and the improvements of intersentential results will significantly improve the overall experimental performance.</p><p>(3) The subdiagonal elements indicate that intra-sentence and inter-sentence have the same weight. Clearly, the performance is unsatisfactory. The reason is that inter-sentential event pairs are usually difficult to predict and have lower confidence than intrasentential event pairs. Thus, treating them equally negatively impacts the easier sentence-level tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Effects of Sparse Attention Mask</head><p>To investigate the impacts of various sparse attention masks on the SER, we report the results using different sparse attention masks: Narrative, Flashback, Global→, Global←, Random, and Banded.</p><p>From the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, we can find that: (1) On intrasentence, these sparse attention masks have similar results except for Global→. This result is consistent with the previous results that event pairs rely more on local contexts rather than long-distance dependence on global contexts.</p><p>(2) Random is unexpectedly good, indicating there is numerous redundant information in the document, and the sparse mask matrix can mitigate the effect of noise.</p><p>(3) Narrative has achieved the best performance, which reflects a language bias from human writing habits -always talk about the main topic at first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8">Case Study</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we present a case study to better understand the effect of SENDIR compared to the baseline model (i.e., BERT). We can notice that: BERT and SENDIR can identify the intra-sentential event pair (dead causal ----→6.1 magnitude quake) and some easy inter-sentential event pairs (dead causal ----→6.1 magnitude earthquake and 6.1 magnitude quake causal ----→ rescue). However, for some complex event pairs that span multiple sentences, SENDIR can employ DIR to infer causal relations, but BERT fails, such as dead causal ----→ quake and 6.1 magnitude quake causal ----→ injured. These demonstrate the significant advantages of SENDIR in dealing with inter-sentential event pairs to identify hard-to-identify causal relations by cross-sentence reasoning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we exploit a novel Discriminative Reasoning with Sparse Event Representation for DERE. It can learn high-quality event representation and facilitate inter-sentential reasoning for document-level understanding. Experimental results show that our method is effective and significantly better than competitive baselines, improving inter-sentence cases without harming intrasentence event pairs. The extensive analysis also provides interesting insights about various language biases for sparse long-text representation learning. In the future, we will combine various sparse assumptions for high-quality document representations and incorporate graph reasoning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Limitation</head><p>The limitations of SENDIR include the following two points: (1) It has not extended to documentlevel entity-centric relations tasks. Our work is event-centric, and future work extends it with entity-centric cases. Document-level entity-centric RE needs to consider multiple mentions of an entity and different relations in different directions of the same entity pair. (2) It does not bring in external commonsense knowledge. Knowledge can be used to enrich events and improve the accurate ERE.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[ 3 ]</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Vodafone Egypt said some users are continuing to face slight problems due to damage in Telecom', "Egypt's", 'cables which began in central Cairo .
