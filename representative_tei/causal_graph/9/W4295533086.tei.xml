<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Along with the rapid emergence of web surveys to address time-sensitive priority topics, various propensity score (PS)-based adjustment methods have been developed to improve population representativeness for nonprobability-or probability-sampled web surveys subject to selection bias. Conventional PS-based methods construct pseudo-weights for web samples using a higher-quality reference probability sample. The bias reduction, however, depends on the outcome and variables collected in both web and reference samples. A central issue is identifying variables for inclusion in PS-adjustment. In this article, directed acyclic graph (DAG), a common graphical tool for causal studies but largely under-utilized in survey research, is used to examine and elucidate how different types of variables in the causal pathways impact the performance of PS-adjustment. While past literature generally recommends including all variables, our research demonstrates that only certain types of variables are needed in PS-adjustment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Producing timely data is a priority of National Statistics Offices (NSOs). However, some of the more timely data collections, including web-based surveys, may be subject to biases relative to large nationally representative surveys conducted by NSOs due to lower coverage and response rates. Adjusting these timelier sources with less timely but higher quality reference surveys may decrease their biases.</p><p>Selection bias has been acknowledged in different areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Herna ´n 2004)</ref> and is becoming more critical in the big data era with the rapid emergence of various web surveys to address time-sensitive priority topics, referred to here as target samples. Data collected in target samples, such as web panels, can result in attrition and response rates are often found to be 10% or lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baker et al. 2013)</ref>. Although low response is not necessarily produce more timely information than national population surveys. To reduce the potential selection bias in RANDS estimates, NCHS' NHIS has been used as a reference sample to construct pseudo-weights using PS-based weighting methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Parker et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Irimata et al. 2020</ref>) and raking. These adjustments have been applied to the estimation of several population health outcomes, including diagnosed asthma, diagnosed hypertension, diagnosed diabetes, health insurance, as well as for health outcomes related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic such as access to health care. In these studies, adjustment to the NHIS (PS-based weighting or raking) has typically been performed using the main effects for all common covariates between RANDS and the NHIS, including sociodemographic, health, and internet use variables; the adjustment for RANDS during COVID-19 used a limited subset of variables for the public release of COVID-19-related estimates (www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/rands.htm). While PS weighting and raking adjustments have been shown to improve RANDS estimates relative to those without any adjustment to the NHIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Parker et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Irimata et al. 2020)</ref>, stability of the estimated propensity scores and how the inclusion of different variables in the propensity model or calibration affects bias and efficiency of the estimated population mean for various outcomes have been a major concern.</p><p>Propensity model variable inclusion has been widely studied in different areas, including clinical trial or medical research and survey research. In clinical trial research, participants are included for clinical and experimental purposes (mainly for treatment effect estimation) and are not necessarily representative of the U.S. population. Simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brookhart et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leyrat et al. 2013)</ref> were performed to examine the effect of the choice of variables that are included in a propensity model has on the bias, variance, and mean squared error of estimated treatment effects. It was concluded that omitting confounding factors increases bias and the inclusion of variables that are independent of the exposure but related to the outcome in the propensity model gains efficiency without increasing bias of estimated treatment effects. However, covariate inclusion for propensity score models in clinical trial research has been limited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ali et al. (2015)</ref> provided a systematic review of covariate inclusion in the PS model for medical studies and concluded that the quality of reporting variable inclusion is far from optimal in the medical literature. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grose et al. (2020)</ref> found 90% out of 303 systematically reviewed studies did not provide justification for covariates included in their PS models.</p><p>In survey research, propensity analyses have been conducted to estimate response propensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Groves 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Iannacchione et al. 1991)</ref> and to adjust sampling weights in representative surveys to reduce the estimation bias due to unit nonresponse. The best auxiliary variables to be included for nonresponse adjustment are those simultaneously correlated with response propensity and the key survey outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lessler and Kalsbeek 1992)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Little and Vartivarian (2005)</ref> further suggested that most important feature of variables for inclusion is that the variables are predictive of survey outcomes; prediction of response propensity is a secondary, though useful, goal.</p><p>This article, in contrast to the interest of estimating treatment effects in clinical research, aims to estimate population quantities such as the population mean. We are interested in identifying key auxiliary information in a reference probability survey to improve the external validity of inferences from a target data set. This is an important obligation for survey designers because the choice and inclusion of these variables has a tremendous effect on both the bias and the precision of the estimates of population quantities. This differs from the goal of nonresponse adjustment which uses chosen covariates for predicting response propensities as, in nonresponse adjustment research, respondents are nested within the sampled units, and respondents and nonrespondents share common sampling design variables. As a result, unweighted analysis of response propensity can be performed conditional on the design and response predictive variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Little and Vartivarian 2003)</ref>. However, this is not true for estimating the propensity of target sample inclusion because the reference survey and the target samples are often independent without sharing design variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Wang et al. 2021)</ref>. Variable choice for the propensity model used to predict the target sample inclusion propensity should be performed with additional care.</p><p>This article aims to examine how different types of variables included in a propensity model impact the performance of population mean estimation using target samples through the directed acyclic graph (DAG), a common graphical tool in causal studies but largely under-utilized in survey research. The DAG is used to identify certain types of variables in the causal pathway to be included in the PS model which results in the lowest bias and highest precision under various scenarios. Estimated population means and their variances are evaluated analytically and numerically under various mis-specified propensity models, including with and without interactive effects. Different levels of variable correlations in the finite population are considered to mimic real data scenarios. The findings are applied to RANDS, with NHIS as the reference, to estimate the prevalence of asthma in the U.S. The RANDS evaluation demonstrates the advantage of this approach compared to the approach when the propensity model includes all available variables.</p><p>The results from this research provide insight for data analysts on propensity model construction to improve the population representativeness of target samples. It also provides insight for questionnaire designers on the critical auxiliary information to collect from the reference survey. NSOs, using the article results, can design the questionnaires for both the target and reference surveys and release accurate estimates for priority topics from more timely data sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>We first introduce some notation. Suppose Y is a binary outcome of interest (e.g., for estimating the prevalence of a disease or health condition: Y ¼ 1 if event and 0 otherwise). In the context of survey sampling, suppose A is the binary selection indicator variable (i.e., A ¼ 1 if a population unit participates in the target sample and 0 otherwise). Note A indicates the target sample participation with value of one representing population units who are recruited and respond to the survey.</p><p>We adapt the framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brookhart et al. (2006)</ref> of employing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to study potential selection bias induced by three types of covariates (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>):</p><p>1. variables related to both the outcome Y and the selection indictor A of the target sample 2 confounders (X 1 ), 2. variables related to Y but not related to A -outcome predictors (X 2 ), and 3. variables related to A but not related to Y -selection variables (X 3 ).</p><p>We now present some background about PS adjustment methods. For estimation of the finite population (FP) mean of a binary outcome</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E Y ð Þ ¼ p Y ¼ 1 ð Þ,</formula><p>the naı ¨ve unweighted estimate using the selected target sample (A ¼ 1) has bias relative to the FP, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Bias ¼ p Y ¼ 1jA ¼ 1 À Á 2 p Y ¼ 1 ð Þ¼ R 2 1 ð Þp Y ¼ 1 ð Þwith R ¼ p A¼1jY¼1 ð Þ p A¼1 ð Þ .</formula><p>In order to remove the bias, it requires the conditional distribution of A given Y is the same as the distribution of A, denoted by A ' Y and adjustment methods based on PS are often employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Valliant 2020)</ref>.</p><p>More specifically in PS-based adjustment methods, the population mean m of the outcome Y, is estimated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m x ð Þ ¼ 1 X j[S c w j x ð Þ j[S c X w j x ð Þy j ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where S c denotes the set of sample units in the target sample of size n c ; y j for j [ S c and x are, respectively, realized values of the outcome Y and X; the pseudo-weights w j x ð Þ for j [ S c is constructed to balance the distribution in covariates between the target sample and the reference survey. Note X can be a single covariate or a vector of covariates from X 1 -X 3 , and are available in both the target sample and the reference survey, while the outcome variable Y is available in the target sample S c only.</p><p>Various PS-based adjustment methods, including PS weighting and PS matching methods, have been developed under the following assumptions. First, the reference survey sample (in our real data example, the NHIS), through weighting, properly represents the target population of interest. Second, all finite population units have a positive participation rate (i.e., each individual in the population has a positive propensity to volunteer to participate in RANDS panel). Third, conditional exchangeability holds with no unmeasured confounders, that is, the probability for each individual in the FP to participate in the target sample is not related to his/her outcome, after adjusting for all measured variables. It is a common practice that the variables in the target sample are measured using same question wordings as in the reference survey to avoid potential reporting or measurement error.</p><p>While PS weighting and PS matching methods have similar assumptions, PS weighting methods construct the pseudo-weight by the inverse of the inclusion probability conditional on x, that is, Li et al: Variable Inclusion Strategies through DAG matching methods distribute the survey sample weights to target sample units that have similar predicted propensity scores. For example, the KW method <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Wang et al. 2021</ref>) first assigns the sample weight of each survey unit, say unit i, to cohort members proportionally according to kernel distances, defined by propensity scores</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">w j ¼ 1 e x j ð Þ for j [ S c , with e x ð Þ ¼ p A ¼ 1jx À Á , the target sample inclusion probability conditional on x.

As such, most of the sample weight for survey unit i is assigned to those cohort members with similar propensity scores. The assigned portions from survey members to cohort member j are then summed up to form the pseudo-weight w j .</p><p>In Subsections 2.1-2.2, we assume that X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 are mutually independent in the FP and study how the PS-based adjustment methods reduce the bias and variance through the incorporation of different types of variables in the propensity models. We further consider real situations in Subsection 2.3 when different types of variables are correlated in the FP using DAG. Although DAG is a graphical tool developed for causal interpretation, we used it to rule out possible confounding and identify a conditioning covariate set for Y ' A. The actual causation is not important in this context. Subsection 2.4 summarizes some practical guidelines for identifying the variable types in real data and choosing between PS-based methods to construct pseudo-weights when covariates interactively affect the target sample participation and the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Bias of m x ð Þ By Various Types of Covariates</head><p>It is readily shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> that the confounders X 1 induce the bias when we use the simple sample mean to estimate the population mean p Y ¼ 1 ð Þ. Intuitively, the information can be exchanged between the two nodes of A and Y through X 1 , but not X 2 or X 3 . This result is consistent with the bias calculation below. For selection variables</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X ¼ X 3 ð Þor predictors X ¼ X 2 ð Þ , we have R ¼ X x p Y ¼ 1jX ¼ x À Á p A ¼ 1jX ¼ x À Á p X ¼ x ð Þ Â Ã p Y ¼ 1 ð Þ X x p A ¼ 1jX ¼ x À Á p X ¼ x ð Þ Â Ã ¼ 1 and hence Bias ¼ 0:</formula><p>For confounders, however, Bias -0: To correct for the bias induced by X 1 , PS-based adjustment methods create pseudo-weights and reweight the target sample such that the weighted sample distribution of the confounder X 1 is same as that in the FP, that is, X 1 ' A as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. The dotted line denotes the path X 1 -A is blocked (i.e., there is no information exchange between the two nodes) by reweighting the target sample and hence A ' Y.</p><p>As a result, the estimator m x 1 ð Þ withthe set of pseudo-weights w x 1 ð Þ, where x 1 is the realized value of the confounder X 1 , is approximately unbiased. Analogously, it is readily shown that the estimator m with pseudo-weights defined by the inverse of sample inclusion probabilities that balance the x 1 distribution between the target sample and the FP, including e x 1 ; x 2 À Á , e x 1 ; x 3 À Á ; or e x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 À Á , is also unbiased. Note that the three sets of pseudo-weights of w x 1 ; x 2 À Á , w x 1 ; x 3 À Á ; or w x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 À Á balance the x 1 distribution and also the distribution of x 2 , x 3 , or x 2 and x 3 ; respectively, between the target sample S c and the FP <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, pseudo-weights of w x 2 ð Þ; w x 3 ð Þ or w x 2 ; x 3 À Á do not balance the X 1 distribution and therefore the corresponding weighted estimators in Equation (1) are biased.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Variance of m x</head><p>ð Þ By Various Types of Covariates Among the four unbiased estimators based on e x 1 ð Þ, e x 1 ; x 2 À Á , e x 1 ; x 3 À Á ; and e x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 À Á , we compare their efficiencies.

The corresponding pseudo-weighted mean, although adding no bias, loses efficiency due to the differential non-informative pseudo-weights.

V m x 1 ð Þ À Á : Note that the model parameter b x ¼ 0 in Equation (2) if x is an outcome predictor, which does not predict the target sample membership A, such as x 2 in Figure 1a.

The resulting mean estimates are unbiased and most efficient. The inclusion of selection variables in the propensity model, in addition to all confounders, adds no more bias, however, will inflate the variances of the estimates. In contrast, the inclusion of outcome predictors does not inflate the variance while retaining the unbiasedness of the FP mean estimates. A short version of the recommendation for PS-based pseudo-weights construction: include all confounders but avoid selection variables in the propensity model.</p><p>The above justification assumesthe logistic regression model (2) with main effects is true. More rigorous justification is needed when different types of covariates are correlated; propensity models are mis-specified (that is, the logistic regression model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">2</ref>) is not the true model); and the pseudo-weights (i.e., propensity model coefficients) are unknown and have to be estimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Correlation Between Covariates</head><p>We now consider more realistic scenarios in which the confounders, the outcome predictors, and the selection variables can be correlated to each other. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows cases where correlation exists between the pairs X 1 and X 3 , X 1 and X 2 , and X 2 and X 3 , respectively. In addition, any two or all three pairs can be correlated simultaneously in the FP.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(a) (b) (c) X 3 X 3 X 3 A A A Y Y Y X 1 X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 X 2 Fig. 2.

Blocking dotted path(s) to have Y ' A.</formula><p>For unbiased estimation of the FP mean of Y using the target sample (A ¼ 1), we need to block all paths connecting A and Y such that Y ' A. We focus on paths that point to A since in the propensity model we construct weights for the target sample units (with A ¼ 1) so that the weighted target sample and the FP have same distributions in certain covariates X, that is, A ' Xje(X).</p><p>As shown by the dotted lines in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, two paths (indicated by two different types of dotted line) in Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref> and 2c, and one path in Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> are identified and need to be blocked, that is, prevent information flow between A and Y, in order to achieve Y ' A. The backdoor criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pearl 2009</ref>) is a way to rule out confounding via conditioning, and allows identifying the causal effect from A to Y (equal to zero in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, i.e., Y ' A) after conditioning a set of covariates that block the backdoor paths between A and Y. Here, the identified dotted paths in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> are backdoor paths because the arrows point into A (not the opposite direction if arrows point from A towards X 1 -X 3 ). By the backdoor criteria, X 1 blocks the identified paths in Figure <ref type="figure">2a-b</ref>. As follows, we construct PS-based pseudoweights w x 1 ð Þ so that the X 1 distribution in the weighted target sample is same as that in the FP in Figure <ref type="figure">2a-b</ref> when X 1 and X 3 or X 1 and X 2 are correlated (i.e., r x 1 x 3 -0 or r x 1 x 2 -0). Thus, the w x 1 ð Þ -weighted target sample mean of Y is an unbiased estimator of the FP mean. In Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>, X 2 or X 3 , in addition to X 1 , block the two identified paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pearl 2009)</ref>. Following the same logic, pseudo-weights that balance the distributions in X 2 or X 3 , in addition to X 1 , denoted by w x 1 ; x 2 À Á or w x 1 ; x 3 À Á ; should be constructed for the target sample units when the pair of X 2 and X 3 are correlated in Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref> (r x 2 x 3 -0). This result also applies to cases when any two pairs or all three pairs of covariates are simultaneously correlated in the FP, and the w(x 1 ,x 2 )-or w(x 1 ,x 3 )-pseudo-weighted target sample means are approximately unbiased.</p><p>In summary, similar to the scenario shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, in order to block the dotted paths when covariates interactively affect the outcome, PS-based adjustment methods can be applied to construct pseudo-weights that balance the distributions of X 1 (Figure <ref type="figure">2a-b</ref>) and <ref type="figure">2c</ref>) in the pseudo-weighted sample and the FP.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">X 1 ; X 2 À Á or X 1 ; X 3 À Á (Figure</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Practical Guidelines</head><p>In practice, the variable types (confounder, predictor, selection variable) need to be identified for propensity model construction. Since we are not concerned about model interpretation, parametric models with complex functional forms or nonparametric models can be fitted. In our RANDS example (Section 4), both the outcome and propensity models were selected by automatic backward selection methods. Starting from the full model containing all factors and their pairwise interaction terms, we removed the interaction term with the largest p-value and re-fit the model. We continued the iterations until all p-values of the interaction terms were less than 0.05. For each interaction, complex survey designs were accounted for in the logistic regression analysis using the svyglm() function in the R survey package <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lumley 2020)</ref>. The main effects with p-values greater than 0.05 were removed only if they were not involved in any of significant interaction terms. As results, each type of variables is identified: confounders are common terms in both the selected propensity and the outcome models; the selection variables (or predictors) are those selected in the propensity (or outcome) model only. Note that each type of variables may contain multiple variables as well as their nonlinear or nonadditive functions (e.g., pairwise interactions) in the final outcome and the propensity models.</p><p>Alternative model selection criteria can be employed, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lumley and Scott 2015)</ref> to identify variable types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yang et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2018)</ref> have also proposed variable selection methods, including penalized estimating equations or LASSO regression, which can be used to identify variable types for inclusion in the PS model. In the case where the outcome of interest is not available in the reference probability sample or the outcome has not yet been collected in the target sample, subject matter literature and knowledge may have to be used to assign the covariate types. Variable type identification is critical in practice and comparing different model selection methods to create the final models is of future research interest.</p><p>The true propensity model of the underlying selection mechanism of the target sample (A ¼ 1) is often unknown but complicated, which may involve covariate terms of higher orders of nonlinearity and/or nonadditivity. For example, X 1 and X 2 (or X 1 and X 3 ) can interactively affect the outcome Y (or selection indicator A), the scenario considered in simulation study 3 (to be shown in Section 3). In order to estimate the propensity scores accurately to achieve the covariate balance so that the condition of Y ' A holds, data analysts need to be careful in choosing the PS-based adjustment methods among PS weighting or matching methods based on parametric models such as logistic regression and nonparametric methods such as machine learning.</p><p>For example, PS weighting methods (such as the ALP) can be sensitive to model misspecification <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al. 2020a</ref>). ALP-weighted target sample distributions match the FP distributions when the assumed propensity model is true. For instance, ALP pseudo-weights that are constructed based on the propensity model of A on X 1 , X 3 , and their interaction X 1* X 3 , produce unbiased estimators. The estimators, however, are biased if the model is misspecified, for example, the interaction term is omitted from the propensity model.</p><p>In contrast, PS matching methods construct weights by matching target sample units with reference sample units using the estimated propensity scores, followed by distributing reference sample weights to target sample units with similar propensities. It has been well recognized that PS matching, compared to PS weighting methods, is more robust to model misspecification <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al. 2020a</ref>). In our limited simulation studies, it is shown that the balance in covariate distributions between the KW-weighted sample and the FP can be achieved as long as the blocking variables, that is, X 1 in Figure <ref type="figure">2a-b</ref>; X 1 and X 3 or X 1 and X 2 in Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>, are included (with or without X 1* X 3 interaction) in the propensity model (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). For complicated propensity models with higher orders of interactions and/or nonlinearity, including only the main effects of the blocking variables in the propensity model by KW methods might not be sufficient. Nonparametric modeling such as machine learning methods maybe promising <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kern et al. 2021</ref>) in identifying nonlinear or nonadditive relationships of covariates with the target sample selection.</p></div>

Recall KW is a type of PS matching method and expected to be more robust to model misspecification compared to the ALP method. As expected, the KW method consistently yields approximately unbiased estimates across four propensity models with or without interaction terms. In the contrast, the ALP approach directly uses the inverse of the participation rates estimated from the assumed propensity model as pseudo-weights, and the ALP estimates are approximately unbiased only under the true propensity model w(x 1* x 3 Þ. Furthermore, it can be observed that biases of the ALP estimates are consistently closer to zero than the KW under the true model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Real Data Analysis</head><p>RANDS, a series of web-based probability panel surveys conducted at NCHS (<ref type="url" target="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/rands">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/rands</ref>), has been used for methodological research and, more recently, for providing early experimental estimates on the COVID-19 pandemic. RANDS has the capability to collect data quickly and is less costly than traditional national household surveys, but is subject to potential selection biasdue to low response rates. Adjustment methods to construct pseudo-weights, including propensity-score based methods, are applied to balance the covariate distributions in the target sample and the FP, and are an important component of the RANDS program. We consider the simulation findings from this article for selecting PS-model covariates to estimate the national prevalence of asthma compared to NCHS' NHIS. Data from the third round of RANDS (RANDS 3) is evaluated. RANDS 3 was collected in 2019 using NORC's AmeriSpeakw Panel (<ref type="url" target="https://amerispeak.norc.org">https://amerispeak.norc.org</ref>) and included responses from 2,646 panelists aged 18 years and older. RANDS 3 panelists were surveyed via web and were asked questions related to general and mental health, medical conditions, opioid use, and pain. The RANDS 3 cumulative response rate was 18.1%. The RANDS 3 original panel weights were developed by the inverse of the probability of inclusion in the AmeriSpeakw Panel, subject to nonresponse adjustment and poststratification adjustment to external population totals of age, sex, education, race/ ethnicity, housing tenure, telephone status, and Census Division (National Center for Health Statistics 2020). The original panel-weighted estimate of diagnosed asthma (ever been told you had asthma) in RANDS 3 was 16.86% (standard error ¼ 0.98%). For comparison, the unweighted estimate of diagnosed asthma in RANDS 3 was 16.40% (standard error ¼ 0.72%). The 2019 NHIS (n ¼ 31,997) is evaluated as the gold standard. The NHIS (<ref type="url" target="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis</ref>) is a cross-sectional household interview survey that collects information on a broad range of health topics, primarily through faceto-face interviews. The NHIS sample adult file, which is a collection of responses from one randomly selected adult per selected household, was used to evaluate the prevalence of ever having asthma among adults. The percentage of adults who ever had asthma based on the 2019 NHIS (n ¼ 31,997) was 13.46% (standard error ¼ 0.25%).</p><p>Common covariates available in RANDS 3 and the 2019 NHIS that were potentially related to diagnosed asthma or the selection indicator were considered (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). All percent estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> (when expressed as proportions) meet the NCHS data presentation standards for proportions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Parker et al. 2017)</ref>. As observed, demographic variables of age, sex and race/ethnicity have similar weighted distributionsin the RANDS and NHIS. This result is as expected, since these variables are poststratification variables used to construct the sample (or original panel) weights in both NHIS and RANDS. As observed, persons with higher levels of education, with selected health conditions (i.e., diagnosed high cholesterol, diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, or chronic bronchitis, diagnosed diabetes, and diagnosed hypertension), who are current or former smokers, or who are not married (with the exception of those who are widowed) participated in RANDS at a higher rate compared to the NHIS. Since the percent of missing values across all considered variables was relatively low for both data sources, ranging from 0%-0.68% for RANDS and 0%-2.64% for NHIS (unweighted), missing values were excluded for evaluation.</p><p>To check for correlation between covariates, bivariate correlations were assessed on the weighted NHIS data. Bivariate correlations for all selected covariates were statistically significant. Prior to evaluating the propensity models, the survey weights for both data sets were normalized to their respective sample sizes (n ¼ 2,646 for RANDS, n ¼ 31,997 for NHIS) as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wang et al. (2021)</ref>. The KW method was implemented for demonstration to construct RANDS pseudo-weights that adjust for potential selection bias due to differential non-response and under-coverage of some groups on the sample frame using the NHIS data as the reference dataset.</p><p>A full propensity model (denoted by model. all) that includes all covariates and their pairwise interactions was used to create pseudo-weights. Due to the large number of parameters in the full model, estimated propensity scores can be unstable. As a result, some form of stepwise propensity model selection methods have been conducted in different studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Weitzen et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Austin 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2020a</ref>), using the combined target sample and the reference sample to identify significant terms out of the full propensity model. In the framework of our article, the combination of the confounders and selection predictors (i.e., model.x13 which contains X 1 and X 3 ), which can be main effects of covariates or their nonlinear/nonadditive combinations such as pairwise interactions, are recommended as terms for inclusion. Based on the simulation results, we expect that the pseudo-weighted mean under model.x13 would be unbiased but with higher variability when compared withthe estimates under model.x12 that includes the confounders and outcome predictors.</p><p>Accordingly, we conducted the outcome model selection using backward selection on the reference survey (e.g., the 2019 NHIS), to identify terms which were confounders or outcome predictors. We defined the selected model as model.x12.n (contains X 1 and X 2 ) with "n" indicating that the outcome predictors were identified using the NHIS. However, Smoking status: Current smoker is defined as someone who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and now smokes every day or some days. Former smoker is defined as someone who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and now does not smoke. Never smokers are defined as persons who have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.</p><p>it is often the case that the reference probability surveys have no collected information on the outcome variable. In this case, we have only the target sample (e.g., RANDS) available for outcome model selection. With the assumption of the conditional noninformative sampling of the target sample, it is expected the unweighted regression of the outcome would produce unbiased estimates of regression coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Korn and Graubard 1999)</ref> The outcome models utilized the observations in the NHIS or the RANDS, whereas the propensity model utilized the observations in the combined NHIS and RANDS data, from which the estimated propensities were obtained and used for construction of the KW pseudo-weight for each individual in RANDS. Note that RANDS has panel weights, which were computed as an overall sampling weight for the selection of each panel member from the sampling frame and the selection of the panel member into RANDS. We considered two scenarios of (1) panel weights or (2) no panel weights for the propensity analysis.</p><p>Various propensity models that included different types of covariates were evaluated by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the KW pseudo-weights (CV ¼ sd KW ð Þ=mean KW ð Þ with sd denoting standard deviation), relative bias ðrelBias ¼ mRANDS 2 mNHIS mNHIS £ 100%Þ; standard error (se), and mean squared error (MSE ¼ mRANDS 2 mNHIS À Á 2 þse 2 mRANDS À Á ). The relative bias was calculated as the estimated asthma prevalence in RANDS relative to the NHIS estimate where the RANDS estimate, mRANDS ; was calculated using the KW pseudo-weights produced from the various propensity models. The standard error se mRANDS À Á considered the variability due to estimating the propensity scores, sampling, kernel weighting, as well as differential pseudo-weights by the Taylor linearization method <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al. 2020b)</ref>. For comparison purposes, we also report the relative bias, standard error, and MSE of the original panel-weighted and unweighted estimates of asthma prevalence in RANDS 3. Results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>.</p><p>Four observations can be made from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Firstly, all 12 (panel-weighted or unweighted) propensity-adjusted estimates perform better, with a smaller MSE (or relative bias), compared to the original panel-weighted RANDS estimate of asthma prevalence without PS adjustment. When the RANDS panel weights are considered in the propensity analysis, the standard errors tend to be inflated, relative to those in the lower pane, due to more variable KW pseudo-weights with their CVs ranging from 1.07-1.13 (see the upper pane) versus 0.69-0.83 (see the lower pane). Accordingly, observations 2 -4 focus on the results in the lower panel when the panel weights are not used to construct KW pseudoweights. Secondly, consistent with our expectations, the propensity models that contain confounders and selection variables, that is, Model.x13, produce larger estimated variances compared with Model.x12 irrespective of the outcome predictors being selected from RANDS or the NHIS (e.g., se ¼ 0.97 vs. 0.81-0.84). Thirdly, comparing the estimates under the propensity models containing the confounders and outcome predictors that are selected using NHIS data (i.e., Model.x12.n) vs. the RANDS data (i.e., Model.x12.r), similar relative bias, se and MSE are observed (relBias ¼ 11.38 versus 11.37; se ¼ 0.81 versus 0.84, MSE ¼ 3.01 versus 3.04). Lastly, the relative biases under Model.x1 are somewhat larger than that under <ref type="bibr">Model.x12 (relBias ¼ 13.67 versus 11.38 or 13.44 versus 11.37)</ref>. This result could be due to the existing correlation between the confounders and the outcome predictors. Adjusting for confounders only may not be sufficient for maximum bias reduction.</p><p>In brief, for the evaluation of diagnosed asthma using the RANDS data, we would recommend the pseudo-weights constructed under Model.x12.n with the confounders and predictors selected from the reference survey (e.g., NHIS). In situations where outcome variables are not collected in the reference survey but available only in the target sample (e.g., RANDS), Model.x12.r can be the alternative model to construct the KW pseudo-weights, assuming conditional noninformative sampling holds for the target sample. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Identifying and collecting the best information on more timely target sample and on higher quality reference surveys can increase the ability of NSOs to produce timely estimates with lower bias from target samples. This article examined how different types of variables that are included in a propensity model impact the performance of PS-based pseudo-weighted estimators for population mean estimation from a target sample. Means and variances of estimated population means under various mis-specified propensity models, including different types of variables with and without interactive effects, were evaluated analytically and numerically. Different levels of variable correlations in the finite population were also considered to reflect real data scenarios. We have the following findings: (1) confounders, the variables related to both the selection indicator and the outcome of interest, are important variables to include in the propensity model; (2) pseudo-weights that balance the distributions in the outcome predictor x 2 or the selection variable x 3 , in addition to the confounder x 1 , denoted by w x 1 ; x 2 À Á or w x 1 ; x 3 À Á ; should be constructed for the target sample units so that the corresponding pseudo-weighted target sample mean is approximately unbiased; (3) compared to w x 1 ; x 3 À Á , the pseudo-weights w x 1 ; x 2 À Á gain more efficiency in estimating population means. In contrast, the inclusion of selection variables, compared to the outcome predictors, in the propensity model tended to inflate the estimated variances. Intuitively, the outcome predictor is related to the outcome variable; including outcome predictors in the propensity score model distinguishes differences between the outcome in the reference and target samples, which results in weights related to outcome and therefore yields estimates with smaller variance estimates. Finally, findings are applied to real target data from RANDS, a survey that uses commercial probability panels, which has potential selection bias. Under the model with confounders and outcome predictors (Model.x12) or model with confounders and selection variables (Model.x13), the RANDS estimate of U.S. asthma prevalence had the greatest bias reduction (relative bias ranging from 11.37% 2 13.51% compared to the NHIS) when the panel weights are not used to construct KW pseudo-weights, compared to the original panel-weighted RANDS estimates (relative bias of 25.31%).</p><p>Results from this articlehave several important applications in practice for NSOs that collect data from both target surveys and high-quality reference surveys. First, this study provides a principled approach to select covariates for the PS model. Rather than including all variables or selecting certain demographic variables, covariates are assessed based on their variable type (confounder, outcome predictor, selection variable) to be included in the PS model for population mean estimation. Second, guidance on how to design the questionnaire for a target survey with specific research questions (e.g., SARS-CoV2 seropositivity web survey by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kalish et al. 2021</ref>) is provided to survey practitioners. The attributes that are most effective in reducing bias/variances of estimates can be collected and used to reduce potential selection bias for the purpose of timely data collection and minimum response burden. Third, the findings from this study can be used for future development of a high-quality probability survey, including the planning of covariates to collect through paradata or the survey questionnaire with minimized measurement/ reporting error, to be used as a high-quality reference survey by various nonprobability or web-based probability surveys with selection bias.</p><p>The proposed variable inclusion strategies have limitations that can be of interest for future research. First, the strategy is developed for single-outcome studies with research questions related to one outcome of interest, for example, SARS-CoV2 seropositivity study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kalish et al. 2021)</ref>. The target sample was collected in a web survey with questions related to COVID-19 infection only. For studies with multiple key outcome variables, it would be of interest to study how the correlation among outcome variables, the overlap for each variable type across outcomes, and their interplays affect population mean estimation by different variable inclusion strategies. Second, in our simulation, we demonstrated the use of a PS matching method (KW) and a PS weighting method numerically. It showed that KW produced approximately unbiased estimates when the analytic propensity model is slightly mis-specified (without the interaction term) while the PS weighting methods require the true propensity model to obtain unbiased estimates. In practice, the underlying selection mechanism of the target sample is often complicated, involving higher orders of nonlinearity and/or nonadditivity. For complicated propensity models, only including main or interactive effects of blocking variables in the logistic model by KW methods may not be sufficient. Nonparametric modeling such as machine learning methods may be promising <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kern et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Third, the focus of this articlewas one valuating the bias and variance reduction of Horvitz-Thompson estimators of FP mean by the types of covariates in the propensity model and thus we did not study how the pseudo-weights, when combined with different estimators, affect the FP mean estimation. Alternative analysis methods, such as doubly robust estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al. 2018)</ref> or augmented estimation equations in the missing data imputation context <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Robins et al. 1994</ref>) can be employed, after identifying the appropriate type of variables to include in the propensity score model. Fourth, selection bias in target samples, compared to more rigorous probability samples, can be induced by low response, different question wording/ordering, topic salience for different types of questions (for example health and health conditions can have large selection bias as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). It would be interesting to study how the proposed variable inclusion strategy can be adapted to reduce the selection bias in target samples with different response rates, question order/ wording and salience effects. Lastly, in our data example the backward selection is employed for identifying the type of variables. It would be interesting to employ and compare alternative variable selection methods such as AIC or BIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lumley and Scott 2015)</ref> that incorporate complex sample designs for the model selection.</p></div>

As follows, outcome model variable selection was conducted based on the unweighted outcome regression of the RANDS data, and the selected model included both confounders and outcome predictors, denoted by model.x12.r (contains X 1 and X 2 ) indicating that the outcome predictors were identified using RANDS. The common terms in model.x13 and model.x12 (denoted by either x12.n or x12.r based on the information available) are confounders, and the corresponding propensity model is denoted by model.x1. The identified covariate types under each model are reported in the Appendix (Section 6). Due to the correlation between x1, x2 and x3, we expect estimates under model.x1, albeit efficient, may not remove as much bias as under the model.x12 or model.x13.</figDesc><table /></figure>
