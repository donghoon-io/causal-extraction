<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We study the problem of learning fair prediction models for unseen test sets distributed differently from the train set. Stability against changes in data distribution is an important mandate for responsible deployment of models. The domain adaptation literature addresses this concern, albeit with the notion of stability limited to that of prediction accuracy. We identify sufficient conditions under which stable models, both in terms of prediction accuracy and fairness, can be learned. Using the causal graph describing the data and the anticipated shifts, we specify an approach based on feature selection that exploits conditional independencies in the data to estimate accuracy and fairness metrics for the test set. We show that for specific fairness definitions, the resulting model satisfies a form of worst-case optimality. In context of a healthcare task, we illustrate the advantages of the approach in making more equitable decisions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Deployment of machine learning algorithms to aid consequential decisions, such as in medicine, criminal justice, and employment, require revisiting the dominant paradigms of training and testing such algorithms. Particularly, the assumption that the data distribution in training and deployment will be the same is not always warranted. Examples of the impact of distribution shift can be found in medical imaging tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, where the algorithms trained on one chest radiography dataset performed poorly on other datasets. Similarly, Nestor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> find that models for critical care tasks degraded in performance over time resulting from changes in the instrumentation of the electronic health records. Given the safetycritical nature of the decisions, the decision-making process should account for these shifts in distributions to ensure high predictive accuracy of the algorithms.</p><p>Many methods exist to learn under distribution shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, including recent work from a causal inference perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Such methods have significant appeal since they allow learning accurate models for arbitrary shifts, including those in unseen future data. This is achieved by exploiting causally-relevant factors in data that are generalizable to unseen test sets, as opposed to fitting to the factors specific to the training sets. However, the focus of the methods has been on average case prediction performance alone. In certain circumstances, while high predictive accuracy is a necessary requirement, decisions made using the algorithms should also not lead to or perpetuate past disparities among groups in the data. Without any design changes, algorithmic solutions for mitigating distribution shifts that do not account for disparities in training data can result in disparate impact while predicting under distribution shifts. We discuss a concrete example later.</p><p>At the same time, most work in algorithmic fairness addresses the setting with a single learning task (or domain) under the assumption that the data distribution does not change between train and test settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Under this assumption, minimizing classification risk along with constraints on the fairness metric in training data is likely to generalize to identically distributed test data. Thinking about shifts in fair machine learning is also important though, since deployment of a (fair) decision-making tool might affect what data is collected in future (e.g. selectively policing locations with high predicted risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>), or might incentivize individuals to strategically adapt their features for favourable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, thus, causing distribution shift. In addition, due to data-scarcity, such as in medical decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, the models may be applied to newer settings (such as hospitals) than the ones seen during training. The issue of ensuring fairness when deployment environment differs from the training one has received little attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Due to the variety of train-test shifts that can occur, conceptualizing and addressing the problem has been challenging.</p><p>Our contributions. We address the problem of learning fair models under mismatch in train-test distributions when either limited or no data is available from the test distribution. We consider the setup of causal domain adaptation where possible shifts are expressed using causal graphs with the goal of learning models with stable performance under the specified shifts. Our main contribution is to formulate the fair learning problem in this setup and provide sufficient conditions that enable estimation of model accuracy and fairness metrics in the test domain. For a subset of covariate shifts and for several well-known group-fairness metrics, we show that the resulting solution is worst-case optimal. We operationalize the sufficient conditions in an algorithm based on a reduction to the standard fair learning problem. Finally, we present a case study on a medical decision-making task which demonstrates applicability of the approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Domain adaptation and fair machine learning are both widely studied problems. Thus, we primarily focus the discussion on literature at their intersection.</p><p>Fairness. A number of fairness metrics have been proposed that make different normative statements on the machine learning models' output (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> for a review). Depending on the application context, different metrics might be appropriate or mandatory by law <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Consequently, fairness methods have been developed to build/modify models that satisfy different fairness criteria. We focus on a class of methods that pose the problem as that of constrained optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Domain adaptation. The seminal work of Ben-David et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> relates the target domain error to the source domain error and the distance between the distributions. This inspired many domain adaptation methods based on adversarial training of representations to align the distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. One drawback is that the methods require some data from test distribution while training. When causal structure of the domains is known, recent work on causal domain adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref> identify predictors with stable accuracy under unseen changes in distribution. To accomplish this, the methods exploit the principle of invariance of causal mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 1.3</ref>] that says -interventions (or shifts) in certain mechanisms in the graph keep the other mechanisms unchanged. The invariant mechanisms can be used to build stable predictors. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, we adopt a setting where a causal graph specifies anticipated distribution shifts and no target domain data is given (but can be used if available). The goal is to construct predictors that are invariant to all anticipated shifts, without necessarily observing the corresponding data. The setting is particularly well-suited for consequential decision-making where we want to proactively guard against shifts that may result in harm, before deploying the model and collecting target data. However, none of these methods consider the possibility of unfair outcomes after adaptation.</p><p>Fairness and domain adaptation. On multiple benchmark datasets, Friedler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> found that fair machine learning methods showed high variance in achieved accuracy and fairness on randomly split train-test sets. To mitigate this, Huang and Vishnoi <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> propose adding a regularization term to the constrained ERM problem that guarantees stability. However, the term stability is used for changes in the fairness metric as a training data sample is removed/added, as opposed to changes under different distributions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, authors propose algorithms for generalisation of fairness constraints but to an i.i.d. test set. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, the authors propose learning feature representations, using adversarial training, which result in fair classifiers when trained on the representations. They do not address changes in distribution of the features (and their representations) across domains.</p><p>In the same setup as ours under the assumption of covariate shift but with the availability of unlabelled target data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> give weighting-based estimators and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> take a robust optimization approach. Other works that assume some labelled data from the target domain include <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> learns a representation from multiple domains with guarantees on generalization to the target domain, but requires labelled target data to fine-tune classifiers and a low-rank assumption that constrains dis-similarity between the domains. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, authors restrict to shifts in feature means and propose ways to flag a potentially unfair model under such shifts. Further, concurrent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> posits a set of test distributions defined as weighted combinations of the training data, and find a fair classifier minimizing the worst loss across such distributions. Instead, we rely on distributional assumptions expressed using a causal graph. Considering the causal structure of the problem allows the modeller to express plausible distribution shifts more intuitively by denoting the mechanisms, instead of the statistical properties, that can change. It also guides the construction of estimators that are robust against shifts of arbitrary magnitude rather than only the shifts in the observed datasets.</p><p>Our work is related in spirit to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> who consider building fair models from 'biased' training data. Here, we provide a complementary set of results on fairness under train-test distribution mismatch, avoiding assumptions on specific generative processes for the shift. Instead we use causal graphs to make weaker assumptions on where the mismatch is. This allows us to give a general characterization of the addressable mismatch settings. Moreover, at a conceptual level, our focus is on addressing mismatch with multiple future test sets rather than a biased training set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROBLEM SETUP</head><p>Let us denote all the variables associated with the system being modelled as V := (X, 𝐴, 𝑌 ), where 𝐴 is the sensitive attribute, X is a non-empty set of covariates other than 𝐴, and 𝑌 is an outcome of interest. We will consider a binary sensitive attribute, 𝐴 ∈ {a, d} (i.e. advantaged and disadvantaged group), and the binary classification case, thus, 𝑌 ∈ {0, 1}. For simplicity of exposition, consider the case with only two domains -a source and a target -with joint probability distributions 𝑃 source and 𝑃 target , respectively. Crucially, the two distributions may be different (e.g. data from two hospitals with different care practices). Bold letters are used for vectors, uppercase for random variables, and lowercase for instantiations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Fair classifier</head><p>Consider that the classifier is built from the feature (sub)set S ⊆ {X, 𝐴} and outputs the binary prediction 𝑓 (S) ∈ {0, 1}. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> We will operate in the empirical risk minimization framework for learning classifiers and introduce additional fairness constraints in the objective to control the inter-group disparity, a commonly-used approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. Each constraint is given by some function 𝐺 of the prediction, outcome, and features. Denote the constraint by 𝐺 (𝑓 (S), (𝑌, S)) ≤ 𝜖 with (𝑌 , S) ∼ 𝑃 target (𝑌, S) and some hyperparameter 𝜖 ≥ 0 allowing for approximate fairness. If there are multiple constraints, we write the set of constraints succinctly as G(𝑓 , 𝑃 target ) ≤ 𝝐. Note that the desired fairness constraint G is assumed to be the same in both the domains. The classification error i.e. probability of a misclassification is written as 𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 ). Then, the fair domain adaptation (DA) problem amounts to finding a minimizer</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[Fair DA] 𝑓 * target := arg min 𝑓 ∈ F (S) {𝑃 target (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 ) : G(𝑓 , 𝑃 target ) ≤ 𝝐 }<label>(1)</label></formula><p>i.e. a function 𝑓 * target in the set of learnable functions F (S) of features S that minimizes classification error as well as satisfies fairness constraints.</p><p>Fairness metrics. We will focus on group-fairness metrics defined based on some notion of parity across groups. These have received much attention in the fair machine learning literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> due to the relative ease of communicating their implications to stakeholders and the ease of computing them from observational data. We define two more metrics derived from EO. If we condition only on 𝑌 = 1, the resulting metric is known as true positive rate equality (TPR), or more commonly equality of opportunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Similarly, for 𝑌 = 0, the metric is known as true negative rate equality (TNR).</p><p>Solving (1) requires estimating the error 𝑃 target (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 ) and the fairness constraint G(𝑓 , 𝑃 target ). Given enough samples from 𝑃 target , standard fair learning methods e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> return a solution. But, this is not possible in the Fair DA setting, as we do not have access to the complete target data. Thus, the central question we ask is: Under what assumptions can we still find 𝑓 * target ? For arbitrary distribution shifts, it is not possible to answer this question in affirmative. With background knowledge of how the distributions differ, past work provides methods to bound the target domain error. Crucially, such methods still do not guarantee target domain fairness and using fairness constraints from the source domain, naturally, does not solve (1). Through the following example, we illustrate that these design choices can significantly affect accuracy and fairness of the models. It also shows how the causal inference framework for domain adaptation allows for the specification of shifts and design of predictors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">An illustrative example.</head><p>Consider a simplified version of the flu diagnosis task from <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The associated data generating process is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref>. Flu status 𝑌 of a person is to be predicted from three measurements {𝑇 , 𝑅, 𝐴}. The disease has two known causes 𝑅 and 𝐴, say virus-exposure risk and age group (indicating adult or child) respectively. In addition, a noisy yet predictive symptom of flu is observed as 𝑇 , say body temperature, which is expressed differently depending on the age group. A categorical variable 𝐶 indicates different data collection sites (the domains) which differ on (i) how well the temperature is measured, e.g. self-reported vs. clinician-tested (𝐶 → 𝑇 ), and (ii) the proportion of demographics across sites (𝐶 → 𝐴). Suppose, a classifier Ŷ is to be built using data from a single site (source domain) and used in multiple sites (target domains) to allocate scarce healthcare resources (testing kits, medical consultation) to individuals. The model designer would like to mitigate differential error rates across age groups and chooses to use EO as the fairness constraint while learning Ŷ .</p><p>We compare three ways of designing the model that account differently for the possibility of shift and unfairness. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1b,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref> show results from a simulation, discussed in detail in Section 6.2. As we vary the magnitude of distribution shift between the sites, the Standard classifier, built by regressing 𝑌 on {𝑇 , 𝑅, 𝐴} from source data degrades in accuracy (blue curve) on target data. By accounting for the shift, CausalDA, a domain adaptation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> that only uses the features {𝑅, 𝐴}, remains stable (orange curve). Surprisingly, domain adaptation leads to higher levels of fairness violations, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref>. To mitigate this we would want to learn CausalDA with fairness constraints which is complicated, as discussed earlier, since we cannot evaluate the constraints for unseen target domains. However, following the method proposed in Section 5, learning CausalDA with fairness constraints on the source domain (red curve) retains both the desired propertiesconsistently high accuracy and low unfairness. Thus, the example illustrates the need to consider fairness constraints while adapting for the shifts.</p><p>Next, we describe the joint causal graphs in more detail that allow us to represent the potential shifts, followed by our main results on learning fair and stable predictors under specific shifts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">JOINT CAUSAL INFERENCE AND DOMAIN ADAPTATION</head><p>Following recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>, we consider a joint causal graph which represents the data distribution for all domains. This allows us to reason about the invariant distributions under shifts, which is key to addressing the fair domain adaptation problem. Assume that all the source and the target domains are characterized by a set of variables V, which are observed under different    contexts (e.g. experimental settings) particular to each domain. Joint Causal Inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sec. 3</ref>] framework provides a way of representing the data generating process for all domains as a single causal graph representing an underlying causal model. In addition to the system variables V, the framework introduces an additional set of exogenous variables, named context variables C , that represent the modeler's knowledge of how the domains differ from one another (given by the causal relations among the system and context variables). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> We include the formal definition of JCI framework in Appendix D along with the necessary assumptions on faithfulness, and Markov property. For the example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref>, system variables are {𝑇 , 𝑅, 𝐴, 𝑌 }. With a binary context variable 𝐶, 𝑃 (𝑇 , 𝑅, 𝐴, 𝑌 | 𝐶 = 0) and 𝑃 (𝑇 , 𝑅, 𝐴, 𝑌 | 𝐶 = 1) correspond to joint distributions for the two domains, source and target. More generally, setting context variable to a particular value, say C = c, can be seen as an intervention that results in the data distribution for a domain 𝑃 (V | C = c). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>A class of causal domain adaptation problems is to learn a predictor that generalizes to different target data distributions which correspond to different settings of the context variables in the causal graph. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, authors propose learning a predictor using only a subset of the features that guarantee invariance of the outcome distribution conditional on the chosen feature subset. More specifically, if V = (X, 𝐴, 𝑌 ) and C are the context variables, the desired subset of features S ⊆ {X, 𝐴} satisfies 𝑌 ⊥ ⊥ C | S, implying that the conditional distribution of outcome 𝑌 given the features S is invariant to the effect of domain changes. The set S is referred to as a separating set as it d-separates 𝑌 and C in the joint causal graph. This criterion generalizes the covariate shift criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, which assumes independence between 𝑌 and 𝐶 conditioned on all the features. Note that the separating set criterion excludes graphs where C directly causes 𝑌 , known as label shift. The predictor using the separating set satisfies a desirable optimality property. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, it has the lowest mean squared loss against any distribution having the same outcome distribution 𝑌 | S as in the source.</p><p>However, using a separable set in itself does not guarantee fairness. For example, separating sets for Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref> are S ∈ {{𝐴}, {𝐴, 𝑅}}. But neither satisfies the condition required for EO, in general, i.e. 𝑓 (S) ⊥ ⊥ 𝐴 | 𝑌 . Thus, to ensure both invariance and fairness, we restrict our search space in Fair DA (1) to F (S), i.e. the set of predictors built using the separating set S. Next, we describe the assumptions that allow us to solve this problem. All proofs are included in Appendices A-C in the supplemental material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">FAIR DOMAIN ADAPTATION</head><p>Now, we return to our problem of finding fair classifiers for the target domain and describe how the joint causal graph helps in solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In the context variable notation, we are interested in finding arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑓 ∈ F (S) {𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 |𝐶 = 1) : G(𝑓 , 𝑃 (𝑌, S|𝐶 = 1)) ≤ 𝝐 }</formula><p>where 𝐶 = 1 represents the target domain. We start by noting the need for further assumptions.</p><p>Proposition 1. Fair DA problem (1) is not solvable in general without further assumptions.</p><p>Proposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> follows by the impossibility results on domain adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Even when domain adaptation is possible, i.e. target domain error is identifiable (uniquely estimable in terms of source domain distribution), the fairness constraint is not guaranteed to be identifiable. We make this point by constructing an example with group-specific measurement error in features.</p><p>Thus, the natural question is under what conditions on distributions and assumptions on data availability can we identify the error 𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 |𝐶 = 1) and the fairness constraint G(𝑓 , 𝑃 (𝑌 , S|𝐶 = 1)). We make the following two assumptions for the selected features S ⊆ {X, 𝐴} for the classifier. For example, the condition for DP asserts that the characteristics (in terms of features S) of the sensitive groups are invariant across domains. Similarly, the condition for EO says that feature distribution for groups defined by the label and the sensitive attribute is invariant across domains. This ensures that we can evaluate (and hence balance) the corresponding fairness constraint irrespective of the domain.</p><p>Next, we consider two scenarios to state the quality of the solution that can be found under the two assumptions -(i) when labelled source and unlabelled target domain data is available, alternatively, (ii) when only the labelled source domain data is available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Fair domain adaptation with limited target domain data</head><p>Proposition 2. Given Assumptions 1 and 2 hold, then using only labelled source and unlabelled target data, the Fair DA problem (1) can be solved exactly by a data re-weighting method.</p><p>Proof sketch. This follows since the error is invariant, i.e. 𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 |S, 𝐶 = 1) = 𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 |S, 𝐶 = 0), due to Assumption 1. This implies that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E 𝑌 ,S (𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 |S, 𝐶 = 1)) = E 𝑌 ,S (𝑤 (S) × 𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 |S, 𝐶 = 0))</formula><p>where weights, 𝑤 (S) = 𝑃 (S|𝐶 = 1)/𝑃 (S|𝐶 = 0), are the ratio of feature densities. Under Assumption 2, the fairness constraint is invariant, i.e. G(𝑓 , 𝑃 (𝑌, S|𝐶 = 1)) = G(𝑓 , 𝑃 (𝑌, S|𝐶 = 0)). To solve (1), we find arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑓 ∈ F (S) {𝑤 (S)𝑃 (𝑓 (S) ≠ 𝑌 |𝐶 = 0) : G(𝑓 , 𝑃 (𝑌, S|𝐶 = 0)) ≤ 𝝐 } .</formula><p>Both the error and the constraint are estimable as we have labelled source data sampled from 𝑃 (𝑌, S|𝐶 = 0). The remaining term is the density ratio 𝑤 (S) used to re-weight the error.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Practicality of assumptions</head><p>Assumptions 1 and 2 together describe the types of shifts that our approach can address. Graphically, these are characterized as (a) shifts with causal paths to 𝑌 which all include 𝐴 (i.e. 𝐶• • • →𝐴→ • • •𝑌 with all arrows toward 𝑌 ), and (b) shifts with non-causal paths to 𝑌 (i.e. 𝐶• • • →𝑀← • • •𝑌 for some feature 𝑀 ∈ S). This means that any shift causing change in the distribution of the sensitive attribute as well as any shift in variables with a non-causal path to 𝑌 can be addressed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref> gives an example of both the cases (described in more detail in Appendix F). Shifts in distribution of sensitive attribute are common when there is sample selection bias e.g. patient demographics being different between rural and urban hospitals. In Section 6.4, we demonstrate a general class of shifts in medical diagnosis tasks where both the assumptions are satisfied. Finally, we note that the assumptions (barring those for DP) are untestable without access to labelled target data. The reason for untestability is the same as that for no unmeasured confoundingwe do not observe the (counterfactual) target data, and hence cannot test for conditional independence. Thus, background knowledge of plausible shifts are critical.</p></div>

We assume that the following are given -a causal graph for the system of interest G and data from a source domain D source = {(X 𝑖 , 𝐴 𝑖 , 𝑌 𝑖 )} 𝑛 𝑖=1 . The steps, outlined in Algorithm 1, are as follows. (a) Iterate over all feature subsets to rank them in increasing order of their empirical error on the source domain. (b) Starting from the feature set with the least error, check for Assumptions 1 and 2 using 𝑑-separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> in G. (c) Solve the fair learning problem with D source limited to model class F (S).

To reduce the combinatorial search, we can run a feature selection procedure, e.g. the lasso in case of linear models [24, Chapter 3], to prune non-predictive features. Another heuristic is to start with the set of causal parents of Y (which satisfy Assumption 1) and prune it to get a subset satisfying Assumption 2.</p></div>

To generate target domains, we perform soft interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to shift distributions of 𝐴 and 𝑇 .

The condition can develop over a few hours to days and early prediction can greatly reduce the fatalities associated with the condition. Hence, building models for predicting AKI risk from clinical data is an active area of research. Such models can be used to risk-stratify patients to screen them for close monitoring or to perform further diagnostics to guide course of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Importantly, AKI incidence has well-documented disparities across groups defined by race and sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Thus, introduction of risk prediction tools for guiding clinical care has a potential to perpetuate such disparities, or alternatively, to address them through a more deliberate design of the prediction tools. A recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> showed good predictive performance for AKI based on patient data provided by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. However, the female population was severely underrepresented in the data, which raises concern over differential error rates when deployed in a different population. Therefore, to analyze the fairness across sensitive groups, we conduct experiments on MIMIC III, a publicly-available critical care dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We extract variable types, mentioned in caption of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref>, for around 24𝐾 patients. Pre-processing steps are described in Appendix I.2. We use a simplified causal graph for the AKI diagnosis task, Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, based on the one used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> for a sepsis diagnosis task. The group sex=female is taken as the sensitive attribute to assess fairness of the predictions. In this case study, the AKI risk score is not intended to prescribe treatment, but to flag a patient for extra care resources e.g. by alerting clinical staff. Thus, the potential harm that we want to avoid is groups having unequal opportunity to such care resulting from group differences in prediction errors.</p><p>Setup. Patient encounters are randomly split (2:1) into source and target data. We artificially introduce two types of shifts -(a) change in female proportion, and (b) change in measurement policy, where a lab test is prescribed less often -some of the factors affecting model performance across clinical settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. We randomly downsample female population by rejecting each row in the source data from that group with probability 50%. This shifts the proportion of females from 40% to 25%. Also, we randomly choose 50% encounters in the target data and add missing values for the Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) test, a biomarker of AKI <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Results with other missingness proportions are included in Appendix I.3.</p><p>From Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, we note that S={D, M, X\BUN} satisfies the two assumptions. We report AUPRC in Figure <ref type="figure">4c</ref>, instead of accuracy, as it is less sensitive to class imbalance (class ratio is 0.21). All results are reported for classifiers trained with gradient boosting trees. We drop OTDA from comparison due to its low accuracy and high running time for this dataset.</p><p>Results. We find that classifiers with separating feature set perform significantly better in AUPRC compared to those with all features (exact numbers are reported in Appendix I.3). Further, CausalDA+FairLearn improves fairness in target domain, reducing fairness violation by 47% with 0.8% decrease in AUPRC. Thus, the experiments provide preliminary evidence that our method can learn stable classifiers while being fair for a class of shifts in diagnosis tasks denoted by Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>. Note that the setup has some limitations, namely, adding missing values to perturb target data conflates the effectiveness of the procedure for handling missing data (mean value imputation in our case) with the procedure for domain adaptation. We plan to validate the approach on datasets across multiple hospitals or time points to address these limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">LIMITATIONS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Knowledge of causal graph. Our approach requires the causal graph for the system being studied to check whether the two assumptions are satisfied for any given subset. While this is a requirement made by multiple domain adaptation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, this can be relaxed when data from multiple domains are available. In such settings, causal discovery methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> can be used to posit a graph and validate with domain experts. Such a procedure is demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. An important direction for future work includes identifying the desired feature subsets with causal discovery algorithms. We recommend that the causal graph be postulated conservatively, i.e. only adding conditional independencies that are well-substantiated by domain knowledge. In this case, if the separating features are not found, our method will output that a fair predictor is not possible instead of incorrectly returning a model that will not be fair.</p><p>Addressable shifts. In Section 5.3, we described shifts that our approach can address and presented examples. However, these are only a part of the possible shifts that a modeller may worry about. For example, shifts in direct causes of the outcome are excluded due to Assumption 2. Such shifts can result in arbitrary changes to the outcome within each group, making it impossible to balance group-specific statistics in the fairness constraint (see Appendix A for an example). These are difficult to address without making strict assumptions on magnitude of the shift or assuming access to target data. Thus, for some joint causal graphs, Algorithm 1 might not yield any feature set. In such cases, an alternative is to return the set with the least source domain risk but such a set has no generalization guarantee.</p><p>Algorithmic fairness in healthcare to promote health equity. Disparities in health outcomes and healthcare access across different groups (e.g. based on race and gender) arise from multiple reasons such as socio-economic inequities (e.g. due to structural racism) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and clinician bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Such disparities can result in differential model performance across groups as Obermeyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> finds in context of a model for identifying patients who need extra care resources. Left unaddressed, allocating resources using 'biased' models may worsen health disparities. As a consequence, a growing body of work aims to develop algorithms embodying fairness principles specific to healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This includes constraining prediction errors across groups for the tasks of predicting risk of cardiovascular events <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> or predicting healthcare costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. However, such group-level fairness constraints, including the ones we consider, may not match ethical desiderata in all possible healthcare settings. Some alternative constraints have been defined, for example, using counterfactuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> or preference between group or aggregate-level models <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. We plan to investigate fair domain adaptation under broader notions of fairness. We have motivated the approach on healthcare tasks due to the importance of ensuring reliable model performance under distribution shifts in this domain. We note that the approach is more broadly applicable to other domains involving high-stakes decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In absence of data from new environments in which a machine learning model will be deployed, giving performance guarantees regarding predictive performance and fairness is challenging. We find that methods to address distribution shift, while controlling for decay in accuracy, can result in fairness violations. As a countermeasure, we show that it is possible to obtain accurate and fair predictors for widely-studied fairness definitions and under a large class of shifts particularly prevalent in healthcare tasks. Future work includes studying fair domain adaptation under parametric assumptions on shifts, adaptation for counterfactual definitions of fairness, and finite sample properties of the estimators. We hope that the problem setup presented here will enable further work at the intersection of fairness and causal inference.       </p></div>

That is, the fairness constraint 𝐺 𝐶=1 (𝑓 ) can change arbitrarily depending on the value of 𝛾 for the particular target domain, while the source data distribution 𝐶 = 0 available to us is fixed. In other words, the fairness constraint (thought of a function of the target distribution 𝑃 (𝑋, 𝐴, 𝑌 |𝐶 = 1)) is not identifiable by the observed distribution 𝑃 (𝑋, 𝐴, 𝑌 |𝐶 = 0) alone. Thus, we cannot solve (4) without further assumptions or without data from the target domain. □</p><p>We constructed the example with a regression task but the same can be shown for a classification task e.g. a logistic function for 𝑓 (𝑋, 𝐴).

The density ratio can be computed, for example, using a probabilistic classifier to discriminate between the domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Next, consider the fairness constraint. We show the following for EO and the corresponding Assumption 2. The argument is similar for the other definitions i.e. DP, TPR, and TNR. Assumption 2 for EO, i.e. 𝐶 ⊥ ⊥ S|𝑌, 𝐴, implies that 𝐶 ⊥ ⊥ 𝑓 (S)|𝑌 , 𝐴, assuming that classifier 𝑓 is a measurable function (which is the case for most classification functions and feature spaces used in machine learning). Thus, for 𝑦 ∈ {0, 1}, we can write the EO constraints as, Therefore, Assumption 2 guarantees that the evaluation of the fairness constraint does not change with the domain. The same is true for the other three fairness constraints. For DP, the conditioning on 𝑌 is dropped in Assumption 2. Similarly, TPR and TNR fix 𝑌 = 1 and 𝑌 = 0 respectively.</p><p>Since both the error and the constraint are estimable, we can minimize (5) without access to labelled target domain data, if we can find a feature subset satisfying the two assumptions. □ C THEOREM 5.2: WORST-CASE OPTIMALITY Now, we show that the fair classifier learned in our setting is worstcase optimal.

Then, the optimal classifier 𝑓 * under the fairness constraint is a threshold function i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">𝑓 * (x) = 1[𝑝 𝑦 |x (x) ≥ 𝑡 𝑎 ] for some constant thresholds 𝑡 𝑎 ∈ [0, 1]</formula><p>that can optionally depend on the sensitive attribute 𝐴 = 𝑎.</p><p>The result also holds when the fairness constraints are required to be only approximately satisfied.</p><p>To relate this lemma to our problem, note that our objective of minimizing classification error is same as maximizing immediate utility for 𝑐 = 0.5, as observed by Lipton et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 1]</ref>. To see this, rewrite the error as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">𝑃 (𝑓 (x) ≠ 𝑦) = E(1(𝑓 (x) ≠ 𝑦)) = E(1 - 𝑦 𝑓 (x) -(1 -𝑦) (1 -𝑓 (x)</formula><p>)) for binary labels 𝑦 ∈ {0, 1}. Rearranging terms, we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">𝑃 (𝑓 (x) ≠ 𝑦) = E(1 -𝑦 𝑓 (x) -(1 -𝑦)(1 -𝑓 (x))) = E(-2𝑦 𝑓 (x) + 𝑓 (x)) + E(𝑦) = -2𝑈 (𝑓 , 0.5) + E(𝑦)</formula><p>where E(𝑦) is a constant. Thus, we can use Lemma 2 to characterize the optimal classifier under classification error and the three fairness definitions.</p></div>

Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, we focus on the latter and use the framework for domain adaptation.</p><p>A joint causal model is used to model the data generated under different domains by introducing context variables to the standard structural causal model, defined as follows.</p><p>Definition D.1 (Joint Causal Model). A joint causal model M is a tuple ⟨I, J, K, H, F , 𝑃 (K)⟩ where (1) {𝐶 𝑖 } 𝑖 ∈I denote a set of context variables, assumed to be exogenous to the system of interest. (2) {𝑋 𝑗 } 𝑗 ∈ J denote a set of system variables, assumed to be endogenous. (3) {𝑈 𝑘 } 𝑘 ∈K denote a set of independent exogenous variables, assumed to be unobserved. (4) {ℎ 𝑖 } 𝑖 ∈H denote a set of functions that give functional dependence of context variables. Each variable 𝐶 𝑖 is assigned its value as 𝐶 𝑖 ← ℎ 𝑖 (U pa(𝐶 𝑖 )∩K ). (5) {𝑓 𝑗 } 𝑗 ∈ J denote a set of functions that give functional dependence of system variables. Each variable 𝑋 𝑗 is assigned its value as 𝑋 𝑗 ← 𝑓 𝑗 (C pa(𝑋 𝑗 )∩I , X pa(𝑋 𝑗 )∩ J , U pa(𝑋 𝑗 )∩K ). (6) 𝑃 (K) denotes a probability distribution over unobserved exogenous variables, 𝑃 (U) = Π 𝑘 ∈K 𝑃 (𝑈 𝑘 ).</p><p>Here, pa(•) is a set of variables, referred to as parents of the variable.</p><p>A joint causal graph G(M) refers to the causal graph representing M. The graph only contains nodes from I ∪ J , a directed edge 𝑎 → 𝑏 for nodes 𝑎, 𝑏 iff 𝑎 ∈ pa(𝑏), and a bidirected edge 𝑎 ↔ 𝑏 iff the set pa(𝑎) ∩ pa(𝑏) ∩ K is non-empty. That is, directed edges represent direct functional dependence and bidirected edges represent presence of unobserved common causes.</p><p>The functional dependencies along with distribution over the unobserved variables induces a distribution over context and system variables. Importantly, intervening on the context variables give distributions for different domains. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> Thus, JCI provides a framework to reason about the distributions of data from multiple domains. To read the conditional independencies in the domain distributions using the graph, we need two assumptions. Causal Markov assumption requires that any d-separation of sets of nodes in G(M) imply the corresponding conditional independencies in the distribution. Conversely, faithfulness means that there are no other conditional independencies than the ones implied by d-separation. Please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 2.2]</ref> for details.</p><p>Thus, given any G(M) proposed using domain knowledge or discovered from data, we can check the conditional independence assumptions posited by Assumptions 1 and 2.</p><p>Remark 1. In case of TPR and TNR, which require 𝐶 ⊥ ⊥ 𝑆 |𝑌 = 1, 𝐴 and 𝐶 ⊥ ⊥ 𝑆 |𝑌 = 0, 𝐴, we need to consider causal graphs drawn for sub-populations (𝑌 = 1 or 𝑌 = 0). The conditional independence can then be checked in such a graph using d-separation. This requires stronger assumptions that the modeler can express causal knowledge at the sub-population level and the distribution is faithful to such a graph.</p></div>

Combined with Assumption 1, we select non-descendants of 𝐴 which form a separating set in order to solve Fair DA.</p><p>Since, Ctf only requires change in feature subset and does not include any fairness constraints in the fair learning problem, we can show the worst-case optimality result as well. The arguments in the proof of Theorem 2 still hold. The only difference is that instead of using Lemma 2 at Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, we use the fact that Bayes classifier (without fairness constraints) is also a threshold function that depends on conditional outcome distribution.</p><p>However, we note that there are multiple ways of defining counterfactual fairness. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> require that causal effects of 𝐴 on Ŷ through particular paths should be zero or small. Further work should explore approaches to solve Fair DA under broader definitions of counterfactual fairness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F EXAMPLES OF ADDRESSABLE SHIFTS</head><p>As remarked in Section 5.3, we can find at least one feature set satisfying Assumptions 1 and 2 in case of the following shiftsshifts with causal paths to 𝑌 which all include 𝐴 (i.e. 𝐶•• →𝐴→ ••𝑌 with all arrows toward 𝑌 ) and shifts with non-causal paths to 𝑌 (i.e. 𝐶•• →𝑀← ••𝑌 for some feature 𝑀 ∈ S). This means that any shift causing change in distribution of the sensitive attribute as well as any measurement error in variables with a non-causal path to 𝑌 can be addressed. We present two examples of real-world tasks with such shifts. Medical diagnosis. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">7a</ref> represents an example of sepsis prediction based on the causal graph presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>; 𝑌 : outcome (prevalence of sepsis condition), 𝐴: age (sensitive attribute), 𝑅 represents a pre-existing condition like chronic liver condition. An indicator like the international normalized ratio (INR) which is a measure of blood clotting tendency is denoted by 𝑋 . 𝑇 represents treatment prescribed to the patient. The graph represents a case of population shift represented by 𝐶 1 and treatment prescription policy shift denoted by 𝐶 2 .</p><p>Credit scoring. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">7b</ref> represents a causal graph posited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for the credit scoring task.

The context variable 𝐶 denotes an anticipated shift which changes the distribution of females, for instance, in the target domain.</p><p>Recidivism risk assessment. Another example of risk assessment tools used to inform pre-trial bail decisions in the criminal justice system is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">7c</ref>. In the causal graph for this task, presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, 𝐴 denotes the sensitive attribute, here race, 𝑍 represents other demographic information (e.g., age, gender) of the defendant which can be confounded by race. Prior convictions are denoted by 𝑊 and recidivism outcome (0 for no, 1 otherwise) is represented by 𝑌 .

For source domain, 𝐶 = 0 and for target domain, 𝐶 = 1. Setting 𝐶 = 1 amounts to performing a soft intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> on 𝐴 and 𝑇 , whose distributions change as a result in the target domain. The magnitude of the effect of 𝐶 on 𝐴 and 𝑇 is scaled by a constant 𝛾, which is varied from 0 to 15 for simulating distribution shifts of increasing magnitude.</p><p>More details on OTDA baseline. OTDA is an optimal transportbased method for unsupervised domain adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Instead of making assumptions on covariate shift, it posits that some (nonlinear) transformation exists between source and target features. It finds the minimal-cost transformations for a given cost function. A classifier is trained on the transformed source data and applied directly to the target data. We use the squared 𝑙 2 cost and 𝑙 𝑝 -𝑙 1 regularization-based transport method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. 5    We compare with another causal domain adaptation method called anchor regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> in a separate experiment setting where we assume access to data from multiple source domains. This method has been shown to be competitive among state-ofthe-art methods for multi-source domain adaptation which do not require target domain data <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</p><p>Anchor regression requires specifying an anchor variable which indicates (in case of discrete anchors) homogeneous subsets of data. An example is the context variable 𝐶 which separates the two homogeneous datasets -source and target -based on their magnitude of shift. Anchors are exogenous sources of variation which can be exploited to regularize the predictor. Intuitively, the method avoids overfitting the predictor to the source dataset by decorrelating the residuals from the anchor. In addition, the method assumes that the anchor causes mean-shifts in a subset of variables, i.e. the linear structural equations for the variables have an added intercept term that is constant for a given homogeneous subset. The data generating process described in Section 6.1 does not have 5 Implemented in POT library <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/rflamary/POT">https://github.com/rflamary/POT</ref> an anchor that follows this assumption. The shift in feature 𝑇 is caused by a shift in the variance of 𝑇 , instead of being a constant mean-shift.

In case of anchor regression, dummy variables are added to encode the samples corresponding to the three different shift magnitudes. The dummy variables are the anchors. For rest of the methods, we simply concatenate the datasets without adding any dummy variables. All variables in source and features in target are mean centered using the corresponding datasets. We use square loss as the loss function for the classification problem with an additional regularization term which is minimized following a two-stage least squares procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. We evaluate the resulting predictor on five target datasets 𝛾 = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.</p><p>Results. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">8</ref> shows fairness violation and accuracy for anchor regression along with other methods. We observe that anchor regression (labelled as AnchorReg) is robust to distribution shift as it has high accuracy even in case of large shifts (green curve in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">8a</ref>). But it has higher unfairness than the proposed approach CausalDA+FairLearn, which is the case for other domain adaptation methods CausalDA and OTDA as well (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">8b</ref>).

The total number of encounters (admissions) in the dataset is 58, 976, with some patients having multiple encounters. In order to have a complete view of a patient's hospital stay from admission until discharge, we removed any patient who died during their hospital stay regardless of the cause. We have also excluded patients that were admitted with evidence of moderate or severe kidney dysfunction, as done by He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 𝑚 2 (calculated using the revised MDRD study equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>) or Serum Creatinine (SCr) level more than 1.3 mg/dL within the first 24 hours of hospital admission are excluded.

Baseline SCr level was defined as the first SCr measured after hospital admission. Out of a total of 24, 852 encounters in the final analysis, AKI events occurred in 5, 137 encounters and 19, 715 encounters had no AKI events. We consider a prediction window which ends 1 day before the onset of AKI. A summary of features used to train the prediction models can be found in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, included at the end. Some of these are also used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, unlike this study, we exclude medications and medical history features as they are high-dimensional (around 1,000). Only patients who did not have AKI at the time of admission are included since we are interested in diagnosing AKI for in-hospital patients. Data for variables mentioned in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> is extracted for each encounter from time before the prediction window.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I.2 Data pre-processing</head><p>In-hospital encounters which met the two KDIGO criteria were labeled as the positive class, while encounters in which the patient did not meet the above criteria was labeled as the negative class. Feature vectors were created for each encounter. Demographic information (age, gender, and race) were included in the feature vectors; age in years, and dummy variables for gender categories (female, male) and race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, multiple race, refuse to answer, no information, unknown, and other). A patient's vitals (BMI, diastolic BP, systolic BP, height, weight) were included as numerical features, where the most recent value associated with any vital was used in cases where multiple measurements were taken during an encounter. Any missing values were imputed using the mean value (calculated on the training data) for the given feature. Lab tests and comorbidities were included in the form of boolean features indicating whether the lab test/comorbidity was present. While only lab tests performed during a given in-hospital encounter were used, comorbidities up to one year prior to the hospital stay were included. Comorbidities included in the AKI predictive model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> were used as a guide for selecting the nine comorbidities in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. After adding dummy variables and missing value indicators, we obtained a dataset containing 24, 852 examples, each with 51 features (13 demographic, 5 vitals, 9 comorbidities, 12 lab tests, and 12 lab test missing value indicators). We removed features that had more than 90% values as missing, namely the lab tests for Troponin, Albumin, and WBC. Since the BUN lab test was one of the most predictive features, it was chosen for creating shifted datasets. We discarded both the BUN variable and missing value indicator when creating the invariant predictor.</p><p>Remark 2.

Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows two predictive performance metrics, namely AUPRC, AUROC, and one fairness metric, namely maximum fairness violation, for different proportions of missingness, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. As mentioned in Section 6.2, the methods which use the invariant features (CausalDA and CausalDA+FairLearn) have stable accuracy as the distribution shifts. Moreover, CausalDA+FairLearn reduces unfairness consistently in the shifted data.

(a) Data generating process for source and target domains represented as a causal graph where domains are indicated by the context variable 𝐶. Edges from 𝐶 represent shifts between the domains. {𝑇 , 𝑅, 𝐴} are features, with sensitive attribute 𝐴, and outcome 𝑌 . (b,c) Classification accuracy and fairness violation with varying magnitude of shifts for synthetic data (Section 6.2) for the example. Fairness violation is computed as the maximum violation of equalized odds constraint across 𝑌 and 𝐴. Median values are plotted over 50 runs and error bars show first and third quartiles. Proposed approach (CausalDA+FairLearn) achieves both stable accuracy and fairness in the shifted target domains.</figDesc></figure>
