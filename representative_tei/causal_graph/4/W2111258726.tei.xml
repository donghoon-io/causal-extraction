<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Theory of Classical Genetics Three Philosophical Accounts of the Theory of Classical Genetics</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1</head><p>The structuralist account The theory of classical genetics will be used as a case study and several philosophical topics (relating to exemplars, anomalies, explanation and unification) will be explored.</p><p>What scientific theories are and how they should be represented, have been very pressing questions in 20th century philosophy of science. In</p><p>search for an answer, many have used the theory of classical genetics as a case study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Woodger ([1929]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[1952]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[1959]</ref>) has provided an elaborate reconstruction of classical genetics within the neopositivist axiomatic framework. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Balzer and Lorenzano ([2000]</ref>) and others have discussed classical genetics extensively within the Sneedian structuralist framework (based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>). 1 Others have used the case of classical genetics to address related questions about theory change in science <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>), or about explanation and unification <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, causality plays no substantial role in any of the above accounts. During the past decades, however, more and more philosophers have stressed the centrality of causality in, among other things, explanation. If they are correct, which I think they are, and if scientific theories can be used for explanation, which I think they can, then we need an account of scientific theories that allows us to represent their causal structure (see section 4 for a more elaborate discussion of causality and explanation). It will emerge that my causal-structural approach, which builds on Woodward's interventionist account of causation and on the theory of causal Bayes nets, is very suitable to that task. It naturally represents both the qualitative and the quantitative aspects of the causal structure of classical genetics in an integrated way. It also results in an interesting account of explanation which allows us to get a grip on explanatory unification within a causalist framework. Moreover, it offers a nice explication of lawfulness in classical genetics and in the special sciences in general (see section 17). A final advantage, which I will not stress here, is that it can easily be implemented in computers and AI; see the tools developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Spirtes et al. ([2000]</ref>), such as TETRAD. Some of the leading figures discussed in this paper have endeavoured a similar advantage in the past, using different tools such as PROLOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balzer and Lorenzano [2000]</ref>, p. 243) and SUTTON <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Darden and Rada [1988]</ref>).</p><p>This paper consists of three parts. In the first part (sections 2-6) I will set the stage. In section 2 I introduce the reader to the main concepts of classical genetics. In section 3, I briefly present three existing philosophical accounts of classical genetics, by the structuralists, by Kitcher and by <ref type="bibr">Darden.</ref> Their ideas will play an important role in this paper and I will try to accommodate several of them. Yet I will also point to a very important lacuna they in common: they have no substantial role for causality to play (section 4). Finally, I will sketch Woodward's interventionist account of causation (section 5) and the basic formal concepts to be used in this paper: causal nets, credal nets, and several kinds of isomorphism relations (section 6).</p><p>In the second part (sections 7-16), I will present the causal-structural account of scientific theories by applying it to the theory of classical genetics. More specifically, I present classical genetics' qualitative causal structure (section 7), its application to monohybrid crosses with complete dominance (sections 8 and 10) and incomplete dominance (section 12), and its application to multihybrid crosses with independent assortment (section 14) and with linkage and crossing over (sections <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Meanwhile, I also present a causal-structural account of explanation (section 9) and glance at Darden's discussion of exemplars (section 11) and anomalies (section 13).</p><p>In the third part (sections 17-18), I will expand on the causal-structural account of scientific explanation (section 17), and highlight one of its important advantages, viz. that it allows us to get a grip on explanatory unification within a causalist framework (section 18).</p><p>Finally, I conclude in section 19 by discussing the possible generalizability of the causal-structural account of scientific theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Theory of Classical Genetics</head><p>The theory of classical genetics has been developed roughly between 1900 and the end of the 1920's. In the middle of the 19th century, Gregor</p><p>Mendel studied phenomena of inheritance and hybridization mainly by experimenting with pea plants. He presented his seminal ideas in 1865. In 1866 these were published in his Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mendel [1865]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[1933]</ref>). In 1900, his work again came to the fore, due to the works of De Vries <ref type="bibr">([1900]</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Correns ([1900]</ref>) and, shortly afterwards, Bateson <ref type="bibr">([1900]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[1902]</ref>). Almost thirty years later, Thomas Hunt Morgan published the second edition of The Theory of the <ref type="bibr">Gene (1928)</ref>. This can be considered an end-point in the development of classical genetics <ref type="bibr">(Darden [1991], pp. 3 and 38)</ref>. In this paper, I will use Morgan's exposition as my main source for exploring the structure of classical genetics. But first I will introduce the main concepts of classical genetics based on a contemporary textbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>).</p><p>The main aim of classical genetics is to explain the distribution of observable traits in the offspring of two (groups of) crossed organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, chapters 3-5). For example, why is it that after crossing true-breeding tall pea plants with short pea plants all the resulting offspring is tall? 2 And why is it that after crossing this offspring with short pea plants, half of the resulting plants are tall whereas the other half are short?</p><p>Traits (such as tall and short) are alternative forms of the same character (in casu stem length in pea plants). <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 40)</p><p>They are assumed to be coded for (or caused) by the organism's genes.</p><p>Alleles are alternative forms of genes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 42) For example, there exists an allele for tall stems and an allele for short stems.</p><p>(Other genes may have more than two possible alleles; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, section 4.5.) An organism's observable features are called its phenotype;</p><p>the set of its alleles for a given character (or set of characters) is called its genotype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 42) In their experiments, classical geneticists focussed on the transmission of one character (monohybrid crosses), or more characters (dihybrid, trihybrid, . . . crosses). <ref type="bibr">(Klug et al. [2006], pp. 40-4)</ref> The number of copies an organism has of each gene depends on its number of chromosomes. In this paper, I will focus on diploid organisms. These have two copies of each chromosome, and hence two copies of each gene. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 20) If both copies are identical (the same allele), the individual is homozygous, otherwise it is heterozygous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 42) The specific location of a specific gene on its chromosome is called its locus (plural: loci) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>,</p><p>p. 51).</p><p>Alleles are transmitted to the next generation via the gametes or germ-cells. Barring cases of crossing-over, each germ-cell receives one member of each pair of chromosomes, and hence one copy of each gene <ref type="bibr">(Klug et al. [2006], pp. 27-30)</ref>. By invoking certain hypotheses about this process, the distribution of genotypes (and hence of phenotypes) in the offspring can be explained. With respect to each pair of alleles, the law of segregation states that during gamete formation, the paired alleles separate or segregate randomly, so that each germ-cell receives one or the other with equal likelihood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 42) When multiple pairs of alleles are investigated (as is the case in multihybrid crosses) extra assumptions are needed. Mendel assumed that the transmission of one pair of alleles was independent of the transmission of other pairs. This was later called the law of independent assortment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 46). This law holds only for genes that lie on different chromosomes. Genes lying on the same chromosome are said to be linked <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p.</p><p>101). Normally, gametes do not receive exact copies of the original chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes (chromosomes of the same pair)</p><p>typically exchange part of their material (crossing-over ). As a result, linkage is normally incomplete <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 101).</p><p>Other hypotheses pertain to the relation between genotype and phenotype. The best-known principle is complete dominance. For example, a pea plant that is heterozygous for stem length is tall (the tall-allele is dominant, the short-allele is recessive). Not all characters show complete dominance, however (see section 12).</p><p>3 Three Philosophical Accounts of the Theory of Classical</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetics</head><p>In this section, I will briefly present three existing philosophical accounts of the theory of classical genetics: by the structuralists, by Kitcher and by <ref type="bibr">Darden.</ref> Even though they have an important problem in common (they all treat issues of causality in stepmotherly fashion; see section 4), these three accounts definitely deserve our attention. I will focus on the structuralist notions of 'theory-element', 'T-theoreticity' and explanation as 'embedding', on Kitcher's 'general argument patterns' and on Darden's notions of 'theoretical component' and 'abstract explanatory pattern'. In the rest of this paper, these notions will be translated into the language of causal Bayes nets. This will prove to be fruitful in the construction of an adequate account of scientific theories, of explanation and of unification. 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The structuralist account</head><p>Balzer Lorenzano <ref type="bibr">([2000]</ref>) have analysed the theory of classical genetics within the Sneedian structuralist framework, in which mature scientific theories are represented in terms of their logical models, i.e. set-theoretic structures that satisfy particular statements or propositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 2-3). In the structuralist approach, scientific theories are rarely treated as monolithic entities. They are usually represented as theory-nets:</p><p>partially ordered sets of theory-elements, which are the basic building blocks of scientific theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, p. 172). A theory-element T = K, I consists of a core K and a limited domain of intended applications I <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, p. 39).</p><p>The theory-core</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K(T) = M p (T), M(T), M pp (T), GC(T), GL(T)</formula><p>consists of five elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, p. 79). M p (T), the set of T's potential models, consists of those set-theoretic structures that can be subsumed under T's conceptual framework; i.e. the structures for which it makes sense to ask whether they satisfy T's laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp.</p><p>15-7). M(T) is the set of T's models, i.e. those potential models that satisfy T's laws (hence M(T) ⊂ M p (T)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 3 and 15-7). M pp (T) is the set of T's partial potential models, i.e. those fragments of the potential models which contain only T's non-theoretical conceptual apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 56-7). Roughly speaking, a concept is T-non-theoretical if there are ways of determining or measuring that concept which do not invoke T's laws, and T-theoretical otherwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 50ff). For example, in classical genetics, 'phenotype' is a non-theoretical concept; 'genotype' is theoretical (see section 7). 4 Partial potential models can be 'extended' to potential models by adding suitable T-theoretical relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 56-7).</p><p>T's constraints, GC(T), characterize the connections among the different local applications of T <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 40-1 and 78). For example, one constraint may state that the same genotype used in two different models will produce the same phenotype in these respective models <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balzer and Lorenzano [2000]</ref>, p. 254). Finally, T's intertheoretical links, GL(T), represent the transfer of data from another theory T to T <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 58 and 79). Such transfer is needed for measuring T-non-theoretical concepts.</p><p>The set of intended applications I describes the phenomena that T should account for <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, pp. 86-9). The intended applications have the structure of partial potential models. But M pp contains all of T's possible applications (even 'purely mathematical' structures), not all of which are intended; therefore, I ⊆ M pp . The distinction between merely possible applications and intended possible applications cannot be made in a purely formal way <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>,</p><p>pp. 88-9). Often, the set of intended applications is specified by citing a few 'paradigms' or 'exemplars' (such as 'the pendulum' and 'the projectile' in classical particle mechanics). Systems that are sufficiently similar to these exemplars are then said to belong to I.</p><p>To explain some given data or phenomena by means of T, one proceeds as follows <ref type="bibr">(Balzer et al. [1987], p. 23)</ref>. By assumption, the data have the structure of one of T's partial potential models (some</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M pp ∈ M pp )</formula><p>. By adding T's theoretical concepts, one creates a potential model (some M p ∈ M p ); this 'embedding' of the data in a potential model is the conceptual aspect of the application of T. Then one asserts that the data satisfy the laws of T, i.e. that M p is an actual model of T (M p ∈ M).</p><p>This assertion has empirical consequences which, if they turn out to be true, show that we have successfully applied T to I.</p><p>To simplify matters, Balzer and Lorenzano do not distinguish between actual, potential and partial potential models. In their reconstruction, all the models of classical genetics consist of eight components: a set J of genetic individuals (these are individual organisms or populations thereof), a set P of phenotypes, a set G of genotypes, and five functions relating these sets to one another (e.g., APPEARANCE is a function mapping individuals to their phenotypes) <ref type="bibr">([2000], pp. 246-9)</ref>. Different theory-elements are obtained by specifying the number of genes that are investigated, or by specifying the precise mathematical form of the models' functions. They distinguish, among other things, between theory-elements for monohybrid crosses with complete dominance, for monohybrid crosses with incomplete dominance, for dihybrid crosses with independent assortment, etc.; together, these theory-elements form the theory-net of classical genetics <ref type="bibr">([2000]</ref>, pp. 260-2). Data are explained by embedding them in one of classical genetics' models <ref type="bibr">([2000]</ref>, p. 3).</p><p>Like Balzer and Lorenzano, I will discuss the different 'theory-elements' of classical genetics separately and I will explore their formal interrelations (albeit using a different formal apparatus). I will also adopt the notion of 'T-theoreticity' and of explanation as 'embedding'.</p><p>These ideas, together with some of Kitcher's and Darden's, will help to get an adequate grip on explanatory unification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Kitcher's unificationism</head><p>Kitcher's main research question is not how to represent scientific theories, but how to build a unificationist theory of explanation.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kitcher ([1989]</ref>, p. 447), scientific theories are constituted by patterns of derivation or general argument patterns, which are defined as follows: 5</p><p>A schematic sentence is an expression obtained by replacing some, but not necessarily all, the nonlogical expressions occurring in a sentence with dummy letters. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p. 432, original emphasis)</p><p>Kitcher <ref type="bibr">([1989]</ref>, pp. 438-42) characterizes classical genetics as a set of patterns that serve to answer specific types of questions:</p><p>What is the expected distribution of phenotypes in a particular generation? Why should we expect to get that distribution?</p><p>What is the probability that a particular phenotype will result from a particular mating?, and so forth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p. 438)</p><p>The general idea common to all patterns is that these questions may be answered <ref type="bibr">[. . . ]</ref> by making hypotheses about the relevant genes, their phenotypic effects, and their distribution among the individuals in the pedigree. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, pp. 438-9)</p><p>The simplest pattern, for example, is called Mendel and has four premises <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p. 439). The first premise says that there are two alleles A and a, where A is dominant and a recessive. It is a schematic sentence with A and a as dummy letters. The filling instructions state that these are to be replaced with names of alleles. The second premise says that AA and Aa individuals have trait P , whereas aa individuals have trait P . The dummy letters P and P are to be replaced with names of phenotypic traits. The third premise is a list specifying the genotypes of all the individuals involved. And the fourth premise says that 'For any individual</p><p>x and any alleles yz if x has yz then the probability that x will transmit y to any one of its offspring is 1/2' <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p. 439). This is the law of segregation. From these premises, the expected distribution of progeny phenotypes can be derived by filling in the dummy letters. Mendel is limited to cases with only one gene and two possible alleles, and with complete dominance. Other, more complicated patterns (called Refined Mendel and Morgan) are more encompassing <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, pp. 440-1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Darden and theory change in science</head><p>Darden's main research question is how scientific theories change over time, how new scientific ideas are developed, and what strategies there are for theory change in science <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>). To that end, she analyses the theory of classical genetics in terms of theoretical components, 'parts of the theory that change over time' <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>, p. 18). For example, between 1900 and 1903 Mendelian genetics incorporated the following component:</p><p>Unit-characters: (1) An organism is to be viewed as composed of separable unit-characters. (Adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Darden [1991]</ref>, p.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>168)</head><p>This component gradually evolved. Where, according to Darden, no distinction was made in 1900-1903 between observable traits and underlying elements or factors, that distinction was evident as of 1910: 4 A Common Lacuna: Where is Causality?</p><p>These three accounts of the theory of classical genetics have one lacuna in common: to a greater or lesser extent, they treat issues of causality in stepmotherly fashion.</p><p>First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balzer et al. ([1987]</ref>) do not discuss the difference between causal and non-causal relations or laws. It could well be that (some of) a theory's laws are causal, but the structuralist framework lacks the expressive power to say so. As a result, the structuralist account of explanation (see section 3.1) is a-causal. Moreover, it is also intended as an account of prediction;</p><p>no distinction is made between prediction and explanation. And even when they apply their framework to overtly causal theories such as classical genetics, the structuralists are reluctant to make room for causality. Balzer and Lorenzano, for example, talk about phenotypes being 'caused' (with quotation marks!) by genotypes <ref type="bibr">([2000]</ref>, pp. 247-8). 6</p><p>A notable exception in the structuralist literature is <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Forge ([2002]</ref>), who goes some way to giving a structuralist account of causal explanation.</p><p>He conjectures that in structuralist reconstructions of scientific theories, causes can be represented by (unconstrained) theoretical concepts or functions <ref type="bibr">([2002], p. 113)</ref>. While this conjecture is interesting, two remarks should be made. First, Forge focuses on scientific theories in the physical sciences and it is an open question whether his conjecture would apply to the theory of classical genetics as well. Second, and more importantly, a function or concept that is theoretical for a theory T 1 may be non-theoretical for some other theory T 2 . But that would make it non-causal for T 2 by definition. This is an unwelcome consequence of Forge's conjecture.</p><p>Second, Kitcher explicitly discusses the notion of causation, but he 'explains it away'. Because of well-known empiricist concerns, he refuses to adopt a causal account of explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p. 435). Instead he develops an explanatory account of causation: 'What is distinctive about the unification view is that it proposes to ground causal claims in claims about explanatory dependency rather than vice versa.' <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p.</p><p>436) Causal relevance is dependent on explanatory relevance, where the latter is tied to the systematization of belief in the limit of scientific inquiry, as guided by the search for derivational unification <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>,</p><p>p. 499). 7</p><p>Third, Darden is less reluctant to talk about causality in her account of classical genetics. She acknowledges that causal considerations did play a role in genetics and cytology <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>, pp. 253-4), especially in the Morgan group <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>, p. 183), and she uses causal language when formulating the theoretical components of Mendelian genetics (see the examples cited in section 3.3). But for all that, she pays relatively little attention to causation in classical genetics. Nor does she give an account of causation.</p><p>One may wonder, of course, whether causality really is that important. 8 In my opinion, there are multiple reasons why causality merits particular attention in our representations of scientific theories, the most important one being related to explanation. 9 For many philosophers, explanation is tightly connected to causation; see the causal-mechanical accounts of <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Salmon ([1984]</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dowe ([2000]</ref>), the interventionist accounts of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hausman ([1998]</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Woodward ([2003]</ref>), and the mechanistic accounts of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Machamer et al. ([2000]</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Glennan ([1996]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[2002]</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bechtel and Abrahamsen ([2005]</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Craver ([2007]</ref>).</p><p>One of the central motivations for stressing the role of causality in explanation is that it solves several of the problems that notoriously plague <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hempel's ([1965]</ref>) deductive-nomological (DN ) model of explanation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Woodward [2009]</ref>, section 2.5) One such problem is explanatory asymmetry. One may logically derive, and hence DN -explain, the length of a flagpole's shadow from its height, together with certain laws and initial conditions. Likewise, one may derive, and hence DN -explain, its height from the length of its shadow, again together with certain laws and initial conditions. But whereas the first derivation seems explanatory, the second does not. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kitcher ([1989]</ref>, pp. 485-7) endeavours to solve this problem within his unificationist model, but he arguably fails <ref type="bibr">(Woodward [2003], pp. 358-60;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gijsbers [2007]</ref>, pp. 489-91).

Even though I endorse the view that causality plays an important role in explanation, I do not wish to say that all explanation is causal explanation. Mathematical explanations, for example, may well be a-causal (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mancosu [2011]</ref>,</p><p>section 1 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Woodward [2003]</ref>, pp. 220-1) and they may better fit Hempel's or Kitcher's account of explanation. That need not be a problem; after all it seems doubtful that there can be a truly general account of explanation that holds in all possible domains of inquiry (cf.</p><p>note 25). Still, if causal considerations are relevant, they should better be taken into account. This surely holds in the case of classical genetics, as I will argue in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Woodward's Interventionist Account of Causation</head><p>My account of the causal structure of classical genetics builds upon Woodward's interventionist theory of causation. The central idea of this theory is that causal relations 'are potentially exploitable for purposes of manipulation and control' <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Woodward [2003]</ref>, p. v). For two reasons, Woodward's theory is well suited for my purposes. 10 First, it dovetails with (large part of) the literature on causal Bayes nets, such as the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pearl ([2000]</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Spirtes et al.

Finally, I discuss a related concept-credal nets-and define corresponding isomorphism relations (6.3). Causal nets will play the same role as models in the structuralist framework.

According to Morgan, the modern theory of heredity 'is primarily concerned with the distribution of units between successive generations of individuals' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 1). These units are invisible and they are called genes. To these genes, properties are assigned in a non-arbitrary way, based on 'numerical data obtained by crossing two individuals that differ in one or more characters' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 1).</p><p>After presenting several examples of possible relations between genes and characters, Morgan formulates the theory of the gene as follows (the three following quotes are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 25):</p><p>We are now in a position to formulate the theory of the gene.</p><p>The theory states that the characters of the individual are referable to paired elements (genes) in the germinal material that are held together in a definite number of linkage groups;</p><p>Where Morgan writes about 'pairs of genes', we would now say 'pairs of alleles.' Linkage groups are groups of genes that are typically transmitted together (since they lie on the same chromosome). Morgan continues by specifying the law of segregation (Mendel's first law) and the law of independent assortment (Mendel's second law):</p><p>it states that the members of each pair of genes separate when the germ-cells mature in accordance with Mendel's first law, and in consequence each germ-cell comes to contain one set only; it states that the members belonging to different linkage groups assort independently in accordance with Mendel's second law;</p><p>Finally he explains the basics of 'gene mapping', the technique by means of which the Morgan group was able to discover which of an organism's genes belonged to the same linkage group (and in what order):</p><p>it states that an orderly interchange-crossing-over-also takes place, at times, between the elements in corresponding linkage groups; and it states that the frequency of crossing-over furnishes evidence of the linear order of the elements in each linkage group and of the relative position of the elements with respect to each other.</p><p>The theory of the gene, as it is presented by Morgan, is not one single theory. It is composed of different abstract explanatory patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>), general argument patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>), or theory-elements forming a theory-net <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balzer and Lorenzano [2000]</ref>). I will incorporate this aspect by representing it by means of interrelated credal nets. As these credal nets are interpreted causally, the common lacuna is remedied. To some extent these credal nets share the same causal structure. This common causal structure ties them together, and distinguishes the theory</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">PT 2 GT 2 PT 1 GC 2 GC 1 GT 3 PT 3 GT 1 GC 3 Figure 1:</formula><p>The causal structure of classical genetics of the gene from alternative theories of inheritance such as Francis Galton's (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Leuridan [2007]</ref> for a brief characterization of Galton's theory).</p><p>This shared causal structure is shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The directed acyclic graph comprises nine nodes, which represent the genotype (GT i ), the phenotype (P T i ) and the make-up of the germ-cells (GC i ) of three groups of organisms (a paternal group, i = 1; a maternal group, i = 2; and a filial group, i = 3). 16 The GT i and GC i variables in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> are dotted to indicate that they are CG-theoretical in the structuralists' sense (see section 3.1; 'CG' stands for the theory of classical genetics). At the time, there was no way to determine an organism's genotype or the make-up of its germ-cells without invoking the theory of classical genetics. The phenotypic variables, by contrast, are CG-non-theoretical. One can determine an organism's phenotypic traits without relying on CG. This point is important with respect to explanation in classical genetics (see section 17).</p><p>The causal relations between these variables are depicted in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>The genotypes (GT i ) causally influence the corresponding phenotypes (P T i ), as well as the corresponding germ cells (GC i )-manipulating the former via an ideal intervention will change (the probability distribution over) the latter. And the parental germ cells (GC 1 and GC 2 ) together causally determine the filial genotype GT 3 . These relations are very plausible from a present-day point of view. But to avoid any allegation that I'm misinterpreting Morgan's exposition, we should briefly justify them on the basis of his work.</p><p>In section 5, I have argued, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Waters [2007]</ref>), that Woodward's interventionism fits Morgan's concept of causality. Here I discuss the precise causal relations that played a role in Morgan's theory of the gene. Let me start with the relation between genes and characters. It is very natural to consider genes as the causes of characters; i.e. to assume that for each i, GT i → P T i . It is not so natural, however, to attribute this assumption to Morgan and his contemporaries. Explicit causal language was surprisingly rare in the genetics literature at the time. Still, Morgan uses implicit causal language on repeated occasions. He hypothesizes that the tall variety of pea plants 'contains in its germ-cells something that makes the plants tall' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 2, my emphasis). He distinguishes between red-producing genes and white-producing genes in crosses of four-o'clocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 8). And he talks about the effects of mutant changes <ref type="bibr">(Morgan [1928], p. 315)</ref>. These examples should suffice to show that, according to Morgan, genes cause characters (see also <ref type="bibr">Darden [1991], pp. 182-3 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Waters [2007]</ref>).</p><p>What about the relations between the paired genes and the germcells?</p><p>In the third and the fourth chapter of his book, Morgan lists overwhelming cytological evidence leading to the conclusion that GT i → GC i (1 ≤ i ≤ 3) and that GC 1 → CT 3 ← GC 2 : the chromosomes are the bearers of the genes <ref type="bibr">([1928]</ref>, p. 45), somatic cells have a diploid number of chromosomes, half of which come from the father, the other half from the mother <ref type="bibr">([1928]</ref>, p. 32), and the germ cells receive a haploid number of chromosomes <ref type="bibr">([1928]</ref>, p. 33).</p></div>

It did not matter whether the tall plants produced pollen and the short plants produced eggs or vice versa.

All the plants in these crosses are tall (P T i = tall) or short (P T i = short). These traits are referable to paired alleles in the germinal material. Let t and s denote a 'tall-producing' and a 'short-producing' allele, respectively. 17 There are three possible configurations of paired alleles, i.e. three possible values for the variables GT i , viz. tt, ts, and ss. Finally, the germ-cells contain one allele of each pair. Hence, the variables GC i may assume the values t or s.</p><p>These specifications can be summarized as follows.

Let G 1 = V 1 , E be isomorphic to figure 1 (where P T 1 ∈ V 1 corresponds</formula><p>to the node P T 1 in the graph, . . . ). This completes the description of G 1 .

This expresses the dominance of tall over short.</p><p>Second, Morgan invokes the law of segregation (Mendel's first law):</p><p>'[i]f the element [or allele] for tall and the one for short (that are both present in the hybrid) separate in the hybrid when the eggs and pollen grains come to maturity, half the eggs will contain the tall and half the short element [. . . ].

The law of segregation is summarized in table 2.</p><p>A third, very implicit principle states that when an egg and a pollen grain fertilize, their respective elements together make up the genotype of the resulting offspring.

For example, when one crosses or self-fertilizes hybrids it may not be the case that tall-producing pollen have a tendency to fertilize tall-producing eggs rather than short-producing eggs. This assumption need not be expressed by means of a conditional probability table, as it holds for any probability distribution that satisfies the Causal Markov Condition relative to figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. 19   Together, these principles give rise to a credal set P 1 (V 1 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P 1 (V 1 ) = {P (V 1 ) | P (V 1</formula><p>) satisfies tables 1-3 and the Causal Markov Condition relative to G 1 }.</p><p>Joined with G 1 , this defines a credal net B 1 = G 1 , P 1 .</p><p>9 Explaining Mendel's Crosses: a Causal-Structural Account</p><p>Morgan explains the filial phenotypic distributions in crosses 1 to 3 by deriving them, by means of the laws or explanatory principles just discussed, from assumptions regarding the parental genotypes. Described in this way, explanation is syntactic. But we can also approach it in a semantic or model-theoretic way. Each of the crosses can be explained by embedding them in a causal net (some B ∈ B 1 ). This model-theoretic approach mimics the structuralist account of explanation, while making room for the concept of causality. Let me call it the causal-structural account of explanation. (See section 17 for a further elaboration.)</p><p>In section 3.1 we saw that for the structuralists, to explain some given data by means of a theory T, 20 one adds to these data-which have the structure of a partial potential model-T's theoretical concepts-thus creating a potential model-and then shows that it is an actual model of T. This 'embedding' can be translated to the language of causal nets. 21</p><p>The data in section 8.1 concern the phenotypic distribution of the filial group, given the phenotypes of the parental groups. Hence they pertain to the CG-non-theoretic variables P T i (with</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">[P T i ] = {tall, short}, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3).</formula><p>These can be included in a graph that also contains the CG-theoretical variables GT i and GC i (1 ≤ i ≤ 3). By demanding that this graph is isomorphic to figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and by adding suitable probability distributions which satisfy tables 1-3 and are causally Markov to the graph in question, one obtains models (causal nets in B 1 ) that incorporate classical genetics' conceptual framework, satisfy its laws and explain the data.</p><p>Let us first turn to cross 1. In one variant of cross 1, the pollen plants are true-breeding for tall and the egg plants are short:</p><p>P T 1 = tall, P T 2 = short. If it is assumed that a true-breeding tall plant contains the element for tall twice (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 6), it can be 'abduced' that GT 1 = tt and GT 2 = ss. 22 If we denote the probability distribution corresponding to this cross by P 1 (V 1 ), or briefly P 1 , we can express this as follows: P 1 (P T 1 = tall) = P 1 (P T 2 = short) = 1.00, and P 1 (GT 1 = tt) = P 1 (GT 2 = ss) = 1.00. Assume now that P 1 ∈ P 1 , so that it satisfies tables 1-3 and the corresponding explanatory principles. Then it follows that P 1 (GC 1 = t) = P 1 (GC 2 = s) = 1.00 (by table 2), and that P 1 (GT 3 = ts) = 1.00 (by table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Hence P 1 (P T 3 = tall) = 1.00 (by table 1), which corresponds to the data. This</p><p>shows that cross 1 can be represented by a causal net B 1 = G 1 , P 1 which predicts that all hybrid offspring is tall. Since B 1 satisfies causal explanatory principles, this embedding of the data in B 1 can rightly be called causal explanation. It shows how the variables on which the data report (in casu P T 3 ) fit in a larger causal system, and how this causal system brings about the (probability distribution over the) values of these variables. 23   The phenotypic distribution in cross 2 can be explained in an analogous way, by embedding it in some causal net, say B 2 = G 1 , P 2 , where P 2 ∈ P 1 so that B 2 ∈ B 1 . In cross 2, the F 1 hybrids are selfed and they produce F 2 offspring 75% of which is tall and 25% of which is short.</p><p>Obviously, if P 2 (GT 1 = ts) = P 2 (GT 2 = ts) = 1.00 and if P 2 ∈ P 1 , then P 2 (GT 3 = tt) = 0.25, P 2 (GT 3 = ts) = 0.50, and P 2 (GT 3 = ss) = 0.25, so that P 2 (P T 3 = tall) = 0.75 and P 2 (P T 3 = short) = 0.25. This corresponds to the data.</p><p>Finally, in cross 3 the F 1 hybrids are back-crossed with the recessive parental plants. Let P 3 (GT 1 = ts) = P 3 (GT 2 = ss) = 1.00. If P 3 ∈ P 1 , then P 3 (P T 3 = tall) = 0.50.

This fruitfulness will emerge in section 18, where I will provide a causal account of explanatory unification which improves on those of Kitcher and Darden. 26   Before we go to the next section, Let me briefly turn to Darden's more recent work on mechanisms. Darden now uses the label 'mechanism schema' instead of 'abstract explanatory pattern' <ref type="bibr">([2002]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[2005]</ref>). A mechanism schema is a 'truncated abstract description of a mechanism that can be instantiated by filling it with more specific descriptions of component entities and activities' <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Darden [2005]</ref>, pp. 360-1); see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Machamer et al. [2000]</ref>, p. 15). 27 They are often depicted in diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Darden [2005]</ref> information was crucial for the prediction and explanation of phenotypic distributions in classical genetics. In the interest of prediction, biologists like <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lazebnik ([2002]</ref>) and philosophers like <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bechtel ([2011]</ref>) have stressed the need for quantitative representations of biologists' findings at the expense of merely qualitative, diagrammatic representations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Casini et al.

As a result, one of their major advantages is that they can be easily used for quantitative prediction (both passive prediction and prediction of the results of manipulations). My approach is in line with this interesting work.</p><p>12 Incomplete Dominance  1.00 0.00 0.00 rr 1.00 0.00 r r 1.00 0.00 0.00 rw 0.00 1.00 0.00 rw 0.50 0.50 r w 0.00 1.00 0.00 ww 0.00 0.00 1.00 ww 0.00 1.00 w r 0.00 1.00 0.00 w w 0.00 0.00 1.00</p><p>Conditional probability tables 4-6, satisfied by all P ∈ P 3</p><p>Now consider a distribution P 1 (V 3 ) such that P 1 (P T 1 = red) = P 1 (P T 2 = white) = 1.00. 31 If P 1 (V 3 ) ∈ P 3 , then P 1 (P T 3 = pink) = 1.00. This corresponds to the data, so it may be assumed that B 1 = G 3 , P 1 , with P 1 ∈ P 3 , represents and explains this first cross. In the second cross, the F 1 hybrids are self-fertilized, so let P 2 (V 3 ) be such that P 2 (P T 1 = pink) = P 2 (P T 2 = pink) = 1.00.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13">Anomalies</head><p>The history of classical genetics is replete with theory changes to account for apparent anomalies. In the beginning of the 20th century, more and more exceptions to the principle of complete dominance were reported. In Darden's terminology, these should be regarded as model anomalies (as opposed to monster anomalies), since they required 'a change in the set of patterns for normal, well-functioning cases. [. . . ] either the alteration of a typical pattern or the addition of one or more new patterns to the set' <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>, p. 199). 33 Mendel's theory was not abandoned, but adapted. 34</p><p>In the structuralist vocabulary: crosses with complete dominance and with incomplete dominance are different kinds of intended applications, giving rise to different kinds of data structures, which are to be dealt with by means of different theory-elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balzer and Lorenzano [2000]</ref>, pp.</p></div>

They were model anomalies since they required a new generic credal net, B β = G β , P β , that substantially differed from B α .</p><p>14 Multihybrid Crosses with Independent Assortment</p><p>After presenting two monohybrid crosses with complete dominance, and one with incomplete dominance, Morgan turns to dihybrid crosses. He cites one of Mendel's well-known dihybrid crosses with Pisum plants on albumen colour (yellow versus green) and seed shape (round versus wrinkled). 35 Mendel had first crossed peas with yellow and round seeds and peas with green and wrinkled seeds. The resulting hybrids (F 1 ) were yellow and round. Then he self-fertilized the hybrids, thus obtaining F 2 plants which were yellow round, yellow wrinkled, green round, and green wrinkled in the ratio of 9:3:3:1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, pp. 7-8)</p><p>To explain the phenotypic distributions in the F 1 and the F 2 generation, Morgan takes the law of segregation and adds the assumption that segregation for one pair of elements is independent of segregation for another pair. This is the law of independent assortment <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 10). He assumes complete dominance for the pairs yellow/green and round/wrinkled, as in the monohybrid crosses. He adopts some revised version of the combination principle (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 9).</p><p>Finally, he assumes chance fertilization. Together, these laws or explanatory principles give rise to a credal net, say B 4 = G 4 , P 4 , the members of which explain dihybrid crosses on albumen colour and seed shape in pea plants. Let us see how B 4 looks like.</p><p>Clearly, the above crosses cannot be described by any set of variables that is value-isomorphic to V α or V β . Each phenotypic variable has four possible values: [P T i ] = {yellowround, yellowwrinkled, greenround, greenwrinkled}. Morgan refers these phenotypes to eight possible genotypes: [GT i ] = {GGW W, GGW w, . . . , ggww}; see table <ref type="table">7</ref> for the full list. The gametes have four possible make-ups: [GC i ] = {GW, Gw, gW, gw}. 36 (G stands for the yellow-producing allele, g for green, W for round, w for wrinkled.) Let V 4 be the set of these variables and let G 4 = V 4 , E be isomorphic to figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table">7</ref> and<ref type="table">8</ref> specify some of the constraints to be satisfied by all P in the credal set P 4 over V 4 .

This would mean that there are as many independent pairs of elements in the germinal material as there are possible characters. Subsequent work has shown, however, that Mendel's second law of independent assortment has a more restricted application, since many pairs of elements do not assort freely, but certain elements that enter together show a tendency to remain together in succeeding generations. This is called linkage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 10) More precisely, By linkage we mean that when certain characters enter a cross together, they tend to remain together in later generations, or, stated in a negative way, certain pairs of characters do not assort at random. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 10)</p><p>Genes that are linked belong to the same linkage group.

There may be some interchange between linkage groups.</p><p>This interchange is called crossing-over, which means that, between two corresponding linked series, there may take place an orderly interchange involving great numbers of genes.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 14)</p><p>As an exemplar, Morgan cites crosses performed by <ref type="bibr">Bateson and</ref> Punnett on Lathyrus odoratus or sweet peas (purple flowers and long pollen grains crossed to red flowers and round pollen grains). Flower colour and pollen shape in sweet peas were known to show normal Mendelian segregation and to satisfy the principle of complete dominance, with purple dominant to red and long dominant to round <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>, pp. 122-3).</p><p>Bateson and Punnett had observed that 'the two types that go in together come out together more frequently than expected for independent assortment of purple-red and round-long' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 10).</p><p>Because of the difference between linkage and independent assortment, there is no credal net B which is (i) distribution-identical to B γ , the generic credal net for dihybrid crosses with independent assortment, and which is such that (ii) its members can be used to explain dihybrid crosses on flower colour and pollen shape in sweet peas. We should seek a new credal net, say B 5 = G 5 , P 5 , with G 5 = V 5 , E and such that P 5 accounts for the failure of independent assortment.</p><p>Let us first have a look at Bateson and Punnett's data <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 11, figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). These results can be explained as follows. We know that the F 1 plants are hybrid, so P (GT 1 = GgW w) = P (GT 2 = GgW w) = 1.00, where G denotes the purple-producing allele, g the red-producing allele, W the long-producing allele and w the round-producing allele. 38 We may assume that complete dominance still holds between purple and red, and between long and round in the dihybrid case, so that we may rely on some variant of table 7. We may also assume that the combination principle holds.</p><p>Then all we need to do is to find the appropriate conditional probability </p><formula xml:id="formula_21">P (GC i = GW | GT i = GgW w) = 0.46 P (GC i = Gw | GT i = GgW w) = 0.04 P (GC i = gW | GT i = GgW w) = 0.04 P (GC i = gw | GT i = GgW w) = 0.46</formula><p>For example, by the principle of complete dominance the F 2 individuals can only have round pollen and red flowers if their genotype is ggww. Hence their fertilizing gametes must both be gw. The following calculations retrodict that 21% of the F 2 plants will have round pollen and red flowers (assuming chance fertilization). We know that P (GT 1 = GgW w) = P (GT 2 = GgW w) = 1.00. By the conditional probabilities just given, we can compute that P (GC 1 = gw) = 0.46, and likewise that P (GC 2 = gw) = 0.46. Given chance fertilization, The reason is that here G and w (and thus g and W ), tend to remain together, whereas in the original cross G and W (and thus g and w) did so:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">P (GC 1 = gw ∧ GC 2 = gw) = 0.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">P (GC i = GW | GT i = GgW w) = 0.04 P (GC i = Gw | GT i = GgW w) = 0.46 P (GC i = gW | GT i = GgW w) = 0.46 P (GC i = gw | GT i = GgW w) = 0.04</formula><p>How, then, should we characterize P 5 ?

All this is summarized in table <ref type="table">10</ref>.</p><p>P 5 thus is the set of distributions over V 5 that satisfy tables 9 and 10 (plus the combination principle and chance fertilization). (Note that the physical probability a may take two possible values and that hence the distribution over GC i conditional on GT i is imprecise. But regarding crosses on flower colour and pollen shape in Lathyrus odoratus, the physical probability a may not take a value between 0.08 and 0.92.) Other crosses, for example on Drosophila, also revealed linkage and crossing-over, but with different frequencies of crossing-over. The frequency of crossing-over for some particular pair of genes in some particular organism is most easily determined observationally as follows (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan [1928]</ref>, pp. 14-7). Let A and B denote dominant alleles; a and b their recessive counterparts. Let two grandparental individuals (e.g.</p><p>AABB and aabb, or AAbb and aaBB) together produce a double heterozygote (AaBb) (F 1 ). Perform the cross AaBb × aabb (the resulting offspring is F 2 ). Barring problems of statistical inference and barring cases of double crossing-over, the frequency of crossing-over is identical to the proportion of individuals in F 2 that do not phenotypically resemble any of the grandparents (called cross-over types).</p><p>Crosses on wing colour (yellow, gray) and eye colour (white, red) in Drosophila revealed a frequency of crossing-over of 1%. Other crosses in Drosophila gave other frequencies: 33% in white versus red eyes and miniature versus long wings, or 40% in white versus red eyes and forked versus normal bristles. If there are no cross-over types, linkage is complete.</p><p>In short, Morgan and his group observed all possible percentages of crossing-over, up to nearly 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, pp. 19-20). As a result, the generic credal net for dihybrid crosses with linkage and crossing-over (and with complete dominance) should look like the following. Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">B δ = G δ , P δ be such that (i) G δ = V δ , E is value-isomorphic to G 5 = V 5 , E</formula><p>, and (ii) any P ∈ P δ satisfies complete dominance, the combination principle and some analogue of table 10, where a ∈ {b, 1 -b} for some b ∈ [0.00, 0.50]. (It should be noted that the characterization of P δ should invoke one more principle relating to the linear ordering of the genes, see section 16.)</p><p>16 Double Crossing-over and the Linear Order of the Gene</p><p>Crossing-over may occur within linkage groups and the frequency of crossing-over may be estimated from the types of crosses cited in section 15. However, the Morgan group discovered a phenomenon called double crossing-over that leads to a systematic underrating of the frequencies of crossing-over. 'By double crossing-over is meant that interchange takes place twice between two pairs of genes involved in the cross. The result is to lower the observed cases of crossing-over, since a second crossing-over undoes the effect of a single crossing-over' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 20, original emphasis). This problem is solved by taking into account more than two pairs of traits.</p><p>For example, if a female <ref type="bibr">[Drosophila]</ref> with the following nine characters of Group I, scute, echinus, cross-veinless, cut, tan, vermilion, garnet, forked and bobbed, is crossed to a wild type male, and if the F 1 female [. . . ] is back-crossed to the same multiple recessive type, the offspring produced will give a record of every crossing-over. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 20)</p><p>Based on these results, Morgan draws a linear diagram depicting the corresponding genes in the linkage group <ref type="bibr">([1928]</ref>, p. 21). In figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, crossing-over has taken place twice. As a result, it seems as if no crossing-over has taken place between e.g. forked and cross-veinless, thus lowering the estimated frequency of crossing-over. By taking the intermediate loci into account, this bias is remedied.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: The linear order of the genes in Group I of Drosophila (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 21, figures 15 and 18). At the top, no crossing-over has occurred. At the bottom, crossing-over took place twice (between tan and cut, and between garnet and forked).</p><p>More generally, the Morgan group concluded that linkage groups can be represented linearly, with genes lying in a line 'like beads on a string' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 24). Evidence for this linear order came from two sources. First, cytological evidence showed that chromosomes were threadlike entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, pp. 38-44). As the assumption that genes are located on the chromosomes became more and more accepted, it was most natural to assume they are organized linearly. Second, genetic evidence pointed in the same direction in a way that is relevant for the characterization of P δ .</p><p>It can be assumed that crossing-over is the result of some interchange taking place at the level of the chromosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 39).</p><p>Though cytological evidence for such an interchange was not conclusive, it was quite convincing <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 44). Such considerations gave rise to the concept of map distance: the 'distance' between pairs of elements or genes on the same chromosome, measured in terms of their percentage of crossing-over <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 22). 42 The concept of map distance allowed to further corroborate the hypothesis of the linear order of the genes.</p><p>Suppose that crossing-over between yellow wings and white eyes occurs in 1.2 per cent of cases. If we then test white with a third member of the same series, such as bifid wings, we find the difference of their respective cross-over values. This is the known relation of points on a line, and is the proof of the linear order of the genes; for no other spatial relation has yet been found that fulfills these conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, p. 24, my emphasis)</p><p>Morgan's citation can be explicated as follows. Let i, j and k be characters of the same kind of organism, say Drosophila. Let the credal net</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">B ij = V ij , E , P ij</formula><p>be the set of causal nets that represent dihybrid crosses on i and j (and analogously for B jk = V jk , E , P jk and B ik = V ik , E , P ik ). If i, j and k are cases of complete dominance, then B ij , B jk and B ik are distribution-identical to B δ . 43 Finally, let a ij , a jk , and a ik be the frequencies of crossing-over for B ij , B jk and B ik .</p><p>If the genes belong to the same linkage group, then according to Morgan's findings either a ij = a jk + a ik or a ij = |a jk -a ik |. This imposes an important constraint (in the structuralists' sense) on the characterization of P δ : it expresses important connections between different local applications of B δ .</p><p>17 Causal-Structural Explanation</p><p>Let us turn now to the final part of this paper: the causal-structural account of explanation and its relation to unification. As we saw in sections 9-16, Morgan explains filial phenotypic distributions by means of a carefully chosen set of explanatory principles or laws and assumptions regarding the parental genotypes. As such, his explanations are a syntactic enterprise, a matter of derivation. But they can also be explicated model-theoretically. To explain a given phenotypic distribution, one tries to find an appropriate credal net B, satisfying the right explanatory principles, so that one of its causal nets can be used to embed the data in.</p><p>The label 'causal-structural account of explanation' covers both these aspects of explanation.</p><p>This account has a number of interesting characteristics. First and foremost, it is a causal account of explanation. The laws or explanatory principles invoked by Morgan are inextricably joined to the causal structure in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where this structure is defined in terms of <ref type="bibr">Woodward's (DC)</ref>.</p><p>It may seem strange to equate the explanatory principles of classical genetics with laws. After all, aren't laws of nature true, universal and physically necessary generalizations whereas the explanatory principles of classical genetics face numerous exceptions, have a limited domain of application and are highly contingent? No. By endorsing this claim, one would demand too much from laws of nature-in fact so much that it becomes questionable whether there are any laws at all in the special sciences. As I have argued following <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mitchell ([1997]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[2000]</ref>), explanatory principles such as those of classical genetics, need not satisfy the traditional criteria for lawfulness to deserve the label 'law' <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Leuridan [2010]</ref>). If they (or, more precisely, the regularities they describe) have sufficient stability and strength, 44 and if they are invariant under some range of interventions, they can be used (in particular contexts) for explanation (even if they fail to hold outside those contexts). The causal-structural account of scientific theories provides a nice explication of this view. The explanatory principles or laws of each (generic) credal net have a limited domain of application. Within that domain, they may be used for explanation regardless of the fact that they face exceptions (anomalies, see section 13) and fail to hold in other credal nets.</p><p>Another way to phrase this is as follows. Each generic credal net implicitly incorporates a set of ceteris paribus conditions which help to determine its domain of intended applications. Of course, these are not just any ceteris paribus conditions, but well delineated sets of such conditions, based on existing scientific knowledge. So it should not be feared that these ceteris paribus conditions make the principles of classical genetics trivially true. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pietroski and Rey [1995]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Earman et al. [2002]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Woodward [2002]</ref>; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mitchell [2002]</ref> for a discussion of ceteris paribus clauses.) For example, B α -B δ all assume that mutation does not occur;</p><p>and B γ and B δ both assume that there is no gene interaction.</p><p>A second characteristic of the causal-structural account of explanation is that it also is an epistemic and representational, rather than an ontic account of explanation. What explains is not the causal structure of the world itself, but causal explanatory principles describing that causal structure. The model-theoretic approach need not detract from that representational character, as classical genetics' causal nets are themselves 'simulacra' of real-world states of affairs (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cartwright [1983]</ref>, pp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>143-62)</head><p>. 45 To say it with a catchword: 'No explanation without representation!' Yet focussing on these models also helps to see that explanation is not merely derivational ; the causal nets in question have to bear the right relations to the ontic structure of the world. And it helps to illuminate the notion of explanatory unification; the causal nets in question bear interesting similarity relations to each other. Finally, the formal framework I use allows for an integrated approach to both the qualitative and the quantitative aspects of causal structures in a way that is suitable for e.g. prediction (see section 11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="18">Explanatory Unification</head><p>The causal-structural account of scientific theories allows us to get a grip on explanatory unification within a causalist framework. Today, Kitcher's anti-causalist approach is still influential in the literature on unification.</p><p>Yet in the past years, the need for, or desirability of, a causalist account has been stressed by several authors. Here, I will present the criticisms raised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mäki ([2001]</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Woodward ([2003]</ref>) against Kitcher's unificationism, elaborate my own proposal, and contrast it with Strevens' kairetic account.</p><p>Kitcherian unification consists in showing that many different phenomena can be derived from a small number of explanatory patterns.</p><p>The unifying power of a set of argument patterns varies directly with the number of statements that can be derived by means of its members, directly with the stringency of the patterns in the set, 46 and inversely with the number of patterns in the set <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p. 435). The patterns in the most unifying set of patterns over a body of scientific knowledge K</p><p>(called the explanatory store E(K)) determine what explains what.</p><p>Both Mäki and Woodward endorse the importance of unification as an epistemic virtue, but they are dissatisfied by Kitcher's approach. I go with them in several ways. I, too, consider unificatory power an epistemic virtue. It is a virtue which scientific theories may have to a greater or lesser extent on top of their being explanatory. I also agree with their critique of Kitcher. Yet I am not fully satisfied with their views either (for reasons to be outlined below). As I will show, the causal-structural theory of explanation adequately addresses their worries while providing an interesting and elaborate alternative to Kitcher's account.</p><p>Woodward finds the idea that explanation is a matter of unifying a range of different phenomena 'unquestionably intuitively appealing';</p><p>generality is 'at least sometimes an explanatory virtue'; and 'theory unification has clearly played an important role in science' <ref type="bibr">([2003], p. 358</ref>).</p><p>Yet he wonders whether our intuitive notion(s) of unification can be made more precise in a way that fits our interventionist intuitions concerning explanation <ref type="bibr">([2003]</ref>, p. 358). In his opinion, Kitcher fails to do so.</p><p>Unification may be an explanatory virtue, but it is not a sufficient condition for explanation: 'considerations having to do with unification do not automatically pick out those derivations that are explanatory from those that are not' <ref type="bibr">([2003]</ref>, p. 361).</p><p>Woodward's own proposal is to explicate unification in terms of ranges of invariance. A generalization's explanatory depth is tied to the range of ideal interventions under which it is invariant: the wider its range of invariance, the more explanatory it is <ref type="bibr">([2003], pp. 257-65)</ref>. This range of invariance is also related to the generalization's generality or unifying power <ref type="bibr">([2003]</ref>, pp. 366 and 373).</p><p>I agree that 'range of invariance' captures part of the notion of According to Kitcher, explanation is not a matter of describing causal relations in the world. Instead, causal relevance is dependent on explanatory relevance and hence on derivational unification <ref type="bibr">([1989]</ref>, pp.</p><p>436 and 499; see also section 4 above.</p><p>In Mäki's opinion, unification should not be (merely) derivational; it should (also) be ontological. 47 Ontological unification is 'based on the referential and representational capabilities of theories', not on their inferential capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mäki [2001]</ref>, p. 498). 48 It is 'a matter of redescribing apparently independent and diverse phenomena as manifestations [. . . ] of one and the same small number of entities, powers, and processes' <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mäki [2001]</ref>, p. 498).</p><p>Unification, according to this picture, is not just a matter of relations between credal nets (where distribution-identity is stronger than value-isomorphism, which is stronger than isomorphism), the stronger the corresponding phenomena are unified. But, and this is very important, all credal nets are isomorphic.</p><p>First, different crosses on a particular trait (or set of traits) in a particular organism are explained by means of a given set of explanatory way. Yet I do not claim that isomorphism of a theory's causal nets is a sufficient condition for that theory to be unifying. One may, after all, devise artifacts that have a causal structure that is isomorphic to figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> but which have nothing to do with classical genetics. To show that their structure is isomorphic to the causal nets of classical genetics would only be a kind of 'spurious unification' <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kitcher [1981]</ref>, pp. 526-9). The phenomena to be explained have to be in the domain of intended applications of classical genetics. This is not a defect of my account, but an unavoidable feature that it shares with the structuralists and with <ref type="bibr">Kitcher.</ref> From their works it is clear that there is no straightforward recipe, or set of necessary and sufficient conditions, for establishing a theory's domain of intended applications. As I wrote in section 3.1, the structuralist notion of intended applications cannot be defined in a purely formal way; it also relies on pragmatic considerations-see <ref type="bibr">(Balzer et al. [1987], pp. 37-40, 87-9;</ref><ref type="bibr">Balzer and Lorenzano [2000], p. 245;</ref><ref type="bibr">Balzer and Dawe [1986a]</ref>, p. 67). Sets of intended applications I are often specified by citing a few 'paradigms' or 'exemplars' such as stem length in pea plants.</p><p>All exemplars of classical genetics concern crosses of organisms with certain phenotypic traits, the resulting progeny of which shows a more or less definite phenotypic distribution. To be included in the set of intended applications of classical genetics, crosses of organisms have to be sufficiently similar to one of its exemplars (qua types of traits involved, qua resulting distributions, etc.). 52 What counts as sufficiently similar depends on pragmatic considerations. Moreover, the set of classical genetics' intended applications changed over time and frequently was a matter of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>, pp. 166 and 260). Likewise, Kitcher's notion of filling instructions, which he needs to avoid spurious unification, cannot be formally defined. Although he nowhere says so, it is clear from his writings that their specification has to rely on pragmatic considerations as well.</p><p>Isomorphism is not a necessary condition either. Define isomorphism class as a class of causal nets that are isomorphic to each other. While classical genetics has only one isomorphism class (all of its causal nets are isomorphic to each other), there may be scientific theories that have more than one such class and still are judged to have at least some unifying power. Yet I conjecture that, ceteris paribus, the less isomorphism classes a theory has, the more we would judge it to be unifying. A theory with less isomorphism classes posits less fundamentally different causal structures underlying the phenomena to be explained. 53 Thus, isomorphism for causal and credal nets and its stronger nephew, distribution-identity, serve to explicate our intuitive notion of unification in a way that fits the interventionist theory of causation and allows to reconcile derivational with ontological unification.</p><p>Let me conclude this section by briefly turning to Strevens' kairetic account of explanation. The claim that the causal-structural account of scientific theories allows us to get a grip on explanatory unification within a causalist framework may suggest that this account is similar in spirit to <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Strevens' ([2004]</ref>), at least prima facie. After all, Strevens also endeavours to 'unify the causal and unificatory approaches to explanation-causally'</p><p>(see the title of his paper). More specifically, his goal is 'a causal account of explanation that has many of the advantages of the unification account' <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Strevens [2004]</ref>, p. 154). Yet there are some important differences which reward further examination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Strevens [2004]</ref> focuses on explanations of events or singular facts, whereas I have been focusing here on explanations of regularities, yet the differences I mention carry over to the kairetic account of the explanation of laws and regularities; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Strevens [2008]</ref>,</p><p>part III.)</p><p>A first difference is that Strevens' use of the unificationist framework is not meant to capture the notion of unification, but the distinct notion of explanatory relevance. A second, minor difference is that Strevens' use of 'model' as a 'set of propositions' is a syntactic one <ref type="bibr">([2004]</ref>, p. 163), whereas mine is semantic. This brings me to a last and most important difference. Apart from classical genetics, which other theories would be suitable for the causal-structural account of scientific theories? In my opinion, the following three criteria are relevant (this list is not intended to be exhaustive). First, the theory in question should be causal in the interventionist sense. The concepts of intervention, invariance and the like should be applicable. Given that <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Woodward ([2003]</ref>) uses examples from a wide range of scientific disciplines, ranging from physics and chemistry, over biology and the biomedical sciences, to economics and social theory, this criterion is not very restrictive. Still, not all scientific theories may be suitable. For example, it has been suggested that the notion of 'ideal intervention' is not applicable to EPR phenomena in quantum mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hausman and Woodward [1999]</ref> A theory that seems to meet both criteria is general equilibrium theory in economics, which pictures the economy as 'a collection of economic agents who make supply and demand decisions over commodities, labour types and assets, in order to further their own interests' and 'studies the equilibrium properties of the economy, so conceived' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bryant [2010]</ref>, p. 1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hamminga and Balzer ([2000]</ref>) have analysed this theory within the structuralist framework and Woodward <ref type="bibr">([2003], pp. 233 and 355-6)</ref> suggests that the relations between e.g. supply, demand and prices can be analysed in interventionist terms.</p><p>The third criterion is related to the first: the theory should not violate the Causal Markov Condition (CMC), as that condition is one of the most central assumptions of my account. The aforementioned claim by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hausman Woodward ([1999]</ref>) is based on problems regarding the CMC in the context of EPR phenomena.</p><p>The CMC and its relation to interventionism are not undisputed. 54   Hausman <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">and Woodward ([1999</ref><ref type="bibr">and Woodward ([ ], [2004a</ref><ref type="bibr">and Woodward ([ ], [2004b]]</ref>) defend the link between the CMC and manipulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cartwright ([2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cartwright ([ ], [2002]]</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Steel ([2006]</ref>) offer a critical discussion. It has been also argued that the CMC may fail for a number of reasons (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cartwright [2001]</ref>, pp. 254-60; Spirtes et al.</p><p>[2000], pp. <ref type="bibr">295-7;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">and Williamson [2005]</ref>, pp. 52-7). One example is Cartwright's chemical factory <ref type="bibr">([1999]</ref>, p. 7). Suppose that a factory C probabilistically produces some chemical X, and that when it does produce X, it also produces, as a side-effect, a nasty polluant Y . X and Y always occur together (the one is produced if and only if the other is). The factory is a purely probabilistic cause: X (and hence Y ) is produced only 80% of the time the production process is active. In this set-up, X and Y are not independent conditional on C. 55 Hence the CMC is violated.</p><p>Different solutions have been proposed for this problem. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hausman and Woodward ([1999]</ref>, p. 562) suggest that maybe C has been characterized in insufficient detail. Another possibility is to treat the production of the chemical and its by-product as a single effect, to be modelled by a single variable (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hausman and Woodward [1999]</ref>, p. 564).</p><p>These solutions may be helpful in some cases; yet whether they always work, I do not know. My approach, in any case, would be pragmatic. The CMC should not be considered an a priori principle which is indissolubly tied to the concept of causation. It is a substantive-and hence useful-semantic constraint since it makes causal graphs more than mere dots-and-arrows. But it is also fallible. As a result, when applying causal nets for causal discovery, for causal reasoning, or for representing scientific theories (in a certain context), one always runs the risk that the CMC is violated (in that context). But this is no reason to dispense with the CMC or with causal nets altogether. Their applicability should be checked on a case-by-case basis. And if it is true that Woodward's interventionism fits many different disciplines, we need not despair. We have good reasons to believe that my causal-structural approach fits many causal scientific theories.</p><p>policy and control, whereas spurious correlations are not; see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cartwright [1983]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Spirtes et al.

Data are idiosyncratic to a particular experimental setting and hence not predictable or systematically explainable. For example, the phenotypic 3:1-ratio of tall versus short in the F 2 generation of cross 2 (section 8.1) is a phenomenon, an idealized statistical generalization. Mendel's data for that cross were 787 1064 versus 277 1064 , which is close but not identical to 3:1 <ref type="bibr">([1965]</ref>, p. 13). From here onwards, by 'data' I will mean 'phenomena' in the above sense. whether all explanation has to be 'ampliative', i.e. whether it always requires the addition of T-theoretical concepts. I would like to thank José Díez for pointing this out.</p><p>22 Abduction is a type of inference which is to be distinguished from 'deduction' and 'induction' <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Douven [2011]</ref>, section 1.1). Peirce ([CP],</p><p>5.189) defines 'abduction' as follows: 'The surprising fact, C, is observed;</p><p>But if A were true, C would be a matter of course, Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.' In classical genetics, the inference from phenotypes to genotypes was explicitly abductive and, given the CG-theoretical nature of the GT i and GC i variables, based on the explanatory principles of genetics itself. This does not mean, however, that the explanation being given is ad hoc. The explanatory principles were expected to hold in a wider range of related cases (see section 18 for an explication of this 'wider range of related cases') and they were explicitly tested by means of test crosses (see cross 3 below). In Waters' words: they were 'local inferences to the best explanation' <ref type="bibr">([2004]</ref>, p. 802). (Inference to the best explanation is a close nephew of abduction. A hypothesis A is the best explanation for C if it outdoes all other explanations for C.)</p><p>23 A reciprocal variant of cross 1, in which the pollen plants are short and the egg plants are pure tall, gives the same results, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mendel ([1865]</ref>, p. 9) discovered. These results can be explained by means of the very same set of principles: there is a P ∈ P 1 such that P (P T 1 = short) = (P T 2 = tall) = 1.00, and P (GT 1 = ss) = P (GT 2 = tt) = 1.00. Given that P ∈ P 1 , P (P T 3 = tall) = 1.00. This also corresponds to the data. In cases of sex-linked inheritance, however, reciprocal crosses do not result in identical filial phenotypic distributions. Such cases can also be modelled in my framework, but I will not do so here. 25 Generic credal nets not only resemble Darden's abstract explanatory pattern. They also resemble the structuralist notion of 'theory-element'.</p><p>Moreover, they also resemble van Fraassen's 'model types' (see van</p><p>Fraassen <ref type="bibr">[1980]</ref>, p. 44 and especially <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lloyd [1983]</ref>, pp. 118-21).

First, a single theory-element may (and usually does) satisfy more than one law or explanatory principle. Theoretical components are such explanatory principles. Hence theory-elements consist of more than one theoretical component. (In section 17, I will expand on my views on laws and explanatory principles.) Second, whereas theoretical components are inherently dynamic, theory-elements are more or less stable end-products of such theory evolution (but see<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balzer et al.

Definition 1 (Causal Markov Condition) Let G = V, E be a causal graph with vertex set V and P be a probability distribution over the vertices in V generated by the causal structure represented by G.

P T 1 is independent of GC 1 conditional on GT 1 in any P that is causally Markov to figure1; likewise, GC 1 and GC 2 are unconditionally independent.

(In other words, all distributions in P are distribution-identical to their image in P .)

Each of these causal nets is a model of classical genetics and explains the data (phenotypic distributions) at hand.In what follows, I will show how crosses on other characters in Pisum or with other genera can be represented by causal nets that fit in analogous credal nets, and explicate the precise relations between these credal nets.(This will prove to be fruitful when we turn to the discussion of explanatory unification.)10 Monohybrid Crosses with Complete Dominance B 1 's can be used to describe monohybrid crosses with tall (dominant) and short (recessive) Pisum plants. In the history of classical genetics, many other monohybrid crosses with complete dominance have been reported. In his Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden, Mendel discussed six more such crosses with Pisum<ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mendel [1865]</ref>, pp. 5-17). He selected traits relating to the shape of the ripe seeds (round, wrinkled), the colouration of the seed albumen (yellow, green), . . . Likewise,<ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan ([1928]</ref>, pp. 4-5) discusses the inheritance of eye colour in humans (blue, brown) as an example of complete dominance. These crosses cannot be described by the members of B 1 , since the set of variables V 1 on which these are defined is tied to stem length in Pisum. However, by slightly changing the members in V 1 , they can. Consider Morgan's case of human eye colour. Two phenotypic traits are studied, where brown is dominant to blue. These are referable to paired alleles in the germinal material, which Morgan denotes by br and bl respectively. (Morgan and his co-workers used a large variety of symbolic systems to denote alleles.) The results of crosses with blue and brown eyes in humans can be accounted for with the help of the explanatory principles discussed in section 8.3, viz. the law of segregation, complete dominance,</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>9) and distribution-identical (definition 10) to B 1 . Thus for any possible cross of tall and short pea plants, there is an analogous cross on eye colour in humans. And likewise for their respective explanations.Formally speaking, it is trivially easy to create a distribution-identical image of a credal net: just relabel the variables and their values. But empirically, the discovery that eye colour could be explained in the very same way as stem length, was not trivial at all. Hence distribution-identity expresses a philosophically interesting phenomenon (see also section 18).11 Exemplars, Abstract Explanatory Patterns,Generic Credal Nets and Mechanism SchemasThe relations between crosses on stem length in pea plants and crosses on eye colour in humans can be generalized to all monohybrid crosses with complete dominance. It is useful to introduce the notion of a generic credal net that serves as an abstract representation of all these similar crosses in the same way as do Darden's abstract explanatory patterns. Like abstract explanatory patterns, generic credal nets are obtained by abstracting from exemplars and they play a role in a theory's unifying power.Darden's notions of 'exemplar' and 'abstract explanatory pattern' derive from the works of Kuhn and Kitcher. Starting from<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kuhn [1962]</ref>, pp. 186-91), she defines exemplars as '[. . . ] concrete problem solutions in which a formalism (such as a mathematical equation) is applied and given empirical grounding'<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Darden [1991]</ref>, p. 18). Kuhnian exemplars, Darden argues, may serve to generate Kitcherian argument patterns.[They] may serve in the construction of abstract explanatory patterns or schemas[. . . ]. The patterns abstractly characterize mechanisms, which, when they are operating, produce observable data-points as output. Thus, fitting an observation into a pattern is a way of explaining it. A set of exemplary patterns constitutes the explanatory repertoire of Mendelian genetics[. . . ].(Darden [1991], p. 19)    </figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head>B</head><label></label><figDesc>1 and B 2 represent but two exemplars, and B α represents but one part of classical genetics. Obviously there was more to classical genetics than monohybrid crosses with complete dominance. After presenting Mendel's crosses and those regarding eye colour in man, Morgan turns to crosses that are interestingly different and which cannot be represented by means of B α . There are other crosses that give, perhaps, a more striking illustration of Mendel's first law. For instance, when a red and a white-flowered four-o'clock [Mirabilis jalapa] are crossed, the hybrid [F 1 ] has pink flowers [. . . ]. If these pink-flowered hybrid plants self-fertilize, some of their offspring (F 2 ) are red like one grandparent, some of them pink like the hybrid, and others white like the other grandparent, in the ratio of 1:2:1. Here one original parental color is restored when red germ-cell meets red, the other color is restored when white meets white, and the hybrid combinations appear as often as red meets white, or white meets red. All the colored flowered plants in the second generation taken together are to the white-flowered plants as 3:1.In passing it is important to note two facts. The red and the white F 2 individuals are expected to breed true, because they contain the elements for red, or for white, twice present [. . . ], but the pink F 2 individuals should not breed true, since they are like the first hybrid generation, and contain one red and one white element[. . . ]. All this turns out to be true when these plants are tested.<ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morgan [1928]</ref>, pp. 5-6) Morgan's explanation of these phenotypic distributions rests on the law of segregation, chance fertilization, and the combination principle.What is new, however, is the relation between the genotype and the phenotype. Let me jointly label the relations in the quote above the 'principle of incomplete dominance'.How can we account for this difference in terms of causal nets? It is easily seen that crosses with incomplete dominance are structurally different from crosses with complete dominance. Crosses on flower colour in four-o'clocks cannot be described by means of causal nets that are value-isomorphic (let alone distribution-identical) to members of B α , since the corresponding set of variables, say V 3 , is not value-isomorphic to V α .The flower colour of four-o'clocks has three possible states: white, pink, and red. So let me define V 3 = {P T 1 , . . . , . . . , GC 3 }, with [P T i ] = {red, pink, white}, [GT i ] = {rr, rw, ww}, and [GC i ] = {r, w}, (1 ≤ i ≤ 3).29 Let G 3 = V 3 , E be isomorphic to figure1.What about the probability distributions over G 3 ? The constraints generated by incomplete dominance, by Mendel's first law, and by the combination principle are summarized in tables 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Together, they determine the credal set P 3 (V 3 ) and the resulting credal net B 3 = G 3 , P 3 . (As before, chance fertilization is ingrained in the graphical structure of figure 1.)In line with section 9, the crosses cited by Morgan can be explained by means of members of B 3 . In a first cross, a red flowered four-o'clock is joined with a white-flowered four-o'clock. Morgan does not clarify which of the two is the pollen producing plant but, as reciprocal crosses again give the same results, we may assume that the pollen producing plant is red.30  </figDesc></figure>

Ontological unification is only incompatible with mere derivational unification. I agree that ontological and derivational unification may coincide. But Mäki's view is only partly satisfying, as he adds the following: My hunch is that this is a contingent issue; there is no necessity for the two kinds of unification to be related in one particular way or another. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mäki [2001]</ref>, p. 499) Mäki's hunch is plausible, provided derivation is tied to standard logical inference. In this respect I would like to take his side. Kitcher's argument patterns are phrased in natural language, but their expressive power does not exceed that of non-modal second order logic joined with probability theory. 49 Hence, whether they coincide with 'the causal order of things in the world' (where this causal order is not defined as a function of the explanatory relations), is a contingent issue. Yet if derivation is tied to causal reasoning, the tie between derivational and ontological unification is much stronger and Mäki's distinction largely dissolves. In this sense, his answer is but partly satisfying.</p><p>In my causal-structural framework, unification is a matter of similarity between a theory's intended applications and, relatedly, between its causal and credal nets. As such, it comes in degrees.

This definition is not watertight. In a given cross, all the offspring of non-true-breeding plants may, by accident, have the parental phenotype. Yet the larger the set of offspring, the less likely this is.</p><p>3 I will not discuss Woodger's work, since I will not incorporate any of his views below. To some extent, his work also suffers from the common lacuna to be presented in section 4. Where at first he paid relatively much attention to causation <ref type="bibr">([1929]</ref>, passim), he became more skeptical about using causal language in science later on <ref type="bibr">([1952], p. 194</ref>). 4 The T-theoretical/T-non-theoretical distinction should not be confused with the observable/unobservable distinction. The two distinctions differ both intensionally and extensionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Díez [2002]</ref>, p. 15).</p><p>5 Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kitcher ([1993]</ref>, p. 9) rejected thinking of science as a series of theories, defined as sets of statements, while at the same time sticking to the view that explanatory schemata or patterns are implicit in scientific practice <ref type="bibr">([1993]</ref>, pp. 82-4).</p><p>6 See also <ref type="bibr">(Balzer and Dawe [1986a]</ref>, pp. 58 and 62) and <ref type="bibr">(Balzer and Dawe [1986b]</ref>, p. 179) for a similar reluctance to use causal language. 7 Woodward <ref type="bibr">([2003]</ref>, pp. 360-2) criticizes Kitcher's theory as a theory of causation and explanation. For criticisms of Kitcher's theory as a theory of unification and for my solution to the problems raised, see section 18.</p><p>8 I would like to thank an anonymous referee for pressing me on this issue.</p><p>9 Causation is also deemed by many to play an important role in policy, manipulation or intervention. The consensus view in philosophy of science now is that causal relations are potentially exploitable for manipulation, mutation) only one kind of gametes can be produced, in casu GC i = GW . Second, suppose that GT i = GGW w or any other singly homozygous value. Then one chromosome will carry G and W . The other chromosome will carry G and w. Part of the gametes (say, x%) will not be the result of crossing-over. Half of them ( x 2 %) will be GW , the other half will be Gw. The rest of the gametes, (100 -x)%, will be the result of crossing-over.</p><p>Half of these, 100-x  2 %, will be Gw; the other half will be GW . Consequently, x 2 + 100-x 2 = 50% of the gametes will be GW , the other half will be Gw. Hence, the gametes of both doubly homozygous plants and singly heterozygous plants are as in the case of independent assortment (even though they result from strongly different underlying mechanisms).</p><p>42 Sturtevant equated one map unit (mu) with 1 percent recombination.</p><p>In honour of Morgan's work, map units are often referred to as centimorgans (cM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 105) Map distances are not absolute distances, since not all parts of the chromosome are evenly prone to interchange. Moreover, a crossover event in one region of the chromosome may inhibit a second event in nearby regions (positive interference). Positive interference increases as the genes in question are closer. This may be explained by physical constraints preventing the formation of closely aligned chiasmata. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klug et al. [2006]</ref>, p. 114)</p><p>43 Obviously, cases of incomplete dominance, codominance, etc. also conform to Morgan's observation, but the corresponding dihybrid crosses are represented by generic credal nets other than B δ .</p><p>44 Stability is a gradual notion. It pertains to the conditions upon which a regularity is contingent. Strength also is a gradual notion. It can be thought of in terms of covariance or correlation, with deterministic regularities being a limit case. <ref type="bibr">(Leuridan [2010], pp. 324-5;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mitchell [1997]</ref>,</p><p>pp. <ref type="bibr">S477-8, [2000]</ref>, pp. 259-63)</p><p>45 Although classical genetics' causal nets are possible realizations in which all of the theory's valid sentences are satisfied (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Suppes [1969]</ref>, p.</p><p>24), and hence 'things depicted by classical genetics', cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Balzer et al. [1987]</ref>, p. 2), they are themselves abstract representations of the real-world states of affairs.</p><p>46 One pattern is more stringent than another one if the conditions it sets on instantiations are more difficult to satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kitcher [1989]</ref>, p. 433).</p><p>47 See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mäki [1990]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marchionni [2005]</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Woodward ([2003]</ref>, p. 362) calls this kind of unification physical unification, but he and Mäki do not refer to each other's writings. 48 The notion of ontological unification is not wedded to an ontic account of explanation, as is evident from Mäki's use of 'the referential and representational capabilities of theories'. Ontological unification and ontic explanation should not be conflated.</p><p>49 Alleles and genotypes may be considered properties (of organisms) instead of objects. Then in a sense Kitcher's schematic sentence 'There are two alleles A, a. A is dominant, a is recessive.' is a second-order sentence. I write 'in a sense', since the quantifier indirectly refers to filling instructions (A and a are dummy letters, not common second order variables).</p><p>50 Credal nets here are defined in terms of Woodwardian causal relations (section 6) and laws or explanatory principles that can be conceived of in the sense of Mitchell's pragmatic laws (section 17), not in terms of mechanisms. I have argued elsewhere, however, that there need not be any tension between the former and the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Leuridan [2010]</ref>, section 7).</p></div>			</div>
