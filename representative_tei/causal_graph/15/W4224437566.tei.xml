<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the traditional methods, the low identification accuracy of cascade implicit causalities is caused by the lack of causal inference. To solve this problem, we propose a causality extraction model based on GCN to infer the causality of the text. It can analyze the cause-effect existing in the text and realize the deep extraction under semantic enhancement. First, the data are preprocessed, and BERT is used for pre-training. In the pre-training, the candidate entities are selected by entity links. The text encoding is used context semantics and embedding location coding. Then, the semantic dependency graph is used to obtain the relationship between entities. In addition, the nodes and edges obtained by the previous step are input into the first-stage GCN to extract the whole causality. Finally, the entity relation graph obtained by the first-stage GCN is introduced into the second-stage GCN for cascade inference. The causality of the cascade is inferred and extracted by a two-stage GCN. Experiments show that the model can find implicit causality more accurately generate new implicit causal entities on the original causality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Relation extraction gives a given text, extracts entities/objects, and infer their relations in the text, forming a triple ( S, R, O ). S represents the subject entity, R represents the existing relationship, and O represents the object entity. At present, entity relation extraction technology impacts all aspects of natural language processing tasks and has been widely used. Causality is one of the most famous relationships.</p><p>Traditional methods can quickly identify explicit causal entities, but the identification accuracy is not high because of the need for inference for implicit causal entities. At the same time, because of the uniqueness and diversity of text, the complexity of semantic structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the variety of expression and other factors, it is inevitable to increase the difficulty of inference, which leads to many potential implicit causal entities are not identified.</p><p>Given the above problems in the research on causality extraction, the following points are mainly considered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> Entity extraction. Previous work has proposed a key sentences extraction algorithm for Chinese microblog comments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which considers multiple factors attributes to identify the key sentences of comments. So this algorithm can provide technical assistance for entity extraction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Feature extraction and relational inference. In the microblog hot topic word extraction model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a feature cooccurrence method is proposed, providing a reference for causal relationship feature extraction and relational inference. (3) Causality identification, especially can effectively identify the implicit causality. Previous work has used ALN (Association link Network) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to achieve the hierarchical division of associated semantics. Learning the semantic information of the text provides technical support for causality identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Based on the above considerations, we combine BERT technology and GCN graph neural network to</head><p>propose a new model called the causality extraction model based on a two-stage GCN. Different from the traditional method, the proposed method identifies a potential causality between cascading causal entities by two-stage inference of GCN and extracts it. The motivation is that the network can learn more complex entity structures, capture more abundant local and non-local features and realize multi-hop inference of entities. The model framework is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, and the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as the following two points.</p><p>• Construction of causal entity candidate library. We use a combination of causal prior knowledge and semantic data to extract causal entities from the corpus. Cluster analysis of the extracted entities, and the same cluster of entities randomly selected as adjacent nodes into GCN. Firstly, the review text is preprocessed, and the sentences without causality or the sentences with default components are deleted. Then, the "NLTK" word segmentation is used to segment the words in the text. Secondly, using emotional intensity to establish causality seed lexicon. Finally, the K-means clustering algorithm is used for clustering calculation to select the final causal entity library. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 Input hidden layer classifier Output X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 hidden layer X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 Output X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 classifier (S,R,O)</formula><p>The advantage is that the two-stage GCN method can achieve better multi-hop relational inference and identify more implicit cascade causality. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as the following two points :</p><p>• Effective construction of causality candidate entity library. we take into account that causal entities often have phrases with emotional polarities. Therefore, the candidate seed bank of causal entity is constructed by emotional intensity, which is convenient for constructing entity knowledge base through entity learning.</p><p>• 2 Related works</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data preprocessing</head><p>The main tasks of data preprocessing include two aspects. One is to preliminarily screen the content of the text, delete the valueless information or unify the sentence format. The second is to mark the selected sentences. For example, causality pairs use cause phrases to represent a cause, and result phrases mean an effect. Since this article involves sequence annotations, punctuation is also annotated as words  Sentence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C C C O E E E O O O</formula><p>This paper aims to extract all the causality entity pairs, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Extraction of causality candidate entities</head><p>Because causality is usually a phrase with more significant emotional tendencies, this paper will prioritize the emotional intensity of the words. The existing sentiment lexicon, such as the sentiment lexicon of the Taiwan University of China and the HowNet sentiment lexicon of CNKI, are all familiar.</p><p>In the field of corpus sentiment analysis, it is impossible to judge the emotional intensity of some specific words accurately, so we need to build a corpus-oriented sentiment lexicon, as follows.</p><p>(1) Data preprocessing, cleaning, and removing incomplete and repetitive data in the corpus. The motivation is to ensure the corpus belongs to the same field. Stop words and special symbols are processed by word segmentation.</p><p>(2) The construction of the word vector model. We use the Word2Vec model in deep learning to transform words into word vectors, which build the foundation for constructing the subsequent neural network.</p><p>( This paper uses the neural network to construct a binary classifier of word emotion. It is known that the training corpus is emotional words, and the corresponding label is the polarity of emotional words.</p><p>Each emotional word is converted into a 100-dimensional word vector through Word2Vec, and the judgment of the sentiment polarity of words belongs to the classification problem. Therefore, we use the fully connected neural network to construct the classifier.</p><p>Step1: Determine the seed word set. According to the characteristics of the fields, the corresponding selection criteria are formulated, and the words in the corpus are extracted as seed words and added into the seed word set.</p><p>Step2: Determine the set of candidate emotion words. The seed words are converted into the word vector and calculated the vector of similarity formula (cosine similarity). N-words that are most similar to each seed word are obtained as the candidate emotion words set.</p><p>Step3: Use the trained classifier to judge the sentiment polarity of each candidate word. the candidate words with sentiment polarity are integrated and added to the sentiment lexicon for specific fields.</p><p>As for the causality in the corpus field, it may be positive or negative emotions, so we consider more about emotional intensity. Firstly, we calculate the emotional intensity of the causality, combined with the emotional intensity of manual annotation in the comment text. Whether a word frequently appears in the corpus and has strong sentiment polarity. When the conditions are met, it can be considered as a candidate seed word. The emotional intensity is divided into four levels: level-0, level-1, level-2, and level-3. The basis for the division mainly considers the following aspects: the completeness of components, the weighted average of the emotional intensity of each word, and the frequency of words that appears in the whole annotation corpus. Therefore, the following definition is given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1: Emotional Intensity of Causality Entity (EICE)</head><p>Emotional Intensity of Causality Entity is used to measure the emotional intensity of entity i in the annotated corpus. The sentiment polarity intensity of the causality entity is calculated from the causal word.

Ei represents the composition of the causality entity in the corpus (subject, predicate, object, etc.). And Wi represents the initial weight of the causality entity.</p><p>The emotional intensity values calculated by Formula (1) can be used to establish a causality seed lexicon, and appropriate weights can be given to causality entities with different emotional intensity levels. The emotional intensity level is mapped to the range of 1-4, and the integer is selected simultaneously. Therefore, the weights are 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2, increasing by 1 for each ascending emotional intensity level. On this basis, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the candidate seed lexicon, and the candidate causality entity set is selected. The specific algorithm process is shown as follows.</p><p>Algorithm The specific examples of the causality candidate entity library are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Construction of causality extraction model 4.1 Screening of nodes and edges</head><p>The representation of the reference node, candidate entity node, and meta-dependent path (MDP) node is constructed. MDP represents a set of shortest independent paths full reference nodes in a sentence. The representation of the candidate entity node is calculated as the average of the reference node and MDP node. At the same time, the dependency edges constructed by the syntactic dependency graph and semantic dependency graph are regarded as an adjacency matrix. The dependency syntactic graph created is centered on the core verbs in the graph. Therefore, in the input text, each sequence component is a node of the graph, and the dependency between words is the edge of the graph. In this paper, the HanLP tool is used to realize the syntactic analysis and dependency syntax analysis, and it is obtained as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Pre-training</head><p>Context word representation is usually trained on unstructured and unmarked texts that do not contain clear semantics with real-world entities. So it usually cannot remember entities other than these entities.</p><p>For each sentence, use the integrated entity linker to retrieve the relevant entity embedding and then update the context word representation in the form of entity attention. The key idea is to model entities explicitly and use an entity linker to retrieve relevant entity embeddings from the constructed entity library. The motivation is to form knowledge-enhanced entity representation. The model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. 10% of the words are replaced by an arbitrary word, and 10% of the words remain unchanged to predict a word.

In general, GCN accepts all the vertex feature messages transmitted from the former layer, makes corresponding transformations, and adds them together. Finally, an activation function is used as the output of this layer. For each hidden layer, there is formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">( ) 1 Re +   =+     l l u u u N u LU Wh b h (6)</formula><p>Here, ℎ 𝑢 𝑙 Shows the features of word u in hidden layer l, including all the words transmitted from word u and all the words introduced, including word u itself.

This step is to integrate the local structural information of nodes, namely the sum operation in the above formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> (for all neighbor nodes). And then do nonlinear transformation after gathering the previous information to increase the expression ability of the model.</p><p>The entity is predicted using the word features extracted from GCN, and the causality between entities is extracted.

Therefore, the second stage GCN is proposed to extract the implicit cascade causalities for long-distance multi-hop inference. The second stage considers the implicit features between all causal entities in the text so that the accuracy of the extraction is higher. In the first stage, a complete correlation weighted graph is established for each pair of causality. Where (w1, w2)is the weight of the edge to represent the probability that w1 and w2 entities are causalities. To extract the causality between each entity pair more accurately, the GCN in the second stage should carry out weighted propagation to achieve a more robust relationship prediction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental setup</head><p>The datasets used are from open source databases SCIFI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>、 ECauSE Corpus2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>、 CaTeRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>、 NYT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>、WebNLG <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. SCIFI contains a total of 1270 valid data, 1803 sentences in the ECauSE Corpus2.0 corpus contain causality, and a third of them involve overlapping relationships. CaTeRS annotates a total of 1600 sentences in 320 five-sentence short stories extracted from the ROCStories corpus, which all contain causality. NYT and WebNLG are datasets for relation extraction, which contain overlapping entity relations. Among them, NYT contains 1230 sentences with causality, and WebNLG contains 1420 sentences. The dataset is mainly divided into a training set, test set, and verification set, which are divided according to 8: 1: 1. The construction of the dataset is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>. We use SCIFI and NYT datasets to verify our method. To verify the effect of this model on causality extraction, the specific experimental operation is as follows.</p><p>Step 1: The causality dataset is obtained. The open-source databases SCIFI, ECauSE Corpus2.0, CaTeRS, NYT, and WebNLG are used for causality extraction. After denoising, 7323 sentences that are conducive to causal analysis are selected.</p><p>Step 2: Causal entity labeling. For the 7323 text sentences obtained, the causal entity labeling is unified. For the entities appearing in the sentences, the special symbol # is used to mark them, such as #entity#, and 7323 sentences with causal entity labeling are obtained.</p><p>Step 3: Candidate causality entity. Extract causality entity from a corpus and put it into entity library.</p><p>Step4: Extract the causal entity triples from the obtained review text. The BERT pre-training is used to convert the text with the semantics of each word into a word vector. At the same time, the entity linker is added to the pre-training, which can better learn the entity word vector. Then the two-stage GCN is used for feature learning. The first stage is to learn the local feature of the entity node, and the second stage is to learn the global feature. The probability of each pair of causality entities satisfies the condition for the threshold value.</p><p>To make the method more persuasive, we compare the models in many aspects. Firstly, the method is tested on multiple datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the causality extraction model. At the same time, this paper also conducts comparative experiments on other baseline models. Including Bi-LSTM+GCN, Bi-LSTM+CRF, 3-layers CNN, GP-GCNs, CNN+RNN, CNN+BiGUR+CRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, Bi-LSTM+Attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Experimental analysis</head><p>According to the above analysis, this paper did the following experiments.</p><p>The GCN model directly extracts the causal triples. The Bi-LSTM context <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> coding is mainly to  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. It can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref> that each overlapping entity needs to be inferred, and GCN can achieve this inference. But the effect of using GCN only once is less than that of two-stage GCN, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>. The number of layers of GCN is also an essential factor. To prove the influence of the number of layers, we also compare the models of different layers. It can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>. In the two datasets, the second layer has the best effect. Although the impact of three layers is also good, the time of three layers is significantly more than two layers. It shows that more layers are considered in the inference process will lead to better performance, especially when there are more entities. The above experiments show that the cascade causality entity extraction relies not just on local features but also needs an inference of global features. To get more comprehensive causal entities, each pair of causality entity are judged. The above experiments prove the effectiveness of this method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>For how to effectively extract causality, we propose a causality extraction model based on a two-stage GCN. This model mainly uses two-stage GCN to extract causality and analyzes all causal entity triples in the text. Especially the cascade implicit causality, to realize the deep extraction under semantic enhancement. The contributions of this paper mainly include the following aspects.</p><p>(1) The two-stage GCN has been proposed for entity relationship inferring. In the first stage, the local features of adjacent entity nodes are learned, and in the second stage, the features of all nodes are learned. The inferring of long-distance learning entities was carried out. Each pair of entities made causality judgment, and more cascade causality was identified.</p><p>(2) The causal entity library has been constructed. In the pre-training, the entity linker was added to find the three closest entities from the entity library so that the pre-training entity vector can learn more features. At the same time, it can better learn the features of the entity. This paper introduced the new concept of the difference coefficient of positive and negative corpus (DC-PNC) to judge the sentiment polarity of words. To a certain extent, the combination of PMI and DC-PNC improved the screening precision of new sentiment words.</p><p>In the future, the method in this paper can be considered to be applied to all relational extraction texts.</p><p>The causality extraction model based on two-stage GCN can help the software platform or relevant departments to extract the causality effectively. It can carry out management measures or coping strategies, help make the best decisions, and build the foundation for subsequent emotional analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Strong reasoning of two-stage GCN.
