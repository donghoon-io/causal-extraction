<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Time series modeling, a key area of academic research, spans diverse domains such as climate modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For instance, precise forecasts of traffic flow aid in optimal route planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, while climate predictions contribute to environmental protection and disaster prevention efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Moreover, precise forecasts of electricity consumption assist power generation companies' inefficient planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Thus, the precision of spatiotemporal prediction models is of paramount importance in enhancing service quality across these applications.</p><p>With the continuous improvement of data availability and computing power, the development process of time series prediction models has gone through several stages. Traditionally, time series modeling methods rely on parametric models derived from professional fields, such as Vector Autoregressive Models (VAR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models (ARIMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Then, the emergence of machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> technologies introduced a data-driven method for capturing time dynamics. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> have achieved great success in capturing relational dependencies due to their permutation invariance, local connectivity, and composability. With the continuous development of graph neural networks, people's interest in the field of spatio-temporal graph modeling is also surging <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. At present, spatio-temporal graph networks are mainly divided into two architecture categories, exemplified by DCRNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and GraphWaveNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. DCRNN combines GNN with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to extract spatial and temporal representations. In contrast, GraphWaveNet adopts stacked Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) instead of recursive structures, thereby improving the stability and efficiency of training. In recent years, some literature has focused on the joint modeling of spatio-temporal correlations based on Spatio-Temporal Joint GCN (STJGCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In the above methods, the primary challenge we face is overemphasizing correlation while neglecting causality, which may lead to the emergence of spurious correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the inherent mechanisms that generate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, as shown in Fig <ref type="figure">1 (c</ref>). Secondly, hidden confounding variables may cause confounding bias, which requires us to control by designing reasonable experiments or using causal methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, as shown in Fig <ref type="figure">1 (a)</ref>. Finally, the lack of consideration for counterfactual scenarios is also a problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, that is, how the results would change if the situation were different, which is of great significance for prediction and decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Take this scenario for instance: observing a surge in vehicle numbers during peak hours and a concurrent increase in traffic accidents does not necessarily suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship between these events. A possible interpretation could be that both shifts might be affected by a third factor, such as traffic congestion. Numerous spatiotemporal issues inherently encompass causal relationships Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> In traffic data analysis, (a) represents the unobservable confounding factors such as weather conditions, unexpected events, and holidays, which may affect traffic flow without notice. (b) notes that under the influence of these hidden confounding factors, the traffic volume each morning may vary, and failing to consider these factors could lead to spurious correlations. (c) describes a hypothetical causal structure graph where C stands for the hidden confounding factors, X represents the input variables, Z represents the mediating variables, and Y represents the output variables. Such a causal structure graph helps us reveal and understand how confounding factors affect traffic flow. In this way, we can attempt to isolate and control the impact of these confounding factors, thereby obtaining more accurate traffic patterns and predictions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Hence, a profound comprehension of causality is especially vital for understanding physical processes and guaranteeing the reliability of our causal forecasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Therefore, when modeling data, we should not only consider the correlation of data, but also delve into causal relationships, control confounding variables, and consider the possibility of counterfactuals. Only in this way can we obtain more accurate and reliable analysis results.</p><p>To reduce bias from confounding factors, we thoroughly analyzed the prediction process of spatiotemporal graph neural networks. We used causal inference techniques, especially the front-door adjustment model, to create unified deconfounding models for unobserved confounding factors. We treated invariant and transient features as intermediary variables, which are immune to confounding factors (refer to Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2 (a)</ref>). We used mediation analysis to estimate the deconfounded input-prediction relationship, P (y|do(x)). Here, x is the context-based input, y is the prediction, and the "do" operation simulates intervention, as shown in <ref type="bibr">Fig 2 (b)</ref>. The deconfounded prediction shows the causal effect of intervening on input x, not just observing it in the training data. We aim to predict future scenarios through "counterfactual", exploring potential changes in future states and traffic flow given changes in the current environment, as shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2 (c</ref>). The key to this problem is to effectively use upcoming external conditions.</p><p>To address these challenges, we introduce a Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Foresting Against Confounding Bias (CSTCB). Specifically, we propose a disentangled spatial attention network designed to capture both invariant and transient patterns within dynamic graphs. This network enables each node to selectively attend to its historical neighbors through an independent attention message-passing mechanism.</p><p>Inspired by the causal inference literature, we propose a front-door adjustment intervention approach, which facilitates the creation of a unified deconfounding model capable of addressing globally unobserved confounding factors. Furthermore, we propose a counterfactual analysis method aimed at reducing the model's susceptibility to environmental biases and emphasizing the importance of causal effects themselves.</p><p>Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• Initially, we explore the processes involved in generating observational data and construct a causal graph based on these data generation mechanisms. Following this, we suggest the existence of two distinct patterns in the data, namely invariant and transient relationships.  Noteworthy research in the STGNN field includes Graph WaveNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which primarily focus on graph-based multivariate time series forecasting. In recent years, various new STGNN paradigms have emerged, such as MT-ASTN <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> based on adversarial learning, ST-MetaNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> based on meta-learning, ST-SSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> based on self-supervised learning, STGODE <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> based on continuous spatio-temporal modeling, STDEN <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> based on physical informatics learning, and ST-GFSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> based on transfer learning. Building on the foundation of correlation, our research delves further into causation. We have developed a new modeling approach that utilizes causal relationships to analyze and predict data. This method not only considers the correlations between variables but also their underlying causal links, thereby offering deeper insights and enhanced predictive accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Causal Inference for Time Series Forecasting</head><p>Using causal relationships in time series data for future value prediction is a method of multivariate time series forecasting. This method not only improves the accuracy and interpretability of predictions but also handles non-stationary, heterogeneous, and high-dimensional data. Related work mainly involves the following aspects: Bayesian network-based causal inference methods represent the causal structure of multivariate time series using Bayesian networks and discover and estimate causal relationships through conditional independence and parameter learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Constraint-based causal inference methods use conditional independence tests to determine the causal skeleton and direction of multivariate time series without specifying a specific probability model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Gaussian process-based causal inference methods use Gaussian processes as a Bayesian nonparametric model for modeling and predicting time series data, capable of handling nonlinear and non-stationary data <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Neural networkbased causal inference methods use neural networks for feature extraction and prediction of time series data, capable of handling high-dimensional and complex data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Causal Inference for Spatio-Temporal Graph Foresting</head><p>Causal inference in the context of spatio-temporal graph foresting is a cutting-edge area of research that combines advanced statistical methods with graph theory to understand the directional relationships between variables across both space and time <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. This approach is particularly relevant for complex systems where spatial interactions and temporal dynamics are intertwined, such as in epidemiological forecasting or environmental modeling. In the field of causal inference, several models have been proposed to address the issue of hidden confounders in various forecasting and estimation tasks. For instance, CAPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> has been utilized for robust event forecasting and individual treatment effect estimation. Similarly, CCHMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> employs a causal conditional hidden Markov model for multimodal traffic prediction. The CaST <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> model is another example, which applies back-door and front-door adjustments for traffic flow prediction. In the context of bike flow prediction, STNSCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> uses the front-door criterion and counterfactual reasoning. CausalGNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, designed for epidemic forecasting, integrates a causal module with an attention-based dynamic graph neural network. Lastly, DCCF <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> offers a solution for recommender systems through front-door adjustment. These models represent significant advancements in understanding and mitigating the effects of hidden confounders in predictive analytics. These methodologies not only provide more accurate predictions but also offer insights into the underlying causal structures of the phenomena being studied, which is crucial for effective decision-making and policy development. In our research, we propose a novel approach that encompasses both constant and transient modes. The crux of this method is the utilization of the front-door criterion to calculate the causal effect of inputs on the predictive outcomes. This allows us to identify and eliminate confounding factors that bias model predictions. Moreover, we have introduced counterfactual reasoning, a powerful tool for examining the causal relationships between predictive outcomes and input scenarios. Through this reasoning, we can further mitigate biases caused by environmental factors, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Preliminaries</head><p>Our paper focuses on the task of spatio-temporal sequence prediction, using graph structures to establish relationships between different variables. In this framework, each variable in the data is considered as a node in the graph. The observations on each node are viewed as the features or graph signals of that node, which is a natural approach in this context. To capture the relationships between nodes, we use the adjacency matrix of the graph, which succinctly describes the interconnections between variables. Through this method, we can effectively model and predict the behavior of each variable based on its relationships with other variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Graph G):</head><p>The graph G = (V, E, A) represents the correlations between multivariate variables. Here, G comprises a set of vertices (or nodes) V ∈ R N and a set of edges E. Each edge connects two vertices, indicating the existence of a relationship between them. The adjacency matrix A ∈ R N ×N characterizes the relationships between nodes, with a size of N × N , where N denotes the number of vertices in the graph.</p><p>Indeed, the goal of predicting time-varying graph signals is to learn a mapping function that can estimate the future features or attributes of nodes on the graph based on their historical features or attributes. This process involves using the historical features or attributes of nodes on the graph over T h time slices to predict the future features or attributes of nodes on the graph over T p time slices. This approach allows us to make informed predictions state of the graph based on its past states, thereby enabling us to understand and anticipate the evolution of the graph over time.</p><p>Definition 2 (Stable Unbiased) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: Let A be a set of assumptions (or constraints) in the data generation process, and let C A be a class of causal models that satisfy A. If for every model M in C A , P (y | do(x)) = P (y | x) holds, then the effect estimation of X on Y is considered stable and unbiased under A. Similarly, under the condition of A, (X, Y ) is stable and free from confounding. Definition 3 (Confounder) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>: In causal inference, we often seek to identify the causal effect of one variable X (the "treatment variable") on another variable Y (the "outcome variable"). The causal effect cannot typically be estimated from the statistical association between X and Y in observational data due to spurious correlations caused by one or more variables. More formally, according to the standards of association in the literature, if there is a variable Z that is not affected by X but is associated with both X and Y , we say that X and Y are confounded. In causal graph or Bayesian networks, a "confounder" usually refers only to a variable that causes both X and Y , for example, according to the example in Fig <ref type="figure">1 (a)</ref>, we can consider weather, unexpected events, and holidays as confounders.</p><p>Although it seems intuitive, formalizing the concept of "causality" using the standard language of probability theory, or determining which correlations are "spurious" is not straightforward. To better study the causal relationships between variables, Pearl introduce a formal language called Structural Causal Model (SCM).</p><p>Definition 4 (Structural Causal Model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>: A structural causal model is a quadruple (U, V, F, P (U )), where U = {U 1 , U 2 , . . . , U n } is a set of exogenous variables representing factors or influences outside the model, not caused by any other variables within the model. V = {V 1 , V 2 , . . . , V n } is a set of endogenous variables, whose values are determined by other variables in the model. F = {F 1 , F 2 , . . . , F n } denotes a set of functions such that for i = 1, . . . , n, we have V i = F i (P A i , U i ), where P A i ⊆ V represents the parent variables of V i . P (U ) is the probability distribution over the exogenous variables U .</p><p>Every Structural Causal Model (SCM) is accompanied by a graphical representation that illustrates the causal relationships between variables within the model, known as a Structural Causal Model or simply "graph model". These graph models not only intuitively reflect the direct and indirect influences between variables but also serve as crucial tools for understanding and analyzing causal relationships. Through graph models, researchers can identify potential causal pathways, assess the effects of interventions, and predict the behavior of variables under different conditions. Therefore, SCM play a vital role in statistical analysis and decision science.</p><p>Definition 5 (Front-Door) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>: A set of variables Z is said to satisfy the front-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of variables (X, Y ), if 1. Z intercepts all directed paths from X to Y . 2. There is no backdoor path from X to Z. 3. All backdoor paths from Z to Y are blocked by X.</p><p>Definition 6 (Front-Door Adjustment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>: If Z satisfies the front-door criterion relative to (X, Y ) and if P (x, z) &gt; 0, then the causal effect of X on Y is identifiable and is given by the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (y | do(x)) = z P (z | x) x ′ P (y | x ′ , z) P (x ′ )</formula><p>In causal inference, the backdoor criterion is a method to determine if the influence of confounding variables can be eliminated by adjusting certain variables. However, if these variables cannot be measured or observed, the backdoor criterion cannot be applied. In such cases, the front-door criterion offers an alternative strategy. It allows us to control for unobservable confounders through an observable intermediary variable. For instance, as shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2 (b)</ref>, if variables I and T are observable and meet the conditions of the front-door criterion, we can adjust for them to estimate the causal effect, even if variable C cannot be measured. This approach is particularly useful in dealing with complex causal relationships, especially when variables are difficult to measure directly.</p><p>The solution to a counterfactual query is an individual-level answer to a "what would have happened if" question where all the exogenous variable sources had been controlled, leaving information to pass through a (modified) set of structural equations. Information about the exogenous variables can be obtained from observable variables already realized.</p><p>Counterfactual querying provides a powerful method to answer "what if" type questions. It achieves this by controlling all sources of exogenous variables and conveying information through a set of modified structural equations. This approach allows us to extract information about exogenous variables from observable variables that have already been realized.</p><p>Definition 7 Counterfactuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>: The counterfactual analysis involves the assessment of events that could have occurred under the alternative condition X = x ′ , given that the event has already occurred under the actual condition X = x and the result is Y = y. This can be mathematically defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E (Y X=x ′ | Y = y, X = x)</formula><p>When assessing counterfactual scenarios, three main steps are followed:</p><p>1. Abduction: which involves using the values of the observed endogenous variables V with X = x and Y = y to infer the posterior distribution of the exogenous variables U . This is a crucial step as it provides the necessary foundational information for subsequent actions and predictions. 2. Action: where if we assume X takes another value x ′ , we adapt the structural equation of X to accommodate this new hypothetical value, resulting in an updated model M x ′ . This new model will be used to simulate the scenario when X takes the value x ′ . 3. Prediction: the prediction phase involves using the updated model M x ′ and the inferred distribution of the exogenous variables U to calculate the counterfactual outcome Y x ′ . This outcome helps us understand how Y might change after altering the value of X.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Method</head><p>In this section, we provide an overview of our model's process, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We delve into the integration of causal inference with graph neural networks and introduce relevant concepts such as Structural Causal Models (SCMs), front-door adjustment, and counterfactual inference. Our approach is based on the assumption that hidden confounders can hinder model generalization. Therefore, we propose a Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> The CSTCB model framework primarily consists of three core components: the encoder, the decoder, and the counterfactual module. The spatio-temporal encoder includes multiple identical layers, each composed of two basic modules: a multi-head self-attention module for perceiving invariant time trends and another multi-head self-attention module for perceiving transient time trends, as well as a graph convolutional network (GCN) module for perceiving invariant spatial dynamics and another GCN module for perceiving transient spatial dynamics. The decoder generates the output sequence in an autoregressive manner and employs a masking mechanism to prevent the use of future subsequence information. The spatio-temporal decoder is composed of multiple identical decoder layers, each including a multi-head self-attention module for perceiving both invariant and transient time trends, as well as a GCN module for perceiving both invariant and transient spatial dynamics. The counterfactual module explores the impact on future predictions in the absence of historical information by transforming the output sequence of the encoder into a zero vector.</p><p>novel strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of hidden confounders. We compute the direct causal effects of inputs on predictions, mediated by invariant and transient relationships. Subsequently, we consider a counterfactual scenario by replacing the features of the historical encoder with counterfactual features. This replacement can be achieved through various methods, including zero vectorization, randomization, or averaging of historical features. The comprehensive model consists of an encoder, a decoder, a causal effect learning module, a counterfactual inference module, and a prediction output module. This approach allows us to make more accurate and reliable predictions by accounting for hidden confounders and considering potential counterfactual scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Strutural Causal Model</head><p>Our innovative framework integrates causal inference to predict future time series within a spatiotemporal context. It employs Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to clarify the causal relationships between the input X, hidden confounding factors C, mediation Z, and the prediction target Y, as shown in Fig <ref type="figure">1 (c</ref>). The directed edges in the figure symbolize these causal relationships. We propose that the spatiotemporal data X can be disentangled into invariant features I and transient features T, as illustrated in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2 (a)</ref>. This process captures the dynamic spatiotemporal patterns within the data. Furthermore, as shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2 (c</ref>), we consider changes in input scenarios and compute the causal effects between real and counterfactual scenarios. This approach mitigates the impact of environmental bias and forms the cornerstone of our framework. Consequently, CSTCB enhances the understanding and prediction of future time series in spatiotemporal environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Causal Intervention via Front-door Criterion</head><p>The hidden confounding factor C is a common cause of X and Y , as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1 (c)</ref>. This situation could lead to a bias in Y towards the general state, potentially overlooking specific environmental factors due to dataset limitations. This could result in an unfair bias in Y . However, causal theory offers a practical solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. We utilize the front-door criterion, which is based on the path C → X → I, T → H → Y . By severing the link C → X, we allow X a fair opportunity to incorporate the hidden confounding factor C into the spatiotemporal state H.</p><p>When considering the front-door criterion mentioned in Definition 5, it can be understood that Z must contain all the necessary and unique semantic information from X that is required for consistently predicting Y . Furthermore, the third condition emphasizes the feasibility of using observed training data to estimate the causal relationship from X to Z. Although these assumptions may not fully apply in practical applications, Z may still capture some unintended features from X. Typically, we adopt the standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) model, which applies to various datasets and problems. The crux is that the more semantic information from X that Z captures, the more precise our method becomes in estimating P (Y |do(x)). Based on these conditions, we employ the front-door adjustment to determine P (Y |do(x)), aiming for more accurate causal inference.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (Y | do(x)) = m p(m | do(x))P (Y | m, do(x)) = m p(z | x)P (Y | do(z), do(x)) = m p(z | x)P (Y | do(z)) = m p(z | x) x ′ p (x ′ ) P (Y | z, x ′ ) = p(i | x) x ′ p (x ′ ) P (Y | i, x ′ ) + p(t | x) x ′ p (x ′ ) P (Y | t, x ′ ) (1)</formula><p>We propose that the spatiotemporal data X can be disentangled into invariant features I and transient features T .

By evaluating the similarity between the query and all keys, we construct a weighted aggregation of the corresponding values. This procedure yields an updated representation for each element, allowing us to effectively model long-range dependencies across the sequence.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">DMHSAttention(Q, K, V) = ⊕ (head 1 , . . . , head h ) W O , head j = Attention QW Q j , KW K j , VW V j ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>in the specified context, the variable h represents the number of attention heads. The matrices W Q j , W K j , W V j function as projection matrices, individually applied to the query (Q), key (K), and value (V) vectors. Finally, the matrix W O serves as the output projection matrix.</p><p>However, since the traditional self-attention mechanism treats all time steps equally, it cannot effectively handle the trend information of traffic data. To solve this problem, this paper adopts the trend-aware self-attention module <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This module captures local trend information by using causal convolution. Causal convolution is a special convolution that only uses current and past information, without considering future information. Therefore, the trend-aware self-attention module can capture the trend information of traffic data. In addition, to more effectively capture the dynamics of traffic data, this paper also introduces a multi-head mechanism in the trend-aware self-attention module. The multi-head mechanism divides the input data into multiple parts, performs self-attention operations on each part separately, and then concatenates all the results. Therefore, the multi-head mechanism can make the model pay attention to different aspects of the data at the same time, thereby more effectively capturing the dynamics of traffic data. However, due to the uniform treatment of all time steps by the traditional self-attention mechanism, it struggles to effectively capture trend information in traffic data. To address this limitation, our approach incorporates the trend-aware self-attention module <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This module leverages causal convolution to capture local trends, focusing solely on current and past information while disregarding future data. Consequently, the trend-aware self-attention module adeptly captures traffic data trends. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to capture traffic dynamics, we introduce a multi-head mechanism within the trend-aware self-attention module. By dividing input data into segments, performing separate selfattention operations on each segment, and subsequently concatenating the results, the multi-head mechanism enables simultaneous attention to different data aspects, leading to more effective modeling of traffic dynamics.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Cohead j = Attention Φ Q j ⋆ Q, Φ K j ⋆ K, VW V j ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">Trhead j = Attention -Φ Q j ⋆ Q, Φ K j ⋆ K , VW V j ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>in our model, we apply the convolution operation denoted by ⋆ across nodes, with shared parameters Φ Q j and Φ K j representing the convolution kernels.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this research, we recognize that unseen confounders can result in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) complications and prediction inaccuracies. To mitigate this, we propose a novel methodology for spatio-temporal graph foresting, termed causal spatiotemporal graph neural network against confounding bias (CSTCB). Our methodology commences with the formulation of a causal structure model graph that encapsulates both the multivariate time series and the unseen confounders. We then implement a Front-door adjustment to the model, effectively differentiating between invariant and transient relationships within the input data. Invariant features could include the structure of the road network, while transient features could include variables such as weather conditions. This differentiation assists the model in learning causal features, thereby augmenting its robustness. To further enhance the accuracy and reliability of traffic data analysis, we employ counterfactual inference. This involves hypothesizing various traffic scenarios, comparing them with actual traffic situations, and thus mitigating the bias introduced by environmental factors. Upon evaluation of four public transportation datasets, CSTCB demonstrated superior accuracy, stability, and interpretability, outperforming 11 baseline methods. Looking forward, our model exhibits potential for application in other spatio-temporal data prediction tasks, such as cryptocurrency situation awareness, which we plan to explore in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2In part A, decomposing the mediating variable Z into constant features I and transient features T helps us better understand the relationships between variables.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Table 1 also reveals the following insights: (1) Time series models, such as VAR and SVR, neglect the spatial correlation, which is crucial for spatio-temporal traffic prediction. (2) DCRNN is an RNN-based method, while STGCN, ASTGCN, Graph WaveNet, and STSGCN are CNN-based methods, for spatio-temporal graph data prediction. However, they only consider the correlation of spatio-temporal data and disregard the causality of spatiotemporal data. Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 illustrate the performance of the PeMSD4 and PeMSD8 datasets across different prediction horizons. The CSTCB model has demonstrated its superior performance on these datasets, successfully achieving a good balance between short-term and long-term predictions, and has exhibited outstanding performance across all prediction ranges.</figDesc><table /></figure>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p>calculate the causal effect of input variables on the prediction outcome, effectively eliminating the bias introduced by hidden confounders. Furthermore, we propose counterfactual reasoning methods, analyzing the causal link between predictions and inputs by setting different input scenarios, thereby reducing the interference of environmental factors. Finally, we evaluate our method on four public transportation datasets, and the experimental results show that CSTCB not only has better interpretability but also outperforms 11 baseline methods, with a 2% improvement in MAE metrics for the PeMSD8 dataset.</p></note>
