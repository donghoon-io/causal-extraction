<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) plays a critical role in identifying the origins of system failures. A fault within any real-world complex system can severely impact user experience and lead to substantial financial losses. To ensure the reliability and robustness of complex systems, key performance indicators (KPIs) like latency, metrics data such as CPU/memory usage, and log data including pod-level Kubernetes entries are often collected and analyzed. However, the complexity of these systems combined with the vast amount of monitoring data can make manual root cause analysis both costly and error-prone. Thus, a swift and effective root cause analysis, enabling rapid service recovery and minimizing losses, is vital for the consistent operation and management of expansive, intricate systems.</p><p>Previous data-driven RCA studies, particularly those employing causal discovery techniques, have primarily focused on the construction of dependency/causal graphs. These graphs capture the causal relationships between various entities within a system High Disk Utilization Error/Warning and the associated KPIs so that the operators can trace back to the underlying causes by utilizing these established causal graphs. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, historical multivariate metric data was leveraged to construct causal graphs through conditional interdependence tests, followed by the application of causal intervention techniques to pinpoint the root causes within a microservice system. Furthermore, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> introduced a hierarchical graph neural networks based approach to construct interdependent causal networks, facilitating the localization of root causes. However, these methods rely solely on data from a single modality, thus failing to capture the intricacies of various abnormal patterns associated with system failures, ultimately resulting in suboptimal solutions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> illustrates an example of anomalous information found in multi-modal data related to different types of system failures. Some system failures, such as Database Query Failures or Login Failures, may easily elude detection if we do not harness system logs to pinpoint their root causes. Conversely, system metrics and logs collectively contribute to the localization of system faults like "Disk Space Full". Leveraging multi-modal data empowers us to gain a deeper and more thorough insight into system failures, emphasizing the critical importance of adopting a more holistic approach to root cause analysis.</p><p>In recent years, multi-modal learning has emerged as a promising way in modeling diverse modalities across various domains, such as natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, and computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. Despite its prevalence, multimodal learning for RCA is still largely unexplored. Recent multimodal RCA approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> primarily aim to extract information from individual modalities, often missing the potential interplay between them. This oversight is particularly significant, given that studies on non-RCA multi-modal algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref> emphasize the pivotal role of harnessing relationships between modalities to optimize generalization outcomes.</p><p>Enlightened by multi-modal learning, this paper aims to propose a multi-modal causal structure learning method for identifying root causes in complex systems. Formally, given the system KPI data and the multi-modal microservice data including metrics and log data, our goal is to learn a multi-modal causal graph to identify the top 𝑘 system entities that are most relevant to system KPI. There are three major challenges in this task:</p><p>• C1: Learning effective representation of system logs for causal graph learning. Traditional methods for learning causal graphs encounter difficulties when directly applied to system log data. Simply extracting statistical features overlooks the rich semantic information within the log messages. An intriguing approach is to employ language models to derive semantic insights. However, unstructured system logs significantly differ from standard textual data. They lack formal grammar rules and extensively employ special tokens. This divergence poses a considerable challenge when attempting to extract contextual information from log data using existing language models. • C2: Learning causal structure from multi-modal data. Relying solely on the extraction of common information may inadvertently overlook critical insights unique to a single modality, potentially resulting in the failure to identify certain root causes.</p><p>To enhance the applicability and robustness of the multi-modal RCA approach, the challenge is how to capture both modalityinvariant information and modality-specific information and determine the corresponding effects associated with system failure. • C3: Assessing modality reliability. Data collected for root cause analysis often includes noisy metrics or overwhelming redundant log messages. This can obscure crucial patterns, making it a challenging task to identify significant events within the noise. However, existing methods typically treat both modalities equally important, thus suffering from the low-quality modality scenario. Consequently, it becomes imperative to re-weight the importance of each modality in noisy scenarios.</p><p>To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose MULAN, a MULti-Modal CAusal Structure LearNing method for root cause localization. MULAN consists of four major modules: 1) Representation Extraction via Log-Tailored Language Model; 2) Contrastive Multi-modal Causal Structure Learning; 3) Causal Graph Fusion with KPI-Aware Attention; and 4) Network Propagation based Root Cause Localization. Specifically, the initial step of MULAN is dedicated to extracting effective log representations, converting log sequences into time-series data to facilitate causal graph generation from system logs. To explore the relationships among different modalities, we introduce a contractive learning-based method that extracts both modality-invariant and modality-specific representations through node-level contrastive regularization and edge-level regularization. In the third module, a novel KPI-aware attention mechanism is designed to evaluate the reliability of each modality and fuse the final causal graph, ensuring the robustness of the root cause analysis model, especially in the presence of low-quality modalities. Finally, we employ random walk with restart to simulate the propagation of a system fault and identify the root causes. Extensive experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p><p>Our main contributions are summarized below:</p><p>• A novel unified framework for the multi-modality root cause analysis method for identifying the root cause. • A novel KPI-aware attention to alleviate the issue of lowquality modality and ensure the robustness of the proposed method.</p><p>• Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p><p>The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as follows:</p><p>After presenting the background and preliminary information in Section 2, we introduce our proposed multi-modal root cause analysis framework in Section 3. Section 4 details the evaluation of our framework on real-world datasets, and the paper concludes with Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PRELIMINARIES</head><p>Key Performance Indicator (KPI). A KPI represents time series data that evaluates the efficiency and efficacy of a system architecture. For instance, latency and service response time are two common KPIs used in microservice systems. A large value of latency or response time usually indicates a low-quality system performance or even a system failure. Entity Metrics. Entity metrics typically refer to the set of measurable attributes that give insight into the behavior and health of individual services (or entities) in a system. The system entity could be a physical machine, container, virtual machine, pod, etc. For example, some common entity metrics in a microservice system include CPU utilization, Memory utilization, disk IO utilization, etc. These entity metrics are essentially time series data. An abnormal system entity is usually a potential root cause of a system failure.</p><p>Causal Structure Learning for Time Series Data. Existing causal structure learning methods for time series data can be classified into four categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> including constrained-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, score-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, noise-based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, and other uncategorized methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Our work belongs to the score-based category, which leverages the Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> to model multi-modal causal relationships between different system entities. One branch of score-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> aim to utilize 𝑝-th order VAR Model to capture the relationship between different system entities as they change over time. Given the 𝑇 -length timeseries data 𝑿 = {𝒙 0 , ..., 𝒙 𝑇 }, these methods utilize the 𝑝-th order data before the 𝑡-th timestamp to predict the value at the timestamp 𝑡 via the VAR model as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝒙 𝑡 = 𝑨 1 𝒙 𝑡 -1 + • • • + 𝑨 𝑝 𝒙 𝑡 -𝑝 + 𝜖 𝑡</formula><p>where 𝒙 𝑡 ∈ R 𝑛-1 , 𝑛 -1 is the number of entities, 𝑝 denotes the timelagged order, 𝑨 𝑝 ∈ R 𝑛-1×𝑛-1 is the weight matrix at the 𝑝-th timelagged order, and 𝜖 𝑡 ∈ R 𝑛-1 is the error variables. The underlying intuition is to predict the future value at the 𝑡-th timestamp by utilizing the last 𝑝-length historical values.</p><p>Inspired by the message-passing mechanism of the graph neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> combined the VAR model with the graph neural network to capture the non-linear relationship between different system entities by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X = 𝑓 ( ∑︁ 𝑝 𝑨 X𝑝 ; 𝜃 ) + 𝜖<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where X ∈ R (𝑛-1) ×𝑚 denotes the future data, 𝑚 = 𝑇 -𝑝 +1 denotes the length of the effective timestamp, 𝑨 ∈ R (𝑛-1) × (𝑛-1) is the learnable weight matrix shared across different 𝑝, X𝑝 ∈ R (𝑛-1) ×𝑚 is the 𝑝-lagged historical data and 𝜽 is the parameters of the graph neural networks 𝑓 . Notice that different from the traditional graph neural network where the adjacency matrix is given, in Equation. 1, 𝑨 is also a learnable adjacency matrix aiming to capture the nonlinear relationship between system entities. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> aimed to minimize the following loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">min(|| X -𝑓 ( ∑︁ 𝑝 𝑨 X𝑝 ; 𝜃 )|| 2 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Note that these methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> are designed for one single modality and simply extending it to include multiple modalities would result in the sub-optimal performance, which is validated in the experiment (i.e., Subsection 4.4.1 and Subsection 4.4.2). Problem Statement. Let X 𝑀 = {𝑿 𝑀 0 , ..., 𝑿 𝑀 𝑎 } denotes 𝑎 multivariate time series metric data. The 𝑖-th metric data is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑿 𝑀 𝒊 = [𝒙 𝑀 𝑖,0 , ..., 𝒙 𝑀 𝑖,𝑇 ] ∈ R (𝑛-1</formula><p>) ×𝑇 , the unstructured system logs 𝑿 𝐿 , and system key performance indicator y ∈ R 𝑇 , the goal is to construct a causal graph G = {𝑽, 𝑨} * to identify the top 𝑘 system entities that are most relevant to y, where 𝑽 is the set of vertices, 𝑨 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑛 is the adjacency matrix, 𝑛 is the number of entities plus the system KPI, and 𝑇 is the length of time series. For simplicity, we concatenate the 𝑖-th system metric and KPI together 𝑿 𝑀 𝑖 = [𝑿 𝑀 𝑖 ; y] ∈ R 𝑛×𝑇 † to illustrate our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY</head><p>We present MULAN, a multi-modality causal structural learning method for root cause analysis. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, MULAN includes four key modules: (1) representation extraction via logtailored language model; (2) contrastive multi-modal causal structure learning; (3) causal graph fusion with KPI-aware attention; and (4) network propagation based root cause localization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Representation Extraction via Log-tailored Language Model</head><p>The first step of MULAN is to transform raw system logs into time series data, making it easier to generate causal graphs from these logs. The main challenge is how to effectively learn highquality representations from these unstructured system logs (i.e., challenge C1 in Section 1). A straightforward method involves fine-tuning a pre-trained large language model with system logs to generate representations for log sequences. However, it's essential to understand that system logs are quite different from traditional textual data. They lack formal grammar rules, make extensive use of special tokens, and lack a structured format, which makes it challenging to extract the necessary contextual information. As a result, merely fine-tuning pre-trained language models on system logs often leads to suboptimal representations. On the other hand, it's vital to extract semantic information from log event content to obtain high-quality representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Unfortunately, most existing approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> fail to capture such important information, thus suffering from the performance degradation.</p><p>To address the challenge C1, we introduce a log-tailored language model (as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This model unfolds in three key phases: Phase 1: We utilize an existing log parsing tool (e.g., Drain) to transform unstructured system logs into structured log messages, represented as log templates. Phase 2: The entire system logs are partitioned into multiple time windows with fixed sizes. For each time window, we assemble a log sequence 𝑿 𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 , 𝑗 ∈ [0,𝑇 ] for the 𝑖-th entity. These sequences consist of unique log templates that occur within that specific time range. Rather than treating individual words in log templates as tokens, we treat each event template as a token, and the log templates within a sequence are organized based on their first appearance timestamp in ascending order. This strategy significantly reduces the token count and minimizes the maximum sequence length, which speeds up the training process. Moreover, it enables the encoding of semantic information into representations and models the relationships among log templates within a log sequence. We also consider the frequency of each unique log template, assuming that more frequently occurring log event templates carry more important information. This assumption proves useful in dealing with certain failure cases, such as DDoS attacks. In the event of a DDoS attack, the frequency of certain log templates may suddenly and dramatically increase, indicating unusual behavior. To address this, we include the frequency right after each log template, providing extra information for monitoring unusual patterns in potential failure cases. Additionally, we leverage log-based anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., OC4Seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> or Deeplog <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) to measure the anomaly score denoted as 𝑦 𝑙𝑜𝑔 . This score is used as label information to assist language models in learning better representations. The objective function is formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L 𝑙𝑜𝑔 = E 𝑖,𝑗 ||𝑦 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑖 -𝑓 (𝑿 𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 , 𝒄 𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 )|| 2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 𝒄 𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 denotes a list of the frequency of the unique log templates within a log sequence 𝑿 𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 , and 𝑓 (•) is the proposed language model that predicts the anomaly score. Phase 3: We train a regression-based language model by optimizing L 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (Eq. 3). The core of our proposed language model consists of a bidirectional transformer, followed by a one-layer multilayer perceptron for predicting the anomaly scores. We then employ this model to generate the representation of the special token [CLS], which serves as the representation of the log sequence 𝒙 𝐿 𝑖,𝑗 ∈ R 𝑑 for the 𝑖-th entity at the 𝑗-th time window. Note that the feature dimension, typically 𝑑 = 768 in traditional large language models, can be further reduced using feature reduction techniques like PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This reduction can potentially bring the dimension down to a much lower value (e.g., 𝑑 = 1 in this paper), facilitating the causal structure learning process. Therefore, for the 𝑖-th system entity, we obtain X 𝑳 𝑖 = {𝒙 𝐿 𝑖,0 , ..., 𝒙 𝐿 𝑖,𝑇 } ∈ R 𝑇 . The structured log representations for the 𝑛 -1 other system entities are denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X 𝑳 = [ X 𝑳 0 ; ...; X 𝑳 𝑛-1 ] ∈ R (𝑛-1)</formula><p>×𝑇 . Similarly, we concatenate the system log and KPI together X𝐿 = [ X𝐿 ; y] ∈ R 𝑛×𝑇 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Contrastive Multi-modal Causal Structure Learning</head><p>As previously mentioned, existing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> often struggle to handle multi-modal data or fail to effectively correlate  [CLS] is a special token used for downstream tasks.</p><p>different modalities, resulting in suboptimal solutions. Furthermore, exclusively extracting modality-invariant information may lead to a loss of valuable insights within individual modalities. To address this challenge (i.e., challenge C2 in Section 1), we propose a contrastive learning based method for extracting both the modalityinvariant representation and the modality-specific representation via encoder-decoder pairs. Contrastive Learning-based Encoders. Given the system metric data X𝑀 = 𝑿 𝑀 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑇 and the system log representation X 𝑳 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑇 , we first extract both modality-invariant and modalityspecific representation by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝑹 𝑣 𝑐 = 𝐸 𝑣 𝑐 ( X 𝑣 , 𝑨 𝑣 ) 𝑹 𝑣 𝑠 = 𝐸 𝑣 𝑠 ( X 𝑣 , 𝑨 𝑣 ) 𝑹 𝑐 = 𝛼 𝑹 𝐿 𝑐 + (1 -𝛼)𝑹 𝑀 𝑐 𝑯 𝑣 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃 𝑣 (𝑹 𝑣 𝑐 )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑣 ∈ {𝑀, 𝐿} represents the two modalities, 𝑹 𝑣 𝑐 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑚×𝑑 1 denotes the modality-invariant representation extracted from the 𝑣-th modality, 𝑹 𝑣 𝑠 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑚×𝑑 1 represents the modality-specific representation from the 𝑣-th modality, and 𝑚 is the length of the effective timestamps. 𝑹 𝑐 is the combined modality-invariant representation, 𝑯 𝑣 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑑 2 can be viewed as the entity representations, while 𝑑 1 and 𝑑 2 denote the hidden feature dimensions. And 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1] is a constant parameter balancing two modality-invariant representations.</p><p>Here, we employ GraphSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> as the backbone for both 𝐸 𝑣 𝑐 and 𝐸 𝑣 𝑠 to extract modality-invariant representation and modalityspecific representation, respectively. And 𝑀𝐿𝑃 𝑣 (•) is a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) used to map the representation 𝑅 𝐿 𝑐 and 𝑅 𝑀 𝑐 to another latent space to get the entity representations. It's important to note that, in contrast to traditional graph neural networks, where the adjacency matrix is predefined, in Eq. 4, 𝑨 𝑣 is also a learnable adjacency matrix designed to capture the non-linear relationships among system entities.</p><p>To ensure mutual information agreement between the modalityinvariant representations extracted from both metric and log data, we propose maximizing the mutual information between these two representations using contrastive learning regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 = - 1 𝑛 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 sim(𝐻 𝑀 𝑖 , 𝐻 𝐿 𝑖 ) 𝑘 sim(𝐻 𝑀 𝑖 , 𝐻 𝐿 𝑘 )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where sim(𝐻 𝑀 𝑖 , 𝐻 𝐿 𝑘 ) =</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝐻 𝑀 𝑖 (𝐻 𝐿 𝑘 ) 𝑇 |𝐻 𝑀 𝑖 | |𝐻 𝑀 𝑘 |</formula><p>is the cosine similarity measurement between two entity representations 𝐻 𝐿 𝑖 and 𝐻 𝑀 𝑘 . To ensure that there is no information overlapping between the modality-invariant and modality-specific representations, we leverage the orthogonal constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L 𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ = ∑︁ 𝑣 ∈ {𝑀,𝐿} 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 ||(𝑹 𝑣 𝑠,𝑖 ) 𝑇 𝑹 𝑣 𝑐,𝑖 || 2 𝐹<label>(6)</label></formula><p>However, minimizing L 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 and L 𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ alone cannot guarantee that the modality-invariant representations contain only information relevant to learning causal graphs. To further ensure the quality of modality-invariant representations, we propose predicting the adjacency matrix of the causal graph based on the representation of edges as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 = ∑︁ 𝑣 ∈ {𝑀,𝐿} ∑︁ 𝑖,𝑗 ||𝐺 (𝒆 𝑣 𝑖 𝑗 ) -𝐴 𝑣 𝑖 𝑗 || 2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where 𝒆 𝑣 𝑖 𝑗 = [𝐻 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝐻 𝑣 𝑗 ] denotes the concatenation of the representations of two entities, and 𝐺 (•) is a one-layer MLP followed by the sigmoid activation function used to predict the existence of an edge in 𝐴 𝑣 . Note that the causal graph (e.g., G 𝑣 = {𝑽, 𝑨 𝑣 }) includes both the system entities and the system KPI. Encoding the topological structure of the causal graph in Eq. 7 allows us to better capture the relationship between the root causes and the system KPI. VAR-based Decoders. After extracting both modality-invariant and modality-specific representations, we aim to predict the future value X 𝑣 with the previous 𝑝-th lagged data X 𝑣 via VAR model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L 𝑣𝑎𝑟 = ∑︁ 𝑣 ∈ {𝑀,𝐿} || X 𝑣 -𝐷 𝑣 (𝑹 𝑐 + 𝑹 𝑣 𝑠 )|| 2<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Similarly, we choose GraphSage as the backbone for the decoder 𝐷 𝑣 (•).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Causal Graph Fusion with KPI-Aware Attention</head><p>From the metric decoder and log decoder, we can obtain the causal graph G 𝑀 and the causal graph G 𝐿 , respectively. Combining these two causal graphs through simple addition is not suitable, as it may lead to dense and cyclical graphs. Furthermore, in scenarios with low-quality modalities (as discussed in challenge C3 in Section 1), treating both modalities as equally important would yield undesirable results. Following the assumption that KPI is highly associated with the root cause <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, we propose a KPI-aware attention-based causal graph fusion. This module measures the cross-correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> between the raw feature of each entity for each modality and the KPI to alleviate the potential negative impact of low-quality modalities by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝒔 𝑣 = max 𝑝 ∈ [0,𝜏 ] (𝑿 𝑣 ⊙ y)(𝑝) = max 𝑝 ∈ [0,𝜏 ] ∫ +∞ 𝑡 =0 𝑿 𝑣 (𝑡 + 𝑝) • y(𝑡)𝑑𝑡 (9)</formula><p>where 𝑝 represents the time lag and 𝜏 is the maximum time lag. Intuitively, 𝒔 𝑣 quantifies the maximum similarity between each entity and the KPI while considering a time lag of up to 𝜏. A higher value of 𝒔 𝑣 indicates a stronger causal relationship between the system entity and the KPI. Given that the temporal patterns of the top 𝑘 entities within a high-quality modality are expected to closely resemble the temporal pattern of the KPI, and that smaller values of 𝒔 𝑣 typically indicate low-quality modalities, we employ 𝒔 𝑣 to measure the importance of each modality as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">𝑎 𝑣 = 𝜎 ( ∑︁ 𝑖 ∈𝑖𝑑𝑥 𝑣 𝒔 𝑣 𝑖 ) = 𝑒 𝑖 ∈𝑖𝑑𝑥 𝑣 𝒔 𝑣 𝑖 𝑒 𝑖 ∈𝑖𝑑𝑥 𝐿 𝒔 𝐿 𝑖 + 𝑒 𝑖 ∈𝑖𝑑𝑥 𝑀 𝒔 𝑀 𝑖 𝑖𝑑𝑥 𝑣 = Topk(𝒔 𝑣 [-1, :]; 𝑘)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where 𝜎 (•) is the softmax function. We validate this assumption in Section 4.4.2. Notably, we can leverage the modality importance score 𝑎 𝑣 to replace the hyper-parameter 𝛼 in Eq. 4 and get the final fused adjacency matrix for the causal graph G as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">𝑹 𝑐 = 𝑎 𝐿 𝑹 𝐿 𝑐 + 𝑎 𝑀 𝑹 𝑀 𝑐 𝑨 = 𝑎 𝐿 𝑨 𝐿 + 𝑎 𝑀 𝑨 𝑀<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Optimization. Therefore, the final objective function is written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L = 𝜆 1 L 𝑣𝑎𝑟 +𝜆 2 L 𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ +𝜆 3 L 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 +𝜆 4 L 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 +𝜆 5 ||𝑨|| 1 +ℎ(𝑨)<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where || • || 1 is the sparsity constraint imposed on the adjacency matrix. The trace exponential function ℎ(𝑨) = (𝑡𝑟 (𝑒 𝑨 * 𝑨 ) -𝑛) = 0 holds if and only if 𝑨 is acyclic <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, where * denotes Hadamard product of two matrices. 𝜆 1 , 𝜆 2 , 𝜆 3 , 𝜆 4 , and 𝜆 5 are the positive constant hyper-parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Network Propagation based Root Cause Localization</head><p>The final fused causal graph G = {𝑽, 𝑨}, 𝑨 ∈ R 𝑛×𝑛 consists of two types of nodes: system entities and system KPI. Malfunctioning effects can propagate from the root cause to its neighboring entities, meaning that the first-order neighbors of system KPIs may not necessarily be the root causes. To pinpoint the root cause, we first derive the transition probability matrix based on the causal graph G and then employ a random walk with restart method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> to mimic the propagation patterns of malfunctions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Performance Evaluation</head><p>4.4.1 Experimental Results. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, and 4 present a comprehensive performance evaluation of all methods. For methods exclusively designed for a single modality (e.g., PC, C-LSTM, REA-SON, Dynotears, and GOLEM), we assess their performance in both single-modality scenarios (e.g., system metrics only or system logs only) and the multi-modality case. To enable multi-modality modeling, we initially convert the system logs into time-series data using the Regression-based language model introduced in Section 3.1. This time-series data is then treated as an additional system metric for evaluation. We calculate an average ranking score based on the evaluation of different system metrics as the final result for all single-modality methods and MULAN. Our observations are as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> In contrast to single-modality scenarios, most baseline methods demonstrate improved performance when leveraging multi-modality data across three distinct datasets and various metrics.</p><p>(2) MULAN consistently outperforms all baseline methods across the three datasets. Notably, MULAN exhibits a remarkable improvement in MRR on the Product Review dataset, surpassing the second competitor (i.e., REASON) by 12.5%. Furthermore, on the Online Boutique dataset, MULAN outperforms Nezha, achieving improvements of over 13.2% and 8% with respect to MRR and MAP@5, respectively. This superiority can be attributed to MULAN's adeptness in exploring correlations among different modalities and its robust KPI-aware attention mechanism, while all baseline methods, including REASON and Nezha, fall short in this regard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Case Study.</head><p>In this case study, we aim to demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method in the context of low-quality modality scenarios. It's important to distinguish this setup from the experimental configuration detailed in Section 4.4.1, where multiple system metrics were utilized. In this case study, we keep the representation of the system log constant and only select a single system metric to investigate its impact on the performance of all models. The procedure unfolds as follows: Initially, we assess the performance of each single-modality baseline method using distinct system metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, transmit rate, etc). Subsequently, we identify the system metric with the highest median ranking score as the high-quality metric, denoted as 𝑀 + , and the system metric with the lowest median ranking score as the low-quality metric, denoted as 𝑀 -. We evaluate all methods' performance on the Product Review Dataset and present the results in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3 (a</ref>) and (b). Notably, the performance of the log-only setting can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Additionally, to underscore the robustness of MULAN, we also examine the weights assigned to the two modalities, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3 (c)</ref>.</p><p>We have four key observations: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. REASON and C-LSTM demonstrate impressive results on the Product Review dataset when utilizing a high-quality metric. However, their performance undergoes a significant decline when the high-quality metric is substituted with the low-quality system metric, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3 (a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Comparing Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3 (a</ref>) and 3 (b) reveals that the performance of most baseline methods improves when incorporating system logs, regardless of whether the chosen system metric is of high or low quality. This underscores the value of integrating multiple modalities for enhanced performance. (3). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> (b), the performance of most baseline methods experiences a notable decrease when replacing the high-quality metric with the low-quality one. Remarkably, our proposed method (MULAN) consistently maintains robust and promising performance in such scenarios. (4) In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> (c), when the high-quality system metric (𝑀 + or blue bar) is replaced by the low-quality system metric (𝑀 -or green bar), MULAN dynamically adjusts the weight assigned to the system     <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>metric in all four cases. This adaptability ensures that MULAN does not overly rely on any specific metric modality. Findings 3 and 4 underscore the effectiveness of the KPI-aware attention mechanism and the inherent robustness of the proposed method.  In this subsection, we conduct an ablation study to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of each component within the overarching objective function (Eq. 12). We consider four distinct variants of MULAN: MULAN-V, which excludes the VAR models responsible for modeling temporal dependencies among diverse system entities; MULAN-O, which disregards the orthogonal constraint (L 𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ ); MULAN-N, which omits the extraction of modality-invariant information by excluding the node loss (L 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 ) from the objective function; and MULAN-E, which removes the edge loss (L 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ). A comparative analysis of MULAN against its variants consistently reveals performance degradation when any component is removed from the proposed method. For example, removing the edge loss induces a performance drop of 16.7% and 23.3% on the Product Review and Online Boutique datasets, respectively. Similarly, excluding the node loss results in an 18.7% performance reduction on the Product Review dataset. These findings underscore the pivotal role of each component in ensuring the overall effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></div>

Notably, in the context of the microservice systems, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> constructed a dependency graph based on system architecture knowledge and proposed a regression-based hypothesis testing to identify the root cause.

Different from the existing works that primarily focus on unimodal data (e.g., system metrics data), MULAN is a multimodal learning approach that extracts both modality-invariant and modality-specific information to enhance RCA performance.</p><p>Multi-modal Learning. Multi-modal learning has been extensively studied across various domains, such as natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, and computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>.

Nevertheless, in the context of RCA, the exploration of multi-modal RCA remains in a nascent stage. Research presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> has attempted to extract information from multi-modal data for root cause analysis. Regrettably, these studies primarily focus on each modality as a standalone entity, overlooking the intricate interconnections between them. In contrast, this paper systematically examines the interplay between different modalities, specifically between time-series data and unstructured text data, and co-constructs a comprehensive causal graph for root cause localization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we investigated the challenging problem of multimodal root cause localization in microservice systems. We proposed MULAN, a unified framework for localizing root causes by colearning a causal graph from multi-modal data. MULAN leverages a log-tailored language model to facilitate causal graph generation from system logs. To explore the relationships among different modalities, both modality-invariant and modality-specific representations were extracted through node-level contrastive regularization and edge-level regularization. Additionally, we introduced a KPI-aware attention mechanism to assess modality reliability and facilitate the co-learning of the final causal graph. We validated the effectiveness of MULAN through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. A promising direction for future work is extending MULAN to handle streaming data in an online setting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The overview of the proposed framework MULAN.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>4.4.3 Parameter Analysis.In this subsection, we conduct a thorough analysis of the parameter sensitivity of MULAN framework on the Product Review dataset. We specifically examine the impact of variations in five parameters: 𝜆 1 , 𝜆 2 , 𝜆 3 , 𝜆 4 , and 𝜆 5 . Our study involves individually adjusting the value of each parameter while keeping the remaining four fixed. Figure4presents the experimental results in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), where the x-axis represents log(𝜆 𝑖 ), 𝑖 ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and the y-axis represents MRR. Notably, a substantial value for 𝜆 1 (e.g., 𝜆 1 = 50) tends to yield superior performance, highlighting the crucial role of the VAR model in capturing temporal dependencies among diverse system entities. For 𝜆 2 , MULAN achieves the best performance when 𝜆 2 is set to 1, with a noticeable decline in performance as 𝜆 2 increases. This suggests a delicate balance in the contribution of 𝜆 2 to the overall model effectiveness. Regarding 𝜆 3 and 𝜆 4 , optimal performance is observed when both are set to 20, underscoring their critical role in achieving superior results. Similarly, the best performance for MULAN aligns with a smaller value for 𝜆</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> </p>, e.g., 𝜆 5 = 0.1. Further decreasing 𝜆 5 results in a decline in performance, highlighting the importance of sparse regularization in the loss function.</p></note></figure>
