<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many research questions concern treatment effects on outcomes that can recur several times in the same individual. For example, medical researchers are interested in treatment effects on hospitalizations in heart failure patients and sports injuries in athletes. Competing events, such as death, complicate causal inference in studies of recurrent events because once a competing event occurs, an individual cannot have more recurrent events. Several statistical estimands have been studied in recurrent event settings, with and without competing events. However, the causal interpretations of these estimands, and the conditions that are required to identify these estimands from observed data, have yet to be formalized. Here we use a formal framework for causal inference to formulate several causal estimands in recurrent event settings, with and without competing events. When competing events exist, we clarify when commonly used classical statistical estimands can be interpreted as causal quantities from the causal mediation literature, such as (controlled) direct effects and total effects. Furthermore, we show that recent results on interventionist mediation estimands allow us to define new causal estimands with recurrent and competing events that may be of particular clinical relevance in many subject matter settings. We use causal directed acyclic graphs and single world intervention graphs to illustrate how to reason about identification conditions for the various causal estimands based on subject matter knowledge. Furthermore, using results on counting processes, we show that our causal estimands and their identification conditions, which are articulated in discrete time, converge to classical continuous time counterparts in the limit of fine discretizations of time. We propose estimators and establish their consistency for the various identifying function-B Matias Janvin</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Practitioners and researchers are often interested in treatment effects on outcomes that can recur in the same individual over time. Such outcomes include hospitalizations in heart failure patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anker and McMurray 2012)</ref>, fractures in breast cancer patients with skeletal metastases <ref type="bibr">(Chen and Cook 2004</ref>) and rejection episodes in recipients of kidney transplants <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cook and Lawless 1997)</ref>. However, in many studies of recurrent events, individuals may also experience competing events, such as death. These events may substantially complicate causal inference.</p><p>For example, in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT Research Group 2015), investigators found that intensive blood pressure lowering therapy increased the expected number of acute kidney injury episodes (a possible harmful side effect of blood pressure treatment) compared to standard blood pressure treatment. However, individuals on intensive blood pressure therapy had a lower incidence of all-cause mortality.</p><p>In this example, all-cause mortality is a competing event for the outcome of interest (number of recurrences of acute kidney injury) because once an individual dies they cannot subsequently experience the recurrent event. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Due to the randomized design these findings indeed have a "causal" interpretation: the results support an average harmful effect of intensive blood pressure treatment on the number of acute kidney injury recurrences. However, analogous to previous arguments in the case where the outcome of interest is an incident (rather than a recurrent) event subject to competing events <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Young et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. 2020)</ref>, this "protection" is difficult to interpret in light of the finding that mortality risk is lowered by intensive blood pressure treatment. The increased number of acute kidney injury episodes in the intensive treatment arm might only be due to the treatment effect on mortality.</p><p>Early works on competing events <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Tsiatis 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gail 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prentice et al. 1978</ref>) considered the problem of identifying the survival function of the event of interest under elimination of competing events, and concluded that this is often unfeasible as it requires strong independence assumptions between the competing events, as well as a clear conceptualization of how to eliminate a competing event without affecting the risk of the other events. Instead, <ref type="bibr">Prentice et al. (1978)</ref> advocated for the causespecific hazard as an identifiable estimand in the competing event setting. Although these early works are clearly based on an insightful intuition, they are not grounded in a formal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying conditions, which makes it difficult to interpret the effect estimates from these procedures and to assess recommendations regarding analytic choices. For example, it has been clarified that cause-specific hazards do not have a desirable causal effect interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Robins 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Young et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aalen et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Martinussen et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hernán 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud and Hernán 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The importance of characterizing the causal interpretation of statistical estimands is increasingly acknowledged both within and outside of the academic causal inference community (European Medicines Agency 2020). In a series of articles by the Recurrent Event Qualification Opinion Consortium <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schmidli et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wei et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fritsch et al. 2021)</ref>, six candidate causal estimands were proposed in recurrent event settings with competing events, defined by counterfactual contrasts under different treatment scenarios in the following: (1) the expected number of events in the study population;</p><p>(2) the expectation over a composite of the recurrent and competing events in the study population; (3) the expected number of events under an intervention which prevents the competing event from occurring in the study population; (4) the expected number of events in a subset of the study population consisting of the principal stratum of individuals that would survive regardless of treatment; (5) the ratio of the expected number of recurrences to the restricted mean survival by the end of follow-up in the study population and (6) the ratio of the expectation over a composite of the recurrent and competing events to the restricted mean survival by the end of follow-up in the study population.</p><p>In addition to defining these various counterfactual estimands, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schmidli et al. (2021)</ref> considered some aspects of their differences in interpretation, as well as, for some of the estimands, approaches to statistical analysis. However, they did not consider assumptions needed to identify any of these counterfactual estimands in a given study with a function of the observed data. Once a causal estimand is chosen, this identification step is required to justify a choice of approach to statistical analysis. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schmidli et al. (2021)</ref> did not consider how underlying questions about treatment mechanism may be important to the choice of estimand in recurrent events studies when treatment has a causal effect on competing events, as illustrated in the example above.</p><p>In this work, we formalize the interpretation, identification and estimation of various counterfactual estimands in recurrent event settings with competing events using counterfactual causal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Robins 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pearl 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Richardson and Robins 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Robins and Richardson 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Robins et al. 2020)</ref>. Building on ideas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Young et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. (2020)</ref> for the case where the outcome of interest is an incident event (e.g. diagnosis of prostate cancer), we show that several of these estimands in recurrent event settings can be interpreted as special cases of causal effects from the mediation literature-total, controlled direct, and separable effects-by conceptualizing the competing event as a time-varying "mediator" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Robins and Greenland 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Robins and Richardson 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Robins et al. 2020)</ref>. We give identification conditions and derive identification formulas for these estimands and demonstrate how single world intervention graphs (SWIGs) <ref type="bibr">(Richardson and Robins 2013b</ref>) can be used to reason about identification conditions with subject matter knowledge. Our results will also formalize the counterfactual interpretation of statistical estimands for recurrent events from the counting process literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cook and Lawless 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ander-sen et al. 2019</ref>), which has not adopted a formal causal (counterfactual) framework for motivating results.</p><p>The article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the structure of the observed data, without the complication of loss to follow-up. In Sect. 3, we define and describe several causal estimands for recurrent events in settings with competing events. In Sect. 4 we give our own prescription for choosing an appropriate causal estimand for recurrent outcomes. In Sect. 5, we consider how to treat the censoring of events, including by loss to follow-up. In Sect. 6 we discuss identifiability conditions and give identification formulas for the proposed causal estimands. Furthermore, we demonstrate the convergence of discrete time estimands to continuous time estimands, and establish the correspondence between the discrete time identification conditions and the classical independent censoring assumption in event history analysis. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> In Sect. 7, we describe statistical methods for the proposed estimands, and establish conditions for their consistency. In Sect. 8, we illustrate our results using a data example on acute kidney injury under blood pressure treatment. Finally, in Sect. 9, we provide a discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Factual data structure</head><p>Consider a randomized trial, like SPRINT, where i ∈ {1, . . . , n} i.i.d. individuals with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease were randomized to intensive versus standard blood pressure lowering therapy A ∈ {0, 1} (0 indicates assignment to standard treatment, 1 assignment to intensive treatment). Because the individuals are i.i.d., we suppress the subscript i. Let k ∈ {0, . . . , K + 1} denote K + 2 consecutive ordered intervals of time comprising the follow-up (e.g. days, weeks, months) with time interval k = 0 corresponding to the interval of treatment assignment (baseline) and k = K + 1 corresponding to the last possible follow-up interval, beyond which no information has been recorded. Without loss of generality, we choose a timescale such that all intervals have a duration of 1 unit of time until Sect. 6.4.</p><p>Let Y k ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . } denote the cumulative count of acute kidney injury episodes by the end of interval k and D k ∈ {0, 1} an indicator of death by the end of interval k. Define D 0 ≡ Y 0 ≡ 0, that is, individuals are alive and have not yet experienced any post-treatment recurrent events at baseline. Let L 0 be a vector of baseline covariates measured before the treatment assignment A, capturing pre-treatment common causes of acute kidney injury and death. For k &gt; 0, let L k ∈ L denote a vector of timevarying covariates measured in interval k, containing the most recent blood pressure measurements. 3 Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> An example of a possible causal model describing the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial <ref type="bibr">(SPRINT Research Group 2015)</ref>, where individuals are randomized to intensive versus standard blood pressure therapy.

We adopt the notational convention that any variable with a negative time index occurring in a conditioning set is taken to be the empty set ∅ (e.g. P(A = a|L -1 , B) = P(A = a|B) for an event B).</p><p>An individual cannot experience recurrent events after a competing event, such as death, has occurred: if an individual experiences death at time k † , then Y j = Y k † -1 and D j = 1 for all j ≥ k † . Thus, the type of outcome that is the focus of this manuscript is defined in the factual data after death occurs. This is in contrast to what we will refer to as a 'truncation by death' setting, where the outcome of interest is undefined after an individual experiences the competing event <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Young et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Young and Stensrud 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. 2021b</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. , 2022))</ref>. For example, when the outcome of interest is quality of life in cancer patients, this is only defined for individuals who are alive unless the investigator chooses to assign an arbitrary quality of life value to dead individuals. Ultimately, the true distinction between a "competing event" setting (where outcomes are defined as absent post-death) and a "truncation by death" setting comes down to the estimands that the investigator is willing to consider. When the outcome is undefined after death then certain estimands will not be available that are available when such outcomes are defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Young and Stensrud 2021)</ref>. We consider this further in Sect. <ref type="bibr">3</ref>.</p><p>In what follows, we will use causal directed acyclic graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pearl 2009</ref>) (DAGs) to represent underlying data generating models. We assume that the DAG represents a Finest Fully Randomized Causally Interpreted Structural Tree Graph (FFRCISTG) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Robins 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Richardson and Robins 2013b)</ref>. Furthermore, we will assume that statistical independencies in the data are faithful to the DAG (see Appendix D for the definition of faithfulness that we adopt here). An example of a DAG, encoding a set of possible assumptions on the data generating model for the trial in the data example described in Sect. 1 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Counterfactual estimands</head><p>In this section, we consider various counterfactual estimands in settings with recurrent and competing events. We propose extensions of previously considered counterfactual estimands that quantify causal effects on incident failure in the face of competing events <ref type="bibr">(Stensrud et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Young et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. 2021a</ref>) to the recurrent events setting. This includes a new type of separable effect, inspired by the seminal decomposition idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Robins and Richardson (2011)</ref>, that may disentangle the treatment effect on recurrent acute kidney injury from its effect on survival. We also discuss additional counterfactual estimands in recurrent event settings.</p><p>We denote counterfactual random variables by superscripts, such that Y a k is the recurrent event count that would be observed at time k had, possibly contrary to fact, treatment been set to A = a. By causal effect, we mean a contrast of some functional (e.g. the mean) of the counterfactual distribution in the same subset of individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Total effect</head><p>The counterfactual marginal mean number of recurrent events by time k under an intervention that sets A to a is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E[Y a k ] for k ∈ {0, . . . , K + 1} .</formula><p>In turn, the counterfactual contrast</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E[Y a=1 k ] vs. E[Y a=0 k ]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>quantifies a causal effect of treatment assignment on the mean number of recurrent events by k. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schmidli et al. (2021)</ref> referred to this effect as the 'treatment policy' estimand. However, in order to understand the interpretational implications of choosing this effect measure when competing events exist, it is important to understand that (1) also coincides with an example of a total effect as historically defined in the causal mediation literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Robins and Greenland 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Young et al. 2020</ref>).</p><p>In our running example, the total effect quantifies the effect of intensive versus standard blood pressure treatment (A) on recurrent acute kidney injury (Y k ) through all causal pathways, including pathways through survival (D k ), as depicted by all directed paths connecting A and Y nodes intersected by D nodes in the causal diagram in Fig. 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Young et al. 2020)</ref>. Therefore, a non-null value of the total effect is not sufficient to conclude that the treatment exerts direct effects on acute kidney injury (outside of death): the total effect may also (or only) be due to an (indirect) effect on survival, keeping individuals at risk of acute kidney injury for a longer (or shorter) period of time.</p><p>In addition to the total effect on recurrent acute kidney injury (Y k ), we might consider the total (marginal) effect of treatment on survival, given by the marginal contrast in cumulative incidences</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E[D a=1 k ] vs. E[D a=0 k ] .</formula><p>(2)</p><p>However, simultaneously considering the total effect of treatment on acute kidney injury and on survival is still insufficient to determine by which mechanisms the treatment affects acute kidney injury and death. For example, suppose that individuals in treatment arm A = 1 experience the competing event shortly after treatment initiation.</p><p>In this case, no recurrent events would be recorded in this treatment arm. Clearly, in this setting it would not be possible for an investigator to draw any conclusions about the mechanism by which treatment acts on the recurrent event outside of the competing event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Controlled direct effect</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Robins and Greenland (1992)</ref>, consider the counterfactual mean number of events under an intervention that prevents the competing event from occurring and sets treatment to</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A = a, E[Y a,d=0 k ] for k ∈ {0, . . . , K + 1} ,</formula><p>where the overline in the superscript denotes an intervention on all respective intervention nodes in the history of the counterfactual, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Y a,d=0 k ≡ Y a,d k =0 k . In turn, the counterfactual contrast E[Y a=1,d=0 k ] vs. E[Y a=0,d=0 k ]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>quantifies a causal effect of treatment assignment on the mean number of recurrent events by k under an additional intervention that somehow "eliminates competing events". <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schmidli et al. (2021)</ref> referred to this effect as the 'hypothetical strategy' estimand. However, it is useful to notice that the effect (3) coincides with an example of a controlled direct effect as defined in the causal mediation literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Robins and Greenland 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Young et al. 2020)</ref>. The quantity E [Y a,d=0   k   ] is closely related to the survival function under the elimination of competing events, as discussed in the early competing events literature by e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tsiatis (1975);</ref><ref type="bibr">Prentice et al. (1978)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Putter et al. (2007)</ref>, although without using a formal causal framework.</p><p>In our example, the controlled direct effect isolates direct effects of treatment on recurrent acute kidney injury by considering a (hypothetical) intervention which prevents death from occurring in all individuals. An important reservation against the controlled direct effect is that it is often difficult to conceptualize an intervention which prevents the competing event from occurring <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Young et al. 2020)</ref>. For example, there exists no practically feasible intervention that can eliminate death due to all causes. Without clearly establishing the intervention being targeted, the interpretation of the direct effect is ambiguous and its role in informing decision-making is unclear. The unclear role of the controlled direct effect in decision-making was reiterated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schmidli et al. (2021)</ref> in their discussion of the 'hypothetical strategy', although the authors did not discuss the role of the estimand in clarifying the mechanism by which treatment affects the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Separable effects</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Robins and</ref><ref type="bibr">Richardson (2011) Robins et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. (2020</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. ( , 2022))</ref>, we will define an actionable notion of direct (indirect) effects that refers to an intervention that might be implemented currently or in the future. These effects require that the investigator pose candidates for modified versions of the study treatment, denoted A Y and A D , with the following properties: let M Y and M D be two random variables, and suppose that the following conditions hold for the original treatment </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M a Y =a,a D Y = M a Y for a D ∈ {0, 1} , M a Y ,a D =a D = M a D for a Y ∈ {0, 1} .

Assumption ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">4</ref>) is referred to as the modified treatment assumption and is discussed in <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. (2022)</ref>. According to (4), receiving A Y = A D = a results in the same outcomes as receiving A = a for a ∈ {0, 1}. While a physical treatment decomposition is one way in which assumption (4) may hold, it may also hold for modified treatments that are not a physical decomposition <ref type="bibr">(Stensrud et al. 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Stensrud et al. , 2022))</ref>. The modified treatment assumption (4) can in principle be falsified in a future six-armed trial where individuals are exposed to A, A Y , A D ∈ {0, 1} once the modified treatment becomes available <ref type="bibr">(Stensrud et al. 2022</ref>).</p><p>In the case of a decomposition, an individual receiving A Y = A D = 0 has received the same treatment as A = 0 (assignment to neither of the treatment components) and an individual receiving A Y = A D = 1 the same treatment as A = 1 (assignment to both treatment components).

These estimands correspond to the effects of joint interventions on candidate modified treatments A Y and A D , even when the modified treatment assumption (4) does not hold. However, the modified treatment assumption (4) is sufficient in order for the separable effects to explain the mechanism by which the original treatment A exerts its effects on the recurrent outcome <ref type="bibr">(Stensrud et al. 2021a, Appendix A)</ref>.</p><p>Returning to the data example, a well-known biological effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) (two common antihypertensive medications) is that they reduce the renal filtration pressure by binding to receptors in the kidneys which dilate efferent glomerular arterioles, which in turn can lead to a substatial drug-induced fall in kidney function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brunton et al. 2018)</ref>. In light of this, drug developers and doctors could be interested in the effect of a hypothetical modified version of an antihypertensive drug, which preserves its effects on systemic blood pressure but does not lead to dilation of efferent glomerular arterioles. In principle, such a modified drug might have similar cardioprotective effects as the original antihypertensive agent, but without the harmful side-effect that can lead to acute kidney injury.</p><p>This working background knowledge on the mechanisms by which the study treatment affects recurrent acute kidney injury and competing events allows us to pose candidates for A Y and A D in this example and, as we will discuss further below, interpret separable effects in terms of direct, indirect, or path-specific effects of A. Specifically, the modified treatment assumption is conceivable in this example by defining A Y to be the component of blood pressure therapy that binds to efferent arterioles in the kidneys, causing their dilatation (M Y ), and A D as the remaining components of the treatment, including those that exert their effects by lowering systemic blood pressure (M D ). Thus, A Y and A D are the treatment levels of these two components under intensive versus standard therapy respectively. A further discussion of this decomposition of blood pressure therapy into the aforementioned A Y and A D components is given in <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. (2021a)</ref>.</p><p>Additional assumptions or isolation conditions <ref type="bibr">(Stensrud et al. 2021a)</ref>, are then required in order to interpret any given separable effect as a direct, indirect, or otherwise path-specific effect of the original study treatment: if the A Y component has no effect on survival, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E[Y a Y =1,a D k ] vs. E[Y a Y =0,a D k</formula><p>] captures exclusively the effect of the A Y component on acute kidney injury not mediated by survival. We can formalize this statement using the condition of strong A Y partial isolation, inspired by <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. (2021a)</ref>:</p><p>A treatment decomposition satisfies strong A Y partial isolation if</p><p>There are no causal paths from A Y to D k for all k ∈ {0, . . . ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">K + 1} .

Consequently, (5) also captures effects of A Y on Y k via D k , and therefore cannot be interpreted as a direct effect outside of D k .</p><p>Another isolation condition, A D partial isolation, allows us to interpret separable effects as indirect effects of treatment on the recurrent outcome via effects on survival.</p><p>A brief account of the isolation conditions is given in Appendix B, and is discussed in detail for the competing events setting in <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. (2021a)</ref>. If we had access to a four arm randomized trial where individuals are observed under all four treatment combinations (A Y , A D ) ∈ {0, 1} 2 , and there is no loss to follow-up, these effects could easily be identified and estimated by two-way comparisons of the four different treatment combinations. Such two-way comparisons would also allow the strong A Y partial isolation condition (6) to be tested: in particular, a non-null value of the two-</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">way comparison E[D a Y =1,a D k ] vs. E[D a Y =0,a D k</formula><p>] implies a violation of (6). Conversely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">inspection of the contrast E[Y a Y ,a D =1 k ] vs. E[Y a Y ,a D =0 k</formula><p>] can strengthen or weaken our belief in the A D partial isolation condition, although cannot be used to falsify the assumption. Because we only observe two of the four treatment combinations in the trial described in Sect. 2, namely A Y = A D = 1 and A Y = A D = 0, the separable effects target effects that require identifying assumptions beyond those that hold by design in this two arm trial. We will consider these assumptions in Sect. 6.3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Schmidli et al. (2021)</ref> proposed the estimands</p></div>

The estimand is the expectation over a counting process which starts at M and decrements in steps of one every time the recurrent event occurs.

There are common limitations to all estimands in this subsection:</p><p>(I) Neither can be used to draw formal conclusions about the mechanism by which the treatment affects the recurrent event and the event of interest for the same reason as the total effect (Sect. 3.1). (II) The estimands (implicitly or explicitly) assign weight to the competing and recurrent events by combining them into a single effect measure. However, the choice of 'weights' is not obvious and can differ on a case-by-case basis. (III) The estimands represent a coarsening of the information in the cumulative incidence and mean frequency, and therefore provide less information than simultaneously inspecting the mean frequency of acute kidney injury and the cumulative incidence of death. Inspecting the mean frequency and cumulative incidence curves separately gives the additional advantage of showing the (absolute) magnitude of each estimand separately as functions of time, which is not visible from the composite estimand alone.</p><p>Points (I)-(III) also apply to composite estimands in settings with truncation by death.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Choosing an estimand</head><p>The choice of estimand for a particular problem must be motivated by subject matter arguments. When there is no subject matter support for a causal effect of the treatment on the competing event (i.e. there are no directed arrows from A into D k at any k) or when this mechanism does not create ambiguities with regard to mechanisms of the treatment then the total effect may be enough.</p><p>However, if treatment effects on the competing event could create mechanisms that lead to an ambiguous interpretation of the total effect, then other estimands may help supplement information quantified by the total effect. Unlike other proposals for effects to quantify treatment mechanism outlined above, strong assumptions are required to even define the separable effects, putting aside even the issue of identifying them in the study data in hand, and to ascribe them a particular mechanistic interpretation. Unfortunately, the alternative estimands provided do not avoid such assumptions but rather bury them: for example, an estimate obtained from a real-world study of a controlled direct effect defined relative to an ill-defined intervention on death, or a natural effect defined relative to setting death to a cross-world unobservable value, can never be refuted in the future without additional assumptions on par with the modified treatment assumption/isolation conditions required to understand a separable effect. The required transparency for proceeding with a separable effects analysis can, and in our view should, be viewed as a benefit of this approach: it shines needed light on the reality that using real-world data to answer mechanistic questions is hard and requires detailed assumptions about how the study treatment works. When an investigator is lacking that knowledge, the solution should not be to revert to untestable questions but to acknowledge the need for more time and thought to sharpen hypotheses. In such cases, one may proceed with a total effect, acknowledging its mechanism is not yet understood. Alternatively, one may proceed with considering separable effects for yet to be elucidated candidates A Y and A D . Such an approach is arguably no more vague than previous (in)direct effect notions but, unlike those former notions, has a hope of being sharpened as more knowledge develops.</p><p>Finally, the identifying functions for separable effects coincides with those for certain path specific effects in certain settings, including those where full isolation holds. Thus, numerous advancements in statistics for path specific effects, such as natural effects, can still be leveraged for estimation of separable effects (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zheng and van der Laan 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Vansteelandt et al. 2019)</ref>.</p></div>

Loss to follow-up (e.g. due to failure to return for study visits) is commonly understood as a form of censoring.

However, other events may or may not be defined as censoring events depending on the choice of causal estimand. For example, competing events are censoring events by the above definition when the controlled direct effect is of interest, but are not censoring events when the total effect is of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Young et al. 2020)</ref>. This is because the occurrence of a competing event at time k † prevents knowledge of Y a,d=0 k † , but does not prevent knowledge of Y a k † . By similar arguments, competing events are not censoring events when separable effects are of interest because they do not involve counterfactual outcomes indexed by d = 0 ("elimination of competing events"). When loss to followup is present in a study, we will define all effects relative to interventions that include "eliminating loss to follow-up" with the added superscript c = 0 to denote relevant counterfactual outcomes, e.g. Y c=0 k . For example, if loss to follow-up is due to the administrative end of a study, the intervention that eliminates loss to follow-up could be conceived as the hypothetical continuation of the study such that every individual is followed until the end of interval K + 1. Contrasts of such effects are examples of controlled direct effects with respect to interventions on loss to follow-up. The identification assumptions outlined below are sufficient for identifying estimands with this additional interpretation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Young et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.3">Differences in interpretation</head><p>In the counting process formalism of recurrent events, N c t is interpreted as the count of events that would be measured if we somehow could observe every individual's future outcomes (for example by implanting a 'tracker device'), even if they withdraw from study participation or otherwise discontinue follow-up. This is a factual (as opposed to a counterfactual) quantity, because it is not subject to any counterfactual intervention to eliminate censoring. Next, the observed counting process N t is interpreted as the number of events that were recorded while the subject was alive and under follow-up, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_94">N t = t 0 I (T D ≥ s, C ≥ s)d N c</formula><p>s . If study participants receive concomitant care by virtue of being under follow-up (e.g. additional medical exams that can lead to discovery of new conditions which trigger initiation of additional, supportive treatments), then individuals who are lost to follow-up may have different outcomes N c t compared to subjects under followup due to the termination of such concomitant care. This violates the independent censoring condition (35). Therefore, E[N c t ] is not identified when concomitant care under follow-up affects future outcomes N c t without additional strong assumptions. In other words, one cannot make inference on individuals who are censored (who do not receive concomitant care) by only observing uncensored individuals (who do receive concomitant care).</p><p>In contrast to N c t , the counterfactual quantity Y c=0 k is often interpreted as the number of recurrent events that would be observed by time k under an intervention which prevented individuals from being lost to follow-up, i.e. in a pseudopopulation where all individuals receive the same level of the primary intervention ( A) and concomitant care. E[Y c=0 k ] is still identified under effects of concomitant care on the recurrent event, i.e. the arrows c k = 0 → Y a,c=0 k in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> do not violate the exchangeability condition (13). In the special case where concomitant care does not affect future recurrent events, the interpretations of E[Y c=0 k ] and E[N c</p><p>t k ] coincide.

In this section, we apply the estimators proposed in the Sect. 7 to compute the effect of such a modified blood pressure therapy on the recurrence of acute kidney injury, as well as the total and controlled direct effect, using data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT Research Group 2015). The illustrative example considered in this section builds on <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al.

Additionally, we adjusted for the most recent measurements of mean arterial pressure (L k ). We truncated the stabilized weights W C,t , W D,t and W Y ,t outside of the interval [0.2-5]. A smoothing parameter of b = 250 was used (analyses with parameters b ∈ {100, 200, 500} gave similar results).</p><p>The analysis relies on the identification assumptions in Sect. 6. The assumptions of exchangebility of baseline treatment, positivity and consistency hold by design because blood pressure treatment is assigned by randomization in a controlled experiment. We have further assumed that the measured covariates (L 0 , L k ) are sufficient for identification. In particular, exchangeability (20) for the controlled direct effect and the dismissible component conditions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_52">27</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_54">28</ref>) would be violated if there are unmeasured common causes of death and recurrent AKI, such as U DY in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, that are not captured by (L 0 , L k ), or causal paths such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_116">A Y → M A Y → D c=0 k+1 or A D → M A D → Y c=0</formula><p>k+1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> that are not intersected by L k . The resulting estimates are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. At 1000 days, we found a total effect of 0.017[-0.001, 0.037] and a controlled direct effect of 0.017[-0.003, 0.037] (95% confidence intervals, obtained using 500 non-parametric bootstrap samples, are reported in square brackets). Thus, the total effect for individuals over 75 years old is (borderline) consistent with an increased occurrence of acute kidney injury under intensive treatment, as reported by <ref type="bibr">SPRINT Research Group (2015)</ref> for the full trial population. However, there were more deaths in the standard group compared to the intensive group (see Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref> in <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. 2021a</ref>). Thus, it is not clear whether the increased occurrence of acute kidney injury in the intensive group is due to a protective effect on survival or a direct effect on the recurrent outcome.</p><p>To quantify the mechanism by which treatment leads to increased risk of acute kidney injury, we studied separable effects. The direct separable effect evaluated at a D = 1 is equal to 0.011[-0.005, 0.034] at 1000 days, which is consistent with no reduction in the recurrence of acute kidney injury by eliminating the A Y component </p><formula xml:id="formula_117">E[Y k aY=1, aD=1 ] E[Y k aY=0, aD=0 ] E[Y k aY=0, aD=1 ] E[Y k aY=1, aD=1, d=0 ] E[Y k aY=0, aD=0, d=0 ]</formula><p>of treatment. This finding is also consistent with <ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. (2021a)</ref>, who only studied the incidence of first kidney failure event. To conclude, the analysis of separable effects does not provide evidence in favor of a reduction in the expected number of acute kidney injury episodes in a modified blood pressure treatment that does not dilate efferent glomerular arterioles. If a non-null effect had been found, this would strengthen the hypothesis that we could change the number of acute kidney injury occurrences by intervening on the treatment component that dilates efferent arterioles, and thereby make it more attractive to test such a hypothesis in a future randomized trial if such a treatment is developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Discussion</head><p>We have used a formal causal framework to define estimands for recurrent outcomes that differ in the way they treat competing events. The controlled direct effect is a contrast of counterfactual outcomes which implies that competing events are considered to be a form of censoring. The total effect captures all causal pathways between treatment and the recurrent event, and the separable effect quantifies contrasts in expected outcomes under independent prescription of treatment components. Further, we have given formal conditions for identifying these effects, and demonstrated how to evaluate the identification conditions in causal graphs. This allowed us to formally describe how the causal estimands map to classical statistical estimands for recurrent events based on counting processes in the limit of fine discretizations of time.</p><p>In settings with competing events, it is often of interest to disentangle the effect on the recurrent event from the effect on the competing event. The controlled direct effect often fails to do so in a scientifically insightful way, because it is not clear which intervention, if any, eliminates the occurrence of the competing event. The interpretation of the direct effect is therefore unclear. The separable effect corresponds (by design) to interventions on components of the original treatment, which are assigned independently of each other. The practical relevance of the estimand relies on the plausibility of modified treatments. The process of conceptualizing modified treatments can motivate future treatment development and sharpen research questions about mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Robins and Richardson 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Robins et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensrud et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Stronger assumptions are needed to identify the (controlled) direct effect and separable effects compared to the total effect. For example, these estimands require the investigator to measure common causes of the recurrent event and failure time, even in an ideal randomized trial such as in Sect. 2. The need for stronger assumptions is far from unique to our setting, and it is analogous to the task of identifying per-protocol effects in settings with imperfect adherence and mediation effects.</p><p>The use of a formal (counterfactual) framework to define causal effects elucidates analytic choices regarding treatment recommendations. The formal causal framework makes it possible to define effects with respect to explicit interventions, and to explicitly state the conditions under which such effects can be identified from observed data. This also makes it possible to transparently assess the strength and validity of the identifying assumptions in practice. sample of patients admitted to nursing homes with a history of cardiovascular disease and currently taking antihypertensives and aspirin. Patients are then randomly assigned to either discontinue or to continue both treatments (A = 0 indicates assignment to discontinuation of both aspirin and antihypertensives, A = 1 denotes assignment to continuing both medications). A similar intervention is considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Reeve et al. (2020)</ref>. Thus, (A Y , A D ) is a physical decomposition of treatment A such that receiving both components, i.e. A Y = A D = 1, is equivalent to receiving A = 1 (and conversely receiving neither component, A Y = A D = 0, is equivalent to A = 0), and therefore satisfies the modified treatment assumption (4). We consider a simplified setting where there is one binary pre-treatment and posttreatment common cause of future events (syncope and death), denoted by L 0 (old age at baseline) and L 1 (binarized blood pressure after treatment initiation) respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_118">Y k D k D k+1 Y k+1 A Y A D L 0 L 1 Y k D k D k+1 Y k+1 A L 0 L 1 a b</formula><p>In the data generating model, we first sampled L 0 , L 1 according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_119">P(L 0 = 1) = 1 2 , P(L 1 = 1 | A Y ) = 1 2 + (2 A Y -1) • β L 1 ,A Y .</formula><p>Next, we generated the processes (Y k , D k , C k ) on a discrete time grid using the hazards</p><formula xml:id="formula_120">P(C k+1 = 1|C k = D k = 0, L 0 , L 1 , Y k , A Y , A D ) = β C,0 , P(D k+1 = 1|C k+1 = D k = 0, L 0 , L 1 , Y k , A Y , A D ) = β D,0 + A D • β D,A + L 0 • β D,L 0 + L 1 • β D,L 1 + Y k • β D,Y , P( Y k+1 = 1|C k+1 = D k+1 = 0, L 0 , L 1 , Y k , A Y , A D ) = β Y ,0 + L 0 • β Y ,L 0 + L 1 • β Y ,L 1 .</formula><p>The data generating model is constructed such that it satisfies all of the identification conditions for total effect, controlled direct effect and separable effect, and is consistent with the causal DAGs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. The implementation of the data generating model is shown in the online Supplementary Material.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> encodes the assumption that only the A Y component (antihypertensive treatment) affects L 1 and does not directly affect death while the A D component (aspirin) acts directly on survival and has no effect on the recurrence of syncope except through pathways intersected by survival (D k ). The parameters of the data generating model were chosen such that antihypertensive treatment (A Y = 1) increases the risk of death through the pathway A Y → L 1 → Y k → D k+1 , i.e. by lowering blood pressure, which in turn may lead to syncope and subsequent injurious falls. This is seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7a</ref>, as individuals who received antihypertensives (A Y = 1), shown by the black and red curves, experience a larger number of syncope episodes. Next, treatment with aspirin decreases the risk of death through cardiovascular protection via the pathway A D → D k+1 . As illustrated by the crossing of the black and blue curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7b</ref>, the decreased risk of death due to aspirin through pathway A D → D k+1 is compensated by the increased risk of death under antihypertensive treatment through</p><formula xml:id="formula_121">A Y → L 1 → Y k → D k+1</formula><p>. Therefore, discontinuation of antihypertensives only, i.e. (A Y = 0, A D = 1), gives the highest survival in this example. This illustrates the role and interpretation of the separable effect; even though a trial investigator only observes individuals in treatment levels A ∈ {0, 1}, the separable effects allows us to make inference under the hypothetical decomposed intervention (A Y = 0, A D = 1), which is not possible using conventional estimands such as the total effect or controlled direct effect.</p><p>By transforming the graphs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> to single world intervention graphs <ref type="bibr">(Richardson and Robins 2013b</ref>) corresponding to Figs. 2, 3 and 4, it is straightforward to verify that the exchangeability ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">12</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_27">13</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_38">19</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_39">20</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_49">24</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) and dismissible component conditions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_52">27</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_58">30</ref>) are satisfied by the causal model. Because all positivity and consistency conditions also hold by construction in the data generating model, the total, controlled direct and separable effects are identified by the respective functionals given in Secs. 6.1-6.3. Furthermore, we can see from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>  ] for a Y = a D using the estimators described in Sect. 7 for 500 simulated individuals in each of the treatment groups A = 0 and A = 1. It follows from the data generating model defined in the beginning of Appendix A and Table <ref type="table">7</ref> that the assumed hazard models are correctly specified. In principle, we could allow for a more involved data generating model with time-varying coefficients. The assumed hazard models would still provide consistent estimates if the additive structure is correctly specified. Thus, an investigator can adapt the estimators in the supplementary R material to other recurrent event problems.  <ref type="table">7</ref> The left column includes the weights, the middle column includes the hazards that define (50), and the right column includes the parametric hazard models that were used in the data analysis Weight Hazards Hazard models fitted</p><formula xml:id="formula_122">W i C,t α i t dt β 0 t + β A t A + β L 0 t L 0 + β L 1 t L 1 + β Y t Y t- α * ,i t dt β 0 t + β A t A W i D,t α i t dt β 0 t + β A t A + β L 0 t L 0 + β L 1 t L 1 + β Y t Y t- α * ,i t dt β 0 t + β A t A W i D,t (a Y , a D ) α i t dt β 0 t + β A t I (A = a Y ) + β L 0 t L 0 + β L 1 t L 1 + β Y t Y t- α * ,i t dt β 0 t + β A t I (A = a D ) + β L 0 t L 0 + β L 1 t L 1 + β Y t Y t- f A,L k ,D k ,C k ,Y k (a, l k , 0, 0, y k ) &gt; 0 ⇒ P(C k+1 = 0 | A = a, L k = l k , D k = 0, C k = 0, Y k = y k ) &gt; 0 .

Our results trivially extend to accommodate effects of adherence to a particular protocol at baseline by instead taking A to be the actual treatment strategy followed at baseline and by including common causes of treatment adherence, acute kidney injury and death in L 0 . In either case, indicators of time-varying adherence to the protocol may be important to include in L k , k &gt; 0, for the purposes of identification to be discussed in later sections.</p></note>

Consider investigators concerned with the effects of over-treatment of older adults with antihypertensive agents (A Y ) and aspirin ( A D ). Over-treatment might lead to episodes (Y k ) of syncope (dizziness) caused by blood pressure becoming too low (in turn, possibly leading to injurious falls), with all-cause mortality (D k ) as a competing risk.

We let R(n,i) be as in (51) (originally defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ryalen et al. (2019)</ref>); an estimator of the weights R i based on additive hazard models with finite third moments on the covariates (see <ref type="bibr">Ryalen et al. (2019, Theorem 2)</ref>).

Assume first that R i , R (n,i) are orthogonal to N i . Define X <ref type="bibr">Ryalen et al.

Furthermore,</p><p>s is PUT (see <ref type="bibr">Jacod and Shiryaev (2003, VI, 6.6.a)</ref>), as it is a sum of two processes that are P-UT. The first term is P-UT from <ref type="bibr">Ryalen et al. (2019, Proposition 1)</ref>. The latter term is P-UT because R (n,i) is driven by a P-UT process K (n,i) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ryalen et al. (2019)</ref>) and N i -is predictable, by <ref type="bibr">Jacod and Shiryaev (2003, Corollary VI.6.20)</ref>. The estimator of interest is</p><p>s . Now, the last term on the right hand side has the following decomposition:</p><p>By <ref type="bibr">Ryalen et al. (2019, Lemma 2)</ref>, the first term on the right hand side converges to zero, while the third term converges to zero by the law of large numbers as it is a mean zero martingale. Finally,</p><p>The first term on the right hand side converges to zero by the law of large numbers, while the second term converges to zero by dominated convergence, as R</p><p>(n,i) t</p><p>-R i t converges in probability to zero for each t. Thus, X (n) and X (n) converge to the same limit. Because E[Z 1 ] is continuous, <ref type="bibr">Jacod and Shiryaev (2003, Corollary VI 3.33)</ref> implies that ( X (n) , Y (n) ) converges weakly (with respect to the Skorohod metric), and <ref type="bibr">Jacod and Shiryaev (2003, Theorem VI 6.22)</ref> implies that also Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></div>			</div>
