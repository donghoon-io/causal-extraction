<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recent advances in causal inference techniques, more specifically, in the theory of structural causal models, provide the framework for identification of causal effects from observational data in the cases where the causal graph is identifiable, i.e., the data generating mechanism can be recovered from the joint distribution. However, no such studies have been done to demonstrate this concept with a clinical example. We present a complete framework to estimate the causal effect from observational data by augmenting expert knowledge in the model development phase and with a practical clinical application. Our clinical application entails a timely and important research question, i.e., the effect of oxygen therapy intervention in the intensive care unit (ICU); the result of this project is useful in a variety of disease conditions, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients in the ICU. We used data from the MIMIC III database, a standard database in the machine learning community that contains 58,976 admissions from an ICU in Boston, MA, for estimating the oxygen therapy effect on morality. We also identified the covariate-specific effect to oxygen therapy from the model for more personalized intervention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the 1960s, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard to identify causation by regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and by the clinical communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Greene and Podolsky, 2012)</ref>. The key idea behind RCT is that, by random assignment of treatment or interventions, the confounding bias, i.e., the bias due to the assignment of treatment or presence of other variables, including the unobserved confounders, can be accounted for in the estimand. Despite the strength of RCTs to identify causation, RCTs are increasingly considered time-consuming, costly, and often infeasible for safety and efficacy reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Frieden, 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, RCTs can be plagued with selection bias due to the strict eligibility criteria, or transportability bias, due to the study population being different from the target population. At the other end of the spectrum, advances in the technology and the adoption of computerized systems in routine healthcare has enabled the collection and curation of large volumes of data, such as electronic health records (EHR), during routine care, albeit with the presence of confounding biases. Therefore, researchers are increasingly trying to address the challenge of identifying causal relationships from large but biased observational datasets.</p><p>Recent advances in the theory of causal inference, more specifically, structural causal models (SCM) provide the framework for adjusting for different kinds of biases such as confounding, transportability, or selection bias under the general theory of data fusion with identifiability formulas, i.e., identification of causal effects, such as backdoor and front-door adjustment, in many cases even if the confounders are unobserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pearl et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pearl, 2009)</ref>. However, this approach requires developing a graphical representation of the causal relationship between variables of interest with meticulous scrutiny, using structure learning algorithms as well as with expert knowledge from clinicians or existing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Raghu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lederer et al., 2019)</ref>. While there are other clinical use cases with SCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Schlüter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adegunsoye et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Vitolo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arendt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hernández-Díaz et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schisterman et al., 2005)</ref>, most of the literature developed the causal graph with domain expertise only. On the other hand, there are many algorithms that can learn the graphical structure from data with different assumptions. Consequently, the resultant causal graph can vary significantly based on the underlying assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Raghu et al., 2018)</ref>. There have been some recent works that tried to bridge between these two approaches: expert knowledge and automated data-driven graph development <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nordon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rotmensch et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goodwin and Harabagiu, 2013)</ref>. However, none of these existing approaches provides a complete framework for expert augmented causal graph generation with specific clinical application. We provide an approach for the development of the SCM with structure learning algorithms and expert augmentation of clinical knowledge in a principled way. We also present a clinical application to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting virtual trials -from observational dataunder the proposed framework.</p><p>Our approach starts with processing observational data collected during routine health care such as EHR data from hospitals. These EHR systems or data repositories are queried based on the clinical question of interest, with explicit inclusion-exclusion criteria, to identify a cohort of eligible patients representative of the clinical setting. All the variables within the scope of the clinical question are extracted from the data repository. A graphical representa-tion of cause and effect relationship between the variables can be learned from the extracted data, with structure learning algorithms augmented with domain knowledge through expert reviews. The resultant graph can be validated from the data through testable implications (e.g., conditional independence, Verma constraints). The key advantage of using SCM over statistical methods such as g-methods under the potential outcome framework <ref type="bibr">(Hernán et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hernán and Robins, 2020)</ref> is that all the assumptions such as the assumptions on observed and unobserved confounders are explicitly encoded in the SCM that can be analyzed in a principled way with do-calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>For the clinical application, we study the effect of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy in the intensive care unit with respect to ICU mortality as the primary outcome. Although oxygenation has been used to treat critically ill patients for hundreds of years <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heffner, 2013)</ref>, there has been a renewed interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Panwar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Girardis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Investigators et al., 2020)</ref> in this topic as new evidence suggests not all patients may benefit from the same oxygenation strategy. To define the study question with a causal query that encodes eligibility or inclusion/exclusion criteria, we aimed at implementing the study protocol as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Panwar et al. (Panwar et al., 2016)</ref> in a multi-center pilot RCT. We will refer to this study as the oxygen therapy RCT (OT-RCT) in this paper. We used MIMIC-III database to emulate the OT-RCT protocol using observational data and SCM <ref type="bibr">Johnson et al. (2016)</ref>. For the study, we used a conservative oxygenation strategy, target SpO 2 is between 88-95%, compared to a liberal oxygenation strategy, target SpO 2 is greater than or equal to 96%, for adult ICU patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). In the observational data, we implemented a clear separation in the mean SpO 2 94. <ref type="bibr">25(3.14) vs. 97.88(3.42)</ref>, SaO 2 91. <ref type="bibr">39(9.20) vs. 91.78(11.84)</ref>, P aO 2 89.80(69 -98) vs. 121.32(86 -140), and F iO 2 0.59(0.18) vs. 0.47(0.14) values between the conservative and the liberal groups respectively. Our analysis was performed in two different ways using the MIMIC database: i) correlation-based observational study (CB-OBS) and ii) structural causal model based observational study as a virtual RCT (SCM-VRCT).</p><p>The point estimate for 90-day mortality with SCM-VRCT was lower with the liberal oxygenation strategy compared to the conservative strategy. This is not consistent with the findings of the OT-RCT. The expectation of 90-day mortality for patients in the conservative oxygenation arm in the SCM-VRCT protocol (54%) was equal to the CB-OBS approach (54%). Also, given the severity of illness based on the physiological scores and age of the patients, the liberal oxygenation strategy in SCM VRCT has lower mortality 29.8%(95% CI 28.1 -31.1%) compared to the conservative approach in SCM-VRCT 54.1%. Furthermore, within the liberal arm, the mortality in SCM-VRCT is lower compared to that of in the CB-OBS 34.1%(95% CI 33-35.3%). Another important observation is that the expectation of mortality is higher for the patients with a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score greater than ten compared to those with scores less than or equal to ten. Conditioned on the severity of illness based on the SOFA score, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality for different oxygenation targets. Therefore, conditioned on the severity of illness, as measured by the SOFA score (SOFA score is greater than or equal to 10), SCM-VRCT supports the feasibility of a larger study to investigate the effect of conservative oxygenation to treat patients requiring invasive MV in ICUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Technical Significance</head><p>We provide a framework with a step by step approach from data curation, model development, model validation, and causal estimation and demonstrate the approach using a clinical application. Previous research has shown model development using SCMs with only a few variables that was mostly hypothesis-driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Schlüter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adegunsoye et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Vitolo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arendt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hernández-Díaz et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schisterman et al., 2005)</ref>. Our approach provides a framework to encode expert knowledge using human-in-the-loop model development with the SCM in a principled way. Furthermore, we provide the derivation for the identifiability equation using backdoor adjustment and do-calculus as well as the estimation process with inverse probability weighting (IPW).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Clinical Relevance</head><p>There has been a number of trials in recent years to investigate the effect of conservative versus liberal (conventional) oxygenation strategies on mortality and number of ventilatorfree days among patients in ICUs receiving invasive mechanical ventilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Panwar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Girardis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Investigators et al., 2020)</ref>. Results have been mixed and the most recent study <ref type="bibr">(Investigators et al., 2020)</ref> showed no significant effect on the number of ventilator-free days between the treatment and the control group. Consequently, the study has a significant impact on clinical practice. The approach can be generalized for other clinical questions and can be adopted by the broader clinical community if relevant data and domain expertise exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">State of the Art</head><p>Ronald Fischer in his seminal work, "Design of Experiments", first introduced randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as an experimental approach to identify causation by accounting for confounding biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fisher et al., 1960)</ref>. The enactment of the 1962 Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act required that new treatments need to be proven efficacious in "adequate and well-controlled investigations" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Greene and Podolsky, 2012)</ref>. In the 1970s, the FDA translated this into the requirement that an RCT is needed to validate the causal link between a new treatment (causal intervention) and a putative clinical outcome. The rationale for adopting RCTs as the means of gathering scientific evidence is that spurious associations due to factors extraneous to the relationship between the treatment and the outcome can be controlled for by randomizing the treatment assignment. Despite a host of benefits, it is widely acknowledged that RCTs are far from perfect. In practice, RCTs are usually time-consuming, overly expensive, not always entirely ethical, contain biases even with randomization, and are often only applicable to a narrow stratum of the population.</p><p>In the 1970s, the potential outcome framework for experimental studies was extended to non-experimental or observational studies through the introduction of the ignorability assumption and propensity score matching for adjustment of confounding biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Rubin, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983</ref>). In the 1980s, sequential backdoor and g-methods were introduced with the potential outcome framework for time-varying exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Robins, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Robins and Hernán, 2009)</ref>. In the 1990s the potential outcome framework was first conceptualized through graphical models, namely, structural causal models, on the foundations of Bayesian networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 1995)</ref>. Subsequently, do-calculus was introduced with SCMs to mathematically transform observational and experimental studies. The strength of the SCM is that all the assumptions are explicitly specified in the model to provide a unified framework for an objective reproducible estimation approach. In recent years, a unified framework, called data fusion, for adjusting other types of bias such as selection bias and transportability bias have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pearl and Bareinboim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearl, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Most of the applications of SCM based on clinical literature has been purely hypothesisdriven. In other words, the graphical model that describes the assumptions was generated with expert knowledge with a small set of variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Schlüter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adegunsoye et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Vitolo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arendt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hernández-Díaz et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schisterman et al., 2005)</ref>. Several recent works attempted to generate the causal graph from medical literature automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nordon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rotmensch et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goodwin and Harabagiu, 2013)</ref>. While both of these approaches are useful, to the best of our knowledge, there are no hybrid approaches that develop the causal graph iteratively from both the clinical data and expert knowledge. A recent study provided a framework for expert augmented machine learning with boosting trees to extract expert knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gennatas et al., 2020)</ref>, but not with SCMs.</p><p>We propose an approach for generating evidence from clinical data captured during routine healthcare such as electronic health records with expert augmented causal graphs. We used the Medical Information Mart for the Intensive Care (MIMIC) III <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adibuzzaman et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Adibuzzaman et al., , 2017) )</ref> to answer the clinical question, whether liberal or conservative oxygen therapy help to improve survival rate in the intensive care unit. Numerous machine learning and clinical application studies have been published using this standard database <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ghassemi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2018)</ref> and the database is widely considered as a benchmark due to the high-quality granular data.</p><p>The clinical question of interest, i.e., the effect of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy in the ICU has drawn widespread attention in recent years with a number of randomized trials. These trials investigated the effect of oxygenation strategies on mortality and the number of ventilator-free days among patients in ICUs receiving intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). In 2016, a pilot RCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Panwar et al., 2016)</ref> to investigate the effect of different oxygenation targets during mechanical ventilation on mortality supported the feasibility of a conservative oxygenation strategy in patients but concluded with a need for a larger RCT to be performed to evaluate its efficacy. In another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Girardis et al., 2016)</ref>, a conservative oxygenation strategy was associated with lower ICU mortality compared to the conventional strategy. One important note about this study is that the findings were reported after an unplanned early termination of the trial due to the potential adverse effect in one of the study arms. They also emphasized the need for a multi-center trial that evaluates this intervention. The most recent study <ref type="bibr">(Investigators et al., 2020)</ref> with a 1000 patients' cohort found no significant effect on the number of ventilator-free days from the use of conservative oxygen therapy as compared to the conventional liberal oxygen therapy. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> summarizes the study demographics and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> summarizes the results of these studies, among others. The lack of a consensus from these studies shows the importance of the continued study of clinical practice and resulting outcomes on mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hirase et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Background</head><p>The causal analysis goes beyond association to infer probabilities under experimental conditions to estimate the effect of interventions. One example of these changes can be external interventions that can be used to estimate treatment effects. The development of mathematical machinery with SCM in the last couple of decades can be used to adjust for biases such as confounding bias, selection bias, and estimate treatment effect and counterfactual <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016)</ref>. In this section, we provide the fundamentals of the mathematical machinery with SCM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Structural Causal Model (SCM)</head><p>An SCM M , represent the causal relationship between variables. M consists of two sets of variables U and V , called exogenous and endogenous variables respectively. It also includes a set of functions f that assign each endogenous variable in V a value based on the values of other variables in the SCM. A variable Y is directly caused by X if X is in the function f of Y . A variable X is a cause of another variable Y if it is a direct or any cause of Y <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Definition 1 Structural Causal Model; A structural causal model is a 4-tuple M = U, V, F, P (u) , where 1.

In other words, each f i assigns a value to the corresponding</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V i ∈ V , v i ← f i (pa i , u i ), for i = 1, 2, . . . n.</formula><p>4. P (u) is a probability function defined over the domain of U .</p><p>Each SCM M is associated with a graph, known as a graphical causal model, G. Each G is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This graphical causal model G consists of a set of nodes or vertices that represent the variables U and V , and a set of edges that represents the functions in f . G contains a node for each variable in M and a directed edge from X to Y if X is in the function f of Y (X is a direct cause of Y ) in M . Causal models and graphs, therefore, represent causal relationships and encode causal assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Causal Structure Learning</head><p>Causal structure learning algorithms are a family of algorithms that estimate the causal graph or certain aspects of it from a given data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Heinze-Deml et al., 2018)</ref>. Given a distribution, these algorithms find possible causal diagrams implied by the graphical structure that could generate it. We assume the underlying graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The underlying causal DAG is generally not identifiable but the Markov equivalence class of DAGs, i.e. the set of DAGs that encode the same set of d-separation relationships, can be identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 2009)</ref>. The Markov equivalence class of DAGs can be described by completed partially DAGs (CPDAG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Andersson et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>There are many methods that have been developed to estimate the underlying DAG. These are broadly classified as 1) constraint-based methods, 2) score-based methods and 3) hybrid methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Scutari, 2010)</ref>. The constraint-based methods, PC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Peter Spirtes, 2000)</ref>, rankPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Harris and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Drton, 2013), and</ref><ref type="bibr">FCI (Peter Spirtes, 2000)</ref>, perform statistical tests of marginal and conditional independence to check dependency. On the other hand, the score-based methods, GES <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chickering, 2002)</ref>, rankGES <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nandy et al., 2018)</ref>, GIES <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alain Hauser, 2012)</ref>, and rankGIES, optimize the search according to a score function. Hybrid methods such as Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ioannis Tsamardinos, 2006)</ref> combine conditional tests with a score-based approach. Besides these three approaches, there are other methods such as structural equation models with additional restrictions, Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (LINGAM), <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Shimizu et al., 2006)</ref> that exploit invariance properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rothenhäusler et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">do-Calculus -Graphical Identification Criterion</head><p>We consider a query Q, the task of estimating the distribution of the outcome Y after intervening on the treatment variable X, mathematically written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (Y = y|do(X = x)).</formula><p>The question is if we can define the conditions under which we can infer the results of the query when we have data, X, Y, Z from an observational study where X, Y, and Z are randomly sampled.

Interventions in an SCM M are denoted by a mathematical operator, namely the do(•) operator. These interventions in SCMs, in the form of do(X = x), are carried out by removing individual functions, f i , from the model i.e. in the corresponding graph, severing all incoming arrows that enter the manipulated or intervening variable X. The distribution of Y after the intervention can be defined using the counterfactual notation as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (y|do(x)) P (Y x = y),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Y x = y means "Y would be equal to y if X had been x" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 2009)</ref>. The backdoor and front-door criteria can be used to identify sets of covariates that should be adjusted for using simple graphical identification rules. However, to uncover all causal effects that can be identified from a given DAG requires symbolic machinery <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 1995)</ref>. The problem of identification that asks whether the interventional distribution, P (Y = y|do(X = x)), can be estimated from the graph (along with the assumptions) and the available observational data.</p><p>For queries in the form of Q or do-expression, identifiability can be decided procedurally using an algebraic method known as the do-calculus.

A sufficient version of do-calculus is the adjustment criterion.</p><p>Do-calculus is a causal inference engine that takes three inputs (Hünermund and Bareinboim, 2019):</p><p>1.

Also, let G X be the graph obtained by removing all arrows pointing to nodes in X. Likewise, G X is a graph obtained by deleting all arrows that are emitted by X in G. The notation G XZ can be used to represent the previous two configurations together, the removal of both arrows incoming in X and arrows outgoing from Z. Given this notation, do-calculus has the following three rules that are valid for every interventional distribution compatible with the causal graph G <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016)</ref>.

To establish identifiability of a causal query Q, we need to repeatedly apply the rules of do-calculus to Q until an expression is obtained that is do-expression free. This do-free expression makes Q estimable from non-experimental data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Cohort selection</head><p>We first consider the observational data collected during routine care such as from an EHR. EHRs contain data repositories from multiple sources or healthcare facilities. In order to identify a set of eligible patients for the experiment, inclusion-exclusion criteria are defined based on the clinical question of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Structure Learning Algorithms</head><p>Given a data set, eligible patients for the study, the framework estimates a possible causal graph that could be generated given the distribution using structure learning algorithms (SLAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Raghu et al., 2018)</ref>. These SLAs learn the underlying causal graph at different levels of granularity under different assumptions. Based on these assumptions, multiple causal graphs were estimated using SLAs. We have considered the following seven SLAs for this framework: 1) PC Algorithm, 2) RFCI, 3) GES, 4) GDS, 5) TABU Search <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Glover and Laguna, 1998)</ref>, 6) MMHC, and 7) LINGHAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Majority Voting</head><p>Seven different causal graphs were estimated using the SLAs discussed in subsection 3.2 and subsection 4.2. We then used a majority voting scheme on the causal relationships estimated using the SLAs. If a simple majority, m/2 + 1 of algorithms support a causal relationship between X and Y , we consider the relationship for our model. Here m is the total number of SLAs under consideration i.e. 7. If it is supported by less than m/2 + 1 algorithms, we discard that functional relation from the model. If we consider a causal DAG G has n nodes, then these nodes are enumerated using integers from 1 to n. Therefore, it can have n x n or n 2 number of directional edges each representing a causal relationship. Let's consider a matrix V of n x n for a causal graph G that stores the number of votes received for each of the causal relationships between nodes i and j, two arbitrary nodes where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.</p><p>For each element (i, j) in V we consider the voting procedure in Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V (i, j) =      0 initially V (i, j) + 1 if a SLA</formula><p>supports a causal edge from i to j V (i, j) + 0 if a SLA does not support a causal edge from i to j</p><p>(5) Consider the pair (u, v) representing a directed edge from node u to node v in a causal graph. After counting votes for all the causal relationships in V , we draw a causal graph G using Equation <ref type="formula">6</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">G = G ∪ (u, v) if V (u, v) ≥ m 2 + 1 G ∪ ∅ if V (u, v)&lt; m 2 + 1 (6)</formula><p>where, 1 ≤ u, v&lt;n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Expert Augmented Knowledge</head><p>To finalize the causal graph for estimation, we verify the model with expert consultation and review of the current clinical literature. This provides a systematic approach for encoding existing clinical knowledge into the graph. In this step, we review the initial estimation, through majority voting, of the causal graph G by domain experts. It allows us to review causal relationships estimated by majority voting and makes the necessary adjustment based on existing evidence. We perform either of the following five operations based on the expert knowledge described in algorithm 1. The resultant causal graph is then reviewed again to make sure that it does not contain any cycles. Therefore, the final causal graph is always a DAG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Causal Questions</head><p>With the graph encoded with the causal relationships, we can now ask causal questions to understand how variables influence each other. This allows us to run virtual experiments to estimate treatment effects. The probability that Y = y when we intervene to make X = x is denoted by, P (Y = y|do(X = x)). That is to say if everyone in a population had their X value fixed at x then what is the population distribution of Y . Using do-expressions and a causal graph, we can ask causal questions and untangle the causal relationships. For our causal questions, X is the treatment variable and Y is the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Causal Identification</head><p>We used causal identification formula such as backdoor adjustment derived using the rules of do-calculus to find a set of confounding variables, Z that must be adjusted depending on the causal query in the form of P (Y |do(X)) and the graphical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pearl, 2009)</ref>. The model automatically finds the confounding variables, can distinguish between confounders and mediators, and provides the causal identification formula. The causal identification formula provides a mathematical transformation between the observational reality and the corresponding experimental reality. It is possible that certain graphical model will not be able to provide the causal identification formula, and in those cases, the method will not be able to answer the query of interest. The resultant formula can be used to evaluate the causal effect.</p><p>Algorithm 1 Encoding Expert Knowledge in to the Causal Graph, G Input: G, ExpertKnowledge Output: G</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1: for Each edge (u, v) in G do 2:</formula><p>if An evidence of a causal relationship from u to v then 3:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Keep the edge (u, v) in G 4:</formula><p>else if An evidence of a causal relationship from v to u then 5:</p><p>Change the orientation of the edge to (v, u)</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">6:</formula><p>else if An evidence of no causal relationship between u and v then 7:</p><p>Remove the edge (u, v) from G 8:</p><p>else if No evidence of a causal relationship between u and v then 9:</p><p>Keep the edge (u, v) in G 10:</p><p>end if 11: end for 12: for Each node u in G do 13:</p><p>for Each node v in G -{u} do 14:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">if the edge (u, v) not in G then 15:</formula><p>if An evidence of a causal relationship from u to v then end for 20: end for 4.7. Estimation Once we have these three sets of variables, treatment X, confounders Z, and outcome Y , we can compute the conditional probabilities in the adjustment formula using the probability distribution to compute the interventional effect. Computing each of the conditional probabilities in the adjustment formula is computationally expensive and may not lead to feasible results with small sample sizes. Instead, we use machine learning algorithms to estimate the probability distribution from the data, that is we use treatment X and confounders Z as input to an ML algorithm to estimate the outcome Y . For this step, we split our data into training and testing sets, each containing X, Y , and Z. We train two ML models, one based on observational data and another based on experimental data, using the training dataset. We use the testing set to predict Y from X and Z using the trained ML models. After that, we use bootstrapping to randomly subsample X and predicted Y for k iterations. This gives us an estimation of the effect of X on Y and used to estimate the mean and confidence interval.</p></div>

There were no significant between-group differences and no harm was associated with the use of the conservative oxygenation strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Selected Cohort</head><p>For our study, we considered a large ICU database containing data routinely collected from patients in the US. Adult patients of age at least 18 years old were considered. We used the MIMIC-III dataset for model development and evaluation <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2016)</ref>. The database comprises a total of 61,532 ICU stays at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA in which 53,432 stays are for adult patients and 8,100 stays are for neonatal patients. The database includes data logged using the CareVue and Metavision electronic health record (EHR) systems spanning from June 2001 to October 2012, a little over 11 years.</p><p>We included adult patients with eligibility criteria described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (b). We closely followed the inclusion-exclusion criteria in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (a) employed in OT-RCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Panwar et al., 2016)</ref>. After the exclusion of ineligible cases, we included 4,062 ICU patients from the database. Out of 4,062 patients, 3,812 patients received liberal oxygenation and 250 patients received conservative oxygenation. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We also present the demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients from the OT-RCT in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for comparison. Patients spent the majority of the time within the intended target range in both liberal and conservative groups. The pooled frequency histogram of the percentage of time spent at each SpO 2 level for both groups is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Our inclusion-exclusion criteria ensure that our study, SCM-VRCT has a similar distribution of SpO 2 in the liberal and conservative arms for observational data compared to the OT-RCT. We extracted a set of 26 variables, including demographics, ventilator settings, and oxygenation parameters, from the dataset. Data on oxygenation parameters and ventilator settings were extracted every 4 hours and for each patient, we included at least 168 hours of measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Structure Learning Algorithm</head><p>Our study has focused on estimating the effect of different oxygenation strategies by establishing the causal relationship between measured oxygenation parameters, ventilator settings, disease state, and demographic information.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Majority Voting</head><p>Based on the estimation by SLAs, we computed the matrix V for voting, using Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>. The resultant matrix is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, which has 26 rows and 26 columns. Each row has a variable for which we have the vote count in the columns for all 26 variables.</p><p>For example, the first row has the number of votes for variable age and the second row has the number of votes for gender. The value 6 at row 5 (variable trauma) and column 4 (variable surgery) means that the causal relationship from trauma to surgery has received 4 out of the total number of votes, 7. As this vote count is greater than or equal to 7/2 + 1 or 4, the majority voting, we include this causal relationship in our final causal graph. The estimated graph using the majority voting (Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>) based on the vote count in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Encoding Expert Knowledge</head><p>We developed the causal graph from the result of the majority voting of estimated graphs by structural learning algorithms. We then incorporated clinical domain knowledge by consulting the domain expert, a critical care physician. We reviewed each causal relationship estimated by the algorithms. This review phase of each of the edges from variable X to variable Y involves three operations: 1) keep the edge if it is supported by the domain knowledge, 2) change the direction or orientation of the edge if that is supported by the domain knowledge, and 3) remove the edge if it is not supported by the domain knowledge. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the process of incorporating the domain expert's input. N ode f rom → N ode to means N ode f rom causes N ode to . For example, in row 8, age causes COP D. The column, majority voting (MJV) is "Yes" which means that it was estimated by the majority voting of the structural learning algorithms, whereas a "No" indicates it was not. The Expert Knowledge column represents the addition of a new causal relationship, removal of an edge, or change of the orientation of an existing causal edge followed by the reference of the domain knowledge in the next column. In total, we added 16 new edges, removed 10 edges, and changed directions of 14 edges as a result of the process. We then review the graph to ensure that the graph is acyclic with clinician consultation. This process allows us to make sure that the causal graph encodes the clinical knowledge along with the data generating process.

Overall, patients in the conservative group spent more time off-target than the patients in the liberal group. Mean SpO 2 , P aO 2 , and F iO 2 were well separated for all patients between these groups. Patients in the conservative group spent more time at a SpO 2 of 90 -95% than those in the liberal group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). We performed a series of experiments based on the causal graph and the selected cohort from the observational data. For each of the following oxygenation strategies, discussed in the subsequent subsections, we have obtained a formula with an admissible set by adjustment using the rules of do-calculus. To illustrate the full picture, the derivation of the query in subsubsection 5.5.3 presented in the appendix, Appendix A and Appendix B. We also present the summary of the experimental results for CB-OBS and SCM-VRCT in Table 4 In our first experiment, we estimated the effect of conservative and liberal oxygenation on mortality, P oxygenation (death). The expectations of mortality for conservative and liberal oxygenation strategies are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> for both the CB-OBS and SCM-VRCT. For the CB-OBS, we found that the expectation of mortality is higher, 0.54, for the conservative oxygenation than the expectation of the mortality, 0.362 (95% CI [0.347, 0.377]) for the liberal oxygenation, as shown in 6(c)subfigure. However, for the SCM-VRCT, the expectation for mortality for the conservative oxygenation strategy is also 0.54 (95% CI [0.521, 0.558]) which is the same as the expectation we estimated in the CB-OBS. The expected mortality for the liberal approach in SCM-VRCT is 0.34 (95% CI [0.33, 0.353]), as shown in 6(a)subfigure. The variance for the effect of oxygenation on mortality in SCM-VRCT is significantly lower, 0.01 compared to the results in CB-OBS, 0.49.

For CB-OBS, we found that the age of the patient does not have any effect on the expected mortality. The expectation of mortality in SCM-VRCT for the liberal oxygenation strategy conditioned on age is 0.298 (95% CI [0.285, 0.313]), see 7(a)subfigure, which is lower compare to non-age specific CB-OBS, 0.362 (95% CI [0.347, 0.377]). On the other hand, the expectations of the mortality for conservative oxygenation for SCM-VRCT and CB-OBS are 0.529 (95% CI [0.505, 0.55]) and 0.54 (95% CI [0.478, 0.60]), respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.3.">Disease severity-specific effect on mortality for oxygenation strategies</head><p>We also estimated the effect of oxygen therapy on mortality conditioned on APSIII and SOFA scores, P oxygenation (death|AP Siii, SOF A). The expectation of mortality for conservative and liberal oxygenation for CB-OBS and SCM-VRCT are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. In CB-OBS, as we discussed in the previous section, the expectation of mortality is higher, 0.54 (95% CI [0.478, 0.60]), for the conservative oxygenation than the expectation of mortality, 0.362 (95% CI [0.347, 0.377]) for the liberal oxygenation. The conservative strategy in SCM-VRCT results in 0.539 (95% CI [0.518, 0.562]), see 7(c)subfigure. However, in the SCM-VRCT, the expectation of the mortality in the liberal strategy is 0.298 (95% CI [0.0.281, 0.311]) which is significantly lower than the expectation we estimated in the CB-OBS. Therefore, given the severity of illness based on the physiological scores, the liberal approach lowers the expectation of mortality. This finding is consistent with the results of several other studies reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>.</p><p>5.5.4. Disease severity-specific effect on mortality conditioned on specific SOFA score</p><p>Finally, we estimated the effect of oxygenation on mortality conditioned on two different ranges of SOFA score, P oxygenation (death|SOF A &lt;= 10) and P oxygenation (death|SOF A &gt; 10). Although the expectation of mortality decreases as we increase the SpO 2 , as shown in 7(c)subfigure, but the expectations of mortality for conservative and liberal oxygenation are different for two different ranges of SOFA scores. In the lower range of SOFA score (SOF A &lt;= 10), we found that the expectation of mortality is higher, 0.42 for the conservative oxygenation than the expectation of mortality, 0.35 for the liberal oxygenation. However, in the upper range of SOFA score (SOF A &gt; 10), we found that the expectation of mortality is higher, 0.58 for the conservative oxygenation than the expectation of mortality, 0.48 for the liberal oxygenation. One important observation here is that the expected outcome is higher for patients with a SOFA score greater than 10 compared to patients with  a SOFA score smaller than or equal to 10. Therefore, given the severity of illness based on the SOFA score, there is no significant difference in the mortality for different oxygenation targets. This finding also supports the feasibility of a larger study to investigate the effect of conservative oxygenation to treat patients requiring invasive MV in ICUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The study was conducted and validated on the MIMIC III ICU database, which contains data routinely collected from adult patients in the US. We included adult patients fulfilling the requirement for the study based on the OT-RCT study. After the exclusion of ineligible cases, we included 4,062 patients for the study. The time-series data of oxygenation parameters and ventilator settings were then used to compute the mean mortality over the entire period. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We extracted a set of 26 variables, 24 variables following the OT-RCT, including demographics, oxygenation parameters and ventilator settings, and 2 variables, one for oxygenation (treatment) and another for mortality (outcome).</p><p>We assessed the feasibility of a conservative oxygenation strategy (target SpO 2 88-95%) compared to a liberal oxygenation strategy (target SpO 2 ≥ 96%) during MV for adult ICU patients. The study protocol followed the protocol in the OT-RCT. To achieve treatment feasibility, this study implemented a clear separation in the mean SpO 2 , SaO 2 , P aO 2 , and F iO 2 values between the groups. The point estimate for 90-day mortality was lower with the liberal oxygenation strategy. This is not consistent with the findings of the OT-RCT. However, in the SCM-VRCT, the expectation of the mortality in the liberal strategy is significantly lower than the expectation we estimated in the CB-OBS. We conclude that given the severity of illness based on the physiological scores, the liberal approach lowers the expectation of mortality. This finding is consistent with the results of several other studies reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>.. The result of the estimation are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> (a). Another important observation is that the expected outcome is higher for patients with a SOFA score greater than 10 compared to patients with a SOFA score smaller than or equal to 10. That is, given the severity of illness based on the SOFA score, there is no significant difference in the mortality for different oxygenation targets. This finding also supports the feasibility of a larger study to investigate the effect of conservative oxygenation to treat patients requiring invasive MV in ICUs.</p><p>Several methodological limitations that we have in the current model are currently being addressed by us for future work with the theoretical foundations. These include timevarying causal model with SCM, survival analysis with SCM, and incorporating unobserved confounders in the model, among others.</p><p>It is important to note that although we demonstrated this method on oxygenation therapy for MV patients in the ICU, the technique can be applied generally for a broad set of clinical questions. We are currently applying this method for a range of questions including estimating the impact of antipsychotic drugs on delirium in the ICU and estimating the impact of timing of antibiotics for patients with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease.</p></div>

The large number of variables, 24 variables, we have in the model makes the subscripts in the equations long and clumsy. We use these sets in the derivation section. The qualitative knowledge of causal relationships in the domain is represented by a causal model shown in The treatment variable is oxygenation and the outcome variable is death.
