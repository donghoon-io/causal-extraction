<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from X0), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This work presents the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) from observed temporal marginals. While parameter estimation has been studied extensively using trajectory data, either from one long trajectory [BPRF06, NMY00, Bis07, TB13, MMP15, KOLL12, NR20, CHLS23], or multiple short trajectories [MCF + 24, WGH + 24, LJP + 21, PHR19, NM24], it is often impossible to observe individual trajectories when tracking large populations. For example, in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, the destructive nature of sequencing technologies prevents specific cells from being tracked over time [TCG + 14, STRZ + 16, FWR + 18, SST + 19, LZKS21]. Similarly, hydrogeochemical sensors cannot track distinct particles when studying contaminant flow, providing only data on plume migration [MT07, HZL + 23, SFGGH07, Elf06, AG92, BYB + 92, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">MFRC86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">NPK11]</ref>. Observational data may therefore be limited to samples from temporal marginals of the process at various measurement times. We refer to this observational setting as marginals-only.</p><p>However, many stochastic processes are non-identifiable under the marginals-only setting, since their distributions may evolve identically, despite having distinct individual trajectories [WWT + 18, CHS22]. Previous works therefore simplify the problem, such that at least one of diffusion or drift are already known <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[LZKS21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">SBB24b,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">VTLL21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">CZHS22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Zha24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">For24]</ref>. Moreover, it is common to impose model restrictions, such as irrotational drift and isotropic diffusion [LZKS21, CZHS22, Zha24, SBB24b, VTLL21, WWT + 18].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Our contributions</head><p>We prove that for a large class of initial distributions, the drift, diffusion, and underlying causal graph of an SDE with linear drift and additive diffusion can be identified from its temporal marginals. We also introduce a practical algorithm for estimating each of these quantities solely from the marginals of a general additive diffusion process, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on simulated data. We illustrate our Temporal marginals observed from a non-auto-rotationally invariant X 0 theoretical contributions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref> and our algorithmic contributions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1b</ref>. A detailed overview of our contributions is also given below.</p><p>1. We provide a theoretical foundation for system identification from temporal marginals in Section 3.</p><p>(a) In Theorem 3.3, we fully characterize the conditions for guaranteeing identifiability of linear drift and additive diffusion from observed marginals. Identifiability is guaranteed if and only if the initial distribution X 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant (Definition 3.2).</p><p>(b) In Lemma 3.5, we connect parameter estimation to causal structure learning via dynamic structural causal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[BM24]</ref>. We show that the causal graph of any additive noise model can be recovered from the SDE parameters.</p><p>2. In Section 4, we introduce our algorithm: Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from X 0 (APPEX). It is the first method designed to estimate drift and diffusion from temporal marginals of additive noise SDEs, without prior knowledge.</p><p>(a) We show that with each iteration, APPEX's estimates approach the true solution. APPEX alternates between a trajectory inference step, which is a Schrödinger bridge problem, and a parameter estimation step, which is solved via maximum likelihood estimation.</p><p>(b) To solve the Schrödinger bridge problem for trajectory inference, we adapt entropic optimal transport for parameter dependent transport costs, including arbitrary anisotropic diffusion.</p><p>(c) We test APPEX's efficacy across a wide range of experiments in Section 5. We first use APPEX to empirically demonstrate that classical non-identifiable linear additive noise SDEs are resolved when X 0 is initialized appropriately according to Theorem 3.3. We then demonstrate APPEX's effectiveness over a large-scale experiment on higher dimensional SDEs with randomly generated parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that APPEX identifies arbitrary linear additive noise SDEs with significantly higher accuracy than the widely-used Waddington-OT (WOT) method [SST + 19]. Our final experiments demonstrate that APPEX can be used to identify the system's causal graph, even in the presence of correlated diffusion from latent confounders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and related work</head><p>In this section, we first give an overview of SDEs and a discussion of some real-world applications. We then review relevant literature and techniques for statistical inference from the "marginals-only" observational setting. Finally, we discuss the problem of non-identifiability of SDEs under this setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and modeling real-world systems</head><p>The mathematical framework of SDEs, or drift-diffusion processes, originates from statistical mechanics. The drift models the velocity of particles flowing in a carrier fluid, while diffusion is driven by Brownian motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Ein56]</ref>, and governs their dispersion due to random collisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[MB92]</ref>. Formally, a d-dimensional time-homogeneous SDE is driven by an m-dimensional Brownian motion W t , and is parameterized by a drift function b(x) : R d → R d and a diffusion function σ(x) : R d → R d×m , such that dX t = b(X t ) dt + σ(X t ) dW t , X 0 ∼ p 0 ,</p><p>where b(x) and σ(x) are Lipschitz to ensure the solution's existence and uniqueness <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[FG20]</ref>. By capturing deterministic and stochastic dynamics, SDEs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across a variety of fields. For example, SDEs have been used to model cell differentiation in single-cell biology, where a stem cell changes into another cell type, such as a blood cell or bone cell. The drift can be related to the set of genes that directly regulate the expression of a gene of interest [Zha24, AVI + 20, ATW + 24, ZLSS24, TLBB + 23], and therefore provides insights into genetic diseases and gene therapies. Meanwhile, the diffusion informs the extent to which cell fates are determined by initial conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[For24]</ref>. In hydrological systems, drift is linked to important and unknown properties of the subsurface, such as hydraulic conductivity through average flow velocity [HZL + 23, BHR93], while the diffusion usually describes material heterogeneity or turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[BHR93]</ref>, and therefore informs the applicability of popular models, such as Darcy's law <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[MT07,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">OT10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">LKR02]</ref>. Together, these parameters determine pollutant fates in hydrological systems, a key concern in safeguarding drinking water sources [O + 02, FMR06, LBSV + 19, CCMV99, Pau97, CBL + 19]. In addition to applications to physical sciences, SDEs have also been prominently used for pricing stocks and options in financial markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[BS73]</ref> and for image generation in computer vision [MHS + 21].</p><p>In this paper, we consider time-homogeneous additive noise SDEs. These SDEs are characterized by an arbitrary drift function b(X t ) and a possibly anisotropic space-independent diffusion G ∈ R d×m , such that dX t = b(X t ) dt + G dW t , X 0 ∼ p 0 .</p><p>(2)</p><p>We also refer to H = GG ⊤ ∈ R d×d as the (observational) diffusion, since it is only possible to observe H [WGH + 24, Pav14]. Time-homogeneous linear additive noise SDEs are of particular interest [dBT23, WGH + 24, Zha24], as they generalize the popular Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process by removing the assumption of stationarity. A time-homogeneous linear additive noise SDE obeys the form dX t = AX t dt + G dW t , X 0 ∼ p 0 , A ∈ R d×d .</p><p>(3)</p><p>We overview important properties of this SDE in Section 7.2 of the appendix, including its closed form solution and transition density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Inference from temporal marginals</head><p>The marginals-only observational setting dates back to at least Aristotle, who dissected bird eggs at various developmental stages, in order to infer the processes and mediators (e.g., heat) behind embryogenesis [Wad35, O + 82, Ari42]. If the underlying system is modeled by an SDE, then the evolution of its temporal marginals p t are defined by its Fokker-Planck equation. For example, a straightforward computation shows that the marginals of a linear additive noise SDE evolve according to the following Fokker-Planck equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∂ ∂t p(x, t) = -∇ • ((Ax)p(x, t)) + 1 2 ∇ • (H∇p(x, t)), p(x, 0) = p 0 (x). (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Contemporary research in statistical inference from temporal marginals largely comes from single-cell biology. Many works focus on trajectory inference for cell fates [SST + 19, LZKS21, YWI + 23, CZHS22], while others infer the causal graph, e.g. GRN [AVI + 20, BLL + 20, TLBB + 23, RCM + 24], or perform parameter estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[CML09,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">SBB24a]</ref>. Recent works jointly estimate a subset of these quantities by leveraging their intrinsic relationships. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[VTLL21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">SBB24b]</ref> are primarily interested in trajectory inference, and iteratively estimate drift and trajectories. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[Zha24]</ref> iteratively estimates drift and trajectories, while additionally applying permanent interventions on the drift dynamics for network inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Schrödinger bridge problem</head><p>Given a set of temporal marginals, trajectory inference is the task of estimating a law on paths that obeys each marginal constraint while closely approximating desired reference dynamics. This is commonly implemented by solving the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[CZHS22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">SBB24a]</ref>, defined below for a pair of marginals. Given the transition law K of a reference process, an initial distribution µ, and a final distribution ν, the SB solution is the law of the stochastic process, which satisfies both marginal constraints, while minimizing relative entropy to K:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">π * = Proj KL Π(µ,ν) (K) = arg min π∈Π(µ,ν) D KL (π∥K).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The SB problem has also gained interest in the machine learning community, due to its connection to generative diffusion models. Score estimation of time-reversed SDEs is an instance of the SB problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[DBTHD21]</ref>, and SB solvers are now widely used in generative modeling due to their flexibility [DBTHD21, CLT21, SDBCD24, Hua24].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Identifiability of SDE parameters</head><p>The problem of non-identifiability occurs if there exists an alternative drift-diffusion pair, e.g. ( Ã, H) ̸ = (A, H) for linear-additive noise SDEs, which shares the same marginals. Equivalently, the processes satisfy the same Fokker-Planck equation across all observed times, given initial distribution p 0 . Non-identifiability can occur due to many factors. For example, distinct SDEs can share the same stationary distribution, and would hence be non-identifiable from marginals if p 0 is initialized at equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[LZKS21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">SBB24a]</ref>. Also, if the initial distribution is standard normal p 0 ∼ N (0, I d ), then it would be impossible to distinguish between a pure Brownian motion, and an SDE with an additional rotational vector field <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[SBB24a]</ref>. We overview three classical examples of non-identifiability in Section 7.1 of the Appendix.</p><p>Because of non-identifiability, previous works require assumptions about the underlying SDE to perform inference. The standard assumptions are that the drift is an irrotational vector field ∇ψ [WWT + 18, LZKS21, VTLL21, CZHS22, TLD24] and that the diffusion is both known and given by isotropic Brownian motion σdW t [WWT + 18, LZKS21, VTLL21, CZHS22, SBB24b, Zha24, TLD24]. It is also common to leverage additional perturbational data from interventions [RCM + 24, Zha24], and to impose regularization [Zha24, MCS + 24], to better learn the system. However, these constraints impose unrealistic conditions on the data. An irrotational drift field cannot model negative feedback loops or repressilator dynamics [WWT + 18], which are common in biological data. Similarly, isotropic diffusion cannot model variable noise scales or correlated noise structures, which commonly arise in real data [MH22, RCM + 24, SRSM24]. While most works use a known diffusion estimate to infer drift, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[For24]</ref> infers diffusion, but requires a drift estimate. In both cases, the accuracy of the prior estimate is crucial, because misspecified diffusion typically leads to poor drift estimation and vice-versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[BHR93]</ref>. This is problematic, since knowing drift or diffusion a priori is unrealistic in practice. Finally, we note that concurrent work estimates drift and diffusion, but does not consider the uniqueness of learned parameters, due to non-identifiability <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[TLD24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">BMBR24]</ref>.</p><p>To advance the field of statistical inference from temporal marginals, we work to remove previous assumptions by determining conditions for identifiability and designing a method that leverages them. [WGH + 24] showed that identifiability of a linear additive noise SDE from ground truth trajectories with fixed X 0 ∈ R d is equivalent to a non-degenerate rank condition based jointly on X 0 , the linear drift A and the observational diffusion GG ⊤ . In contrast, our work studies identifiability of linear additive noise SDEs in the more general "marginals-only" setting. We also demonstrate that identifiability is guaranteed across all linear additive noise SDEs solely from the properties of the initial distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been shown even in the case of trajectory-based observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System identification from temporal marginals</head><p>We present our main theorem in Section 3.1. We prove that generalized rotational symmetries in the initial distribution X 0 provide necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the drift and diffusion parameters of linear additive noise SDEs from its time marginals. We then show that the underlying causal graph of a general additive noise SDE can be recovered from its drift and diffusion parameters in Section 3.2.</p><p>We first define the desired rotational properties. Recall that classical rotations in R d for d ≥ 2 are given by matrix exponentials e At , such that t is the rotation angle and A is skew-symmetric, i.e. A + A ⊤ = 0. We may similarly define rotations over anisotropic geometries.  Definition 3.1. Let d ≥ 2. We define a Σ-generalized rotation in R d as a matrix exponential e At , such that t is the rotation angle and A ∈ R d×d is skew-symmetric with respect to Σ ⪰ 0, i.e. AΣ + ΣA ⊤ = 0.</p><p>If Σ ≻ 0, then Σ-generalized rotations are equivalent to classical rotations in a transformed space, such that lengths and angles are modified by scaling and shearing(see Lemma 7.4 in appendix). Intuitively, ellipsoids, defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E Σ = {x ∈ R d : x ⊤ Σ -1 x = 1}, are invariant under Σ-generalized rotations, since e At E Σ = E Σ .</formula><p>We may similarly extend this definition for random variables. Definition 3.2. Let X be a d-dimensional r.v. with covariance Σ. X is auto-rotationally invariant</p><p>• if there exists a nontrivial Σ-generalized rotation e At with A ̸ = 0 such e At X ∼ X ∀t ≥ 0, or • if there exists an orthogonal transformation P , such that at least one component of P ⊤ X is mean 0 univariate Gaussian, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(P ⊤ X) 1 ∼ N (0, σ 2 ).</formula><p>Conversely, X is not auto-rotationally invariant, if e At X ∼ X ∀t ≥ 0 admits only the solution A = 0, and none of its cross sections are univariate Gaussian.</p><p>Auto-rotational invariance is reminiscent of Maxwell's theorem, which states that if a random vector X has independent components, and is invariant to all classical rotations, then X ∼ N (0, σ 2 I d ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[Max60]</ref>. Indeed, all mean 0 isotropic Gaussians are auto-rotationally invariant, since they are invariant under e At , for any skew-symmetric A. To extend our definition to one dimensional subspaces, where rotations are undefined, we define mean 0 Gaussians as the only univariate auto-rotationally invariant distributions by convention.</p><p>However, auto-rotational invariance generalizes Maxwell's characterization in a few important ways. First, auto-rotational invariance generalizes rotations for anisotropic geometries defined by the covariance Σ, e.g. N (0, Σ) is auto-rotationally invariant (see Lemma 7.5 in appendix). Second, auto-rotational invariance only requires that there exists one matrix A such that e At X ∼ X, rather than invariance to all rotations, e.g. a stack of Gaussians X = Unif(-1, 1) × N (0, Σ) would be auto-rotationally invariant. Furthermore, auto-rotational invariance does not assume independent components, and therefore permits any rotationally symmetric distribution (after shearing and scaling R d accordingly), e.g. uniform distributions over ellipsoids and cylindrical distributions are auto-rotationally invariant. Finally, the matrix A is not required to be related to a rotation, even after shearing and scaling the space. Indeed, all degenerate r.v,'s are auto-rotationally invariant, since e At X ∼ X would hold if X is in the nullspace of A with probability 1. It turns out that if X is non-degenerate and satisfies e At X ∼ X for some A ̸ = 0, then X has a density whose level sets are ellipsoids (see Lemma 7.6 in the appendix). Thus, almost all r.v.s are not auto-rotationally invariant. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates examples of auto-rotationally invariant r.v.s and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref> in the appendix shows that there are only three types of auto-rotational invariance: rank-degenerate r.v.s, r.v.s that are invariant to a non-degenerate Σ-generalized rotation, and r.v.s containing a Gaussian cross-section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">SDE parameter identifiability</head><p>We are now ready for our main identifiability theorem, which characterizes identifiability of linear additive noise SDEs based on the auto-rotational invariance of the initial distribution X 0 .</p><p>Theorem 3.3. Let p 0 be a probability distribution on R d with finite moments, and let</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Θ = {(A, H) : A ∈ R d×d , G ∈ R d×m , H = GG ⊤ }</formula><p>denote the set of drift-diffusion pairs under a linear additive noise model (3). Then, given the initialization X 0 ∼ p 0 , any parameter set (A, H) ∈ Θ is identifiable from its marginals {p t : t ≥ 0} A,H , in the sense that if {p t : t ≥ 0} A,H = {p t : t ≥ 0} Ã, H then (A, H) = ( Ã, H), if and only if p 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant.</p><p>In other words, identifiability of (A, H) from marginals is guaranteed if p 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant. However, if p 0 is auto-rotationally invariant, then there exist multiple drift-diffusion pairs (A, H) ∈ Θ that would obey the same marginals from p 0 .</p><p>Proof. We first show that if X 0 is auto-rotationally invariant, then there exist multiple systems with equivalent marginals for each time, but distinct parameter sets (A, H = GG ⊤ ) ̸ = ( Ã, H = G G⊤ ). Since X 0 is autorotationally invariant, then there exists a matrix A ̸ = 0 such that e At X 0 ∼ X 0 , or there exists a cross-section that is univariate Gaussian, i.e. (P ⊤ X 0 ) 1 ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) such that P ⊤ = P -1 .</p><p>If there is A ̸ = 0 such that e At X 0 ∼ X 0 , then distinguishing the presence of A in the linear drift would be impossible, provided that A is also skew-symmetric with respect to the diffusion H = GG T . Indeed, given that e At X 0 ∼ X 0 and AH + HA ⊤ = 0, the following two processes would obey X t ∼ Y t ∀t ≥ 0, γ ∈ R:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">dX t = γGdW t X 0 ∼ p 0 (6) dY t = AY t dt + γGdW t Y 0 ∼ p 0<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Intuitively, A induces a Σ-generalized rotation that is non-identifiable from X 0 , where Σ = Cov(X 0 ). The full proof for the distributional equivalence of (6) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">7</ref>) is given in the Appendix. Alternatively, suppose that (P ⊤ X 0 ) 1 ∼ N (0, σ 2 ). Recall that N (0, σ 2 ) is the stationary distribution of any one-dimensional OU process with drift:diffusivity ratio -1 : 2σ 2 [LZKS21, BMBR24]. Thus, the SDEs</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">d(P ⊤ X t ) = -1 2 0 0 A 2,2 P ⊤ X t dt + σ 0 0 G 2,2 dW t X 0 ∼ p 0 (8) d(P ⊤ Y t ) = -α 2 2 0 0 A 2,2 P ⊤ Y t dt + ασ 0 0 G 2,2 dW t Y 0 ∼ p 0 .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>would obey the same marginals P ⊤ X t ∼ P ⊤ Y t for all t ≥ 0. Both SDEs are distributionally identical in the first component, since they would stay at the stationary distribution N (0, σ 2 ). The SDEs also trivially obey the same law in the complementary subspace. It then follows that X t ∼ Y t would hold ∀t ≥ 0 given the SDEs</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">dX t = P -1 2 0 0 A 2,2 P ⊤ X t dt + P σ 0 0 G 2,2 dW t X 0 ∼ p 0 (10) dY t = P -α 2 2 0 0 A 2,2 P ⊤ Y t dt + P ασ 0 0 G 2,2 dW t Y 0 ∼ p 0 .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>We now prove that identifiability is guaranteed if X 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Causal graph identification from SDE parameters</head><p>Given that the drift and diffusion are identified, we can gain important insights into the system's causal structure. It has already been shown that knowing drift and diffusion provides the system's post-intervention distributions [HS14, WGH + 24]. We prove under basic conditions that the causal graph G of an additive noise SDE can be recovered from the drift b(X t ) and observational diffusion H = GG ⊤ . Consider a d-dimensional additive noise SDE (2). By isolating the jth variable and integrating, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">X (j) t = X (j) 0 + t 0 b j (X α(j) s ) ds + m k=1 G j,k W (k) t ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where α(j) ⊂ [d] is the set of variables that are used as input in b j (X t ). Then, (15) is an example of a dynamic structural causal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[BM24]</ref>. In particular, we can define a causal graph G over vertices V = [d] and edges</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">E = {i → j : j ∈ [d], i ∈ α(j)} [BM24][Definition 2]. Intuitively, given j ∈ V , we include the edge i → j if X (i) t</formula><p>influences the evolution of X (j) t through the drift. Under an additive noise model, the diffusion σ(X t ) = G is space-independent, and does not contribute edges between vertices. However, if G is anisotropic, then the diffusion induces correlations between variables through shared driving noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[SRSM24]</ref>. In this paper, we interpret shared driving noise as evidence of a latent confounder.</p><p>Definition 3.4. Let X evolve according to a d-dimensional additive noise SDE:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">dX t = b(X t ) dt + G dW t . We define a multi-directed edge ẽ = (i 1 , . . . i p ) ∈ G if variables X (i1) , . . . , X (ip) depend on a common noise source W (k) t , k ∈ [m].</formula><p>This definition follows standard convention in the static setting, where latent confounders introduce dependencies between noise terms in a functional causal model. In this framework, multidirected edges represent sets of variables whose noise terms are dependent due to a shared latent confounder <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[LRW21]</ref>. In the dynamic setting, shared driving noise has similarly been used to to model latent confounders (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[LKS24]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[BM24]</ref>[Example 4]). However, we note that this is not a comprehensive characterization of latent confounders in the dynamic setting, since confounding effects cannot always be attributed to diffusion. To address this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[MH22]</ref> uses blunt edges to specifically denote correlated noise between two variables.</p><p>Under this causal framework, we show that the drift and diffusion identify all directed edges in the underlying causal graph, as well as all pairwise multidirected edges, i.e. bidirected edges.</p><p>Lemma 3.5. Let X t evolve according to a d-dimensional additive noise SDE: dX t = b(X t ) dt + GdW t , and let G = (V = [d], E, Ẽ) be its causal graph, over the variables X (1) , • • • , X (d) , with directed edge set E and multidirected edge set Ẽ.</p><p>a.

There exists a multidirected edge ẽ containing (i, j) in G, if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">H i,j = (GG ⊤ ) i,j ̸ = 0.</formula><p>Thus, G is identified by b(X t ) and H = GG ⊤ if no more than two variables share a common noise source.</p><p>Proof. The first claim follows immediately from the definition of the dynamic structural causal model (15).</p><p>To prove the second claim, it is easy to see from (15) that X (i1) , . . . , X (ip) depends on a common noise source if and only if G i1,k , . . . G ip,k ̸ = 0 for some column k ∈ [m] in the diffusion G. Indeed, the existence of such a column implies that X (i1) , . . . , X (ip) each depend on W (k) t , and the other direction is given by the fact that W t is a multivariate Gaussian process, with independent components. If two variables share a noise source, this condition is equivalent to H i,j = G i • G j ̸ = 0. We therefore conclude that there is a multidirected edge containing (i, j) in G if and only if H i,j ̸ = 0. Lemma 3.5 enables arbitrary causal structures to be learned from the drift, as well as pairwise shared noise structures from the diffusion. Combining Theorem 3.3 and Lemma 3.5 shows that we can identify the full causal structure of a linear additive noise SDE from its marginals if and only if X 0 is non-autorotationally invariant. This result is particularly important for GRN inference, since our mathematical framework encompasses rotational drift, which can model feedback and repressilator dynamics [WWT + 18].</p></div>

We focus on linear additive noise SDEs, since Theorem 3.3 guarantees identifiability given that X 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant. However, our algorithm can be used to estimate any additive noise SDE in the form of Equation 2.

Using this reference SDE and the set of observed temporal marginals, we perform trajectory inference (18), to estimate the path distribution q (k) ∈ D that minimizes relative entropy to the reference SDE, while satisfying the marginal constraints (16) (see the middle plot of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). We then perform a two-step maximum likelihood estimation, in order to estimate the drift and diffusion from the estimated trajectories. This in turn updates the reference SDE p A (k) ,H (k) ∈ A for the next iteration. To perform APPEX on a general additive noise SDE (2), the spaces A and the drift maximum likelihood parameter estimation step (19) would be modified accordingly. We show in Corollary 7.17 of the appendix that there is a closed form diffusion MLE for general additive noise SDEs, once the drift has been estimated.</p><p>Previous works [Zha24, SBB24b, VTLL21] implement similar iterative schemes, which alternate between trajectory inference and MLE parameter estimation. In contrast to our method, each of these works assumes that the diffusion of the process is known, and hence invariant across iterations. One reason for this assumption is to ensure finite KL divergence between the estimated trajectories and estimated SDEs for all iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[VTLL21]</ref>. Given continuously observed marginals of a d-dimensional process, the KL divergence between two laws on paths q, p is taken over the path space Ω = C([0, T ], R d ), such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">D KL (q∥p) = Ω log dq dp (ω) dq(ω).</formula><p>Thus, D KL (q∥p) will only be finite between two laws on paths if we can define the Radon-Nikodym derivative dq dp over path space Ω.

We note that D KL (q i ∥p i ) ≤ D KL (q i,i+1 ∥p i,i+1 ) holds by the data-processing inequality. Hence, D KL (q N ∥p N ) will be finite as long as</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">D KL (q i,i+1 ∥p i,i+1 ) = R d ×R d log dqi,i+1</formula><p>dpi,i+1 (x) q i,i+1 (x) dx &lt; ∞ for each i = 0, . . . , N -1. In particular, if p and q are the laws of two different drift-diffusion SDEs with distinct non-degenerate diffusions, then the KL divergence D KL (q N ∥p N ) over the discretized path space Σ D will be finite. Since we consider a setting with a finite number of temporal marginal observations in this work, we may consider laws on paths discretized over these observations. This allows us to both consider diffusions which are not known in advance, and to improve our diffusion estimates with respect to KL divergence after each iteration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>In a wide range of experiments on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs, we find that APPEX accurately identifies the underlying SDE from its temporal marginals and that it outperforms the popular Waddington-OT method [SST + 19]. In Section 5.1, we assess the validity of Theorem 3.3 by showing that APPEX can learn the drift and diffusion parameters of classical non-identifiable SDEs, if X 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant. We then demonstrate APPEX's effectiveness on randomly generated higherdimensional SDEs in Section 5.2. Finally, in Section 5.3, we show that APPEX can use its parameter estimates to recover the underlying causal graph, thus supporting Proposition 3.5. An empirical experiment for consistency is also provided in Appendix 8.1, which shows that as the number of samples per time marginal increases, APPEX's drift and diffusion estimates converge to the true parameters.</p><p>For each experiment, we simulate data for linear additive noise SDEs using Euler-Maruyama discretization with dt EM = 0.01, such that we generate M = 500 trajectories, each observed across 100 time steps. Each d-dimensional trajectory is initialized with p 0 ∼ Unif{x i } d i=1 where {x i } d i=1 are random linearly independent vectors with each entry having a magnitude uniformly sampled between 2 and 10. It follows from Proposition 7.8 and Theorem 3.3, that this initial distribution ensures that the drift and diffusion are theoretically identifiable. To model the "marginals-only" setting, we subsample at the rate dt = 0.05 to produce N = 20 marginals with M = 500 observations per time.</p><p>To perform parameter estimation, we use 30 iterations of our APPEX algorithm, such that the first reference SDE is an isotropic Brownian motion dX t = σdW t , even when the true process has anisotropic noise. To model the realistic setting where diffusion is not precisely known, we assume that the initial guess of the diffusion's trace is within an order of magnitude of the ground truth trace tr(H). Specifically, we initialize A (0) = 0, H (0) = σ 2 I d s.t. σ 2 ∼ tr(H)10 Unif(-1,1) . Because the first reference SDE is σdW t , we note that the first iteration of APPEX is equivalent to performing MLE on trajectories that were inferred using the Waddington-OT (WOT) method from [SST + 19], based on standard entropy regularized OT (22) with ϵ 2 = σ 2 ∆t. APPEX and WOT are distinguished by the fact that APPEX benefits from further iterations, and allows the reference SDE to have anisotropic diffusion and non-zero drift. For each iteration of APPEX, we use Sinkhorn's algorithm to solve the anisotropic entropy-regularized optimal transport problem for trajectory inference, and we use the closed form MLE solutions from Proposition 4.2. Due to time complexity and numerical stability, we use linearized discretizations for the Gaussian transition kernels (unless d = 1).</p></div>

By Theorem 3.3, parameter estimation is feasible under the revised initial distribution. 10 replicates of each experiment were performed, such that the replicates featured data from different valid p 0 initializations and different initial diffusivities σ 2 . We track the mean absolute error (MAE), plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, between the true drift/diffusion parameters and their estimates.</p><p>The results are consistent with Theorem 3.3 and Lemma 4.4. In each example, APPEX is able to estimate the drift and diffusion by iteratively improving upon both estimates, as evidenced by decreasing MAEs as the number of iterations increases. In particular, we observe the worst performance from the first iteration, which is equivalent to performing parameter estimation following trajectory inference by WOT. The most difficult SDE to infer was dX t = -10X t dt + √ 10dW t , due to the high noise scale. We also note that APPEX succeeded in estimating the degenerate diffusion from the SDEs in Example 7.3, despite the fact that degenerate diffusion can result in infinite KL divergence with respect to a misspecified reference SDE. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Higher dimensional randomly generated linear additive noise SDEs</head><p>We now consider parameter estimation on a broad range of higher dimensional random linear additive noise SDEs. For each dimension d = 3, . . . , 10, we generate 10 random SDEs. To create each drift matrix A, we randomly sample each of its d 2 entries from Unif(-5, 5), and verify that its principal eigenvalue is less than 1. This allows us to consider non-stationary processes, while obeying reasonable growth conditions. To create each diffusion G, we randomly initialize each of its d 2 entries via Unif(-1, 1) and then set H = GG ⊤ . For numerical stability, we perform Sinkhorn on the logarithmic scale for this experiment. We evaluate each estimate's performance using MAE and correlation with the true parameters, where correlation is computed by vectorizing the corresponding matrices.  The results demonstrate that APPEX estimates both SDE parameter sets robustly across all settings. Importantly, APPEX can handle arbitrary additive noise structures H = GG ⊤ , as evidenced by the fact that its drift and diffusion estimates have low MAE and high correlation with respect to the true parameters. This is significant because previous literature has focused on the setting of isotropic noise, but in practice, we expect correlated noise structures, as well as unequal noise along the main diagonal. In contrast, although WOT estimates the drift somewhat decently, it is unable to estimate the diffusion accurately, particularly in higher dimensions, since it is constrained to isotropic noise in its reference SDE. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> shows how APPEX is able to re-orient incorrect diffusion priors to closely match the true diffusion of the underlying SDE.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Causal discovery</head><p>We conclude with experiments that test our method's ability to recover the underlying causal graph. We first consider causal discovery from systems without latent confounders, and then consider causal discovery from systems with latent pairwise confounders through correlated diffusion.</p><p>In both settings, we generate random SDEs of dimension d = 3, 5, 10 whose causal structure is determined by Erdös-Renyi graphs G(d, p), such that each of the d(d -1) possible simple directed edges are included with probability p. As in Section 5.2, we ensure that the maximal eigenvalue of the randomly generated ground truth drift matrix is at most 1 to prevent unbounded growth. Proposition 3.5 states that simple directed edges e = i → j ∈ E in the causal graph G = ([d], E, Ẽ) are characterized by the condition A j,i ̸ = 0. To simulate ground truth edges, we follow standard convention, by simulating edge weights A j,i uniformly via Unif(-5, -0.5) ∪ Unif(0.5, 5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[Run21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">RSW21]</ref>. We infer the presence of an edge i → j, if in the estimated drift, Âj,i &gt; ϵ (corresponding to a positive edge weight) or Âj,i &lt; -ϵ (corresponding to a negative edge weight). We choose our threshold ϵ = 0.5 to match the minimal edge weight magnitude from our simulations. Inference of simple edges is then measured according to the structural Hamming distance between G and the estimated graph G est , which considers the classification of positive directed edges, negative directed edges, and absent edges. The structural Hamming distance adds 1 for every misclassified simple edge:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">d simple (G, G) = (i,j)∈[d]×[d] 1 sgn(A j,i ) ̸ = sgn( Âj,i )1 | Âj,i|&gt;ϵ .<label>(29)</label></formula><p>If the observed system does not have any latent confounders from correlated diffusion, we enforce this by setting the diffusion matrix G to be strictly diagonal. This ensures that the only edges in G are simple edges from the drift. As in the experiments on random matrices, we set each of the d diagonal entries of G via Unif(-1, 1). Conversely, when modeling pairwise latent confounders, we introduce correlated diffusion by selecting a random subset of columns in G to have precisely two nonzero entries. In particular, we initialize all entries along the diagonal of G to be 1, and for each of the selected columns, e.g. column i, we set one non-diagonal entry G i,j = 1, to model the pairwise latent confounder U i,j . All other entries are set to 0. The number of selected columns with pairwise latent confounders is sampled from Unif{1, • • • ⌊2d/3⌋}, e.g. we sample from Unif{1, 2} for d = 3, Unif{1, 2, 3} for d = 5, and Unif{1, . . . 6} for d = 10.

We observe that APPEX can consistently infer complex causal relationships, whereas WOT's inference is often limited, due to mis-specified diffusion. For example, the first row in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> demonstrates that APPEX recovers the system's negative feedback structure, while WOT introduces additional cycles in order to compensate for a poorly specified reference diffusion.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> reports the mean structural Hamming distances for simple and bidirected edges (from latent pairwise confounders) from causal graphs estimated by WOT and APPEX, in the setting with correlated diffusion.

As in the setting with uncorrelated diffusion, APPEX outperforms WOT in all evaluated settings, particularly for higher-dimensional systems.  Red edges i → j represent negative edge weights, such that X (i) negatively regulates X (j) . Green edges i → j represent positive edge weights, such that X (i) positively regulates X (j) .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Many recent works have focused on inferring the drift or diffusion from an SDE's temporal marginals, yet the problem of non-identifiability remained largely unaddressed [WWT + 18, LZKS21, CZHS22, SBB24a, Zha24, TLD24, BMBR24]. To resolve this issue, we provide necessary and sufficient identifiability conditions for linear additive noise SDEs in Theorem 3.3. With this theorem, we prove that non-identifiability of the drift and diffusion arises precisely from the auto-rotational invariance of the initial distribution X 0 . We also show that the drift and diffusion parameters identify the underlying causal graph for general additive noise SDEs. This provides a theoretical foundation for learning the precise dynamics and causal structure of a linear additive noise process, solely from its temporal marginals, without relying on the usual prior knowledge assumptions and model restrictions.</p><p>To build on our theoretical contributions, we also introduce APPEX, a method that simultaneously learns drift and diffusion from temporal marginals. APPEX iterates towards the optimal parameter set by alternating between trajectory inference, via anisotropic entropy-regularized optimal transport, and MLE parameter estimation. Since each of these subprocedures are asymptotically optimal (Lemma 4.4), given a finite set of the process' true marginals, APPEX improves its estimates with each iteration. When tested on hundreds of randomly generated linear additive noise SDEs between dimensions 3 to 10, APPEX is able to effectively recover the process' drift, diffusion, and causal graph, while significantly outperforming Waddington-OT, which is one of the most popular inference methods in single-cell biology.</p><p>Our theoretical and algorithmic contributions offer a number of insights to advance statistical inference methods from temporal marginals. First, our framework removes common model restrictions to expand the set of dynamics that can be inferred from marginals. This includes negative feedback loops and repressilator dynamics, which both arise from rotational drift, and correlated noise, which arises from anisotropic diffusion. These features are common in real-world datasets, and are especially relevant for accurate trajectory and GRN inference from single-cell data [WWT + 18, SRSM24]. Second, we demonstrate that joint identification of the unique drift and diffusion parameters is theoretically and practically possible in the "marginals-only" setting. Previous and concurrent works either estimate only one parameter given the other [WWT + 18, LZKS21, CZHS22, SBB24a, Zha24, For24] or estimate both without guaranteeing non-identifiability <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[TLD24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">BMBR24]</ref>. We note that even if a user is only interested in one parameter, APPEX offers the ability to estimate it, regardless of how the other parameter is initialized. This is particularly significant given that a misspecified diffusion typically leads to a misidentified drift, and vice-versa. Third, we remark that the fundamental condition for identifibility is satisfied by a large class of distributions and should therefore be widely applicable. Indeed, the only pathological distributions are auto-rotationally invariant, which fall into three categories (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>): 1) satisfying invariance under a rotation after scaling and shearing, 2) having a mean-0 Gaussian cross-section, 3) having rank-degenerate support. One can therefore check the initial distribution, and perform an intervention if needed, to guarantee system identifiability from marginals generated by a linear additive noise SDE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Limitations and future work</head><p>Although this paper presents several breakthroughs for the identification of SDEs from marginal snapshots, we acknowledge several limitations and opportunities for future work.</p><p>First, while Theorem 3.3 shows that identifiability is guaranteed when the initial distribution X 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant, and that there exist non-identifiable SDEs if X 0 is auto-rotationally invariant, we note that this is distinct from the stronger claim that given a set of observed temporal marginals from an SDE, the true parameters are uniquely identifiable from the data if and only X 0 is auto-rotationally invariant. For example, if X 0 is rotationally symmetric, e.g. N (0, I d ), then it would be impossible to determine rotational drift. Similarly, if X 0 is rank-degenerate, then it would be impossible to distinguish between drifts that each contain X 0 in its nullspace. However, if the underlying SDE has rotational drift, and X 0 is degenerate, then the ensuing marginals likely identify the SDE parameters. Similarly, a full rank rotationally symmetric X 0 may identify the underlying SDE from the rank degeneracy counterexample. Importantly, the true SDE is generally unknown, so it is difficult to assess whether identifiability holds despite X 0 being auto-rotationally invariant. For this reason, the strong guarantee of identifiability under non-auto-rotationally invariant X 0 is practical.</p><p>Second, our identifiability result is restricted to time homogeneous linear additive noise SDEs. Although this is a popular model for real-world processes, including for GRN inference [RCM + 24, Zha24], it would be beneficial to characterize identifiability conditions under more general models. We note that characterizing identifiability is particularly challenging for non-additive noise models, where the noise depends on the process X t , since the same marginal observations can be explained by a nonlinear additive noise SDE and a linear multiplicative noise SDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[CHS22]</ref>. For this reason, it may be easier to consider identifiability for parameteric families of nonlinear drift under the additive noise model. We note that we have already proven results about causal discovery for additive noise SDEs in Section 3.2 and that APPEX is also formulated for general additive noise SDEs. Although the MLE for nonlinear drift may not have a closed form solution, optimizers like BFGS [LZKS21, CZHS22, WGH + 24] and neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[SBB24a]</ref> have been successfully used for SDE parameter estimation on real and synthetic data.</p><p>Third, our theory considers the infinite data setting, given the process' true marginals {p i } N -1 i=0 , and we have not studied asymptotic convergence rates. In particular, our identifiability result was established given continuously observed marginals, which corresponds to obtaining infinite samples from infinite marginals. Similarly, the theory surrounding the optimality of APPEX assumes that we have infinite samples from a finite set of marginals. We leave the asymptotic analysis of APPEX for future work. Directions for future work include the sample complexity of entropic optimal transport for trajectory inference, which requires asymptotically more samples per marginal as we decrease the entropic regularization (decreasing time granularity in the SDE setting) [GCB + 19][Thm. 3], and the fact that the MLE of the AR(1) process from multiple trajectories is slightly biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[Led09]</ref>. We note that APPEX could be combined with previous methods that relax the marginal constraints (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[LZKS21]</ref>). This could improve estimates in low data settings, particularly in the biological setting where taking measurements destroys samples.</p><p>Fourth, even in the asymptotic setting, the nonconvex nature of APPEX's alternating projection optimization problem makes the prospect of proving convergence difficult. Although our experiments indicate that APPEX's estimates approach the true solution, regardless of the initial guesses for the drift A and observational diffusion H, we have not yet proved convergence due to the non-convexity of the optimization space. A formal proof of convergence and consistency would further strengthen APPEX's theoretical foundation.</p><p>Finally, we note that the trajectory inference step of APPEX, which we solve using Sinkhorn's algorithm, is computationally intensive. When solving the standard EOT problem (22), the asymptotic computation of each iteration of Sinkhorn's algorithm is O( N 2 ϵ 3 ), where N is the number of samples, and ϵ is the scalar entropy regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[ANWR17]</ref>. The number of iterations required is further related to the average error, which decays like O( 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">√ N ϵ d ) [GCB + 19].</formula><p>Similar asymptotics hold for the AEOT problem (23). We note that accurate trajectory inference relies on a large number of samples (N ), a small entropic regularization ϵ 2 ∼ δt, and potentially high-dimensional data. Our method is therefore impractical on very large datasets, which are prevalent in biological applications. It would therefore be advantageous to solve the associated Schrodinger bridge problem using more efficient methods. We note that recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[Hua24]</ref> makes use of closed form solutions to the SB problem when X 0 is a degenerate Dirac distribution, to increase computational efficiency. We also note that the SB problem can be expressed via forwards and backwards drifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[VTLL21]</ref>, and can therefore be solved via generative diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[DBTHD21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">SDBCD24]</ref>. Thus, when a closed form solution is not known, generative diffusion models may be more efficient solvers for the trajectory inference problem. Concurrent work estimates drift and diffusion using other methods, including JKO energy minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[TLD24]</ref> and reproducing Hilbert kernel spaces to minimize distance to the Fokker-Planck solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[BMBR24]</ref>. We have not yet compared the accuracy and computational efficiency of these methods against APPEX, and a systematic comparative analysis would be an interesting direction for future research.</p></div>

Additionally, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[BM24]</ref>, self-loops j → j are excluded to have a simple SCM, but we do not follow this convention in this paper. Under this more general framework, we see that latent confounders can affect endogenous variables via the integrand or integrator, which can be decoupled as drift and diffusion. For instance, any SDE driven by Brownian motion</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">dX t = b(t, X t ) dt + σ(t, X t )dW t ,<label>(46)</label></formula><p>can be rewritten in the form (44) by setting a(t, X t ) = b(t, X t ) σ(t, X t ) and h(t, X t ) = t W t T .

Indeed, given only H = GG ⊤ , multiple causal interpretations may be possible, because structurally different matrices G, G can obey H = GG ⊤ = G G⊤ .</p><p>Example 7.12 (Non-identifiability of higher order multidirected edges). Consider two matrices G 1 , G 2 , which share the same observational diffusion H:</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">G 1 =   0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0   , G 2 =   4 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 4 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 4 3   , H = G 1 G T 1 = G 2 G T 2 =   2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2  </formula><p>Given G 1 as the additive noise of an SDE, each pair of variables shares a noise source, since each row shares a nonzero column entry with another row. However, there is no common noise source that is shared among all 3 variables, since each column contains a 0. Hence, the causal interpretation under G 1 consists in three bidirected edges 1 ↔ 2, 1 ↔ 3, 2 ↔ 3. In contrast, the causal interpretation under G 2 consists in a single multidirected edge (1, 2, 3), since all components share noise sources.</p><p>Since G 1 and G 2 admit different causal graphs, despite having the same observational diffusion H, this shows that H provides information about the existence of unobserved confounders between pairs of variables, but cannot provide further causal structure about the confounder with respect to the other endogenous variables [d] \ {i, j}.</p><p>We note that if the noise is not additive, then this further complicates the causal interpretation. In this case, the driving noise σ(X t ) may be a function of the endogenous variables, i.e. β(j) ∩ V ̸ = ∅. Thus, unlike the additive noise setting in Theorem 3.5, simple edges i → j may be informed by the driving noise, via β(j), rather than just the drift, via α(j). However, since only σ(X t )σ(X t ) T is observable rather than σ(X t ) itself, observational data under such a model would lend itself to multiple interpretations of the causal graph. The idea is similar to Example 7.12, where we saw one interpretation feature three bidirected edges and another feature a multi-edge, but under non-additive noise, the ambiguity extends to simple edges i → j. This is illustrated in Example 5.5 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[HS14]</ref>.</p><p>The causal framework also highlights the impracticality of common model assumptions within the scRNAseq literature, namely isotropic diffusion H = GG ⊤ = σ 2 I d and irrotational drift b(X t ) = ∇ψ. We have seen in Lemma 3.5 that latent confounders from shared noise can only be modeled with anisotropic diffusion. Moreover, while we expect GRNs to contain feedback loops, i.e. cycles in G, imposing irrotational drift prevents most cycles from being considered. Lemma 7.13 shows that imposing irrotationality on a linear model is equivalent to imposing a symmetric drift, which determines a symmetric causal graph. However, as illustrated in [WWT + 18][Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>], symmetric GRNs cannot capture important relationships, such as negative feedback loops or repressilator dynamics. Indeed, consider the 2-cycle i ↔ j. By Lemma 3.5, i → j if A j,i ̸ = 0 and j → i if A i,j ̸ = 0. However, if the model is irrotational, then by Proposition 7.13, A i,j = A j,i , which can only model a positive feedback loop. Lemma 7.13. Let X t evolve according to a linear additive noise SDE (3). Then, the drift AX t is irrotational if and only if A is symmetric, i.e. A = A ⊤ .</p><p>Proof. First, we note that for any symmetric matrix A, the vector field Ax can be expressed as the gradient of the scalar potential given by the quadratic form ϕ</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">(x) = x ⊤ Ax/2 [PP + 08][(96)-(97)].

In the standard ϵ-regularized OT problem (22), the cost is the squared Euclidean distance, and K ∼ N (x, ϵ 2 I d ) is an isotropic Gaussian kernel. As noted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[LZKS21]</ref>, this implies that entropy regularized OT can be leveraged for trajectory inference from observed marginals, given a reference SDE. For example, to find the discretized law on paths π * ∈ Π(µ, ν) satisfying P (X t = µ, X t+∆t = ν), which minimizes relative entropy to the law of a pure diffusion process dX t = σdW t , one should set the entropic regularization ϵ 2 = σ 2 ∆t. This would correspond to minimizing the KL divergence to K(x, y) = e -∥y-x∥ 2 2σ 2 ∆t ∼ N (x, σ 2 ∆t), which is the transition kernel of the reference SDE. Similarly, as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[Zha24]</ref>, one can perform trajectory inference given an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck reference SDE dX t = -AX t dt+σdW t by approximating the transition distribution X t+∆t|t via K(x, y) = e -∥y-e A∆t x∥ 2 2σ 2 ∆t .

Let Σ ≻ 0 and A ∈ R d×d be such that</p><p>Then, B = Σ 1/2 A Σ -1/2 is skew-symmetric, and for all t ∈ R,</p><p>In other words, the Σ-generalized rotation e At produces a classical rotation e Bt after the change of variables y = Σ 1/2 x, which can be interpreted as a shearing and scaling transformation of R d .</p><p>Proof. Since Σ ≻ 0, the unique symmetric positive definite square root Σ 1/2 exists and is invertible.

Rearranging yields e At = Σ -1/2 e Bt Σ 1/2 as desired.</p><p>To explicitly see that the change of variable y = Σ 1/2 x amounts to a shearing and scaling, note that any positive definite matrix admits an LDL T factorization:</p><p>where L is unit lower-triangular (so its off-diagonal entries describe a shear transformation) and D is a diagonal matrix with positive entries (representing scaling along the coordinate axes). Thus, the transformation x → y = Σ 1/2 x decomposes into a shear (via L) and a scaling (via D 1/2 ). Lemma 7.5. Let X be a r.v. with covariance Σ and suppose that e At X ∼ X.

We expand</p><p>Hence, a sufficient condition for the claim is that X is in the nullspace of A with probability 1.

Then X 0 is not auto-rotationally invariant if and only if the support of p 0 spans R d .</p><p>Proof. Lemma 7.7 provides the only if direction. Now, let span(X 0 ) = R d a.s. Since e At represents a continuous transformation, and X 0 is supported on a discrete set of points, which cannot all be mapped to 0 by A, it follows that the support would shift for each t &gt; 0.
