<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Algorithmic fairness has aroused considerable interests in data mining and machine learning communities recently. So far the existing research has been mostly focusing on the development of quantitative metrics to measure algorithm disparities across different protected groups, and approaches for adjusting the algorithm output to reduce such disparities. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of identification of the source of model disparities. Unlike existing interpretation methods which typically learn feature importance, we consider the causal relationships among feature variables and propose a novel framework to decompose the disparity into the sum of contributions from fairness-aware causal paths, which are paths linking the sensitive attribute and the final predictions, on the graph. We also consider the scenario when the directions on certain edges within those paths cannot be determined. Our framework is also model agnostic and applicable to a variety of quantitative disparity measures. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data sets are provided to show that our method can provide precise and comprehensive explanations to the model disparities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in a variety of real-world applications including high-stakes scenarios such as loan approvals, criminal justice, healthcare, etc. In these real-world applications, fairness is getting increasing attentions as machine learning algorithms may lead to discrimination against certain disadvantaged sub-populations. This triggers the research on algorithmic fairness, which focus on whether members of specific unprivileged groups are more likely to receive unfavorable decisions made from machine learning algorithms.</p><p>One important line of research in the computational fairness community is to develop metrics for measuring group fairness, such as demographic parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, equalized opportunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, accuracy parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, etc., so that the discrepancy among the decisions made in different groups (a.k.a. disparity) are precisely quantified, which can further inspire the development of fair machine learning models that aim to minimize such disparities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the great efforts on fairness quantification and fair model development, one critical issue that has not been studied extensively is the diagnostics of model fairness, i.e., what are the reasons that lead to the model disparity? This information is crucial for understanding the intrinsic model mechanism and provides insights on how to improve model fairness. As an example, under the current pandemic, researchers have found that the racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. African Americans and Hispanics or Latinos are found to be more likely to have positive tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and deaths <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, compared with non-Hispanic Whites. In this case, it is crucial to figure out whether such disparity is coming from genetic factors or accessibility to adequate healthcare services, which will imply completely different clinical management plans and public health policies for battling with the pandemic.</p><p>In view of this need, recently researchers have leveraged Shapley value based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to attribute the model disparity as the sum of individual contributions from input features <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, so that we can understand which feature contributes more or less to the model disparity. However, in real-world problems, the mechanism that causes model disparity could be much more complex. Considering the COVID-19 example above, it turns out that one main factor contributing to such disparity is disproportionate access to care for patients with different races and ethnicity, which can be impacted by both economic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In practice, they correspond to two different causal paths leading to outcome disparity and imply different public health intervention policies.</p><p>In this paper, we propose FACTS (which stands for Fairness-Aware Causal paTh decompoSition), a novel framework for algorithm fairness explanation. FACTS decomposes the model disparity as the sum over the contributions of a set of Fairness-Aware Causal paThs (FACT) linking the sensitive attributes with the outcome variable. In this way, our approach can quantify the different causality mechanisms that can lead to the overall model disparity. Specifically, FACTS includes two steps:</p><p>• Step 1. FACTs identification, where we propose a method to identify all active paths that link the sensitive attributes and final outcome without colliders given a causal graph constructed on feature variables (which are referred to as FACTs). The graph could be given according to domain knowledge or arXiv:2108.05335v1 [cs.LG] 11 Aug 2021 learned from the training data. One important consideration here is that frequently the causal directions for certain edges on the graph cannot be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, which makes the graph a Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (PDAG). Our proposed algorithm can effectively identify active paths on PDAGs. • Step 2. Disparity attribution through Shapley value decomposition, where we propose a Shapley value <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> based method to attribute the quantified model disparity value (e.g., according to demographic parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) to identified FACTs, so that the contribution of each FACT can be quantified.</p><p>In addition, with the derived attributed disparity on FACTs, we further develop a fair learning approach by selectively removing the FACTs based on their effects on disparity and accuracy through data transformation. Our framework is model agnostic and can be applied to a broad set of popular group-fairness criteria including demographic parity, equalized opportunity, equalized odds, and accuracy parity.</p><p>With experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that FACTS can accurately quantify individual path contributions to the model disparity. With qualitative analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how our approach can appropriately explain the sources of disparity and successfully make fair adjustments 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PRELIMINARIES AND RELATED WORKS 2.1 Notations</head><p>In this paper, we use capitalized/lower-case letters in italics to represent a variable/value of the variable. We use capitalized/lower-case letters in boldface to represent a variable set/values of the variable set. We use {. . . } to represent a set without ordering relationship and use [. . . ] to represent a sequence. 𝜋 is a function indicating the rank of specific elements in an ordered sequence. For example, for an order pair of features [𝑋 1 , 𝑋 2 ], we will have 𝜋 (1) &lt; 𝜋 (2).</p><p>Suppose we are given a dataset including samples characterized by a set of variables {𝐴, X, 𝑌 }, where X = {𝑋 1 , ..., 𝑋 𝑀 } is the set of input feature variables. 𝐴 ∈ {0, 1} is the sensitive attribute and 𝑌 ∈ {0, 1} is the outcome. We set 𝑌 = 1 as the favored outcome. 𝑓 is a trained model and Ŷ is the predicted outcome.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x = (𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , • • • , 𝑥 𝑀 ) ⊤ is a concrete data vector with 𝑋 1 = 𝑥 1 , 𝑋 2 = 𝑥 2 , • • • , 𝑋 𝑀 = 𝑥 𝑀 .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Causal Model</head><p>We introduce causal model-related concepts that will be used throughout the paper in this subsection. Our descriptions are based on the definitions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Nodes and Edges. A graph G consists of a set of nodes (variables) {𝐴, 𝑌 , Ŷ , 𝑋 1 , . . . , 𝑋 𝑀 } and a set of edges (variable relations). The edges can be either directed (→) and undirected (-). We call two nodes are adjacent to each other if there is an edge linking them. The collection of nodes adjacent to 𝑋 𝑖 is denoted as Adj(𝑋 𝑖 ). Paths. A path 𝑝 from 𝑋 𝑖 to 𝑋 𝑗 in G is a sequence of nodes where every successive nodes are adjacent in G. A path from 𝑋 𝑖 to 𝑋 𝑗 in 1 We upload our source code on <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/weishenpan15/FACTS">https://github.com/weishenpan15/FACTS</ref>. In the example shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, there are paths (e.g., 𝐴 → 𝑋 3 ← 𝑋 4 ) linking 𝐴 and 𝑋 4 , but 𝐴 and 𝑋 4 are independent due to fact that they are linked by a collider 𝑋 3 . To characterize the variable relationships, we introduce the following definitions. If a path 𝑝 contains 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑘 ← 𝑋 𝑗 as a subpath, then 𝑋 𝑘 is a collider on 𝑝. For a given set of nodes C (referred to as the conditioning set), a node 𝑋 𝑖 is active relative to C on a path 𝑝 if either: 1) 𝑋 𝑖 is a not a collider on 𝑝 and not in C; 2) 𝑋 𝑖 is a collider, and 𝑋 𝑖 or any of its descendants is in C. A path is active relative to C only when every node on the path is active relative to C. When C = ∅, the definition of an active path is degenerated to that there is no collider on the path. When we say 𝑝 is an active path, we means 𝑝 is an active path relative to ∅ in this paper.</p><p>As in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, considering the path 𝐴 → 𝑋 3 → Ŷ when C = ∅, 𝑋 3 is an active node since 𝑋 3 is not a collider. Thus 𝐴 → 𝑋 3 → Ŷ is an active path. Similarly, 𝐴 → 𝑋 3 ← 𝑋 4 is not an active path because 𝑋 3 is a collider. But 𝐴 → 𝑋 3 ← 𝑋 4 is an active path relative to {𝑋 3 } since 𝑋 3 is a collider in the conditioning set {𝑋 3 } . Faithfulness. The distribution of the variables and G are faithful to each other means for all 𝑋 𝑖 , 𝑋 𝑗 , C, 𝑋 𝑖 is conditional independent with 𝑋 𝑗 on C if and only if there exists no active path from 𝑋 𝑖 to 𝑋 𝑗 with relative to C. Faithfulness is an important and common assumption in the research field of causality, which will be also used in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Fairness and Disparity</head><p>We list some popular algorithmic fairness definitions as follows: Demographic Parity (DP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A prediction Ŷ satisfies demographic parity if 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝐴 = 1) = 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝐴 = 0).</p><p>Equalized Odds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A prediction Ŷ satisfies equalized opportunity if 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝑌 = 𝑦, 𝐴 = 1) = 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝑌 = 𝑦, 𝐴 = 0), ∀𝑦 ∈ {0, 1}. Equalized Opportunity (EO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A prediction Ŷ satisfies equalized opportunity if 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝑌 = 1, 𝐴 = 1) = 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝑌 = 1, 𝐴 = 0). Accuracy Parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> A prediction Ŷ satisfies accuracy parity if</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑃 ( Ŷ = 𝑌 |𝐴 = 1) = 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 𝑌 |𝐴 = 0).</formula><p>In practice, we can take the difference between the two sides of the equalities in the above definitions as a quantification measure for disparity. For example,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Δ 𝐷𝑃 = 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝐴 = 1) -𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝐴 = 0) (1) Δ 𝐸𝑂 = 𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝑌 = 1, 𝐴 = 1) -𝑃 ( Ŷ = 1|𝑌 = 1, 𝐴 = 0) (2)</formula><p>are two popular algorithm disparity measures used in fairness learning algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Here we follow the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to use signed difference across groups to show which group is privileged. These fairness definitions are based on the (conditional) independence of the Ŷ and the 𝐴, which can be determined using the causal graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For example, according to the definitions in Section 2.2, Ŷ is independent to 𝐴 if there is no active path between them, which can obtain demographic parity. In other words, any non-zero Δ 𝐷𝑃 comes from the active paths linking 𝐴 and Ŷ . In the example in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, active paths between 𝐴 and Ŷ contain 𝐴 ← 𝑋 1 → Ŷ , 𝐴 → 𝑋 2 → Ŷ and 𝐴 → 𝑋 3 → Ŷ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Shapley Values</head><p>Shapley values is a popular concept that has been used in model interpretation in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. These methods typically decompose the prediction 𝑓 (x) for a given x as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑓 (x) = 𝜙 𝑓 (0) + ∑︁ 𝑀 𝑖=1 𝜙 𝑓 (x) (𝑖)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 𝜙 𝑓 (x) (𝑖) is the contribution of feature 𝑋 𝑖 to 𝑓 (x). 𝜙 𝑓 (0) = E𝑓 (X) is the averaged prediction with the expectation over the observed data distribution 𝑃 (X). 𝜙 𝑓 (x) (𝑖) is referred as the Shapley value of feature 𝑋 𝑖 for 𝑓 (x).</p><p>In order to calculate 𝜙 𝑓 (x) (𝑖), we firstly assume a sequential order 𝜋 for all variables in X, such that 𝜋 (𝑖) corresponds to the rank of 𝑋 𝑖 . The Shapley value of 𝑋 𝑖 for 𝑓 (x) with respect to 𝜋 is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝜙 𝜋 𝑓 (x) (𝑖) = 𝑣 𝑓 (x) ({𝑋 𝑗 : 𝜋 ( 𝑗) ≤ 𝜋 (𝑖)}) -𝑣 𝑓 (x) ({𝑋 𝑗 : 𝜋 ( 𝑗) &lt; 𝜋 (𝑖)})<label>(4</label></formula><p>) where 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) represents the model's output on a selected coalition of features X S with a feature subset S ⊂ {𝑋 1 , ..., 𝑋 𝑀 }. 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) must satisfy that 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) = 𝑓 (x) when S = X and 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) = 𝜙 𝑓 (0) when S = ∅. With Π denoting the set of all permutations of features and 𝑤 denoting a permutation weight satisfying 𝑤 (𝜋) &gt; 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝜋 ∈Π 𝑤 (𝜋) = 1, we can calculate 𝜙 𝑓 (x) (𝑖) as 𝜙 𝑓 (𝑥) (𝑖) = ∑︁ 𝜋 ∈Π 𝑤 (𝜋)𝜙 𝜋 𝑓 (x) (𝑖)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Different versions of Shapley values can be calculated based on different choices of 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) and 𝑤. An obvious choice would be to take a uniform distribution 𝑤 (𝜋) = 1 𝑀! and calculate 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) as the expectation over the observed distribution of unselected features: <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Aas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> considered the correlation among x and propose the calculation of 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) = E X ′ S [𝑓 (x S , x ′ S)]</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">as 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (S) = E X ′ S |X S [𝑓 (x S , x ′ S)</formula><p>]. The resulting Shapley-values are referred to as on-manifold Shapley-values. Frye et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> further considered different choices of 𝑤. For example, one reasonable approach is to put weights only on those permutations which are consistent with known causal orderings: </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝑤 (𝜋) ∝          1 if 𝜋 (𝑖) &lt; 𝜋 ( 𝑗)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Fairness Explanation</head><p>There have been a few studies trying to derive explanations for model fairness, which can be categorized as either feature-based or path-specific explanation.</p><p>2.5.1 Feature-based Explanation. Lundberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Begley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> leveraged Shapley values defined in Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) to attribute the feature contributions to Δ 𝐷𝑃 in Eq.( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). Specifically, they proposed to use the group difference of 𝜙 𝑓 (𝑥) (𝑖) to quantify the contribution of 𝑋 𝑖 to Δ 𝐷𝑃 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Φ 𝑓 (𝑖) = E X|𝐴=1 [𝜙 𝑓 (x) (𝑖)] -E X |𝐴=0 [𝜙 𝑓 (x) (𝑖)]<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Begley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> has also extended this formulation to disparity measured on equalized opportunity as in Eq.( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). However, decomposing model disparity into feature contributions ignores the causal structure of the features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2">Path-Specific Explanations.</head><p>There have been existing research studying fairness and the causal effects on the outcome by flipping the sensitive attribute value. They also studied the causal effects from particular paths, which are called path-specific effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Intuitively, the path-specific effect can be viewed as quantification of path-specific contribution to model disparity. Existing research has only focused on causal paths (paths in which all edges are directed outwards 𝐴) so far, this may miss other sources of disparity. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, 𝐴 ← 𝑋 1 → Ŷ is an active path linking 𝐴 and Ŷ and thus may contribute to model disparity, but it is not a causal path. Therefore, the sum of the path-specific effects considering only causal paths will not amount to the entire model disparity (e.g., measured by Eq.( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)), which leads to incomplete explanations.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic fairness explanation method called Fairness-Aware Causal paTh decompoSition (FACTS), which is introduced in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY</head><p>In this section, we will introduce our framework with Δ 𝐷𝑃 as the model disparity metric. We provide generalizations of our framework to other model disparity metrics in the appendix.</p><p>Our framework is based on a causal graph G, which could be obtained based on domain knowledge or learned from the training data with existing causal discovery algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. According to Section 2.3, active paths from 𝐴 to Ŷ are sources of Δ 𝐷𝑃 . If there is no active path between 𝐴 and Ŷ , Δ 𝐷𝑃 = 0. If G is a DAG, we can identify all active paths based on the definition above and analyze their contributions to disparity. However, in reality G could be a PDAG, where the causal directions on some edges cannot be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. This makes the problem more challenging.</p><p>In this section, we first propose a corresponding concept potential active path to represent the correlation relations between 𝐴 and Ŷ under a PDAG, and each potential active path between 𝐴 and Ŷ is referred to as a fairness associated causal path (FACT) in this paper. Then we propose an algorithm to extract all potential active paths from 𝐴 to Ŷ . Finally, we decompose Δ 𝐷𝑃 as the sum of the contributions of these paths following the Shapley values strategy.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A X 2 X 1 G 1 G 2 G 3 Ŷ A X 2 X 1 Ŷ A X 2 X 1 Ŷ X 3 X 3 X 3</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Potential Active Paths from 𝐴 to Ŷ</head><p>Potential active paths on a PDAG are defined as follows: Potential Active Paths. A path 𝑝 in G is a potential active path if one of following properties is satisfied:</p><p>(1) All edges on 𝑝 are directed and 𝑝 satisfies the definition of active path in Section 2.2. (2) 𝑝 contains undirected edges. If we add arbitrary directions to all undirected edges (adjacent node pairs) on 𝑝, the resulting path is active. (3) 𝑝 contains undirected edges. Considering all possible directions of undirected edges in G, there exists at least one situation to obtain a DAG G ′ which satisfies: 1) corresponding path obtained from 𝑝 in G ′ is active; 2) the conditional independence relationships among variables encoded in G ′ are consistent with those inferred from observational data. We illustrate the above definition with examples in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. For path 𝐴 → 𝑋 1 → 𝑋 2 → Ŷ in G 1 , since it is an active path by definition, it is a potential active path as well. As for 𝐴 -</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">𝑋 1 → 𝑋 2 → Ŷ in G 2 , since no matter what direction of 𝐴 -𝑋 1 is, the resulting path 𝐴 → 𝑋 1 → 𝑋 2 → Ŷ or 𝐴 ← 𝑋 1 → 𝑋 2 → Ŷ is active. Thus 𝐴 -𝑋 1 → 𝑋 2 → Ŷ in G 2 is a potential active path. For 𝐴 → 𝑋 1 -𝑋 2 → Ŷ in G 3 , suppose the conditional independence relation obtained from data is 𝐴 ̸⊥ ⊥ 𝑋 1 |𝑋 2 , 𝐴 ̸⊥ ⊥ 𝑋 2 |𝑋 1 , 𝑋 1 ̸⊥ ⊥ 𝑋 2 |𝐴.</formula><p>Consider the directions of all undirected edges to be 𝑋 1 → 𝑋 2 , the corresponding path 𝐴 → 𝑋 1 → 𝑋 2 → Ŷ in G 3 under this case is active and the relationships among variables is consistent with the conditional independence relation observed from the data. So</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝐴 → 𝑋 1 -𝑋 2 → Ŷ is a potential active path.</formula><p>When G is DAG, the potential active path is equivalent to the active path. The potential active paths satisfy the following property: Proposition 3.1. If there is no potential active path between two variables on G, then the two variables are independent.</p><p>This proposition shows the importance of potential active paths between 𝐴 and Ŷ when we consider Δ 𝐷𝑃 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we propose to a novel framework to explain algorithmic fairness with the causal graph. In particular, we decompose the disparity into contributions from fairness-aware causal paths that link the sensitive attribute and model outcome on a causal graph. We propose an algorithm to identify those paths and calculate their contributions to the disparity. With the path explanations, we can gain more insight into the inequality of a machine learning algorithm and propose an interpretable method to achieve better trade-offs between utility and fairness.  To prove Proposition 3.2 and 3.3, we first prove the following lemma: Lemma A.1. In a DAG, if 𝑝 is an active path, then every subpath of 𝑝 is an active path.</p><p>Proof. Suppose 𝑝 ′ is a subpath of 𝑝. For each 𝑋 that is a node on 𝑝 ′ , then 𝑋 is also on 𝑝. Since 𝑝 is an active path, then 𝑋 is a non-collider. According to the generality of 𝑋 , each node on 𝑝 ′ is a non-collider. So 𝑝 ′ is also an active path. □</p><p>Then we will prove Proposition 3.2 with Lemma A.1:</p><p>Proof. (Proposition 3.2) Suppose 𝑝 is a potential active path and 𝑝 ′ is any subpath of 𝑝. We consider the three conditions in the definition of potential active path. If all edges on 𝑝 are directed and 𝑝 satisfies the definition of active path. Then all edges on 𝑝 ′ are also directed and 𝑝 ′ is active according to Lemma A.1, and thus a potential active path. Similarly, for the rest two cases, if 𝑝 satisfies the condition, we can get 𝑝 ′ also satisfies the same condition by Lemma A.1. So we can have 𝑝 ′ is a potential active path. □</p><p>Proof. (Proposition 3.3) Since G is a DAG, a potential active path is equivalent to an active path according to the definition. Assume ∃𝑋 𝑖 , 𝑋 𝑗 ∈ X (P) , 𝑋 𝑖 ∈ Adj(𝑋 𝑗 ), but neither of them is prior to the other with respect to 𝐴. According to the definition, at least one of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p>• There is no active path from 𝐴 to Ŷ through both 𝑋 𝑖 and 𝑋 𝑗 . Without loss of generality, we let 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑗 . Since 𝑋 𝑖 ∈ X (P), there exists an active path from 𝐴 to Ŷ through 𝑋 𝑖 .</p><p>We consider its subpath which connects 𝐴 and 𝑋 𝑖 and call it 𝑝. 𝑝 is an active path according to Lemma A.1. Considering a new path obtained by appending "𝑋 𝑗 → Ŷ " to 𝑝, it will be obviously an active path since 𝑋 𝑗 and Ŷ must be noncolliders. This new path is an active path from 𝐴 to Ŷ and both 𝑋 𝑖 and 𝑋 𝑗 are on it. So the beginning condition does not hold. • There exist at least two active paths from 𝐴 to Ŷ , one is as</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">"𝐴 → • • • → 𝑖 . . . 𝑋 𝑗 • • • → Ŷ " and the other is as "𝐴 → • • • → 𝑋 𝑗 . . . 𝑋 𝑖 • • • → Ŷ ".</formula><p>The paths are pointed out from 𝐴 because 𝐴 is a source node in G. Without loss of generality, we let 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑗 . We denote the latter path as 𝑝. And we denote the subpath of 𝑝 from 𝑋 𝑗 to 𝑋 𝑖 as 𝑝 ′ . 𝑝 ′ must be an active path according to Lemma A.1. There are three possibilities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">𝑋 𝑗 → • • • → 𝑋 𝑖 , if it is satisfied, 𝑝 ′ and the edge 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑗 will form a directed cycle, which violates that G is a DAG; 𝑋 𝑗 ← • • • ← 𝑋 𝑖 or 𝑋 𝑗 ← • • • ← 𝑋 𝑘 → • • • → 𝑋 𝑖 ,</formula><p>in both cases, 𝑋 𝑗 will be a collider on 𝑝 and 𝑝 is not active. Since all the situation can not be satisfied, the beginning condition dose not hold.</p><p>In conclusion, neither of the conditions above can be satisfied. So the original assumption can not be satisfied, and X (P) is completely ordered with respect to 𝐴 on G. □</p></div>

With Eq.( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_18">8</ref>), we can prove the Linearity. Nullity: We denote the set of potential active paths from 𝐴 to Ŷ relative to 𝑌 as P 𝑌 . We use an example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(a) to further illustrate the definition. We can get:  If the two following conditions satisfy, then we call 𝑋 𝑖 is an informative successor of 𝑋 𝑗 with respect to 𝐴 relative to 𝑌 : 1) 𝑋 𝑗 ≻ 𝐴 |𝑌 𝑋 𝑖 ; 2) 𝑋 𝑗 is adjacent to 𝑋 𝑖 or 𝑋 𝑖 , 𝑋 𝑗 are spouses with child 𝑌 . And 𝑋 𝑗 is called an informative predecessor of 𝑋 𝑖 with respect to 𝐴 relative to 𝑌 . The set of all informative successors of 𝑋 𝑗 is denoted as Is 𝐴 |𝑌 (𝑋 𝑖 ). The set of all informative predecessors of 𝑋 𝑗 is denoted as Ip 𝐴 |𝑌 (𝑋 𝑖 ). For Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>(a), we have Ip 𝐴 |𝑌 (𝑋 1 ) = {𝐴}, Ip 𝐴 |𝑌 (𝑋 2 ) = {𝐴, 𝑋 1 }. We will write Ip 𝐴 |𝑌 (𝑋 𝑖 ) as Ip 𝑖 and Is 𝐴 |𝑌 (𝑋 𝑖 ) as Is 𝑖 for simplicity in the following.</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">If 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (T ∪ {𝑝 𝑖 }) = 𝑣 𝑓 (x) (T),</formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">P 𝑌 = {𝐴 → 𝑋 1 → Ŷ, 𝐴 → 𝑋 1 → 𝑌 ← 𝑋 2 → Ŷ }.

And we need to infer 𝑋 𝑖 as 𝑋 𝑖 = 𝑔 𝑋 𝑖 |𝑌 (Ip 𝑖 , X(P 𝑌 )). Thus we have 𝜙 𝑓 (x),𝑦 (𝑝 𝑖 ) obtain by replacing the function 𝑔 𝑋 𝑖 with 𝑔 𝑋 𝑖 |𝑌 in the calculation of 𝜙 𝑓 (x),𝑦 (𝑝 𝑖 ).</p><p>For equalized opportunity, we compute the path contribution to Δ 𝑂𝑃 as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_42">Φ 𝑓 (𝑝 𝑖 ) = E X |𝑌 =1,</formula><p>For equalized odds, we need to consider the disparity conditioned on 𝑌 = 1 and 𝑌 = 0 respectively.
