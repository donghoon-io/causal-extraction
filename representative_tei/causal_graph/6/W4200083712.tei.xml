<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Graph-based causal models are a flexible tool for causal inference from observational data. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework to define, identify, and estimate a broad class of causal quantities in linearly parametrized graph-based models. The proposed method extends the literature, which mainly focuses on causal effects on the mean level and the variance of an outcome variable. For example, we show how to compute the probability that an outcome variable realizes within a target range of values given an intervention, a causal quantity we refer to as the probability of treatment success. We link graphbased causal quantities defined via the do-operator to parameters of the model implied distribution of the observed variables using so-called causal effect functions. Based on these causal effect functions, we propose estimators for causal quantities and show that these estimators are consistent and converge at a rate of N -1/2 under standard assumptions. Thus, causal quantities can be estimated based on sample sizes that are typically available in the social and behavioral sciences. In case of maximum likelihood estimation, the estimators are asymptotically efficient. We illustrate the proposed method with an example based on empirical data, placing special emphasis on the difference between the interventional and conditional distribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graph-Based Models for Causal Inference</head><p>The graph-based approach to causal inference was primarily formalized by <ref type="bibr">Judea Pearl (1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines (2001)</ref>. A causal graph represents a researcher's theory about the causal structure of the data-generating mechanism. Based on a causal graph, causal inference can be conducted using the interventional distribution, from which standard causal quantities such as average treatment effects (ATEs) can be derived. In the most general formulation, a causal graph is accompanied by a set of nonparametric structural equations. Thus, a common acronym for Pearl's general nonparametric model is NPSEM, which stands for nonparametric structural equation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pearl, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shpitser, Richardson, &amp; Robins, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Graph-based causal models share many common characteristics with the traditional literature on structural equation models (SEM) prevalent in the social and behavioral sciences and economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bollen &amp; Pearl, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Heckman &amp; Pinto, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pearl, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pearl, , 2012))</ref>. However, these two approaches also differ in several aspects including the underlying assumptions (e.g., graphbased models assume modularity), notational conventions (e.g., the meaning of bidirected edges in graphical representations), research focus (e.g., nonparametric identification in graph-based models vs. parametric estimation in traditional SEM), and standard procedures.</p><p>Graph-based procedures often focus on a single causal quantity of interest (e.g., ATE) and establishing its causal identification based on a minimal set of assumptions (e.g., without making parametric assumptions). Causal quantities are well defined via the do-operator and the resulting interventional distribution and causal identification can be established based on graphical tools such as the back-door criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Pearl, 1995)</ref> or a set of algebraic rules called do-calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Shpitser &amp; Pearl, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tian &amp; Pearl, 2002a)</ref>. The central insights developed within the graph-based approach relate to causal identification, whereas less attention has been devoted to the estimation of causal quantities. 1  On the other hand, the traditional literature on SEM frequently assumes parametrized (often linear) models and usually focuses on identification and estimation of the entire model. 2 Causal quantities such as direct, indirect and total effects can be defined based on reduced-form equations and partial derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alwin &amp; Hauser, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bollen, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Stolzenberg, 1980)</ref>. A main focus within the traditional SEM literature lies on the model implied joint distribution of observed variables and its statistical modeling. A considerable body of literature is available on model identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bekker, Merckens, &amp; Wansbeek, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fisher, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wiley, 1973)</ref> and estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Browne, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jöreskog, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Satorra &amp; Bentler, 1994)</ref> for parametrized SEM.</p><p>In this paper, we combine causal quantities from graph-based models with identification and estimation results from the traditional literature on linear SEM. For this purpose, we formalize the do-operator using matrix algebra in the section on "Graph-Based Causal Models with Linear Equations." Based on this matrix representation, we derive a closed-form parametric expression of the interventional distribution and several causal quantities in the section entitled "Interventional Distribution." Linear graph-based models imply a parametrized joint distribution of the observed variables. We define causal effect functions as a mapping from the parameters of the joint distribution of observed variables onto the causal quantities defined via the do-operator in the section entitled "Causal Effect Functions." Methods for identifying parametrized causal quantities are discussed in the section entitled "Identification of Parametrized Causal Quantities". Estimators of causal quantities that are consistent and converge at a rate of N -1/2 are proposed in the section on "Estimation of Causal Quantities." We show that the proposed estimators are asymptotically efficient in case of maximum likelihood estimation.</p><p>Our work extends the literature on traditional SEM by providing closed-form expressions of graph-based causal quantities in terms of model parameters of linear SEM. Furthermore, we extend the literature on linear graph-based models by providing a unifying estimation framework for (multivariate) causal quantities that also allows estimation of causal quantities beyond the mean and the variance. We illustrate the method using simulated data based on an empirical application and provide a thorough discussion of the differences between conditional and interventional distributions in the illustration section.</p><p>Throughout this paper, we focus on situations in which direct causal effects are functionally independent of the values of variables in the system. In other words, direct causal effects are constant. In such situations, the data-generating mechanisms can be adequately represented by linear structural equations and the use of linear graph-based causal models is justified. A priori knowledge that suggests constant direct causal effects sometimes allows identifying causal quantities that would not be identified under the more flexible assumptions of the NPSEM (see illustration section for an example). However, scientific theories that suggest constant direct causal effects might be incorrect and consequently, linear models might be misspecified. We will discuss issues 1 Exceptions from this statement include, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ernest and Bühlmann (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bhattacharya, Nabi, and Shpitser (2020)</ref>. Furthermore, statistical procedures from related fields such as the potential outcome framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Robins, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Robins, , 1987;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Robins, Rotnitzky, &amp; Zhao, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">van der Laan &amp; Rubin, 2006)</ref> or econometrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chernozhukov, Fernández-Val, Newey, Stouli, &amp; Vella, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Matzkin, 2015)</ref> could be adjusted such that they can be used to estimate causal quantities in the NPSEM framework.</p><p>2 However, techniques for identification (e.g., rank and order conditions) and estimation (e.g., limited information estimators) of single structural equations have been developed (c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bollen, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bollen, Kolenikov, &amp; Bauldry, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bowden &amp; Turkington, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fisher, 1966)</ref>.</p><p>1.

Assumptions 4 and 5 justify the use of linear structural equations. Assumptions 6 justifies the use of multivariate normally distributed error terms. We further assume that variables are measured on a continuous scale and are observed without measurement error. Throughout this paper, we assume that the model is correctly specified. In the discussion section, we briefly point to the literature on statistical tests of model assumptions and methods for analyzing the sensitivity of causal conclusions with respect to violations of untestable assumptions. Furthermore, we briefly discuss possible ways to relax the model assumptions (e.g., measurement errors, unobserved heterogeneity, effect modification, excess kurtosis in the error terms).</p><p>A linear graph-based causal models over the set V = {V 1 , ..., V n } of observed variables are defined by the following set of equations <ref type="bibr">(Brito &amp; Pearl, 2006, p.</ref>2):<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V j = n i c ji V i + ε j , j = 1, ..., n<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We assume that all variables are deviations from their means and no intercepts are included in Eq.</p><p>(1). A nonzero structural coefficient (c ji = 0) expresses the assumption that V i has a direct causal influence on V j . Restricting a structural coefficient to zero (c ji = 0) indicates the assumption that V i has no direct causal effect on V j . The parameter c ji quantifies the magnitude of a direct effect. The q × 1 parameter vector θ F ∈ F ⊆ R q contains all distinct, functionally unrelated and unknown structural coefficients c ji . F denotes the parameter space, and it is a subspace of the q-dimensional Euclidean space. Restating Eqs. (1) in matrix notation yields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V = CV + ε ⇔ V = (I n -C) -1 ε (2)</formula><p>The n × n identity matrix is denoted as I n . The n × n matrix of structural coefficients is denoted as C, and we sometimes use the notation C(θ F ) to emphasize that C is a function of θ F . We restrict our attention to recursive systems for which the variables V can be ordered in such a way that the matrix C is strictly lower triangular (which ensures the existence of the inverse in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>); <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bollen, 1989)</ref>. The set of error terms is denoted by E = {ε 1 , ..., ε n }. Each error term ε i , i = 1, ..., n, comprises variables that determine the level of V i but are not explicitly included in the model. Typically the following assumptions (or a subset thereof) are made <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brito &amp; Pearl, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kang &amp; Tian, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koster, 1999</ref>):</p><p>(a) E(ε) = 0 n , where 0 n is an n × 1 vector that contains only zeros. (b) E(εε ) = , where the n × n matrix is finite, symmetric and positive definite.</p><p>(c) ε ∼ N n (0 n , ), where N n denotes the n-dimensional normal distribution.</p><p>A nonzero covariance ψ i j indicates the existence of an unobserved common cause of the variables V i and V j . The p×1 parameter vector θ P ∈ P ⊆ R p contains all distinct, functionally unrelated and unknown parameters from the error term distribution. P denotes the parameter space, and it is a subspace of the p-dimensional Euclidean space. We sometimes use the notation (θ P ) to emphasize that is a function of θ P . The resulting model implied joint distribution of the observed variables is denoted by {P(v, θ ) | θ ∈ }, where = F × P , and P is the family of n-dimensional multivariate normal distributions. The graph G is constructed by drawing a directed edge from V i pointing to V j if and only if the corresponding coefficient is not restricted to zero (i.e., c ji = 0). A bidirected edge between vertices V i and V j is drawn if and only if ψ i j = 0 (bidirected edges are often drawn using dashed lines). The absence of a bidirected edge between V i and V j reflects the assumption that there is no unobserved variable that has a direct causal effect on both V i and V j (no unobserved confounding). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> For recursive systems, the resulting graph belongs to the class of acyclical directed mixed graphs (ADMG), whereas mixed refers to the fact that graphs in this class contain directed edges as well as bidirected edges <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Richardson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Shpitser, 2018)</ref>. An example model with n = 6 variables and the corresponding causal graph is introduced in the illustration section.</p><p>At the heart of the graph-based approach to causal inference lies a hypothetical experiment in which the values of a subset of observed variables are controlled by an intervention. This exogenous intervention is formally denoted via the do-operator, namely do(x), where x denotes the interventional levels and X ⊆ V denotes the subset of variables that are controlled by the experimenter. The system of equation under the intervention do(x) is obtained from the original system by replacing the equation for each variable V i ∈ X (i.e., for each variable that is subject to the do(x)-intervention) with the equation V i = v i , where v i is a constant interventional level <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pearl, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Spirtes et al., 2001)</ref>. Note that the do(x)-intervention does not alter the equations for variables that are not subject to intervention, an assumption known as autonomy or modularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pearl, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Peters, Janzing, &amp; Schölkopf, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Spirtes et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The probability distribution of the variables V one would observe had the intervention do(x) been uniformly applied to the entire population is called the interventional distribution, and it is denoted as P(V | do(x)). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">8</ref> The interventional distribution differs formally and conceptually from the conditional distribution P(V | X = x). The former describes a situation where the datagenerating mechanism has been altered by an external do(x)-type intervention in an (hypothetical) experiment. The latter describes a situation where the data-generating mechanism of V has not been altered, but the evidence X = x about the values of a subset of variables X ⊆ V is available. These differences will be further discussed in the illustration section (see also, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gische, West, &amp; Voelkle, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pearl, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In the remainder of this section, we translate the changes in the data-generating mechanism induced by the do(x)-intervention into matrix notation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hauser and Bühlmann (2015)</ref> for a similar approach). The following definition introduces the required notation. , where the operator \ denotes the set complement. 3. Let ı i ∈ R n be the i-th unit vector, namely a (column) vector with entry 1 on the i-th component and zeros elsewhere. The n× K x matrix 1 I := (ı i ) i∈I contains all unit vectors with an interventional index. The n × (n -K x ) matrix 1 N is defined analogously, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">1 N := (ı i ) i∈N .</formula><p>The matrices 1 I and 1 N are called selection matrices. 4.

The i-th diagonal value is equal to one if i ∈ N and zero otherwise.</p><p>Note that all of the elements of the matrices 1 I , 1 N , and I N are either zero or unity. The variables V in a linear graph-based model under the intervention do(x) are determined by the following set of structural equations:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> </p><p>given do(x) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">V = I N CV + I N ε + 1 I x<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The corresponding interventional reduced form equation is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">V | do(x) = (I n -I N C) -1 (I N ε + 1 I x) = (I n -I N C) -1 I N =:T 1 n×n ε + (I n -I N C) -1 1 I =:a 1 n×K x x<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The matrix I N C is obtained from C by replacing its rows with interventional indexes by rows of zeros, and consequently (I n -I N C) is non-singular.

Note that these results do not require multivariate normality of the error terms. The interventional mean vector is functionally dependent on the vector of interventional levels x, whereas the interventional covariance matrix is functionally independent of x. The interventional distribution in linear graph-based models with multivariate normal error terms is given as:</p><p>Result 3. (interventional distribution for Gaussian linear graph-based models)</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V | do(x) ∼ N n-K x n ( a 1 x , T 1 T 1 ) (7a) V N | do(x) ∼ N n-K x ( a 2 x , T 2 T 2 ) (7b)</formula><p>Proof. Both results follow from the fact that linear transformations of multivariate normal vectors are also multivariate normal <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Rao, 1973)</ref>.

Singularity follows from the fact that the K x interventional variables are no longer random given the do(x)intervention, but are fixed to the constant interventional levels x. Therefore, the random vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">V | do(x) satisfies the restriction 1 I (V | do(x)) =</formula><p>x with a probability of one. Equation (7b) states that the vector of all non-interventional variables follows a (n -K x )-dimensional normal distribution.</p><p>Typically, one is interested in a subset Y ⊆ V N of outcome variables. The marginal interventional distribution P(y | do(x)) can be obtained as follows:</p><p>Result 4. (marginal interventional distribution for Gaussian linear graph-based models) Let the outcome variables Y be a subset of the non-interventional variables (i.e., Y ⊆ V N , |Y| = K y ). The index set of the outcome variables is denoted as I y . Then, the following result holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P(y | do(x)) ∼ N K y ( 1 I y a 1 x , 1 I y T 1 T 1 1 I y ) (8)</formula><p>The result follows from the fact that the family of multivariate normal distributions is closed with respect to marginalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Rao, 1973)</ref>. An important special case of Result 4 is the ATE of a single variable V i on another variable V j , which is obtained by the setting Y = {V j } and X = {V i } (and consequently</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">I x = {i}, I y = { j}, K y = K x = 1</formula><p>). The ATE of the intervention do(x) relative to the intervention do(x ) (where x and x are distinct treatment levels) on Y is defined as the mean difference E(y</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">| do(x)) -E(y | do(x ))</formula><p>. For a single outcome variable {V j }, the selection matrix 1 I y simplifies to the unit vector ı j and E(y | do(x)) -E(y | do(x )) can be expressed as ı j a 1 (xx ) (using the mean expression from the normal distribution in Eq. [8]).</p><p>The probability density function (pdf) of the interventional distribution of all noninterventional variables is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">f (v N | do(x)) = (2π) -n-Kx 2 |T 2 T 2 | -1 2 exp - 1 2 (v N -a 2 x) (T 2 T 2 ) -1 (v N -a 2 x)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Many features of the interventional distribution that hold substantive interest in applied research (e.g., probabilities of interventional events, quantiles of the interventional distribution) can be calculated from the pdf via integration. For example, a physician would like a patient's blood glucose level (outcome) to fall into a predefined range of values (e.g., to avoid hypo-or hyperglycemia) given an injection of insulin (intervention). More formally, let [y low , y up ] denote a predefined range of values of a set of outcome variables Y ⊆ V N . The interventional probability P(y low ≤ y ≤ y up | do(x)) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P(y low ≤ y ≤ y up | do(x)) = y up y low f (y | do(x))dy (10)</formula><p>The interventional distribution and its features will be used to formally define parametric causal quantities in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal Effect Functions</head><p>In this section, we formally define terms containing the do-operator as causal quantities denoted by γ . According to this definition, any feature of the interventional distribution that can be expressed using the do-operator is a causal quantity. Let the space of causal quantities be denoted as . As discussed in earlier in the section on "Graph-Based Causal Models with Linear Equations," linear causal models imply a joint distribution of observed variables that is parametrized by </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">: γ → R r , with γ = g(θ γ ), θ γ ∈ γ ⊆ R s , γ ∈ R r (11)</formula><p>is called a causal effect function. The image γ of a causal effect function is called a causal quantity which is parametrized by θ γ . If the value of a causal quantity depends on other variables (e.g., the interventional level x ∈ R K x , the values v N ∈ R n-K x of non-interventional variables), we include these variables as auxiliary arguments in the causal effect function separated by a semicolon (e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">g(θ γ ; x, v N )).</formula><p>This idea can be applied to the interventional mean from Eq.

( <ref type="formula">12a</ref>) is free of the do-operator and contains the parameter vector θ F (structural coefficients ) as a main argument and the interventional level x as an auxiliary argument. Thus, the causal effect function g 1 maps the parameter vector θ F onto the interventional mean.

A graph-based causal quantity is said to be identified if it can be expressed as a functional of joint, marginal, or conditional distributions of observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pearl, 2009)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Graph-based causal models combine a priori assumptions about the causal structure of the datagenerating mechanism (e.g., encoded in a ADMG) and observational data to make inference about the effects of (hypothetical) interventions. Causal quantities are defined via the do-operator and may comprise any feature of the interventional distribution (e.g., the mean vector, the covariance matrix, the pdf). This flexibility allows researchers to analyze effects of interventions beyond changes in the mean level. Causal effect functions map the parameters of the model implied joint distribution of observed variables onto causal quantities and therefore enable analyzing causal quantities using tools from the literature on traditional SEM. We propose an estimator for causal quantities and show that it is consistent and converges at a rate of N -1 2 . In case of maximum likelihood estimation, the proposed estimator is asymptotically efficient.</p><p>In the remainder of the paper, we discuss several situations in which linear graph-based models are misspecified and how the proposed procedure can be extended to be applicable in such situations.</p></div>

Most importantly, the combination of observational and interventional data allows differentiating causal models that cannot be distinguished solely based on observational data. Furthermore, the availability of experimental evidence enables (partly) testing further causal assumptions such as the assumption of modularity, which cannot be tested solely based on observational data. While modularity seems rather plausible if the mechanisms correspond to natural laws (e.g., chemical or biological processes, genetic laws, laws of physics), it needs additional reflection if the mechanisms describe human behavior. For example, humans might respond to an intervention by adjusting behavioral mechanisms different from the one that is intervened on. The proposed method can readily be adjusted to capture such violations of the modularity assumption if an intervention changes other mechanisms in a known way. However, if the ways in which humans adjust their behavior in response to an intervention are unknown, they need to be learned. Well-designed experiments may be particularly useful for this purpose.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, we focus on specific do-type interventions that assign fixed values to the interventional variables according to an exogenous rule. However, in practical applications interventional values are often chosen conditionally on the values of other observed variables.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6" xml:id="foot_4"><p>Throughout this article, we use the following conventions: Sets of random variables are denoted by calligraphic letters (e.g., V = {V 1 , ..., V n }). Single random variables from a set are denoted by corresponding upper-case Latin letters (e.g., V i ). The column vector containing all random variables in a set is denoted by the corresponding bold Latin letter (e.g., V = (V 1 , ..., V n ) ). Realizations of a random vector V are denoted by lower-case Latin letters (e.g., v).</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7" xml:id="foot_5"><p>Note that bidirected edges in a causal graph (see Fig.2in the illustration section) represent a nonzero covariance between error terms that is due to an unobserved common cause. This convention for causal graphs is different for path diagrams from the traditional SEM literature where bidirected edges simply indicate a correlation without being specific about its origin.</p></note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix</head><p>Proof of Lemma 2. Proof of rank(T 1 ) = n -K x : The matrix (I n -I N C) -1 is lower triangular with ones on the diagonal and thus has full rank n (Lütkepohl, 1997, result 9.14.1(4)(c), p. 165). By construction I N is a diagonal matrix where K x diagonal elements are equal to zero which implies rank(I N ) = n -K x <ref type="bibr">(Lütkepohl 1997, result 9.4</ref>(3)(a), p. 120). Thus, rank(T 1 ) = rank((I n -I N C) -1 I N ) = n -K x , where the last equality sign follows from result 4.3.1(9) in Lütkepohl <ref type="bibr">(1997)</ref>. Proof of rank(T 2 ) = n -K x : (I n -I N C) -1 is a lower triangular matrix of full rank n that has ones on the diagonal. Postmultiplying (I n -I N C) -1 with I N sets all columns with index i ∈ I to zero. Or more formally, [t 1 ] •i = 0 n×1 , i ∈ I, where [t 1 ] •i denotes the i-th column of the matrix T 1 . Similarly, [t 1 ] i• denotes the i-th row of the matrix T 1 . Thus, all diagonal elements t ii with i ∈ I are equal to zero. Premultiplying T 1 with 1 N deletes all rows [t 1 ] i• that have an index i ∈ I. The deleted rows are exactly those rows that have t ii = 0 as diagonal elements. The matrix T 2 = 1 N T 1 contains only those rows of T 1 that have a non-interventional index, that is, rows that have diagonal elements t ii equal to 1. The resulting structure of T 2 is illustrated below:</p><p>The ordered set of non-interventional indexes is given by N := {1, 2, ..., n} \ I = { j 1 , j 2 , ..., j n-K x }. For clarity of display (and without loss of generality), we assume j 1 = 1 and j n-K x = n, that is, variables V 1 and V n are not subject to intervention. Due to the step structure of the matrix T 2 with the rightmost nonzero element of each row equal to one, the matrix T 2 has full row rank, that is, rank(T 2 ) = n -K x .</p><p>Sketch of proof of local identification of example model. Due to space restrictions and the necessity to state high-dimensional vectors and matrices explicitly, a detailed and fully reproducible version of the proof is given in the online supplementary material. Let V = CV + ε be a linear graph-based model as defined in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), where n = 6, and C and are given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) and (20), respectively. Plugging in these quantities into Eq. (3.3.6) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bekker et al. (1994)</ref> yields:</p><p>The (32 × 36) matrix R and the (11 × 36) matrix R C encode the zero restrictions and equality constraints imposed on the covariance matrix and the matrix of structural coefficients in Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>), respectively. The matrix K 6 denotes the commutation matrix for n ×n matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Magnus &amp; Neudecker, 1979)</ref>. Theorem 3.3.1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bekker et al. (1994)</ref> states that under certain regularity conditions the parameter vector θ is locally identified, if and only if, the Jacobian matrix J has full column rank. We show that rank( J) = 36. The exact form of the restriction matrices R and R C , and the Mathematica (Wolfram Research Inc., 2018) code used to evaluate the rank of J are provided in the online supplementary material.</p><p>Properties Required for Theorem 8:</p><p>Property A.1. (properties of causal effect functions g) Let γ be a causal quantity and g(θ γ ) the corresponding causal effect function. Let g(θ γ ) be continuously differentiable with respect to θ γ in a neighborhood around the true population parameter value θ * γ ∈ γ . The r × s matrix of partial derivatives is non-singular and denoted by ∂g(θ γ ) ∂θ γ</p><p>. If the causal effect function contains auxiliary variables, say g(θ γ ; x, v N ), then non-singularity of the matrix of partial derivatives is supposed to hold for any fixed value combination</p><p>Property A.2. (statistical properties of θ γ ) Let θ γ be an estimator of θ γ with:</p><p>Where θ * denotes the true population value and p -→ ( d -→) refers to convergence in probability (distribution) as the sample size N tends to infinity. The covariance matrix of the limiting distribution is denoted as AV( √ N θ γ ) and is assumed to be finite. 17</p></div>
