<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the field of music information retrieval (MIR), cover song identification (CSI) is a challenging task that aims to identify cover versions of a query song from a massive collection. Existing works still suffer from high intra-song variances and inter-song correlations, due to the entangled nature of version-specific and version-invariant factors in their modeling. In this work, we set the goal of disentangling version-specific and version-invariant factors, which could make it easier for the model to learn invariant music representations for unseen query songs. We analyze the CSI task in a disentanglement view with the causal graph technique, and identify the intra-version and inter-version effects biasing the invariant learning. To block these effects, we propose the disentangled music representation learning framework (DisCover) for CSI. DisCover consists of two critical components: (1) Knowledge-guided Disentanglement Module (KDM) and (2) Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglement Module (GADM), which block intra-version and inter-version biased effects, respectively. KDM minimizes the mutual information between the learned representations and version-variant factors that are identified with prior domain knowledge. GADM identifies version-variant factors by simulating the representation transitions between intra-song versions, and exploits adversarial distillation</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Nowadays, online digital music platforms, such as Spotify and Apple Musiccontain a massive number of music tracks for consumption, intensifying the need of music retrieval techniques for discovering related songs. One of the key techniques for music discovery is cover song identification (CSI), which aims to retrieve the cover versions from a music collection given a query song. Specially, a cover version/song is an alternative interpretation of the original version with different musical facets (e.g. timbre, key, tempo, or structure).</p><p>In real-world scenarios, the music collection can be massive and rapidly updated, potentially amplifying the intra-song variances (c.f. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and inter-song correlations. These characteristics drive the CSI problem hard to handle due to the ubiquitous spurious correlations among songs of different collections. Intuitively, CSI requires a fine-grained analysis of music facets and semantics such that the intra-song correlations and inter-song differences can be adequately distinguished. Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence in other domains <ref type="bibr">[1, 29, 50-53, 59, 60, 65]</ref>, deep learning based CSI models have presented superior performance compared with traditional sequence matching methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Most of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref> treat CSI as a classification task and utilize CNN-based architecture for music content understanding. Furthermore, some state-of-the-art works <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> explore metric learning techniques to narrow the gap between different cover versions of the same song and simultaneously expand the distance among the different version groups. Despite the significant advances made by these methods, we argue that song-specific and song-sharing musical factors are highly entangled in their modeling, thus being inadequate to distinguish unseen cover versions and songs. For example, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the testing cover version (b) of the query song (a) shows significant differences in pitch/F0 (the orange curve in the spectrogram), timbre, or rhythm. If the model is unable to disentangle these factors and identifies them as version-variant, it might fail to generalize on this testing version and identify it as negative ones. On the other hand, if the model fails to disentangle and recognize version-invariant factors, it might falsely correlate some other songs with the given query based on the high similarity of version-specific factors. To bridge the gap, we set the goal of explicitly disentangling version-variant and version-invariant factors and thus learning invariant musical representations for unseen cover song identification.</p><p>To better understand the underlying mechanism of the disentanglement in CSI task, we resort the causal graph technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> for illustration (c.f. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The nodes denote cause or effect factors. An edge 𝐴 → 𝐵 means the 𝐴 can directly affect 𝐵.</p><p>• Firstly, we illustrate the causal graph from the model's perspective in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a): 𝑍 𝑖 denotes the set of factors that are specific to Technically, we propose a Disentangled music representation learning framework for Cover song identification, denoted as Dis-Cover, which encapsulates two key components: (1) Knowledgeguided Disentanglement Module (KDM) and (2) Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglement Module (GADM) for blocking biased effects 𝑍 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 and 𝑍 𝑗 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 , respectively. KDM employs off-the-shelf music feature extractors as the domain knowledge for disentanglement, and minimizes the mutual information (MI) between the learned representations and version-variant factors. GADM identifies version-variant factors by simulating the representation transitions between intra-song versions and adopting gradient-based adaptive masking. Since the discrete-valued mask might distort the continuity of representations in the hypersphere, it would be less effective to use MI to measure the effect 𝑍 𝑗 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 . Instead, GADM incorporates an adversarial distillation sub-module for distribution-based effect blocking.</p><p>The main highlights of this work are summarized as follows:</p><p>• We analyze the cover song identification problem in a disentanglement view with causal graph, a powerful tool but is seldom used in the community. We identify the bad impact of version-variant factors with two effect paths that needed to be blocked. • We propose the DisCover framework that disentangles versionvariant factors among intra-song versions and blocks two biased effect paths via knowledge-guided MI minimization and gradientbased adversarial distillation. • We conduct in-depth experimental analyses along on both quantitative and qualitative results, which have demonstrated the effectiveness and necessity of disentanglement for CSI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Cover Song identification</head><p>With the increasing amount of music data on the Internet, cover song identification (CSI) has long been a popular task in the music information retrieval community. CSI aims to retrieve the cover versions of a given song in a dataset, which can also be seen as measuring the similarity between music signals without meta-information (e.g., title, author, genre). Specifically, meta-information might ease the problem but also introduce spurious correlations that many different songs have quite similar or even the same short title. Moreover, users humming the query songs might not necessarily know/provide the meta-information. Overall, CSI as a challenging task has long attracted lots of researchers due to its potential applications in music representation learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref> and recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. However, those cover songs may differ from the original song in key transposition, speed change, and structural variations, which challenges identifying the cover song. To solve these problems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> developed music sequences alignment algorithms for version identification by measuring the similarity between time series, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> generated fixed-length vectors for cover song identification. In addition, deep learning approaches are introduced to CSI. For instance, CNNs are utilized to measure the similarity matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> or learn features <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. On this basis, TPPNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> uses a temporal pyramid pool to extract information at a different scale. CQTNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> proposes a special CNN architecture to extract musical representations and train the network through classification strategies. Although these methods have made significant progress, they ignore the entanglement of cover song representations and may incorrectly correlate some other songs with a given query. Thus, we propose a framework that disentangles version-variant factors among intra-song versions. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Z 1 X 1 X 2 Z Z 2 Y 1 Y 2 ◊ ◊ Cover Version 1 Cover Version 2 (a) Cutoff Z i → X i Z 1 X 1 X 2 Z Z 2 Y 1 Y 2 ◊ ◊ Cover Version 1 Cover Version 2 (b) Cutoff Z i → X j</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Disentangled Representation Learning</head><p>Disentangled representation learning (DRL) focuses on encoding data points into separate independent embedding subspaces, where different subspaces represent different data attributes. To prevent information leakage from each other, the correlation between the two embedding parts is still required to be reduced. Some correlationreducing methods mainly focus on Mutual Information (MI) minimization, where MI is a fundamental measure of the dependence between two random variables. To accurately estimate MI upper bound, CLUB <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> bridges mutual information estimation with contrastive learning. This method has gained a lot of attention and applications in scenarios such as domain adaption, style transfer, and causal inference. For instance, IDE-VC <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and VQMIVC <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> achieves proper disentanglement of speech representations. MIM-DRCFR <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> learns disentangled representations for counterfactual regression. In addition, as analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>, the gradients of the final predicted score convey the task-discriminative information, which correctly identifies the task-relevant features. For instance, Grad-CAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> visualizes the importance of each class by leveraging the gradient information. On the basis of this, ToAlign <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> decomposes a source feature into a task-relevant one and a taskirrelevant one for performing the classification-oriented alignment. RSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> discards the task-relevant representations associated with the higher gradients. DropClass <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> uses gradient information to extract class-specific information from the entangled feature map. However, most of these works learn to disentangle representations from a single perspective. This paper blocks two biased effect paths via knowledge-guided MI minimization and gradient-based adversarial distillation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Music Representation Learning</head><p>An effective musical representation is essential for learning different music-related tasks, such as music classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, cover song identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>, music generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Most of them rely on large amounts of labeled datasets to learn music representations. As the labeled datasets on which supervised learning methods require extensive manual labeling, it is often costly and time-consuming, leading to limitations in the performance of supervised learning methods. For this reason, some audio researchers have adopted a self-supervised learning approach to learning musical representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. For example, MusicBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> models music self-representation with a multi-task learning framework. PEMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> proposes a positive-negative frame mask for music representation with contrastive learning. Many approaches to music representation learning focus on key pieces of music, while CSI focuses more on the whole song. Prior Knowledge Selection. There are usually multiple variations of musical facets for the cover version, such as timbre, key, tempo, timing, or structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Hence it meets a problem of how to select the appropriate musical facets as expert knowledge. Inspired by the common practice in the disentanglement-based voice conversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> and singing voice synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and other speech-related tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we consider that fundamental frequency (F0) and timbre are relatively more sensitive to cover versions among different facets since they often change when different artists perform the same piece of song/music. Therefore, we select the F0 and timbre as representatives of the prior knowledge in our work. Specifically, F0 is the musical pitch, representing the high or low notes in the song/music. Timbre describes the vocal characteristics of the artist or instrument, which strongly influences how song/music is heard by trained as well as untrained ears.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Framework Overview</head><p>To block the intra-version and inter-version biased effects for learning version-invariant representations, we propose DisCover, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. DisCover consists of two modules: (1) Knowledgeguided Disentanglement Module (KDM), which mitigates the negative effect from cover information and extracting the commonness for the versions (green area in the upper left of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</p><p>(2) Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglement Module (GADM), which identifies the differences between versions and alleviates the negative transfer (blue area in the lower right of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). The two modules are jointly trained in a parallel manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Knowledge-guided Disentanglement</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a), the Knowledge-guided Disentanglement module (KDM) aims to block the bias between intra-song versions (cutoff 𝑍 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 ), which attempts to make the model more focused on the version-invariant factors 𝑍 and learn invariant representations for different cover versions. Considering that the model is hard to identify the version-specific factors entangled in the representation, as mentioned in Sec 3.1, we introduce the prior knowledge (e.g. F0 and timbre) to serve as the teacher that provides version-variant factors 𝑍 𝑖 . In contrast to the goal of knowledge transfer, the model aims to minimize the correlation between the Here, we denote 𝒙 ∈ R 𝑑𝑖𝑚 as the learned representations and 𝒛 ∈ {𝒐, 𝒕 } as the knowledge bank of version-variant factors, where 𝒐 ∈ R 𝑑𝑖𝑚 represents the fundamental frequency (F0) features, 𝒕 ∈ R 𝑑𝑖𝑚 represents the timbre representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">factors-invariant Representation Modeling.</head><p>To minimize the correlation between the learned representations 𝑥 and the versionvariant factors 𝑧, we introduce mutual information (MI) to serves as the measurement, which is defined as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their joint and marginal distributions as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝐼 (𝒙; 𝒛) = E 𝑝 (𝒙,𝒛 ) [log 𝑝 (𝒛|𝒙) 𝑝 (𝒙) ]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Since the conditional distribution 𝑝 (𝒛|𝒙) is intractable, we adopt vCLUB <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to approximate the upper bound of MI as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐼 (𝑥, 𝑧) = E 𝑝 (𝑥,𝑧 ) [log 𝑞 𝜃 𝑥,𝑧 (𝑧|𝑥)] -E 𝑝 (𝑥 ) E 𝑝 (𝑧 ) [log 𝑞 𝜃 𝑥,𝑧 (𝑧|𝑥)]<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where 𝑞 𝜃 𝑥,𝑧 (•) represents the variational estimation network between 𝒙 and 𝒛. Therefore the unbiased estimation for vCLUB between learned representation and version-variant factors can be reformulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L 𝐼 (𝒙;𝒐) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 [log(𝑞 𝜃 𝒙,𝒐 (𝒐 𝑖 |𝒙 𝑖 )) - 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 log(𝑞 𝜃 𝒙,𝒐 (𝒐 𝑗 |𝒙 𝑖 ))]<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">L 𝐼 (𝒙;𝒕 ) = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 [log(𝑞 𝜃 𝒙,𝒕 (𝒕 𝑖 |𝒙 𝑖 )) - 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 log(𝑞 𝜃 𝒙,𝒕 (𝒕 𝑗 |𝒙 𝑖 ))]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑁 represents the batch size. By minimizing the Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) and (4), we can decrease the correlation between learned representation and version-variant factors and the total MI loss is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L 𝑀𝐼 = L 𝐼 (𝒙;𝒐) + L 𝐼 (𝒙;𝒕 )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>To obtain the reliable upper bound approximation, a robust variational estimator 𝑞 𝜃 𝑥,𝑧 (•) is required.

However, we argue that vCLUB might be at risk of posterior collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> due to the KL-Vanishinig. For example, if the weights of the variational estimator become randomized due to undesirable training, the introduction of prior knowledge would be meaningless. Therefore, knowledge tradeoff is the self-supervised way to relieve the posterior collapse and ensure training stability for variational estimator. Furthermore, considering knowledge extractors' ability, little beneficial versioninvariant information might still remain in the 𝒛. To address these concerns, we provide two alternatively simple methods. Firstly, we can fuse task-oriented representation 𝒆 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝑎 = 𝜎 (𝑔(𝒆, 𝑞(𝒛))),<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝒆 * = 𝑎 * 𝒆 + (1 -𝑎) * 𝑞(𝒛)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where 𝜎 (•) denotes the sigmoid function, 𝑔(•) is the linear transformation, 𝑞(•) is the shared MLP in the variational estimator, and 𝑎 ∈ R serves as the tradeoff between 𝒆 and 𝑞(𝒛). Secondly, we can use clustering models (e.g. k-means) to annotate the pseudo labels for 𝒛 to supervise the variational estimator with classification task:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L 𝑧 𝑐𝑙𝑠 = - 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑧 𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔( ŷ𝑧 𝑖 ) + (1 -𝑦 𝑧 𝑖 )𝑙𝑜𝑔(1 -ŷ𝑧 𝑖 )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where 𝑦 𝑧 𝑖 is the pseudo label for 𝑧 𝑖 , and ŷ𝑧 𝑖 is the output of the knowledge classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglement</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(b), the Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglement module (GADM) aims to block the bias between inter-song versions (cutoff 𝑍 𝑗 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 ), which attempts to bridge the intra-group gap and avoid biased representation learning. As analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>, the gradients of the predictive score contain the discriminative information for the downstream tasks. Analogously, the gradients of the transition cost between two versions might convey important information for version-variant factors. For this purpose, we randomly construct the positive query-target pairs with different versions and obtain the corresponding representation pairs (𝒙, 𝒙 + ) with the same backbone model. GADM has three main steps: identification, decomposition, and alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Identification.</head><p>The main idea of identification is to recognize the version-variant factors that are entangled in the elements of learned representations. Since the backbone encoder maps the samples into the hyperspace, positive representation pairs 𝑥 and 𝑥 + can be regarded as two points in the same high dimensional space.</p><p>In the ideal case, different versions of the same song should have similar representations. In other words, these points should cluster together in the hyperspace. However, the distance between two points would be enlarged due to the disruption of version-variant factors that are highly entangled in the representations. Therefore, we treat the distance between query-target pair 𝑥 and 𝑥 + as the transition cost caused by entangled version-variant factors. Here, we can use metric function (e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan, or Cosine) to serve as the transitions cost C 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 ∈ R + between the representations of intra-song versions 𝑥 and 𝑥 + as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 = ℎ(𝒙, 𝒙 + )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where ℎ(•, •) denotes the metric function.

We can obtain versionvariant information by calculating the gradients of the transition cost C 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 w.r.t. the representation 𝒙 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">𝑔 𝒙 = 𝜕 C 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 𝜕 𝒙<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where 𝑔 𝒙 ∈ R 𝑑𝑖𝑚 denotes the gradient vector of 𝒙. Since the partial derivative operation for query 𝒙 utilizes the information from target 𝒙 + , gradient vector 𝑔 𝒙 probably conveys the element-wise importance information of representation 𝒙 for measuring the difference to its target 𝒙 + . Specifically, as shown in the bottom right corner of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, each element 𝑔 𝒙 (𝑖) in 𝑔 𝒙 represents the fusion result between query element 𝒙 (𝑖) and whole target representation 𝒙 + . The process allows element 𝑔 𝒙 (𝑖) to automatically search for the elements of the query representation 𝒙 that are relevant to the transition cost. That's why 𝑔 𝒙 can identify the version-variant factors hiding in the 𝒙 + . Furthermore, the value of 𝑔 𝒙 (𝑖) represents the sensitivity to the changes of transition cost C 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 , where the element with the higher value is more relevant to the version-variant factors based on the nature of gradient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Decomposition. After identifying the version-variant factors, we attempt to decompose the version-invariant representation</head><p>x from 𝒙. Inspired by ToAlign <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, which decomposes a source feature into a task-relevant/irrelevant one with a gradient-based attention weight vector. We further exploit the numeric order in 𝑔 𝒙 to ensure that the element with the higher gradient has the lower attention weight. Specifically, given the gradient vector 𝑔 𝒙 , we will construct the corresponding mask vector and decompose it as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">𝒎 𝒙 (𝑖) =          1 - exp (𝑔 𝑥 (𝑖)) 𝑘 ∈ {𝑘 |𝑔 𝑥 (𝑘 ) ≥𝑞 𝑝 } exp (𝑔 𝑥 (𝑘)) , 𝑖 𝑓 𝑔 𝑥 (𝑖) ≥ 𝑞 𝑝 1, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒<label>(12)</label></formula><p>x = 𝒎 𝒙 ⊙ 𝒙 (13) where 𝑚 𝑥 (𝑖) denotes 𝑖-th element in the mask, 𝑞 𝑝 denotes the 𝑝-th largest percentile in 𝑔 𝒙 , and ⊙ denotes the hadamard product. Moreover, in view of the self-challenging method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the decomposition process adaptively re-weights 𝒙 based on the knowledge from 𝑔 𝒙 and forces the backbone to lower the attention on version-specific elements, so as to obtain the version-invariant representation x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Alignment.</head><p>To alleviate the negative transfer, we adopt the adversarial distillation sub-module to align entangled representation 𝒙 to the disentangled one x. In the beginning, 𝒙 and x belong to different hyperspheres, where the 𝒙 is considered as the negative source and the x is the positive target. We use them to train the discriminator 𝐷 to distinguish which hypersphere the representation belongs to, with the classification loss L 𝐷 1 . Meanwhile, the backbone encoder is trained to fool the discriminator to learn the version-invariant representation by minimizing task-oriented loss while maximizing L 𝐷 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">L 𝐷 1 = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 [log 𝐷 ( x𝑖 ) + log (1 -𝐷 (𝑥 𝑖 )]<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">L 𝐷 2 = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 [log (1 -𝐷 (𝑥 𝑖 )]<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, considering the symmetry of the query-target pair, we can similarly obtain the version-invariant target representation x+ ∈ R 𝑑𝑖𝑚 . To ensure the semantic consistency between query and target, it is better to minimize transition cost as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 = ℎ( x, x+ )<label>(16)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Training</head><p>Given the output of the task-oriented classifier ŷ x , we treat CSI as the classification task, where the task-oriented learning objective can be formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L 𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘 = - 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝑦 x𝑙𝑜𝑔( ŷ x ) + (1 -𝑦 x )𝑙𝑜𝑔(1 -ŷ x )<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where 𝑦 x is the groundtruth label.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Overall Results (RQ1)</head><p>We instantiate the proposed DisCover framework on three bestperforming CSI methods, i.e., TPPNet, CQTNet,and PICKiNet, and obtain TPPNet-Dis, CQTNet-Dis and PICKiNet-Dis. • Overall, the results across multiple evaluation metrics consistently indicate that TPPNet-Dis, CQTNet-Dis, and PICKiNet-Dis achieve better results than their base models among different datasets and scenarios. Especially, CQTNet-Dis and PICKiNet-Dis show comparable performance and outperform other bestperforming methods. We attribute the improvements to the fact that baselines succeed in learning the version-invariant representations by disentangling version-specific musical factors.</p><p>• DisCover can boost the performance of models in different scenarios, especially in scenario #1, where all test songs are unseen. It suggests that the version-variant factors have been highly disentangled. In addition, in Karaoke30k where the cover versions of a particular song are fewer, DisCover could still significantly improve the baselines. These results demonstrate the practical merits of DisCover, i.e., identifying version-variant factors with limited number of annotated versions. Note that in real-world scenarios, less popular songs constitute the majority of the music collections and have fewer cover versions. In summary, these results demonstrate the strengths of DisCover in generalization and few-shot learning, which is critical for industrial scenarios where music collections could be rapidly updated and too massive to sample the full cover versions for training. • Surprisingly, MR1 scores in scenario #1 are mostly worse than those in scenario #2 for all models, especially in SHS100K. These results might suggest that entangled training leads to spurious correlations among songs, including those testing songs seen during training. We also observe that on the SHS100K dataset, the proposed method could not beat some baselines w.r.   • Removing either KDM or GADM leads to performance degradation, while removing both modules (i.e., the base model) leads to the worst performance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two modules as well as the benefits of disentanglement for CSI. We attribute this superiority to the fact that the models would absorb less spurious correlations among songs and versions by learning version-invariant representations and blocking intra/inter-version biased effects. • Removing GADM leads to more performance drops than removing KDM, which indicates that introduced prior knowledge only contains the part of the version-variant factors. Therefore it is necessary to identify the remained factors that hide in the representation. These results again verify the effectiveness of the end-to-end disentanglement module GADM.  between two versions of a song. Therefore a reliable metric function is vital for identifying the version-variant factors between different versions. In this experiment, we select three commonly used distances (e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine) to serve as the transition cost. Surprisingly, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, the Euclidean distance, which is less explored in the CSI literature, shows a clear advantage over other widely used metric functions. This is an interesting finding that might be potentially inspirational. We plan to further uncover the underlying mechanisms in the future.</p></div>

𝑋 𝑖 denotes the learned musical representation of the 𝑖-th cover version. 𝑍 denotes the set of version-invariant factors. 𝑌 𝑖 denotes the retrieval results (e.g. a candidate playlist) given the learned representation 𝑋 𝑖 . Intuitively, during the co-training of various cover versions where different factors are highly entangled, 𝑍 1 could have a direct effect on 𝑋 1 and also 𝑋 2 , which is the musical representation of the second cover version. Therefore, 𝑌 1 and 𝑌 2 will be indirectly affected through causal path 𝑍 1 → 𝑋 1 → 𝑌 1 and 𝑍 1 → 𝑋 2 → 𝑌 2 respectively, which will lead to spurious correlations and mismatching during unseen cover song identification. • Secondly, as illustrated in Figure 2(b), we further consider the causal graph from searcher's perspective. It is a relatively ideal causal graph that X𝑖 is only affected by 𝑍 . In other words, version information has no effect on the learned music representation, such that intra-song versions can be adequately distinguished from the others. In this work, we aim to develop a disentanglement framework that could realize the transition of models' underlying behavior from Figure 2(a) to Figure 2(b) for debiased and effective cover song identification. We identify two critical challenges in achieving disentanglement in CSI: (1) Mitigating the negative effect from cover information and extracting the commonness for the versions (cutoff 𝑍 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 ), which aims to make the model more focused on the version-invariant factors 𝑍 and learn invariant representations for different cover versions. (2) Identifying the differences between versions and alleviating the negative transfer (cutoff 𝑍 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑗 → 𝑌 𝑗 ), which attempts to bridge the intra-group gap and avoid biased representation learning. It is non-trivial to block paths 𝑍 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 and 𝑍 𝑗 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 due to the implicit nature of version-specific factors 𝑍 𝑖 , 𝑍 𝑗 and the effects in deep neural networks. In this regard, we introduce a disentanglement module for identifying versionspecific factors, followed by an effect-blocking module for learning invariant representations. As for the path 𝑍 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 , disentangling 𝑍 𝑖 is challenging without supervision signals since different factors (e.g. F0 and timbre) in raw music are highly entangled. In this regard, we introduce prior domain knowledge as guidance for disentanglement. As for the path 𝑍 𝑗 → 𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑌 𝑖 , the challenge lies in how to identify the factors 𝑍 𝑗 in the 𝑗-th sample that could affect the representation learning of 𝑋 𝑖 . Intuitively, we regard the modified factors during the transition from 𝑋 𝑗 to 𝑋 𝑖 as version-variant factors that are critical to 𝑋 𝑖 in the 𝑗-th sample. Technically, we propose a Disentangled music representation learning framework for Cover song identification, denoted as Dis-Cover, which encapsulates two key components: (1) Knowledgeguided Disentanglement Module (KDM) and (2) Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglement Module (GADM) for blocking biased</figDesc></figure>

We use 𝑞 to denote one query song and S = {𝑠 𝑖 } 𝑖=1,...,| S | to denote the song collections on an online music platform. Given the query 𝑞, cover song identification aims to retrieve the most similar candidates C = {𝑐 𝑖 } 𝑖=1,...,𝑘 from the song collections S in a top-k manner. A deep learning-based CSI model 𝑓 (•) encodes the 𝑞 and 𝑠 𝑖 into the fixed dimension representation 𝒒 and 𝒔 𝑖 separately. Then we use cosine distance to calculate the similarity for all the pairs 𝑃 = {(𝒒, 𝒔 𝑖 )} 𝑖=1,...,|𝑆 | . During testing and serving, top-k candidates C will be ranked by the similarity and displayed on the music platform in a position consistent with the rank.</figDesc></figure>

We adopt CQTNet, TPPNet and PICKiNet as baseline and equip them with DisCover framework and plot the twenty randomly sampled songs and each song has three versions with the representations encoded by the corresponding model. As shown in Figure 5, we can observe that: • Overall, different versions of a song exhibit more noticeable clusters with the help of DisCover. The base model is more likely to falsely correlate songs based on the similarity of version-variant factors. For example, the versions of song #12 in Figure 5(a) are closer to the other songs, which suggests that CQTNet fail to learn the discriminative representation for them. However, in Figure 5(b), different versions of song #12 are more compact, which demonstrates the capability of disentanglement. • Moreover, equipped with DisCover, all of CQTNet, TPPNet and PICKiNet show better performance in learning more discriminative representations compared to the baselines, which further reveals the model-agnostic capability of DisCover. • Furthermore, although the training samples for each song are limited (2 to 3 cover versions for a song), DisCover can still learn the discriminative representations for unseen songs. These results again verify the strengths of DisCover in generalization and few-shot learning.</figDesc></figure>
