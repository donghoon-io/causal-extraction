<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), commonly known as chronic diseases, present a significant challenge to public health globally, impacting individuals of all ages and geographical regions. These persistent health conditions result from a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, behavioural, and physiological factors. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, NCDs are responsible for the majority of global mortality, accounting for an estimated 41 million deaths annually, with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) leading the statistics followed by cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Effective prevention and management strategies are crucial to address this growing challenge.</p><p>The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revealed new possibilities for transforming healthcare. AI offers immense potential in various aspects, including diagnosis, disease prediction, and treatment optimisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. However, many AI systems lack transparency, hindering their interpretability and limiting their ability to capture causal relationships. To address this issue, there is a growing interest in developing models that not only provide accurate predictions but also offer transparency through causal inference, facilitating optimal decisionmaking under uncertainty through the simulation of hypothetical interventions. Causal inference plays a crucial role in addressing this critical gap in AI-powered healthcare solutions, where the ability to intervene effectively can significantly impact patient outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. It enables us to move beyond mere prediction and towards understanding the underlying cause-and-effect relationships.</p><p>Graphical models have gained popularity as a means of capturing causal relationships probabilistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. The Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) framework, introduced by Pearl <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, is a widely used approach for estimating how the probabilities of a given output may change due to external interventions. Therefore, CBNs provide a powerful framework for modelling and reasoning about causal relationships in complex systems, including those found in healthcare. The graphical structure of a CBN model is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) G, which is said to be a CBN if the arcs are assumed to represent causal relationships. The literature has ex-tensively studied learning the structure of causal networks from observational data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. The well-established classes of learning are:</p><p>• Constraint-Based Learning: A class of learning that typically starts with a fully connected undirected graph, and employs conditional independence tests on the data to eliminate most of those edges between variables and orientate some of the remaining edges.</p><p>• Score-Based Learning: This class of learning is made up of two parts: a search strategy that determines how to explore the search-space of possible graphs, and an objective function that is used to evaluate each graph visited within the search-space of graphs, affecting the paths visited by the search strategy.</p><p>• Hybrid algorithms: combine the above two classes of structure learning. A typical process involves applying conditional independence tests to the data to eliminate spurious relationships, and then score-based learning to the reduced search-space of graphs.</p><p>This study investigates causal networks underlying diabetes. By gaining a better understanding of its root causes, we aim to improve diabetes management. This pursuit extends beyond mere prediction, leveraging the power of CBNs to unlock deeper insights into the factors contributing to the disease. This is because CBNs allow us to simulate real-world interventions through the mathematical framework called do-operator introduced by Pearl and thus allow us to answer crucial questions beyond prediction, such as, "How does education of diabetes affect the management of diabetes?" or "What effect does blood pressure have on diabetes?". This capability transcends traditional observational data analysis, enabling us to truly understand cause and effect, not just correlations.</p><p>The key contributions of this research are:</p><p>• Developed a set of knowledge graphs for diabetes with different levels of confidence, through a collaboration with a clinical expert, that encompass important entities, relationships, and attributes that are pertinent to the disease and its associated factors. This knowledge graph provides a solid foundation for further analysis and dissemination of information in the field of diabetes research.</p><p>• Identified causal pathways amongst potential risk factors affecting the progression of diabetes by means of an extensive analysis utilising various structural learning algorithms (constraint-based, score-based, and hybrid approaches). This method enhances the credibility and applicability of the findings compared to relying on a single algorithm, potentially leading to new insights into the fundamental causal mechanisms of diabetes.</p><p>• Investigated the stability and consistency of identified causal pathways across different learning algorithms. This analysis provides deeper understanding into the dependability and general applicability of the results, offering better comprehension of the causal elements involved in diabetes.</p><p>• Developed an integrated causal model for diabetes by merging insights from diverse learning algorithms by means of a model-averaging technique. This model combines the strengths of individual approaches and reduces potential biases inherent in any single algorithm, resulting in a more robust outcome.</p><p>• Validated and refined the inferred causal relationships by comparing the structures obtained from individual algorithms and the averaged graph with those identified by domain experts. This integrates domain knowledge into the research, enhancing the credibility and potential impact of the findings. Furthermore, by exploring areas of agreement and divergence between expert-driven models and algorithm-derived structures, the research identifies potential areas for improvement and refinement in the future iterations of the causal model.</p><p>• Demonstrated the practical application of the research findings by utilising CBNs to evaluate the potential effects of hypothetical interventions on diabetes outcomes. This analysis delivers valuable, evidence-based information to inform public health decision-making regarding diabetes prevention and management strategies. By examining the effectiveness of different intervention policies and their implications, the research offers insights to support the development and implementation of more effective strategies for combating diabetes.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: we discuss relevant works in Section 2, we describe the dataset and provide exploratory analysis in Section 3, we describe the methodology in Section 4, we present and discuss the results in Section 5, and Section 6 provides our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related works</head><p>This section provides an overview of relevant literature on ML and BNs in healthcare. By exploring works in both fields, it is possible to gain a comprehensive understanding of their respective strengths and limitations. Research on disease prediction has advanced significantly, covering various aspects such as diagnosis, prediction, categorisation, and treatment.</p><p>ML and AI techniques have been widely investigated and applied in various healthcare domains. These include genomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, treatment selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, outcome, prognosis, and prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. The primary objective of disease diagnosis is to identify patterns in a given dataset, and the use of ML in healthcare diagnostics and clinical decision-making is becoming increasingly popular. In their research on the early-stage risk prediction of NCDs, as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, the authors introduce a novel ML-based health Cyber-Physical System (CPS) framework to tackle the challenges associated with effectively processing wearable IoT sensor data for early risk prediction of diseases like diabetes. Although their work primarily focuses on the early-stage risk prediction using ML algorithms, the results do not take into account certain factors that could significantly impact disease progression.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, the prevalence of NCDs across gender and age groups was examined using descriptive statistical methods. Additionally, the study explored the cumulative effects of various combinations of NCDs. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> conducted a review of six ML algorithms to predict heart disease, with logistic regression producing the highest classification accuracy. The study focused mainly on disease prediction and evaluating the effectiveness of different algorithms. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, memory networks were used to diagnose inference using free text clinical records and an external knowledge source, while in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> a hierarchical GRU-based neural network was proposed to predict clinical outcomes based on medical code sequences from previous patient visits. These studies address different challenges in healthcare using ML and AI, ranging from sequential disease prediction to cardiovascular disease diagnosis using covariates such as sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.</p><p>BNs have attracted growing research attention in healthcare and many BN models have been developed for medical diagnosis, incorporating data, knowledge, medical literature, ontologies, and other sources of medical evidence, either individually or in combination. Relevant applications of BNs include diagnosing breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, age-related cognitive degeneration diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, and understanding severity of a patient's condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, publicly available Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data is combined with knowledge to construct CBNs and investigate factors associated with infantile diarrhoea. A similar approach is taken in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, where a CBN model is employed to analyse a diabetic case study. The model is built and evaluated using the Netica software based on three main factors, providing insights into the emergence of diabetes and associated major problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> describes a strategy for integrating various sources of empirical data and verified theoretical models to improve both qualitative and quantitative HRA applications using the BN model. The use of causal independence is demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> as a way to simplify probability assessment and inference in BNs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> also highlight that BNs are useful for predicting long-term health-related quality of life and comorbidities in bariatric surgery patients. Lastly, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, it was demonstrated that using BN classifiers for predicting asthma exacerbations has an advantage over traditional clinical prediction methods due to the use of multiple factors associated with exacerbations simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data and exploratory analysis</head><p>Data was obtained and pre-processed from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is the primary system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data on risk behaviours, chronic health conditions, and use of preventative treatments amongst U.S. residents <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. The survey started in 1984 and currently performs over 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the world's largest continuously conducted health survey system. This survey data provides a dataset that could be used to analyse and forecast diabetes risk variables. We utilised the BRFSS-2015 dataset, which included 253,680 health assessments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0.1.">Data pre-processing</head><p>We pre-processed the data and selected 22 variables that are relevant to this study. We present these variables in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>and group them as follows:</p><p>• Non-modifiable RFs (Risk Factors): Sex, Age.</p><p>• Modifiable RFs: Body mass index (BMI), Blood Pressure (HighBP), Cholesterol (HighChol), General Health (GenHealth), Education, Heart Disease (HeartDiseaseo-rAttack), Physical Activity (PhysActivity).</p><p>• Medical condition: Diabetes (Diabetes binary).</p><p>In the analysis of the BRFSS data, certain pre-processing steps were essential to ensure compatibility with various algorithms that require categorical data for constructing CBNs. This involved encoding non-categorical variables, since some variables within the dataset were not categorical in nature. It also involved ensuring that existing categorical variables are restricted to a reasonable number of states, since many of the variables had a large number of possible states which can be impractical for constructing CBNs. Therefore, the next step involved reducing the number of states while ensuring that no es-sential information was lost for the purposes of this case study. Specifically, : individuals with income between $0-14,999 as 1, between $15,000-24,999 as 2, between $25,000-50,000 as 3 and greater than $50,000 as 4. 5. BMI categorisation: BMI, initially continuous, was categorised into three states: 0-24 (0), 25-39 (1), and ≥ 40 (2). 6. Physical and mental health duration: Variables related to physical and mental health, which had values ranging from 0 to 30, were transformed into three categories: 0-9 days (0), 10-19 days (1) and ≥ 20 (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0.2.">Exploratory Data Analysis</head><p>This section presents an initial exploration of the relationships between key variables and the target variable, diabetes, within our pre-processed dataset. Key observations include:</p><p>1. The age distribution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) showed a higher prevalence of diabetes in individuals aged 55 and above, aligning with existing research. 2. Regarding socioeconomic factors, the income levels displayed a difference between diabetic and non-diabetic groups, with a higher proportion of non-diabetics falling into higher income categories (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). 3. The distribution of individuals across general health categories shifted, with a decrease in the "Excellent" category and an increase in the "Poor" category amongst those with diabetes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). 4. The distribution of individuals across BMI categories shifted towards higher levels in the diabetic group, highlighting the importance of monitoring individuals in the 25-39 BMI range (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). 5. The percentage of individuals with high cholesterol significantly increased in the diabetic group compared to nondiabetics (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). 6. The prevalence of high blood pressure was substantially higher in the diabetic group compared to the non-diabetic group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</p><p>These findings provide preliminary insights into the potential relationships between these variables and diabetes, warranting further investigation through statistical analysis and causal inference techniques.      </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methodology</head><p>This section is separated into four parts. We begin by detailing the process we followed to obtain a causal structure with the assistance of a domain expert in Section 4.1. Following this, we elaborate on the process employed to learn causal structures solely from data in Section 4.2. Subsequent subsections describe the model-averaging approach utilised to derive a unified structure from multiple candidate structures (Section 4.3), and the adoption of the do-operator framework for interventional analysis (Section 4.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Constructing a causal graph from knowledge</head><p>We initiated the graph construction process through collaboration with a domain expert, jointly crafting a causal graph. The domain expert identified and categorised possible causal relationships, between the variables collated, into three levels of confidence: high confidence, moderate confidence, and low confidence. We used these three levels of confidence to produce three different graphs:</p><p>1. High confidence graph: To strengthen the credibility of the pre-processed dataset, as well as the high-confidence graph developed by the domain expert, we employed statistical analysis to explore the strength of the potential relationships, after they had been identified by the expert. The analysis showed that the relationships share strong associations, highlighting the propagation of inference through the interconnectedness of factors within the studied population. For example, a strong correlation emerged between heavy alcohol consumption and physical health, indicating that higher alcohol intake associates with different physical health outcomes. Similarly, a significant association was identified between sex and diabetes, suggesting a potential role of gender in diabetes prevalence. Furthermore, age exhibited substantial correlations with numerous factors (income, general health, diabetes, BMI, physical activity, difficulty walking, and physical health), all statistically significant (p-values = 0.0). These preliminary analysis might emphasise the importance of considering demographic and lifestyle factors when investigating health outcomes.</p><p>While this analysis has helped us to obtain a better understanding of the associational strength between some variables of interest, it is important to clarify that correlation cannot be used to judge causal relationships. This is not only because correlations can be spurious, but also because the absence of correlation does not necessarily indicate the absence of causation.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Learning causal structure from data</head><p>We employ structure learning algorithms from various learning classes to learn graphical structures. Specifically, we consider constraint-based, score-based, and hybrid learning algorithms founded on varying assumptions about the input data, and produce diverse types of graphical structures. To ensure a comprehensive exploration of the learning algorithms, our analysis encompasses a total of 14 algorithms across the three different classes of learning. This variety in algorithmic approaches aims to strengthen the robustness and generalisability of our findings.</p><p>By comparing the results obtained from these diverse methodologies, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying relationships within our data. This approach helps to mitigate potential biases that might be introduced by any single algorithm, leading to a more reliable and representative picture of the true structure. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> lists the 14 algorithms along with the package we used to execute them, and the learning class they belong to. The 14 algorithms are:</p><p>• Peter-Clark algorithm (PC): This algorithm was proposed by Peter-Clark in 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. It starts by forming a fully connected undirected graph and eliminates edges using conditional independence tests. It identifies the causal relationships between variables based on the absence of subsets of variables that render them independent when conditioned upon.</p><p>• PC-Stable: The PC-Stable algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> is an extension of the PC algorithm. It modifies PC to address the issue of its dependence on the order of variables as read from data. These modifications eliminate or reduce this dependency.</p><p>• Fast Causal Inference (FCI): FCI, developed by Spirtes et al. in 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, is a constraint-based method that extends the PC algorithm to account for latent variables in the data. It begins by establishing the skeleton and then uses conditional independence tests to orientate some of the edges, including the identification of bi-directed edges to indicate confounding. • SaiyanH: A hybrid algorithm by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> that starts with marginal and conditional independence tests to learn a sparse undirected graph, and then uses the results from those tests together with BIC and do-operator tests to orientate the edges. The algorithm then utilises a tabu search with the restriction not to visit graphs that contain disjoing subgraphs. This learning approach guarantees that the acquired model does not contain disjoint subgraphs or variables, to enable full propagation of evidence .</p><p>• Hill-Climbing (HC): HC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> typically starts with an empty graph and greedily searches the space of graphs by adding, removing and reorienting edges iteratively. It uses a scoring function to score each graph visited and, at each iteration, moves to the graph that maximises the scoring function. It terminates when no neighbouring graph further increases the score.</p><p>• Structural Expectation Maximisation (EM): Structural EM <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> combines the traditional EM approach for parameter optimisation with score-based learning for model selection. The Structural EM trains networks using penalised likelihood scores, which include the BIC/MDL score and several Bayesian score estimates.</p><p>• Grow-Shrink (GS): The GS algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> is a method for discovering a variable's Markov Blanket, MB(X), which includes all of the variables in a graph that hold information about X; i.e., its parents, its children, and the parents of its children. The algorithm has two stages: a) adds variables to an empty set S based on their relationship with X, and b) removes variables that do not belong to MB(X). The GS algorithm then uses those MBs to construct a global graph.</p><p>• Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB): The IAMB algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> involves two phases: forward and backward. During the forward phase, a candidate set (CMB) is populated with variables, potentially including false positives. This addition is based on a heuristic function f that maximises the association between variables and the target variable (T), aiming to estimate the MB of T. In the backward phase, false positives are identified and removed from CMB to ensure its equivalence to MB(T). The heuristic function calculates the Mutual Information between variables for soundness. This strategy prioritises efficiency in both time and sample size, excluding irrelevant variables and minimising the sample required for conditional independence tests in backward conditioning.</p><p>• fast-IAMB: fast-IAMB <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> is an extension of IAMB that, in the growing phase, it sorts attributes from most to least conditionally dependent, and multiple attributes are added at once to reduce computational complexity and make the algorithm faster. This is different from IAMB, which adds only one attribute at a time and sorts the remaining attributes after each modification. Fast-IAMB's approach is said to be more statistically appropriate and adds more true members to the MB.</p><p>• Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC): MMHC is a hybrid algorithm that first learns an undirected graph using the Max-Min Parents and Children (MMPC) approach, which is a local discovery method described in Tsamardinos et al. (2003b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. It then uses a greedy Bayesian-scoring hill-climbing search to orientate the edges.</p><p>• H2PC: The hybrid learning H2PC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> first identifies the parents and children set for each variable and then conducts a greedy hill-climbing search in the space of graphs.</p><p>• Model Averaging Hill-Climbing (MAHC): MAHC <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> method extends HC in two ways. First, it pre-processes the Candidate Parent Sets (CPSs) for each variable and performs pruning on CPSs to dramatically reduce the searchspace of graphs. It then performs model-averaging in the hill-climbing search process, and moves to the neighbouring graph that maximises the objective function, on average, for that neighbour and over all its valid neighbours. This approach is said to be less sensitive to data noise or data imperfections typically present in real datasets.</p><p>• TABU: TABU <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> is an extension of HC that permits the exploration of DAGs that slightly decrease the objective score, in an effort to escape local maxima solutions, and maintains a tabu list containing the most recently visited graphs to prevent the algorithm from returning to a graph that was previously visited. This approach enables TABU to move into new graphical regions that may contain an improved local maximum compared to HC.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, we made use of three structure learning tools, the TETRAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, Bayesys <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, and bnlearn <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, to apply the 14 algorithms described above to our data and obtain graphical structures. Additionally, we utilised Bayesys for model-averaging (described in the next subsection) and converting graphical structures into BN models, which were subsequently analysed using the GeNIe BN software <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. However, structure learning from observational data often leads to a graphical structure known as CPDAG, which contains both directed and undirected edges. The undirected edges in a CPDAG represent relationships for which causal directionality cannot be established from observational data alone and hence, a CPDAG represents a set of DAGs that belong to the same Markov Equivalence Class (MEC). Some constraint-based algorithms may also produce a Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (PDAG) where only v-structures are captured and hence, it contains a higher number of undirected edges than a CPDAG, and a PDAG cannot always be converted into a CPDAG or a DAG structure.</p><p>To manage computational resources efficiently, we imposed a time-limit of four hours on the execution of structure learning. The PC and FCI algorithms, implemented in TETRAD, are the only ones that exceeded this time-limit and so we could not include these algorithms in the results. Additionally, the PC-Stable algorithm, in bnlearn, yielded a PDAG featuring conflicting v-structures and hence, we could not convert its graphical structure into a CPDAG or a DAG. The inability to transform PDAGs into acyclic graphs rendered results derived from PC-Stable unsuitable for evaluation. Therefore, we obtained suitably learnt outputs from 11 out of the 14 algorithms investigated. Moreover, not all the algorithms produce a DAG, which </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Model-averaging</head><p>Because the learnt graph could be highly sensitive to the selection of the structure learning algorithm or domain expert, we also explore the use of a model-averaging approach to consolidate insights from multiple structure learning algorithms. In the context of structure learning, model-averaging aims to obtain a comprehensive portrayal of the underlying causal structure given the data, rather than relying on a single best-performing model as identified by a single algorithm. Therefore, modelaveraging addresses the inherent variations in individual algorithms by mitigating the risk of overfitting, thereby reducing variance in causal estimates and enhancing the overall reliability of the results. We adopted the model-averaging strategy implemented in Bayesys <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, which takes as input multiple input graphical structures of any type, and works as follows: a) Skip an edge if it has already been added as an undirected edge</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Interventional analysis</head><p>We use the GeNIe software <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> that implements Pearl's dooperator, to simulate interventions on variables that could be intervened on, and assess the impact of those interventions with reference to the target variable Diabetes binary. Further to what has been discussed in Introduction, the do-operator was initially developed by Pearl <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> and extended by others like Valorta and Huang <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, Shpitser and Pearl <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, and Tian and Pearl <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. It provides a robust mathematical framework for causal inference by enabling us to simulate hypothetical interventions on a node within the network, and manipulate its distribution to a particular state. When we intervene on node X, for example, we essentially disconnect all the parent nodes of X from affecting it; i.e., the intervened nodes is rendered independent of its causes.</p><p>Consider a scenario with three variables: X, Y, and Z, where X → Y, Z → X and Z → Y. We assert that X = x serves as a cause of Y = y. To denote this causal concept, we perform an intervention on node X within the causal DAG and set it to x, thereby modifying the model to become <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P hypo (Y = y, Z) (X=x) = P(Y = y, Z | do[X = x]) = P(Y = y | Z, X = x)P(do[X = x] | Z)P(Z)</formula><p>where P hypo is simply the probability of hypothetical intervention.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P(Y</head><formula xml:id="formula_1">= y | do[X = x]) -P(Y = y | do[X = x -])</formula><p>is known as the "causal effect difference" or "average causal effect" (ACE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>. If a query Q such as Q = P(y | do(x), z) is presented, the do-operator can systematically determine its identifiability through the above algebraic procedure.</p><p>Consider four disjoint sets of nodes X, Y, Z, and W in a causal DAG G. We can obtain a graph G X by removing all arrows pointing to nodes in X from G, and a graph G X by removing all arrows emerging from nodes in X. To denote the deletion of both incoming and outgoing arrows, we use the notation G XZ . The three rules presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> have universal applicability to all interventional distributions that conform to the structure of graph G [55].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Graphical evaluation</head><p>We use three metrics to compare the similarity between DAG structures obtained by the algorithms, the model-averaging process, and the domain expert. These are: i) Structural Hamming Distance (SHD): SHD is a fundamental metric used to evaluate the structural dissimilarity between two graphs. The SHD score is computed by calculating the count of structural modifications needed to transform a learnt graph into the ground truth, with arc additions, deletions, or reversals. Minimising the SHD score aims for a closer alignment between the two graphical structures, while a higher score indicates greater dissimilarity.</p><p>ii) F1: The F1 score is a widely-used metric that considers the balance between precision and recall in evaluating the accuracy of predicted edges within a graphical structure. It is mathematically expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F1 = 2 • RP R + P<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where R represents the recall, which is the proportion of true positive connections (correctly predicted edges) out of all actual positive connections, P represents precision, which is the ratio of true positive connections (correctly predicted edges) to the total positive connections predicted.</p><p>iii) Balanced Scoring Function (BSF): Unlike the SHD and F1 metrics that solely consider edge presence, the BSF metric takes into account the difficulty of discovering both the presence and absence of edges, to generate a score that is balanced, relative to the difficulty of discovering the presence of an edge. The BSF score is calculated using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">BS F = 0.5 T P a + T N i - FP i - FN a</formula><p>where T P is the number of true positives (correctly identified edges), T N is the number of true negatives (correctly identified absent edges), FP is the number of false positives (incorrectly identified edges that are not present in the ground truth), FN is the number of false negatives (edges that are present in the ground truth but not identified by the model), a is the number of edges in the assumed ground truth, and i is the number of independencies in assumed ground truth calculated using the formula i = |V|(|V|-1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>, where |V| is the number of variables.</p><p>The BSF score has a range from -1 to 1, where a score of -1 corresponds to the worst possible graph (the reverse of the true graph), a score of 1 represents a perfect match between the two graphs, and a score of 0 indicates a graph that has the same score as an empty or a fully connected graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Evaluation and discussion of the results</head><p>We begin the evaluation in subsection 5.1 by investigating inference and predictive validation, and in subsection 5.2 we evaluate the similarities between graphical structures learnt from the data and those obtained through domain knowledge. We then investigate the differences in the effect of intervention produced by some of these structures in subsection 5.3, and perform sensitivity analysis in subsection 5.4. Finally, in subsection 5.5, we undertake a qualitative causal evaluation of the graphical structures. Before we discuss the results, we present the model-averaging graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>, which was produced as described in subsection 4.3. This average graph offers a visual representation of the combined insights from the 11 structure learning algorithms, and it is considered as part of the evaluation in addition to the 11 individual graphical structures learnt by each of the structure learning algorithms considered. Note that the average graph distinguishes itself by the absence of undirected edges, effectively addressing issues related to the directionality commonly associated with PDAGs and CPDAGs. This characteristic enhances the clarity of the graphical representation, contributing to a more refined and conclusive depiction of causal relationships within the model-averaging framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Inference-based evaluation and Predictive validation</head><p>The performance of the learnt CBNs is evaluated using two key metrics: the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Log-Likelihood (LL). BIC plays a crucial role in model selection by balancing model fit with complexity. It penalises models with increased complexity, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting the data. In contrast, LL quantifies the degree to which the model reflects the observed data. More specifically, it measures the probability of observing the given data, assuming the model's underlying structure holds true. Higher LL values indicate a better fit between the model and the data.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> illustrates the performance of various learning algorithms based on their LL and BIC scores. MAHC, FGES, HC, Structural EM and TABU emerge as top performers, achieving a desirable balance between model fit and complexity. H2PC demonstrates LL and BIC scores comparable to top performers. Notably, the model-averaging graph prioritises model balance, achieving a strong BIC score while retaining acceptable LL. IAMB, its variant FastIAMB, and MMHC generate moderate LL and BIC scores. Lastly, GS and the high confidence knowledge graph stand out as outliers due to their exceptionally low BIC and LL scores, relative to the scores produced by the other algorithms.GS, in particular, tends to produce sparse models. A low LL score typically indicates a reduced ability of the model to capture the underlying data complexity. Consequently, this often results in fewer edges, reflecting a simpler structure with potentially less explanatory power. Regarding the knowledge graph, its lower BIC score compared to others is unsurprising, as its primary purpose lies in representing existing knowledge rather than maximising model selection scores.</p><p>we also evaluated the performance of the learnt BN models using 10-fold cross-validation within the GeNIe BN software <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> presents the classification accuracy achieved for predicting the target variable, Diabetes binary, across all models. It is important to note that predictive validation is generally not recommended for models that involve unsupervised learning, such as the causal structures discussed in this paper. This is because they do not optimise with respect to a specific target variable. Therefore, the results presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Our cross-validation analysis reveals that H2PC emerges as the frontrunner, achieving the highest accuracy in predicting unseen data. Closely following are Model-averaging and HC, demonstrating strong performance. However, it is observed that there is no meaningful difference in predictive accuracy across the various models, despite their fundamentally different causal structures. This finding aligns with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> indicating that predictive validation alone is insufficient for uncovering underlying causal distinctions. Instead, these differences can only be revealed through interventional analyses. On the other hand, these predictive results suggest the effectiveness of these models in generalising and making accurate predictions on data not used for training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Graphical structure</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref> plots the SHD score relative to the average of F1 and BSF scores for each graph learnt from data (including the model-average graph) and with reference to the expertproduced knowledge graphs across the three confidence levels. Recall that higher SHD scores indicate lower similarity between graphs, whereas higher F1 and BSF scores indicate higher similarity.</p><p>We investigate the results further by comparing the average SHD and BSF+F1 scores across all algorithms for each confidence level to the corresponding SHD and BSF+F1 scores of the model-average graph. We present these results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">14</ref>. Overall, the results show that the independent algorithms produce an average SHD that is lower than that produced by the model-averaging graph, suggesting a closer alignment with the expert-produced knowledge graphs across the three confidence levels than the model-averaging graph. However, the modelaveraging graph outperforms all 11 independently learnt graphical structures in terms of the F1 and BSF scores, indicating that it better captures the overall balance between precision and recall, as well as the difficulty of identifying both edge presence and absence. This disagreement between the SHD score and the F1 and BSF metrics is documented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, and is attributed to the SHD score being biased towards sparser graphs. Specifically, the SHD score primarily reflects pure classification accuracy, whereas the F1 and BSF metrics encompass partly and fully balanced scores, respectively. This bias also explains why the SHD score undervalues the average graph compared to the F1 and BSF scores, which contains a higher number of edges  compared to most of the independent graphs learnt by the 11 algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Interventional analysis</head><p>We conduct intervention analyses targeting High Blood Pressure (HighBP), High Cholesterol (HighChol), Heart Disease or Heart Attack (HeartDiseaseorAttack), Body Mass Index (BMI), Education level (Education), and Physical Activity (PhysActivity) as the variables for intervention. Our aim is to assess the differences in potential influence of these interventions on diabetes (node called Diabetes binary) and investigate differences across graphical structures.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref> presents a comprehensive analysis of the percentage shift in diabetes resulting from interventions for the specified key variables. Overall, the results highlight important alterations in the likelihood of diabetes following interventions for High Blood Pressure (HighBP), High Cholesterol (High-Chol), Body Mass Index (BMI), General Health (GenHealth), and Physical Activity (PhysActivity). Conversely, interventions targeting Education and HeartDiseaseorAttack exhibit minimal to negligible impact on the likelihood of diabetes across various graphs. The impact of interventions on diabetes, as observed across the majority of individual algorithms, consistently aligned with the patterns outlined in the knowledge graph, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">15</ref>. Notably, the model-averaging graph demonstrated a tendency to converge towards the knowledge graph. Moreover, the impact of interventions appears to be partially linked to the density of graphs. This is explained by denser network facilitating increased propagation of information throughout the graph.</p><p>In addition to investigating the impact of interventions on diabetes, we extend our analysis to examine the effect on other variables. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">16</ref> offers a comprehensive visual depiction of the effects of interventions on various factors across algorithmically learnt, model-averaging, and high-confidence knowledge graphs. Some key observations include:</p><p>1. Intervening on HighBP do(HighBP): A notable impact of intervening on HighBP is observed through its influ-  ence on HighChol, BMI, and HeartDisease. This observed effect remains consistent across various algorithmically learnt graphs, the model-averaging graph, and the high-confidence knowledge graph. The relationship between HighChol and HighBP is complex, with indications of bidirectionality, which led to its absence in the high-confidence knowledge graph. However, given the consistent effects observed in intervening on HighBP, this suggests a potential starting point for further exploration. Another significant relationship emphasised is that between HighBP and HeartDisease. This relationship has been well-documented, as evidenced by the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> which provided compelling evidence endorsing the efficacy of blood pressure reduction in preventing heart disease.  nomic and behavioural factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>. Therefore, the complex and multifaceted nature of this relationship justifies the notably insignificant impact of intervening on education across various health factors. 6. Intervening on GenHealth do(GenHealth): This exhibits a strong impact on HighBP, HighChol, BMI, Heart-Disease, and Education as can be observed consistently across most of the learnt graphs. It highlights the pervasive influence of general health on overall well-being and its interconnectedness with various aspects of health and lifestyle.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Sensitivity Analysis</head><p>Sensitivity analysis examines the responsiveness of a node to changes in its parent and ancestor nodes. High sensitivity implies that small adjustments to the Conditional Probability Table (CPT) parameters strongly impact posterior distributions, partly indicating a stronger dependency. Conversely, low sensitivity suggests that substantial changes to CPT parameters result in weak effects on posterior distributions, partly signifying a weaker dependency. As before, our focus is on the variable of interest Diabetes binary, to gain insights into its sensitivity characteristics across the different graphical structures constructed. We use the GeNIe BN software <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> to perform sensitivity analysis.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">17</ref> illustrates the sensitivity analysis of the target node Diabetes binary considering the graphs derived from domain knowledge (high-confidence), the model-averaging approach, and each of the graphs learnt by the 11 structure learning algorithms. Only relevant fragments of these graphs are presented. Nodes not included in the set of parent and ancestor nodes of the target variable are shaded in grey, while the rest are highlighted in red where a darker red shade indicates stronger sensitivity.</p><p>The diverse outcomes derived from our sensitivity analysis provide insights into the multifaceted nature of the factors influencing Diabetes binary. GS indicates that Diabetes binary exhibits insensitivity to all other nodes. In contrast, algorithms such as H2PC, FGES, HC, TABU, model-averaging, and the high-confidence knowledge graph suggest that Diabetes binary is predominantly sensitive to Age. On the other hand, IAMB, StructuralEM, MAHC, and SaiyanH show that Diabetes binary displays heightened sensitivity to GenHlth. Moreover, H2PC and model-averaging graph indicate sensitivity to both Age and GenHlth, whereas FGES suggests sensitivity to Age and BMI. Based on the results obtained, it can be deduced that diabetes is primarily sensitive to age, a factor that aligns with the existing literature, which emphasises the crucial role of age as a primary risk factor in the development of diabetes. It is widely acknowledged that the incidence of diabetes escalates with progressive age <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>. GenHlth and BMI emerge as additional factors wherein the sensitivity of diabetes becomes apparent. This aligns with existing research emphasising BMI's role as a risk factor for diabetes and its associated complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>. Increased BMI is associated with a higher likelihood of developing diabetes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Causal Relationship evaluation</head><p>We also perform qualitative assessment of the causal connections discovered by the structure learning algorithms. In this part of the evaluation, our attention is directed towards relationships that are clearly understood and are present in the highconfidence knowledge graph, as identified by the domain expert. This qualitative evaluation serves as a crucial step in validating the accuracy and relevance of the learnt causal structures, as well as investigating any strong disagreements between what the structure learning process suggests and what the domain expert indicates.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, the varying shades of red and green are used to highlight whether the graphs produced by the 11 algorithms and the model-averaging graph capture the knowledge-based relationships identified with high confidence by the domain expert. For the average graph, a red colour indicates disagreement and a green colour agreement with the specified knowledge-based edges, whereas different shades of red and greed are used to capture the level of agreement between the knowledge-based edges and the 11 graphs learnt by the different algorithms. Despite noticeable inconsistencies in learnt structures between algorithms, Table <ref type="table">4</ref> demonstrates that structure learning algorithms have generally performed well in identifying many of the relationships provided in the high-confidence knowledge graph.</p><p>The model-averaging graph aligns in 20 out of 37 edges with the high-confidence knowledge graph, and differs in the remain- ing 17 edges. This finding suggests that certain relationships are consistently predicted across different algorithms, while others show varying predictions. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting the appropriate algorithm for each specific study, as different algorithms may capture different aspects of the relationships between variables. In our investigation, we operate under the assumption of an equal contribution from each structure learning algorithm to compose the average graph. However, considering a weighted average that prioritises edges learnt by algorithms acknowledged for their heightened accuracy could be advantageous. Moreover, the coexistence of agreement and disagreement in the model-averaging graph indicates that the relationships between the variables might be difficult to measure and involve complex interactions.</p><p>There are several areas of disagreement, particularly with regard to the relationships between sex and diabetes, age and physical activity, physical activity and diabetes, physical health and high blood pressure. While it is reasonable to assume that the lack of a direct relationship between sex and diabetes in the results may be attributed to the fact that sex influences complex biological processes within the human body, such as hormonal variations, genetic predispositions, and metabolic differences, which could potentially serve as the driving factors behind diabetes risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>, the dataset does not explicitly include these biological variables. As a result, the structure learning algorithms may fail to detect a direct relationship between sex and diabetes. The literature supports the notion that sex differences in metabolic regulation and diabetes susceptibility are influenced by both biological and psychosocial factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>.</p><p>The influence of age on physical activity is well-documented in existing research. As people age, they typically experience a reduction in physical activity, muscle mass, and muscle strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref> emphasises the importance of physical activity for individuals with diabetes, and the American Diabetes Association's <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref> statement highlights that physical activity improves blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes and improves overall well-being. The absence of a direct causal link between the above variables could be explained by bidirectional influences, given the complex interactions within the context of these relationships. This means that we may need to consider multiple other factors in order to fully comprehend the underlying causal relationship between some of the variables considered in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This study investigated the discovery of causal graphical structures and the construction of CBNs from data on diabetes collated from BRFSS, which is a system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data on risk behaviours, chronic health conditions, and use of preventative treatments amongst U.S. residents. This study contributes to the development and evaluation of CBNs for diabetes in different ways: To promote future research and collaboration, we make all the learnt graphs, the average graph, the three knowledge graphs, the CBN models of the average graph and the highconfidence knowledge graph, as well as the pre-processed dataset, publicly accessible through the Bayesys repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>.</p><p>The results highlight that the inferred causal structure is highly sensitive to the selection of the structure learning algo- rithm, which motivated our exploration of a model-averaging strategy to derive a representative graph from the diverse algorithmic outputs. Notably, our findings indicate that the modelaveraged graph converged closer to the high-confidence knowledge graph, compared to the individual graphs learnt by the different algorithms. Although model-averaging is found to effectively address variability between algorithms, it is crucial to acknowledge that the resultant average graph still exhibits notable distinctions compared to the knowledge graph, and this level of disagreement requires further investigation.</p><p>In our exploration of the effects of hypothetical interventions on diabetes, we find that risk factors related to blood pressure, high cholesterol, BMI, general health, and physical activity, display a remarkable degree of similarity across the majority of the algorithms used in our study and show a parallel pattern of similarity in the high-confidence knowledge graph. Importantly, these observations align with the existing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref> which highlights the role of these factors in diabetes. These experiments also emphasise the important influence of these variables on the likelihood of diabetes, reinforcing their significance in line with established scientific knowledge.</p><p>However, the results also highlight many inconsistencies between causal structures learnt from data and elicited from domain knowledge, and many inconsistencies extend between algorithms. For example, the sensitivity analysis conducted on diabetes across diverse graphical structures highlights the complexity of the factors influencing the development of diabetes, and while certain algorithms suggest heightened sensitivity to variables, such as Age, GenHlth and BMI, others indicate insensitivity. Therefore, while our findings mark a significant step in unravelling the complex set of relationships between risk factors and diabetes, it is imperative to recognise that further work is required to refine the accuracy of the inferred causal relationships.</p><p>The identification of causal pathways linking various variables to potential causes of diabetes through learnt graphs not only enables early detection but also plays a pivotal role in implementing effective preventive measures, significantly reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with diabetes. However, a key limitation and area for future research is that the traditional causal discovery methods for constructing CBNs neglect the temporal dimension, such as distribu- tion shifts and time-varying causal structure, thereby limiting our capacity to accurately identify causal relationships between variables over time. This prevented the incorporation of suggestions from domain experts about evolving connections between diabetes and general health or diabetes and physical health into the knowledge graph, owing to concerns about introducing cyclicity. This limitation is particularly significant in healthcare data, where temporal information is essential for comprehending the dynamic nature of health conditions from longitudinal healthcare databases that capture individuals' health trajectories over time, which offer a valuable resource for discovering and modelling causal relationships.</p><p>Several limitations related to the data warrant consideration in this study. Notably, the BRFSS data lacks a clear distinction between Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), prompting the exploration of potential insights derived from segregating these cohorts. Investigating whether the identified risk factors exhibit consistency across these subtypes could enhance our understanding of diabetes etiology. Additionally, the absence of explicit information on medication usage is a notable limitation. Although the survey inquires about medication for blood pressure control, the potential influence of specific medications on observed connections between certain nodes (e.g., high blood pressure and cholesterol) remains unexplored. The variable of medication, however, has not been incorporated into the present study, signaling a gap in our analysis that could be addressed in future research endeavors.</p></div>

The relationship between HighChol and HeartDisease is welldocumented in the literature. The findings align with exist-ing clinical knowledge and guidelines related to the management of high cholesterol and its implications for the prevention and management of heart disease [59]. 3. Intervening on BMI do(BMI): This results in a significant effect on HeartDisease and HighBP. Research has consistently shown that an elevated BMI is associated with an increased risk of developing heart disease and experiencing adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Several studies and scientific statements from reputable sources, including the American Heart Association (AHA) [60] and the British Heart Foundation (BHF) [61], have highlighted the strong relation between BMI and HeartDisease. 4. Intervening on HeartDisease do(HeartDisease): This appears to have a minimal impact on various factors, as evident from the figure. 5. Intervening on Education do(Education): The impact of intervening on Education is notably insignificant across various health factors, as depicted in the figure. Existing research indicates that the influence of education on health is intricate and interwoven with various socioeco-</figDesc></figure>
