<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The interventions aimed at improving the levels of physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents diagnosed with heart disease did not produce the expected outcomes. Safe participation in sport activities proposed based on actual recommendations could be a solution to promote PA in this population. The aims of this study were to discover a causal diagram of sport participation in children and youth with heart disease and establish the factors that affect and are affected thereof through the use of questionnaires. Furthermore, the study aims to qualitatively assess the reliability of the constructed diagram in comparison with existing medical knowledge. The Greedy Fast Causal Inference method was employed to conduct a data-driven search of the directed acyclic graph that represents the causal relationships within the provided observational data. This causal discovery was performed using the Tetrad software. The analysis involved a cohort of 121 Caucasian patients (50 females) diagnosed with heart disease. The age range of the patients included in the study was 8-17 years. The study findings indicate that the participants engaged in sports presented significantly higher values of health-related quality of life (QoL) and motives for participating in physical and leisure activities. Age appears to be a cause of sport participation. Sport participation appears to be a cause of participation in physical education classes, which in turn appears to be a cause of higher enjoyment. Higher enjoyment appears to be a cause of other motives for participating in physical and leisure activities, as well as a higher score in terms of physical health. The causal diagram provided a graphical representation of the causal relationship between sport participation and better QoL with potential confounders for children and adolescents with heart disease that nearly coincided with the existing literature. Clinical trials should be designed to validate clinical utility of the presented causal diagram.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the recommendations for physical activity (PA), recreational sport, and exercise training in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (ConHD) were published a decade ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, a number of studies have assessed the PA level and the reported associations between higher PA levels and better health-related outcomes in this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Interestingly, discrepant results exist regarding the differences in PA level between children with ConHD and healthy peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>. The authors of a review on PA modification in youth with ConHD published in 2021 presented that 50% of the analyzed studies showed a lack of significant differences in PA levels between patients and age-matched healthy peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Comparable PA levels of children with ConHD to normal children, however, higher than previously reported by others, were recently observed by authors from Belgium, who speculated that this could be attributed to their policy of motivating and encouraging children to participate in sports <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>. Indeed, sport is one of the best investments for promoting PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>, as it provides medical and psychosocial benefits for children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12)</ref>. Sport participation could be a solution to promote PA in children and youth with ConHD as interventions aimed at improving PA levels in this population did not produce the expected outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>. Nevertheless, despite the existence of published evidence-and practice-based guidelines for pediatric cardiac rehabilitation programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>, as well as recommendations for exercise (18) and examination procedures that aim to ensure safe participation in sports for each individual with ConHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, and positive consequences of sports participation in this group <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, recent studies continue to report instances where patients experience a lack of PA promotion and/or restriction on sport participation by physicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30)</ref>. In addition, parental overprotection, children's low self-efficacy and fear to exercise, lack of adequate information on PA clearance of the physical education teachers are listed as factors that limit sport participation in youth with ConHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31)</ref>.</p><p>Reviewing the barriers and facilitators contributing to children sports participation is important <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33)</ref>, so that healthcare providers and parents may be able to enhance and promote sport activities in children with ConHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(36)</ref>. Therefore, we aim to evaluate relationships (particularly in the causal sense) that can be discovered from the questionnaire responses regarding various factors. This can be accomplished using data-driven causal discovery methods, which are intended to search the causal structure [so-called directed causal diagrams, directed acyclic graph (DAG)] from observational data <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38)</ref>. The aims of this pilot study are to discover a causal diagram of sport participation in children and adolescents with heart disease and establish the factors that affect and are affected thereof through the use of questionnaires (treated as observational data). Furthermore, the study aims to qualitatively assess the reliability of the constructed diagram in comparison with existing medical knowledge (addressed in the Discussion).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study design and population</head><p>The present study is reported in accordance with STROBE guidelines (39). The observational prospective study was conducted from January 2022 to January 2023. The study included a cohort of 121 patients, aged from 8 to 18 years, who voluntarily participated in the study during their routine pediatric follow-up visit. The study eliminated children with (a) impairments that hindered their ability to understand and/or respond to the items in the questionnaires, (b) non-cardiac diseases that prevented them from sport participation, and (c) without confirmed diagnosis. All the interviewed children completed the questionnaires under the supervision of one parent or legal guardian. This study is a part of the research project on assessment of determinants of PA levels in pediatric patients with heart disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Questionnaire</head><p>The team prepared a questionnaire consisting of closedended questions pertaining to demographic data (age, sex, place of residence, number of siblings), clinical cardiac diagnosis (ConHD, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis), sport participation status of the patient (actual and before diagnosis with additional information such as type, duration, and frequency of the sport and duration of training session), patient's additional activities with potential influence on participation in sport activities (transport to school, participation in domestic chores, physical education classes, out-of-school additional activities, and spending free time: preferred place and companionship), parental education and sport participation status, and sleep disturbances. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents all the data that were collected using the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Core Scales</head><p>The Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using a Polish version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL TM ) Generic Core Scales questionnairea self-report version for children <ref type="bibr">(8-12 years</ref>) and adolescents <ref type="bibr">(13-18 years)</ref>. The questionnaire consists of 23 items in four scales that assess the physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. The items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 "Never a problem" to 5 "Almost always a problem." The participants were asked how much of a problem each item has been during the past month. A higher score represented a better HRQoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(40)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Physical Activity and Leisure Motivation Scale-Youth</head><p>The Physical Activity and Leisure Motivation Scale-Youth (PALMS-Y) consists of 28 items with seven subscales (mastery, enjoyment, psychological condition, physical condition, appearance, affiliation, and competition/ego) measuring different types of motives for participating in physical and leisure activities. Each subscale consists of four items. The response format for all of the items is a 5-point Likert scale rated from 1 "Strongly disagree" to 5 "Strongly agree," higher scores reflect the participant's experience of a higher level of that motive for participating in physical and leisure activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(41)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistics</head><p>The data-driven search of the DAG (causal discovery) was performed using the Greedy Fast Causal Inference (GFCI) technique for continuous variables. The GFCI approach is a combination of and improvement upon two algorithms:</p><p>• Fast Causal Inference (FCI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(42)</ref>, which begins with a complete undirected graph. • Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (FGES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(43)</ref>, which starts with an empty graph, and adds iteratively needed edges, and then eliminates unnecessary ones in a graph.</p><p>The GFCI method uses the latter one (FGES) to find a "supergraph" (the skeleton of connections), and then the former (FCI) is utilized to prune the "supergraph" to find the final orientations (44).</p><p>This method can assess whether the relation is direct and whether there are any latent confounders between the two variables being analyzed.</p><p>The whole analysis was performed using Tetrad 6.5.3 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(45)</ref>. The input data were the table with rows corresponding to the study participants and columns with various variables recorded from the questionnaire (as listed in subsequent lines in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). All variables were stored as numeric values (so that the technique for continuous variable can be utilized), and the table was prepared in a way that no information regarding the column names and their respective meanings was provided for the analysis, and the order of the data columns and rows did not play any role.</p><p>Then, we used default settings for the GFCI method:</p><p>• Cutoff for p-value (0.01).</p><p>• Penalty discount (2).</p><p>• Faithfulness assumed.</p><p>• Unlimited length for any discriminating path.</p><p>• The complete FCI rule set was not used.</p><p>• No bootstraps.</p><p>• Ensemble method: highest.</p><p>As a result, the output graph was created, and hidden column names were back uncovered in order to produce Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the data distribution for normality. The U-Mann-Whitney non-parametric test was utilized to compare the medians of the two groups (unpaired case). The χ 2 test was used to compare the frequencies between groups. The level of statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 (STATISTICA 13, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>There were 121 completed questionnaires received from Caucasian patients (n = 50 females) diagnosed with heart disease with a median age of 13 years (range: 8-17). The descriptive statistics of all data that were collected from the questionnaires are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the PedsQL and PALMS scores. There were 56 (46%) sport participants and 65 (54%) nonsport participants. A total of 22 (18%) patients had stopped their participation in sport due to their diagnosis. Among the groups of sport participants and non-sport participants, there were five and 25 patients, respectively, who had medical exemptions from participating in physical education classes.</p><p>The study found that sport participants had a higher proportion of boys (p &lt; 0.05) and children who engaged in sports prior to diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), who participated in physical education classes (p &lt; 0.001), with a lower number of nights with sleep disturbances (p &lt; 0.05), and parents that participated in sport activities (p &lt; 0.05) than the non-sport participants. Sport participants practiced endurance sports (n = 45), strength and power sports (n = 4), and mixed sports (n = 7). They practiced a sport with a median of three times per week (range: 1-7). In addition, the median duration of one training session was 60 min (range: 30-240). The reasons for participation in sport were as follows: because I like it/it is my passion (n = 41), to take care of the health and body (n = 29), to spend time with friends (n = 26), to relieve emotions or stress (n = 16), to spend time with parents (n = 12), and because my parents encourage me (n = 2).</p><p>Sport participants presented significantly higher values of HRQoL in total score, physical health, psychosocial health, and emotional functioning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this pilot study, the idea was to discover the causal diagram of factors that may affect and be affected by sport participation in children and adolescents with heart disease and to assess the reliability of the diagram by comparing it with the existing literature. Based on the diagram, sport participation appears to be a cause of participation in physical education classes, and this practice appears to be a cause of higher enjoyment. Higher patients' enjoyment appears to be a cause of other motives for participating in physical and leisure activities, as well as a higher physical health score. Importantly, emotional functioning appears to be a cause of sleep disturbances. Among the analyzed variables, only age appears to be a cause of sport participation, however, with unmeasured confounder(s). It is worth mentioning that other factors that may influence on the likelihood of sport participation in pediatric patients with heart disease such as sex, diagnosis, or parents' sport participation status were found to be causally unrelated with the sport participation status of the patients. The heterogeneity of the group may have impacted these results.</p><p>The GFCI method employed in our study successfully identified a graph of sport participation in pediatric patients with heart disease that nearly coincided with the existing literature. There are several original studies on sport participation in pediatric patients with ConHD, mostly assessing its association with QoL. The correlation between beliefs in self-efficacy and involvement in sport and PA was shown to be stronger in adolescents than the severity of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(46)</ref>. Higher self-efficacy, male gender, and participation in physical education classes were associated with a higher likelihood of engagement in PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref>. Patients who exercised more often (school classes or fitness centers) were more likely to participate in leisure or competitive sports <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Participation in sports was associated with improved exercise capacity, emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing, and generally with a higher QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">48)</ref>. An improvement in health status has been observed after a 3-day multi-sports camp <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(49)</ref>. Participating in recreational sport encouraged patients to be more intrinsically motivated to engage in PA-patients emphasized their enjoyment of PA as a primary source of motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. The findings from existing literature suggest the occurrence of closed-loop interaction between higher self-efficacy and/or higher intrinsic motivation and higher involvement in sport and PA in pediatric patients with ConHD. Understanding the patient's motivation for PA or sport can be helpful to a clinician or a physical therapist in order to stimulate participation in PA and/or identify suitable forms of activity. To assess an individual's goal-oriented motivation, the Physical Activity and Leisure Motivation Scale was developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(41)</ref>. The scale measures eight types of motivation-enjoyment and mastery factors, significantly higher in group of sport participants in our study, can be considered as intrinsic motivation, while the other six factors describe extrinsic motivation based on the selfdetermination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(50)</ref>.</p><p>There is an urgent need for global action aimed at decreasing levels of insufficient activity in both healthy children and pediatric patients with chronic conditions and disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(51)</ref>. Proposed interventions aimed at improving PA levels in children and youth with ConHD did not produce the expected outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>. Learning causal diagram discovered a priori with longitudinal data providing extensive prior knowledge may be a helpful technique in establishing the kind and dose of sport activities as a potential solution for promoting PA in this population.</p><p>Causal diagrams based on observational data have been utilized in Alzheimer's pathophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(52)</ref>. The authors constructed a "gold-standard" causal structure graph based on the existing literature. Then, they applied three algorithms to discover this causal structure from observational data. FGES, the method used in the presented study, managed to (almost perfectly) recover the "gold-standard" graph. In addition, the authors provided a detailed guideline on how causal discovery algorithm can be applied to discover high-quality causal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(52)</ref>. Recently (2023), Huie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(53)</ref> discussed chronic low back pain as a "Big Data" problem and identified how data-driven method that uses artificial intelligence and high dimensional datasets (constraint-based: FCI and score-based: FGES algorithms) to identify causal structures may help better understand causal factors for low back pain, guide clinical practice, and improve outcomes.</p><p>The causal diagram was presented as solely the data-driven output of the GFCI method, without supplementing it with any specific medical knowledge or experience-based intuition. It seemed that some relations had not been "detected" by a method (we were aware of such a possibility prospectively), even if simple comparisons (presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are found as significant. Perhaps, these relationships may be further emphasized with a similar analysis conducted on a larger population. As with all studies, there are a number of limitations to consider. These include the limited dataset used for identifying DAG (no sensitivity analysis could be conducted), heterogeneity of a small study group, and the failure to differentiate between different types of sports, i.e., competitive or recreational/leisure. The inclusion of participants across a wide age range in the study group should be also considered as a study limitation-drop out from sports is increasing with increasing age during childhood and adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(54)</ref>. The directed edges in the discovered DAG are being interpreted causally. Accordingly, the edge Age → Sport participation status in the graph can be interpreted as age causally influences the sport participation status in pediatric patients with heart disease. The results of the direct comparison showed that sport participants were younger; however, as this relation is not separated in the DAG, it does not inform regarding the extent to which a change in age would causally affect sport participation status.</p><p>One advantage of conducting this pilot study is that it will pave the way for future research involving a larger population of pediatric patients with heart disease and will include more factors that have the potential to affect and/or might be a consequence of sport participation, such as PA level, obesity status, cardio-respiratory function, health-related physical fitness, cardiac module of PedsQL, and parental support. Then the objective would be to: (i) identify the appropriate set of variables to minimize bias due to potential confounding associations and (ii) to generate hypotheses to be tested (as interventions in the causal sense) in future trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, causal diagram provided a graphical representation of the causal relationship between sport participation and better QoL with potential confounders for children and adolescents with heart disease that nearly coincided with the existing knowledge. However, it is important to exercise caution in interpreting these findings, as there are certain limitations that have been mentioned. Clinical trials should be designed to validate the clinical utility of the presented causal diagram. The optimal dose of PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(55)</ref> and promotion strategies still remain a challenge. Pediatric cardiologists should propose appropriate sport activities for children and adolescents with heart disease as a strategy for promoting active lifestyles to improve QoL.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>3.0-20.0) 15.0 (0.0-20.0) 0.275 Psychological condition 10.0 (4.0-15.0) 9.0 (0.0-15.0) 0.018 Appearance 11.5 (0.0-15.0) 11.0 (0.0-15.0) 0.419 Other's expectations 5.0 (0.0-15.0) 5.0 (3.0-10.0) 0.150 Enjoyment 13.0 (3.0-15.0) 11.0 (0.0-15.0) &lt;0.001 Competition/ego 8.0 (0.0-15.0) 7.0 (0.0-14.0) 0.001 Gąsior et al. 10.3389/fcvm.2023.1247122</figDesc></figure>
