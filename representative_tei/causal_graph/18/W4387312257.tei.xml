<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Statistical methods are essential in epidemiology research, but they can generate erroneous estimates when selecting variables based only on statistical criteria. The use of directed acyclic graphs (DAG) helps to understand the causal relationships between variables and to avoid biases.</p><p>Objective: Compare the estimate of the effect of skin color on heart attack obtained from two data analysis techniques: a stepwise approach based on statistical criteria and a graphical approach based on causal criteria. Methods: Population-based cross-sectional study using data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II). The exposure variable was skin color (black or non-black) and the outcome was heart attack (yes or no). To identify the association between the variables, multivariate logistic regressions were carried out using the stepwise technique and the DAG-based approach. In the stepwise technique, all variables potentially related to the outcome were included in the model and a forward or backward algorithm was used. In the DAG-based approach, different possible causal models were developed between the variables, identifying confounding, mediation, and collision factors. The models were created considering self-rated health as a confounding or collider variable, and the modeling results were veri ed.</p><p>Results: A total of 10.351 adults were evaluated, the majority female (52.1%), aged 20 to 39 years (48.5%), and with non-black skin color (90.4%). The prevalence of heart attack was 3.0%, and 45% rated their health as good, fair or poor. Using different modeling techniques, no association was found between skin color and heart attack (p&gt;0.05), except when self-rated health, a collider variable, was included in the models. In this case, there was an inverse and biased association between the two variables, indicating a collision bias (stepwise-backward-OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.33-0.70; stepwise-forward-OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.44-0.94). Conclusion: Skin color was not associated with heart attack when controlling for appropriate confounding factors. However, when adjusting for self-rated health, a colliding variable, there was an inverse and distorted association between the two variables, indicating a collider bias. The DAG-based approach can avoid this bias by correctly identifying confounding factors and colliders.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Epidemiology is a science that seeks to understand the determinants and consequences of phenomena related to health and disease in human populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rouquayrol;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Goldbaum;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Santana, 2013)</ref>. This science uses quantitative methods to measure and compare frequencies, distributions, and associations between exposure factors and outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Brachman, 1996)</ref>. A relevant challenge in epidemiology is to settle causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes to identify whether an explanatory variable can produce a change in the response variable, regardless of other variables that may interfere with this relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ananth;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Schisterman, 2017)</ref>. To overcome this challenge, appropriate data analysis techniques should include possible confounding factors, effect modi cation, and mediation.</p><p>One of the main techniques for epidemiological data analysis is variable selection through stepwise algorithms, which consist of adding or excluding the variable from the statistical model based on prede ned criteria, such as the level of signi cance or the determination coe cient <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hernán et al., 2002)</ref>. This technique is widely used in statistical software and has the advantage of simplifying the modeltting process (Prieto-Merino; Pocock, 2012). However, has some limitations, such as sample data dependence, instability of results, statistical tests violation of assumptions, and introduction of bias in estimating the causal effect (Prieto-Merino; Pocock, 2012). For these reasons, some authors have criticized the indiscriminate use of the stepwise technique in epidemiological research, as it could lead to erroneous or misleading attempts about the causal relationships between variables (Digitale; Martin; Glymour, 2022).</p><p>The directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an alternative to the stepwise technique. DAGs consist of visual representations of causal relationships between variables based on causal theory and the researcher's prior knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Greenland;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Pearl;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Robins, 1999)</ref>. Thus, DAGs can be used to identify which variables should be added or excluded from the statistical model, considering possible confounding factors, effect modi cation, mediation, and collision <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ananth;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Schisterman, 2017)</ref>. This approach makes the researcher's causal hypotheses explicit, facilitating the communication of results and avoiding bias in estimating the causal effect (Greenland; Pearl; Robins, 1999; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hernán et al., 2002)</ref>. Some authors have indicated the use of DAGs in epidemiological research because they can help in the preparation and evaluation of studies, in addition to the interpretation and synthesis of ndings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Suttorp et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Digitale;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Martin;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Glymour, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the advantages of DAGs over the stepwise technique and other statistical models, few studies compare the results obtained with both approaches, showing the differences and implications for estimating the causal effect (Heinze; Wallisch; Dunkler, 2018). An example of a research question that can be addressed with both techniques is the relationship between skin color and heart attack. Skin color re ects racial inequalities in society and can be associated with several health outcomes (Dressler; Oths; Gravlee, 2005), such as heart attacks, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Roth et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Vos et al., 2020)</ref>. However, the relationship between skin color and heart attack can be in uenced by other variables, such as self-rated health, which can be a confounding factor, effect modi cation, mediation, or collision, depending on the causal model adopted. Then, this question can be answered, for example, using the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II).</p><p>The NHANES II is a national health and nutrition survey conducted in the United States (US) between 1976 and 1980, which collected information on several sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral variables from a representative sample of the adult population (NCHS, 2023).</p><p>The general objective of this study is to compare the results based on statistical criteria (stepwise) with results based on causality criteria (DAG) in estimating the causal effect of skin color on heart attack, using data from NHANES II. The speci c objectives are: 1) Estimate the association between skin color and heart attack using the stepwise technique, considering several variables potentially related to the outcome; 2) Estimate the association between skin color and heart attack using the DAGs-based approach, considering different possible causal models; 3) Compare the results obtained with the two approaches, analyzing the differences between the causal effect estimates and the variables selected for the adjustment of the model; 4) Discuss the advantages and limitations of both approaches and their implications for epidemiological research.</p><p>We hypothesized that the stepwise technique introduces a bias in the causal effect estimation of skin color on heart attack when adjusting for a colliding variable, such as self-rated health. It is expected that the DAGs approach is more adequate to identify the confounding factors, modi ed effect, mediation, and collision, avoiding the bias in the belief of the causal effect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>This is an observational, cross-sectional, and analytical study conducted with publicly available data from the 1976-1980 NHANES II, a unique source of national data on the health and nutritional status of the US population, aiming to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors for diseases.</p><p>The methods and data collection procedure behind NHANES are described in detail elsewhere (NCHS, 2023).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population or sample studied</head><p>The NHANES II sample was composed of 27,801 individuals from 6 months to 74 years of age, being that 25,286 were interviewed and 20,322 were examined, resulting in an overall response rate of 73.0% (NCHS,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2023).</head><p>Participants who had complete information on the variables of interest were included in this study: skin color, heart attack, self-rated health, sex, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and geographic location. Participants who were younger than 18 years old or older than 74 years old, who had a physical or mental disability that prevented data collection, or who had a medical condition that could interfere with the results were excluded. The nal sample of this study consisted of 10,351 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome variable</head><p>The outcome variable was a heart attack, measured using the following question: "Has a doctor ever told you that you had a heart attack?". The answer options were: yes <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> or no <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(0)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure variable</head><p>The exposure variable was skin color, and the answer options were: white (1), black <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>, or other <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. For analysis purposes, the variable was dichotomized into black <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> or non-black (0), the latter being the reference category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariates</head><p>Variables potentially related to the outcome were: sex (male or female), age (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and ≥ 70 years), location (urban or rural), diabetes (no or yes), BMI, self-rated health, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and high blood pressure. Self-rated health was assessed using the question: "Would you say your health in general is?" Responses included ve categories: excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. For this study, the responses were re-categorized as excellent/very good (reference category), good (moderate), and fair/poor based on other studies other studies that analyzed self-rated health (Brett O'Hara &amp; Kyle Caswell, 2010; White, Philogene, Fine, &amp; Sinha, 2009). BMI was evaluated as a continuous variable, calculated as the ratio between weight in kilograms and the square of height in meters. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured using a sphygmomanometer and expressed in millimeters of mercury, and high blood pressure was classi ed when systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>To analyze the data using Stata software version 16.0. The NHANES II database was downloaded from Stata using the 'webuse nhanes2' command. The sampling plan was then checked using the 'svydescribe' command, which con rmed that the ' nalwgt' variable was the sampling weight, the 'strata' variable was the stratum and the 'psu' variable was the primary sampling unit. All statistical analyses were performed considering a 5% signi cance level and adopting procedures for studies with complex methodologies (cluster sampling and multiple stages). We incorporated the pre x 'svy' (survey commands) into the syntax, which considers the effects of strati cation and clustering derived from the complex sampling design, along with the sample weighting, to expand the results to the population evaluated.</p><p>The descriptive analyses included absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables and measures of central tendency and dispersion for continuous variables. For the categorical, the data was tabulated using the following command: 'svy: tabulate variable_category variable_outcome, ci col', which produced a table with the absolute and relative frequencies, 95% con dence intervals (95%CI), and Pearson's chi-squared tests for each category. For the continuous variables, the data was tabulated using the following command: 'svy: mean continuous_variable, over (outcome_variable)' and 'regress continuous_variable, outcome_variable', which produced a table with the means, 95%CI, and the test for statistical signi cance.</p><p>For the multivariate analyses, two approaches were used: the stepwise technique and the DAG-based approach. The stepwise technique is a method that uses prede ned criteria to select the variables that remain in the statistical model. In this study, two algorithms were used: forward and backward. In the forward algorithm, the empty model does not contain any variables, and the inclusion of each variable potentially related to the outcome is tested, using the p-value as the model t criterion. The variable (if any) with the lowest p-value of less than 0.05 is included in the model and the process continues until no other variable reaches this level of signi cance. In the backward algorithm, the initial model contains all the variables potentially related to the outcome that had a p-value of less than 0.20 in the univariate analysis. These variables are tested for removal from the model, using the p-value as the model t criterion. The variable (if any) with the highest p-value and which is greater than 0.05 is removed from the model and the process is repeated until all the remaining variables have a p-value of less than 0.05.</p><p>The DAG-based approach is a method that uses causal criteria to select the variables that remain in the statistical model. In this study, different possible causal models between the variables were constructed using DAGitty software version 3.0. To do this, causal connections represented by arrows were established between the variables. Each variable in the DAG was represented with a rectangle, and each color had a different meaning: green, exposure variable; blue, outcome variable; light red, potential confounding variables; white, colliding variable (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). To avoid spurious associations and unnecessary adjustments, the backdoor criterion was adopted to select the minimum set of confounding variables. A set of variables is considered su cient for confounding control if the variables contained block all non-causal paths linking exposure to the outcome. In addition, the set must be minimal, as the inclusion of unnecessary variables not only has a risk of causing collision bias but also contributes to reducing the accuracy of the estimates.</p><p>To design the DAG and select the path between the explanatory variable (skin color), the outcome (heart attack), and the probable collider (self-rated health), a portfolio with the Hill criteria was made to support the path of analysis, available in the Supplementary Material (Appendices 1, 2, and 3). The Hill criteria are a set of nine aspects that can be used to assess the strength of evidence of a causal relationship between two variables. These aspects are the strength of association, consistency, speci city, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experimental evidence, and analogy. These criteria were applied to verify the path of 1) Skin color to Heart attack; 2) Heart attack to Self-rated health and; 3) Skin color to self-rated health. Then, we can check which scenario is more realistic. It was found that self-rated health can be a mediator or a collider between skin color and heart attack.</p><p>After that, in the multivariate analyses, seven logistic regression models were performed using two approaches: the stepwise technique and the DAG-based approach. The seven models were: Model 1: univariate, without adjusting for any variable: 'svy: logistic heartattack i.black'. Model 2: stepwise backward, without considering the colliding variable (self-rated health), adjusted for location, diabetes, and blood pressure: 'svy: logistic heartattack i.black i.rural i.diabetes i.highbp, Model 3: stepwise forward, without considering the colliding variable (self-rated health), adjusted for sex, age, diabetes, and BMI: 'svy: logistic heartattack i.black i.sex i.age i.diabetes c.bmi'. Model 4: based on DAG, for the total effect of skin color on heart attack, without adjusting for any variable, as there was no spurious path opened by the backdoor criterion: 'svy: logistic heartattack i.black'. Model 5: based on DAG, for the direct effect of skin color on heart attack, adjusted for mediators (blood pressure, BMI, diabetes, and location): 'svy: logistic heartattack i.black i.highbp c.bmi i.diabetes i.rural.' Model 6: stepwise backward, considering the collider variable (self-rated health), adjusted for self-rated health and blood pressure: 'svy: logistic heartattack i.black i.hlthstat i.highbp'. Model 7: stepwise forward, considering the collider variable (self-rated health), adjusted for self-rated health, sex, and age: 'svy: logistic heartattack i.black i.hlthstat i.sex i.age'.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of the participants</head><p>This study included 10,351 participants, the majority female (52.1%), aged between 20 and 39 years (48.5%), with non-black skin color (90.4%), and living in rural areas (68.3%). Regarding health conditions, 36.9% had high blood pressure, 3.0% had a heart attack, the prevalence of diabetes was 3.4%, and the average BMI was 25.3 kg/m 2 . Concerning self-rated health, 27.5% reported excellent or very good health, 28% good health, 12.3% fair health, and 4.7% poor health (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Table 1 also shows the association between the covariates and explanatory variable (skin color) and the outcome (heart attack). It was found that black individuals lived more in rural areas and had a higher frequency of diabetes, high blood pressure, and higher BMI than non-black individuals (p &lt; 0.05). About heart attacks, it was found that older men who lived in urban areas and who had diabetes, high BMI, and high blood pressure had a higher prevalence of heart attacks.</p><p>In addition, black individuals were less likely to rate their health as excellent or very good. Similarly, individuals who rated their health as good, fair, or poor had a higher prevalence of heart attacks than individuals who rated their health as very good or excellent (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association between skin color and heart attack</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the association between skin color and heart attack. Different modeling techniques were used to select the confounding factors: univariate, stepwise backward or forward, and DAG-based. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the results of the seven models tested.</p><p>In models 1 to 5, there was no signi cant association between skin color and heart attack (p&gt;0.05). These models were adjusted by different sets of variables, but none of them included self-rated health, which was considered a colliding variable. In models 6 and 7, from a stepwise backward (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.33-0.70) and forward (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.44-0.94) selection approach, which included self-rated health as a confounding factor, there was a signi cant inverse association between skin color and heart attack, indicating that black individuals were less likely to have a heart attack than non-black individuals. However, this association was distorted by the presence of the collider variable, which introduced a collision bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The results of the present study showed a signi cant difference between the two approaches (stepwise e DAG) in estimating the causal effect of skin color on heart attack. In the stepwise technique, considering the collider variable (self-rated health), skin color was associated with a heart attack, indicating that black people had fewer chances of having a heart attack than non-black people. In the DAG-based approach, with no collider bias, skin color was not associated with a heart attack, evidencing no difference in the chance of having a heart attack between black and non-black people. The difference between the two approaches is that the stepwise technique, adjusted for a colliding variable (self-rated health), introduced a bias in the estimation of the causal effect. The DAG-based approach avoided this bias by correctly identifying the confounding factors and not adjusting for the collider.</p><p>The evaluation of the methods used in this study reveals some advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of the stepwise technique is that it is simple and easy to apply, as it uses prede ned criteria to select the variables that remain in the statistical model. The disadvantage of the stepwise technique is that it can introduce a bias in the causal effect estimation by adjusting for variables that are not confounding factors but rather colliders or mediators (Hernán; Hernández-Díaz; Robins, 2004). Regarding the DAG approach, in addition to being a technique used to identify and select confounding variables, the DAG makes explicit the a priori hypotheses about the causal relationships between the variables being studied since it is based on causal theory and the researcher's prior knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Schipf et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Werneck, 2016)</ref>. The disadvantage of the DAG-based approach is that it depends on the quality and availability of the data, as well as the researcher's ability to build and test possible causal models (Law; Green; Ellison, 2012).</p><p>Understanding a particular health-disease process, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a challenge, as it is usually the result of a complex interaction between genetic, individual, sociocultural, economic, environmental, and behavioral factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Patwardhan;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mutalik;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tillu, 2015)</ref>. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of disease burden in the world, contributing to deaths and disability and, consequently, loss of healthy life years <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Nascimento et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Roth et al., 2020)</ref>. Some hypotheses suggest that race is associated with CVD. One is that race re ects genetic and epigenetic differences that can in uence metabolism, in ammation, coagulation, and vascular response <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ho et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, some studies have shown that genetic variants in genes related to blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose are more frequent in certain racial groups (Harrell; Burford; Davis, 2022). Another hypothesis is that race is a marker of environmental, social, and behavioral factors that can affect cardiovascular health (HO et al., 2022). For example, some studies have shown that psychosocial stress, racial discrimination, poverty, pollution, smoking, diet, and a sedentary lifestyle are more prevalent in certain racial groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Paradies et al., 2015)</ref>. One way of measuring the impact of these factors is through the social determinants of health, which are the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. Some studies have shown that social determinants of health are independent predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in different racial groups (Wang; Li; Zheng, 2023). However, most studies only consider the indirect effects between race and cardiovascular risk, and not its direct effects. Thus, race may be an indicator of the socioeconomic and environmental conditions that in uence the development of cardiovascular disease, rather than a direct causal factor.</p><p>One hypothesis regarding self-rated health is that it acts as a mediator between skin color and heart attack. Individuals of black skin color might self-assess their health more negatively than non-black individuals because they face socioeconomic conditions, racism, and other factors that affect social equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Borrell et al., 2006)</ref>. Thus, this perception of poor health could re ect their health condition and, consequently, be associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes in the long term.</p><p>However, to test this hypothesis, a signi cant association between skin color and heart attack in the crude analysis unadjusted for other factors would be expected. Furthermore, this association should be attenuated by including self-rated health in the model, as we would be controlling for the mediating effect. Interestingly, the results of our study do not show this pattern. In the univariate analysis, there is no found association between skin color and heart attack. Nonetheless, when we adjust for self-rated health, an effect that did not exist before appears, indicating that this variable is probably a confounder or collider. To de ne whether it is a confounder or a collider, we can use the DAG approach. To be a confounder, self-rated health should cause both the explanatory variable (skin color) and the outcome (heart attack), described as a fork in the DAG approach. However, this scenario is not plausible since skin color is only determined by hereditary genetic characteristics. Therefore, the possibility of it being a collider remains. The collider is a variable resulting from the effect of both variables; that is, it is caused by the explanatory variable (skin color) and the outcome variable (heart attack), an inverted fork in the DAG approach. In this case, adjusting the model for this variable opens up a spurious non-causal path between skin color and heart attack, which was previously closed off by the collider. This is the situation observed in our study. To assess the causal plausibility of these paths, we used the Hill criteria, which are a set of principles proposed by Austin Bradford Hill to examine the evidence of a causal relationship between two variables <ref type="bibr">(FEDAK et al., 2015)</ref>. We found that the path that best ts Hill's nine criteria is the one that considers self-rated health as a collider between skin color and heart attack. This reinforces the importance of using graphical tools, such as the DAG, to represent causal relationships between variables and discuss the implications of these relationships clearly and transparently for readers.</p><p>The interpretation of the results of this study considers the hypotheses, objectives, and theory. The hypothesis of this study was con rmed, as it was found that the stepwise technique introduced a bias in the estimate of the causal effect of skin color on heart attack, by adjusting for a collision variable. In addition to that, the objective of this study was achieved, as the results obtained with the two approaches were compared, analyzing the differences in the estimates of the causal effect and the variables selected for adjusting the model. The theory underpinning this study was causal theory, which provides the concepts and methods for identifying and estimating causal effects between variables, besides providing the tools to build and test possible causal models, such as DAGs.</p><p>This study has some limitations to be considered when interpreting the results. One of the limitations of this study is that it was based on secondary data, which may contain errors of measurement or recording of variables. Another limitation is the cross-sectional design, which does not allow the temporality between variables to be established.</p><p>Despite the limitations mentioned above, we should consider some of the strengths of our study. A notable strength of our study is the application of Hill's causality criteria, which increases the credibility of our conclusions regarding assessing the chain of causality between skin color, self-rated health, and heart attacks. Furthermore, the use of a DAG as a theoretical framework provides a structured approach to modeling the complex relationships between variables, contributing to the robustness and analytical clarity of our study. Moreover, using a database with a large and representative sample of the US adult population increases our results' statistical power and validity, making them more applicable and impactful.</p><p>Finally, as possibilities to advance the topic, we have some suggestions for future research based on the gaps in knowledge or open questions observed in this study. One of the suggestions for future research is to carry out studies that will allow the variables to be measured with greater precision and reliability. Another suggestion for future research is to carry out studies with longitudinal data, which will allow us to establish the temporality between the variables. A third suggestion for future research is to carry out studies with data from different populations to assess the generalizability of the results. A fourth suggestion for future research is to carry out studies with more variables to explore other factors potentially related to the causal relationship between skin color and heart attack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>According to the proposed causal model, the results showed that skin color was not associated with a heart attack when controlling for the appropriate confounding factors. However, when self-rated health, a collider variable, was included in the stepwise models, there was an inverse and distorted association between the two variables, indicating a collider bias. This bias can lead to erroneous or misleading conclusions about the causal relationships between variables when not identi ed and avoided. The DAGbased approach can avoid this bias by correctly identifying confounding factors and colliders based on causality criteria. This study contributed to epidemiological research by demonstrating the importance of the DAG-based approach in analyzing causal relationships and addressing a relevant public health issue related to racial inequalities in society. The ndings highlight the importance of the use of DAGs by researchers in the planning and evaluation of their studies, as well as in the interpretation and synthesis of their results, as DAGs can generate relevant insights, even in situations where it is not possible to identify a set of  Odds ratios (OR) and 95% con dence intervals (95% CI) were estimated for each model using logistic regression. The outcome variable was heart attack, categorized as 0 (no) or 1 (yes). The explanatory variable was skin color, with the reference category being non-black and the test category being black. Seven models were tested: model 1 -univariate; model 2 from a stepwise backward modeling without considering the collision variable, adjusted for location, diabetes and blood pressure; model 3 from a stepwise forward modeling without considering the collision variable, adjusted for sex, age, diabetes and body mass index; model 4 from the selection of the minimum adjustment by DAG, for the total effect of skin color on heart attack, which suggested that no adjustment by confounders would be necessary because there was no spurious path open through the backdoor; model 5 from the selection of the minimum adjustment by DAG, for the direct effect of skin color on heart attack, which suggested the adjustment by mediators, adjusted by blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes and location; model 6 from a stepwise backward modeling considering the collision variable, adjusted for self-reported health and blood pressure; and model 7 from a stepwise forward modeling considering the collision variable, adjusted for self-reported health, sex and age. The backward stepwise criterion was p-value &lt; 0.20 in the univariate analysis and p-value &gt; 0.05 in the multivariate analysis to exclude the variables.</p></div>
