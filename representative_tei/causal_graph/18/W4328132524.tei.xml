<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this short note, I derive the Bell-CHSH inequalities as an elementary result in the present-day theory of statistical causality based on graphical models or Bayes' nets, defined in terms of DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) representing direct statistical causal influences between a number of observed and unobserved random variables. I show how spatio-temporal constraints in loophole-free Bell experiments, and natural classical statistical causality considerations, lead to Bell's notion of local hidden variables, and thence to the CHSH inequalities. The word "local" applies to the way that the chosen settings influence the observed outcomes. The case of contextual setting-dependent hidden variables (thought of as being located in the measurement devices and dependent on the measurement settings) is automatically covered, despite recent claims that Bell's conclusions can be circumvented in this way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> gives us the physical background and motivation for the causal model described in the DAG of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. How that is arranged (and it can be arranged in different ways) depends on Alice and Bob's assistant, Charlie, at the intermediate location in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. There is no need to discuss his or her role in this short note. Very different arrangements can lead to quite different kinds of experiments, from the point of view of their realisation in terms of quantum mechanics. each with a switch on it that can be set to position "up" or "down"; one may imagine that it starts in some neutral position.</p><p>A short moment later, a light starts flashing: it could be red or green. Alice and Bob each write down their setting and their outcome. This is repeated many times. The whole thing is synchronised (with the help of Charlie at the central location).</p><p>The trials are numbered, say from 1 to N, and occupy short time-slots of fixed length. The arrangement is such that Alice's outcome has been written down before a signal carrying Bob's setting could possibly reach Alice's apparatus, and vice versa.</p><p>As explained, each trial has two binary inputs or settings, and two binary outputs or outcomes. I will denote them using the language of classical probability theory by random variables A, B, X, Y where A, B ∈ {1, 2} and X, Y ∈ { -1, + 1}. A complete experiment corresponds to a stack of N copies of this graphical model, ordered by time. We will not make any assumptions whatsoever (for the time being) about independence or identical distributions. The experiment does generate an N × 4 spreadsheet of 4-tuples (a, b, x, y). The settings A, B should be thought of merely as labels (categorical  Thus we are making the following assumptions. There are two statistically independent random variables (not necessarily real-valued --they may take values in any measure spaces whatsoever), which I will denote by Λ E and Λ H , such that the Thus, Λ H is the hidden variable responsible for possible statistical dependence between X and Y given A and B.</p><p>In the theory of graphical models, one knows that such models can be thought of as deterministic models, where the random variable connected to any node in the DAG is a deterministic function of the variables associated with nodes with direct directed links to that node, together with some independent random variable associated with that node. In particular therefore, in obvious notation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X = f(A, Λ H , Λ X ), Y = g(B, Λ H , Λ Y ),</formula><p>where Λ:= (Λ H , Λ X , λ Y ) is statistically independent of (A, B), the three components of Λ are mutually independent of one another, and f, g are some functions. We can now redefine the functions f and g and rewrite the last two displayed equations as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X = f(A, Λ), Y = g(B, Λ),</formula><p>where f, g are some functions and (A, B) is statistically independent of Λ. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X = f(A, B, Λ), Y = g(A, B, Λ),</formula><p>in which Alice's outcome can also depend directly on Bob's setting, and vice versa.</p><p>Kupczynski claims that Bell inequalities cannot (or may not?) be derived for his model. But that is easy. Thanks to the assumption that (A, B) is statistically independent of Λ, one can define four random variables (X 1 , X 2 , Y 1 , Y 2 ) as </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X a = f(a, Λ) Y b = g(b, Λ).</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">-2 ≤ E(X 1 Y 1 ) -E(X 1 Y 2 ) -E(X 2 Y 1 ) -E(X 2 Y 2 ) ≤ + 2</formula><p>and similarly for the comparison of each of the other three correlations with the sum of the others.</p><p>The whole argument also applies (with a little more work) to the case when the outcomes lie in the set { -1, 0, + 1}, or even in the interval [ -1, + 1]. An easy way to see this is to interpret values in [ -1, + 1] taken by X and Y not as the actual measurement outcomes, but as their expectation values given relevant settings and hidden variables. One simply needs to add to the already hypothesized hidden variables further independent uniform [0, 1] random variables to realise a random variable with given conditional expectation in [ -1, 1] as a function of the auxiliary uniform variable. The function depends on the values of the conditioning variables. Everything stays exactly as local and contextual as it already was.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>5 Figure 1 .Figure 1</head><label>511</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
