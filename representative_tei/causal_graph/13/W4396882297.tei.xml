Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example provided by the organizers to illustrate the task. Two subtasks were proposed: Subtask 1, which uses only textual inputs, and Subtask 2, which allows for the consideration of video and audio processing as well.</p><p>The shared task is timely given the recent success of multimodal architectures combining computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Redmon et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2023b)</ref>, natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref>, and speech processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gong et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Radford et al., 2022)</ref> advancements. In the particular context of multimodal emotion analysis, the task builds on top of previous work such as recognizing the triggered emotions as a classification task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alhuzali and Ananiadou, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref> or predicting complex causeeffect relations between speakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wei et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ding et al., 2020)</ref>. For the particular case of the shared task, the dataset -centered in English -relies on <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2023a)</ref> and provides text, image and audio inputs. The goal of the task consists of predicting (i) the emotion associated to each utterance within the conversation, (ii) the cause-effect relations that trigger the emotions between utterances and (iii) the associated span in the cause utterance.</p><p>We had time and resources only to build a textual model for official participation in Subtask 1. We validated some multimodal baseline approaches using vision and audio inputs, but the computational resources required to fine-tune text and video data were beyond our range, so we participated in Subtask 2 only during post-evaluation. In what follows, we describe our approach. The implementation of our early prototype can be found at <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/anaezquerro/semeval24-task3">https://github.com/anaezquerro/semeval24-task3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution</head><p>We propose an end-to-end multimodal prototype based on a large multimodal encoder to contextualize text, image and audio inputs with a graph-based decoder to model the cause-effect relations between triggered emotions within multi-party conversations. The large encoder joins pretrained architectures in text <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, image <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dosovitskiy et al., 2021)</ref> and audio <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baevski et al., 2020)</ref> modalities, while the decoder is adapted from the graph-based approaches in semantic parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dozat and Manning, 2018)</ref>. The model is trained end-to-end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis A number of datasets collecting multi-party conversations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Poria et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chatterjee et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Firdaus et al., 2020)</ref> have been published to train and test multimodal neural architectures. Simpler configurations involve recognizing the speaker emotion at each utterance -this task is commonly known as Emotion Recognition (ER) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Poria et al., 2019)</ref> while others require a deeper level of understanding to model interactions and causal relations between speakers -Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Xia and Ding, 2019)</ref>. The most common approaches follow an encoder-decoder neural architecture where the encoder is conformed by multiple modules -one module per input modality (text, image and/or audio) -and produces an inner representation at utterance level; and the decoder accepts the encoder outputs as inputs and returns a suitable output adapted to the specifications of the targeted task. In the context of Multimodal ER, Nguyen et al. ( <ref type="formula">2023</ref>) proposed a GCN-based decoder to capture temporal relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schlichtkrull et al., 2017)</ref>, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dutta and Ganapathy (2024)</ref> used cross-attention to fusion the input modalities and a final classification layer to predict the targeted emotions. Approaches in ECPE require an extra effort to represent and model causal information: <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wei et al. (2020)</ref> scored all possible utterance tuples to predict the most probable list of emotion-cause pairs. Other authors, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fan et al. (2020)</ref>, represented the emotion-cause pairs as a labeled graph between utterances and tried to predict the set of causal edges using a GCN or a transition-based system, respectively. The SemEval 2024 Task 3 joins the recognition and causal extraction tasks and challenges a system able to both model speaker emotions and elicit relations.</p><p>Graph-based decoding For structured prediction tasks, such as dependency parsing, graphbased approaches are a standard for computing output syntactic representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McDonald, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Martins et al., 2013)</ref>. Particularly, Dozat and Manning (2017) introduced a classifier that computes a head and dependent representation for each token and then uses two biaffine classifiers: one computes a score for each pair of tokens to determine the most likely head, and the other determines the label for each head-dependent token pair. We will also build upon a biaffine graph-based parser: we will frame the task as predicting a dependency graph, where utterances are the nodes and emotions are dependency labels between pairs of utterances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System Overview</head><p>Our system consists of two modules: a large pretrained encoder and a graph-based decoder (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). It can add extra input channels into the encoder without requiring any adjustments to the decoder, so the same decoder is used for both tasks, while the encoder is adapted to incorporate textonly (Subtask 1) or multimodal (Subtask 2) inputs.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑈 1 𝑈 2 𝑈 3 … 𝑈 𝑚 u 1 u 2 u 3 … u 𝑚 ENCODER DECODER 𝑈 1 𝑈 2 𝑈 3 … 𝑈 𝑚 𝑒 1 𝑒 2 𝑒 3 … 𝑒 𝑚</formula></div>

The encoder takes as input the sequence of m utterances of a given conversation and returns a unique vector representation for each utterance. The decoder uses the utterance embedding matrix to apply the affine attention product in the decoder, obtain the scores of the adjacent matrix and return the predicted sequence of emotions and the cause relations between utterances.</p><p>Let C = (U 1 , ..., U m ) be a conversation of m utterances, where each utterance</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U i = {W i , s i , ε i } is defined by (i) a sequence of words W i = (w (i) 1 , ..., w (i)</formula><p>ℓ|w,i| )<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , (ii) an active speaker s i and (iii) a triggered emotion ε i ∈ E<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> . The set of cause-pair relations between utterances can be represented as a directed labeled graph G = (U, R) where U = (U 1 , ..., U m ) is the sequence of utterances of the conversation assuming the role of the nodes of the graph and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">R = {U i ε j -→ U j , i, j ∈ [1, m]}</formula><p>is the set of emotion-cause relations between an arbitrary cause utterance U i and its corresponding effect U j . Thus, the task can be cast as the estimation of the adjacent matrix of G, similarly to syntactic <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ji et al., 2019)</ref> and semantic dependency <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dozat and Manning, 2018)</ref> parsing. Adapting algorithms from parsing to model emotion-cause relations between utterances has also been explored by other authors, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fan et al.

For each U i , we select the CLS embedding (u i ) from the contextualized embedding matrix W i = (u i , w 1 , ..., w ℓ|w,i| ), which is assumed to have information of the whole sentence. The CLS embedding matrix U = (u 1 , ..., u m ) was passed as input to the decoder module and the word embeddings were reserved for the span attention module.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">B E R T … 𝑈1 𝑤1 𝑤𝑛 … 𝑈2 … 𝑈𝑚 DECODER Word embeddings u 1 … u 2 u 𝑚 Utterance embeddings SPAN ATTENTION e 1 … e 2 e 𝑚 Effect embeddings 2 3 4 … … Textual batch 𝑊𝑚: 𝑏 𝑤 1 𝑚 ⋯ 𝑤 ℓ|𝑤,𝑚| (𝑚) 𝑊2: 𝑏 𝑤 1 2 ⋯ 𝑤 ℓ|𝑤,2|<label>(2)</label></formula><p>𝑊1: 𝑏 𝑤 1 1 ⋯ 𝑤 ℓ|𝑤,1|</p><p>(1)</p><p>1</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: High level representation of the textual encoder.

To produce an adjacent matrix G of dimensions m × m, where each position (i, j) represents the probability of a causal relation from U i (cause) to U j (effect), the first biaffine module uses a trainable matrix W G ∈ R d G ×d G and maps U using two feed-forward networks to a cause (C) and an effect (E) representation. By projecting the original BERT embeddings to two different representations, u i ∼ (c i , e i ), the decoder learns different contributions for the same utterance depending on the role.

To compute each S i , the matrix of word embeddings (W i ) of the utterance U i is passed through a One-Head Attention module (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>), where W i acts as the query matrix and E as the key and value matrices, so</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S i = Φ(softmax(W i • E ⊤ ) • E),</formula><p>where Φ is a feed-forward network to project the embedding dimension to a unique binary value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Encoding speaker information</head><p>The dataset includes information about the active speakers in each utterance. A first approach to use this information as input would be concatenating the speaker embeddings to the sequence of utterances. However, this might lead to some issues: the model could assume that there is some inner dependency between triggered emotions and the characters in the conversation. This might be true in some cases, but it can also lead to biases, and there is still the challenge of modeling infrequent and unknown characters. To deal with this, we encoded a conversation C with speakers s 1 , ..., s m using relative  <ref type="bibr">et al. (2017)</ref>. The tensor of word embeddings (W 1 • • • W m ) from the encoder (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) and the effect contextualizations (E) from the decoder (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>) are passed to the attention product using each W i as key and E as query and value matrices.</p><p>positional embeddings. For instance, the sequence (Chandler, Phoebe, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> would be encoded as (0, 1, 2, 0, 1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Image encoding</head><p>We relied on a Transformerbased architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ma et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zheng et al., 2023)</ref> to contextualize input images. While recent studies have proposed adaptations of the Vision Transformer and 3-dimensional convolutions that capture temporal correlations between sequences of frames for video classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnab et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ni et al., 2022)</ref>, our experiments were constrained by our resource limitations, preventing us from using these pretrained architectures. Hence, for our multimodal baseline we opted for the the smallest version of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dosovitskiy et al., 2021)</ref> pretrained on the Facial Emotion Recognition dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Goodfellow et al., 2013)</ref> 5 to contextualize a small fraction of sampled frames 6 , and incorporated an LSTM-based module to derive a unique image representation for each utterance.

Given a raw audio (a i ) of an utterance U i , the encoder of wav2vec 2.0 returns a sequence of hidden states that we summarized with an additional trainable LSTM layer to retrieve a unique vector that contents the audio information.</p><p>… …</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">X 1 : x 1 (1)</formula><p>x 2</p><p>(1) ⋯ x ℓ|𝑥,1|</p><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">X 2 : x 1 (2)</formula><p>x 2</p><p>(2) ⋯ x ℓ|𝑥,2|</p><p>(2) Model fine-tuning The multimodal encoder ( §3.2) uses three pretrained architectures to contextualize individual utterances and passes to the decoder the concatenation of the three unimodal representations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). We chose to fine-tune only BERT during training together with the rest of the network. This was based on our empirical observation of superior results when learning from text compared to image and audio data. We entrusted the learning of audiovisual data to the LSTM learnable module within the encoder, presuming an accurate initial contextualization from wav2vec 2.0 and ViT pretrained on FER-2013.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">X 𝑚 : x 1 (𝑚) x 2 (𝑚) ⋯ x ℓ|𝑥,𝑚| (𝑚) … … 𝑊 𝑚 : 𝑏 𝑤 1 𝑚 ⋯ 𝑤 ℓ|𝑤,𝑚| (𝑚) a 1 a 2 ⋯ a 𝑚 BERT ViT wav2vec b 1 b 𝑚 … ෨ X 1 ෨ X 𝑚 … ෩ A 1 ෩ A 𝑚 … ෩ W 1 ෩ W 𝑚 … x 1 x 𝑚 … a 1 a 𝑚 … LSTM LSTM 𝑊 2 : 𝑏 𝑤 1 2 ⋯ 𝑤 ℓ|𝑤,2| (2) 𝑊 1 : 𝑏 𝑤 1 1 ⋯ 𝑤 ℓ|𝑤,1|<label>(</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Post-processing</head><p>Our end-to-end system directly recovers the predicted emotion-cause relations in a single postprocessing step that linearly operates with the output tensors of the decoder. For the first subtask, the decoder returns (i) the adjacent matrix G ∈ R m×m , (ii) the labeled adjacent matrix G ∈ R m×m×|E| and (iii) the span scores S ∈ R m×m×ℓmax|w,i| . As <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dozat and Manning (2017)</ref>, each arc U i → U j is predicted by thresholding G, and, once the arcs are predicted, the tensor G determines the label (emotion) associated to each arc. Since our formalization ( §3.1) associates a given utterance to an unique emotion, we leveraged the scores of G by the cause utterances and return the emotion with highest score. Finally, to produce a continuous span for each score vector s ij , we considered the leftmost and rightmost elements of s ij higher than a fixed threshold. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Evaluation of our prototype with different multimodal configurations. Precision (P), recall (R) and F-Score (F) measured the weighted average across the eight emotions of the dataset (superscript w denotes that the measure is weighted) and for the first subtask the span performance is considered with strict correctness (subscript s) or overlapping (subscript p). The symbol † remarks the reference metric for each subtask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>Validation The annotated dataset contains 1 375 multi-party conversations with a total of 13 619 utterances <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2023a)</ref>. Although an unbiased estimation of the performance of our system would require validating the trained architecture using all available annotated data, our time and resources limitations prevented us from conducting k-fold cross-validation. Instead, we partitioned a 15% of the annotated dataset as our development set. The specific split used will be available with the accompanying code to replicate our findings.</p><p>Evaluation We use the official metrics<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> : the weighted strict F-Score for the Subtask 1 and the weighted F-Score for the Subtask 2.</p><p>Hyperparameter configuration Our computational limitations prevented us from exhaustively searching the optimal hyperparameters for our system. We conducted some tests varying the pre-trained text encoder<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> , model dimension, gradient descent algorithm and rate and adding or removing the speaker module. We maintained in all experiments some regularization techniques (such as dropout in the hidden layers and gradient norm clipping) to avoid over-fitting. Our final configuration uses AdamW optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019)</ref> with learning rate of 10 -6 and is trained during one hundred epochs with early stopping on the validation set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> presents the performance of our system for both subtasks. For the first subtask, we investigated various embedding sizes of the Biaffine decoder while concurrently fine-tuning the largest version of BERT<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> . For the second subtask, we conducted experiments using different types of inputs to evaluate their impact. These included: (i) using only text-based inputs, (ii) adding audio data, (iii) incorporating visual data through frames, and (iv) leveraging all available multimodal inputs together.</p><p>For approaches (i), (ii) and (iii), only BERT was fine-tuned, whereas for approach (iv), all pretrained weights were frozen. These weights solely served to contextualize input information, with the learning process confined to the decoder component.</p><p>Our top-performing model for the first subtask achieved a validation score of 9.75 and ranked in the evaluation set in 7th position among 15 participants with 6.77 points. We observed a slight performance improvement by increasing the hidden dimension of the decoder. Thus, considering the expansion of decoder layers could improve the performance. It is worth noting the significant impact of span prediction on the model performance: the proportional results consistently outperform strict metrics. Removing span prediction while retaining only text inputs results in a notable increase in F-Score (20.43 points for the second subtask), indicating the crucial role of span prediction in model learning. Furthermore, we noticed that there was a consistent delay in the alignment between recall and precision metrics, with precision consistently exceeding recall by more than 5 points across all approaches. This suggests that our system tends to adopt a conservative behavior, avoiding the number of false cause emotion predictions.</p><p>The best validation performance for the second subtask is achieved through the integration of text and audio, yielding a score of 23.36 points in the weighted F-Score. Using image data also improves the text-only baseline, though unexpectedly lags behind the audio model. It is important to note that these two approaches are not directly comparable due to differences in their data inputs: the text and image model only considers a fixed number of sampled frames, suggesting that providing more image data (ideally, the full sequence of frames) could potentially yield a better performance that surpasses the audio-based approach. Unfortunately, we could not fine-tune BERT with the full multimodal encoder, so we were restricted to projecting the multimodal inputs to their respective contextualizations, and relying the trainable weights of the decoder to optimize the full architecture. The results prove the importance of, at least, finetuning the text encoder: the F-Score only reaches 11.25 points, whereas the text finetuned baseline nearly doubles its performance with 20.43 points, highlighting the insufficient context of the original pretrained BERT embeddings to address this task.</p><p>Once the post-evaluation period concluded, we upload an experimental submission of our best multimodal system to the official competition. We obtained 15.32 points in the weighted F-Score, positioning our baseline in the 13th place out of 18 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a graph-based prototype for the analysis emotion-cause analysis in conversations. Given the limited preparation time, we only submitted official results for Subtask 1 (text-only), but also report post-evaluation results for Subtask 2 (multimodal). The task required predicting several aspects of the conversation: (i) the emotion associated with each utterance, (ii) the cause-effect relationships triggering these emotions between utterances, and (iii) the specific span within the cause utterance responsible for the emotion. We achieved 7th place out of 15 valid submissions for Subtask 1, a promising outcome considering the time and resource constraints we had to prepare the task. Yet, our results make us optimistic about exploring future research avenues to enhance our system and study lighter approaches that can perform competitively. As future work, we aim to experiment with smaller and distilled models to encode textual, visual, and audio inputs, enabling us to fine-tune the full model cheaply.  </p></div>
