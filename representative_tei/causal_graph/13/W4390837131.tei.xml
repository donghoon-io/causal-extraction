<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose a nonparametric and time-varying directed information graph (TV-DIG) framework to estimate the evolving causal structure in time series networks, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional econometric models in capturing high-dimensional, nonlinear, and time-varying interconnections among series.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Understanding the interconnection between financial institutions, especially in the context of systemic risk, is of great importance. In principle, there are two main approaches to measuring such interconnections between institutions in the literature, which are mainly visualized by a directed graph. One approach is based on a mathematical model of financial market participants, and the relations are derived from a combination of information extracted from financial statements, like the market value of liabilities of counterparties. The other approach, which is also adopted in this work, is based on statistical analysis of financial series related to the institutions of interest. Nevertheless, most existing methods in the literature rely on pairwise comparisons or impose additional assumptions on the underlying model, such as linearity, and often presume time-invariant interconnections. In this work, we introduce a novel framework designed to capture causal relationships within a time series network while relaxing these assumption.</p><p>To highlight a few relevant works, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Billio et al. (2012)</ref> propose systemic risk measures to capture the connections between the monthly returns of various financial institutions (hedge funds, banks, brokers, and insurance companies), utilizing pairwise linear Granger-causality tests. Alternatively, in their work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Diebold and Yılmaz (2014)</ref> propose a connectedness measure based on generalized variance <ref type="bibr">decomposition (GVD)</ref>. This measure, again limited to linear systems, also suffers from disregarding the entire network akin to pairwise analysis commonly used in the literature, as we will discuss in Section 2.6.3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barigozzi and Hallin (2016)</ref> focus on one particular network structure: the long-run variance decomposition network (LVDN). Similar to the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Diebold and Yılmaz (2014)</ref>, the LVDN defines a weighted directed graph where the associated weight to edge (i, j) represents the proportion of h-step-ahead forecast error variance of variable i which is accounted for by the innovations in variable j. LVDNs are also limited to linear systems.</p><p>Building on these approaches, there are several attempts to go beyond linear models in the literature. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Andersen et al. (2019)</ref> provide unifying theory for parametric nonlinear factor models based on a panel of noisy observations. The nonlinear model is governed by stochastic differential equations and the estimation procedure is carried out via penalized least squares. The inference theory for penalized least squares with fixed time span has been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Andersen et al. (2015)</ref>. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Andersen et al. (2019)</ref> develop an inference theory that applies in either fixed or large time span cases.</p><p>Expanding further on nonlinear methodologies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bonaccolto et al. (2019)</ref> study quantile based methods of Granger causality and multiplex networks. This work provides a possible solution to combine multiplex network, or a collection of networks existing between a set of subjects. Ideally, the constituents of the multiplex network represent the outcomes of different approaches to the estimation or identification of links between the analyzed subjects. Another contribution of this work is developing a quantile based method to interpret the risk of the estimated financial networks that identifies causality among quantiles of the modelled variables. It is important to realize that this method is consistent with the works by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hong et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Corsi et al. (2018)</ref> that focus on causality among tail events. The main idea is to capture causalities that are not in the center of their distributions, or in the mean but they are in the tails of their distributions. We discuss this method in details in Section 2.6.5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Etesami et al. (2017)</ref> use a non-parametric information-theoretic measure to infer causal relations in a network however, it relies on an assumption that the causal network is time invariant. Herein, we extend this result to time-varying networks.</p><p>Connectedness measures based on correlation remain widespread. Such measures capture only pairwise association and are mainly studied for linear Gaussian models. This makes them of limited value in finance. Different approaches have been developed to relax these assumptions. For example, equi-correlation approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Engle and Kelly (2012)</ref> uses average correlations across all pairs. The CoVaR approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008)</ref> measures the value-at-risk of financial institutions conditional on other institutions experiencing financial distress. The marginal expected shortfall approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acharya et al. (2017)</ref> measures the expected loss to each financial institution conditional on the entire set of institutions' poor performance. Although these measures rely less on linear Gaussian methods, a general framework that can capture non-pairwise connectedness in time-varying networks remains elusive. Introducing such measure is the main purpose of this work.</p><p>Recently, there have been various attempts to infer time-varying causal relations among time series. These methods generally fall into three categories: rollingwindow methods, change-point detection techniques, and model-based approaches.</p><p>Rolling-window methods, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lu et al. (2014)</ref>, use rolling sub-samples for timevarying Granger causality in oil markets, building on Hong (2001)'s Granger causality test. This method, and its adaptations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hong et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Shi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Baum et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>, primarily reveal causal relationships in means and variances between time series. However, absence of such causalities doesn't rule out all causality, and these tests assume an ARMA-GARCH model for conditional variance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Shi et al. (2018)</ref> introduced a recursive evolving window test for detecting causal relationship changes, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Phillips et al. (2017)</ref> examined nonlinear cointegration models with time-varying structural coefficients, using non-parametric kernel methods for estimation.</p><p>In statistical analysis, change point detection is crucial for identifying instances when a process's probability distribution changes. This technique is particularly useful in pinpointing alterations in causal networks, such as changes in the parent sets of network nodes or in their conditional probabilities. Detecting these shifts in high-dimensional distributions remains a challenging task <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aminikhanghahi and Cook, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Wang et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Barigozzi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pelger and Xiong, 2022)</ref>. To overcome these challenges, several model-based methods have been developed. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barigozzi et al. (2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Barigozzi et al. ( , 2021) )</ref> propose a framework for the estimation of time series factor models with multiple change-points in their second-order structure. As we will discuss in Section 2.8, our proposed method is also capable of detecting such changes in the conditional distributions as well.</p><p>Model-based approaches like Markov switching models describe dynamic interconnections via time-dependent or state-dependent model parameters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bianchi et al. (2019)</ref> introduce a Markov switching graphical model for analyzing time-varying systemic risk using multi-factor asset pricing models. This model assumes each time series as a dynamic multi-factor linear model with normally distributed residuals. They employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for parameter inference and use weighted eigenvector centrality to identify latent states. However, their time-varying network, defined as a Markov random field in the error terms, fails to adequately represent causal relationships as it forms an undirected graph. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Billio et al. (2022)</ref> suggest a tensor-on-tensor regression for multilayer networks, combining zero-inflated logistic regression and Markov-switching coefficients for structural changes, using Bayesian inference with Gibbs sampling. Despite innovations, this approach shares limitations in causal network inference similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bianchi et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Most of the aforementioned methods are studied in small size networks. The inference problem in high dimensional settings requires estimating a large number of parameters and thus most of the above methods may not be applicable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Billio et al. (2019)</ref> propose a Bayesian nonparametric Lasso prior for high-dimensional VAR models that can improve estimation efficiency and prediction accuracy. This approach clusters the VAR coefficients into groups and shrinks the coefficients of each group toward a common location to overcome over-parametrization and overfitting issues. Another related work is <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Petrova, 2019)</ref>, in which the authors propose a quasi-Bayesian local likelihood estimation methodology for multivariate models in high dimensional setting with time-varying parameters. However, these methods are limited to linear models. To overcome this limitation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kalli and Griffin (2018)</ref> propose a Bayesian non-parametric VAR model that allows for nonlinearity in the conditional mean, heteroscedasticity in the conditional variance, and non-Gaussian innovations. But, unlike the BNP-Lasso, it does not allow sparsity in the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Iacopini and Rossini (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bernardi and Costola (2019)</ref> tackle the curse of dimensionality through a two-stage prior specification. In the first stage, a spikeand-slab prior distribution is used for each entry of the coefficient matrix. In the second stage, it imposes prior dependence on the coefficients by specifying a Markov process for their random distribution. Causal network is a by-product of this estimation procedure. Within the hierarchical conditional Bayesian prior methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Korobilis and Pettenuzzo (2019)</ref> develop a new estimation algorithm for VARs that breaks the multivariate estimation problem into a series of independent tasks and consequently reducing the curse of dimensionality. Note that all aforementioned methods are limited to VAR models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hué et al. (2019)</ref> propose a new network measure of systemic risk that com-bines the pair-wise Granger causality approach with the leave-one-out concept. This methodology allows them to deal with the issue of indirect causalities, without facing the inherent curse of dimensionality that arises in the multivariate approaches. However, since this approach only leaves out one financial institution at a time, it fails to capture causalities with more than one indirect paths. In this work, we propose a framework for estimating time-varying causal relations in a general and possibly high-dimensional network of time series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Contributions</head><p>In our research, we contribute both theoretically and empirically to the understanding of dynamic causal relationships within complex networks of time series, especially in the financial domain and the emerging influence of crypto assets. Theoretically, we introduce the time-varying directed information (TV-DI) measure, an information-theoretic framework specifically designed to capture the evolving nature of causal relationships in a general network of time series. Additionally, we enhance the estimation process of directed information (DI) by proposing a non-parametric method. This method leverages rolling window moving block bootstrapping in conjunction with non-parametric estimators for mutual information, such as k-nearest and kernel-based methods. The efficacy of this estimator is rigorously validated through a series of simulated experiments, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. We also discuss different approaches to tackle the curse of dimensionality for estimating DI in large networks. Furthermore, we introduce a DI-based measure for inferring non-parametric and non-pairwise aggregated causal effects between two disjoint subsets of time series. This can be used to quantify the causal effect of, for instance, a financial sector on another sector. In the context of network analysis, this translates into estimating the influence of an entire sub-network, rather than individual nodes, on another sub-network. Moreover, we quantify the contributions of each individual time series in such aggregated causal effects. This is useful to detect the most or the least influential asset in a financial sector influencing another sector, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of systemic risk. We also establish the connection between our framework with several well-known econometric models such as VAR, GARCH, switching models and others. We show how our framework improves the measurement of systemic risk. Empirically, to the best of our knowledge, this is the inaugural study that investigates the evolving dynamics of systemic risk posed by crypto assets to financial networks, marking a significant advancement in empirical financial network analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodology</head><p>In order to investigating the dynamic of systemic risk, it is important to measure the causal relationship between financial institutions. In this section, we introduce a statistical approach to measure such causal interconnections using a generalized version of Granger causality. We begin by introducing some notations. Plain capital letters denote random variables or processes, while lowercase letters denote their realizations. Bold lowercase and capital letters are used for column vectors and matrices, respectively. Calligraphy letters are used for denoting sets. We use X j,t to denote a time series X j at time t and X t j to denote the time series X j up to time t. For a set A = {a 1 , ..., a n } and an index set I ⊆ {1, ..., n}, we define A -I := A \ {a i : i ∈ I}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Graphical Models and Granger Causality</head><p>Researchers from different fields have developed various graphical models suitable for their application of interest to encode interconnections among variables or processes. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koller and Friedman (2009)</ref> define Markov Networks, Bayesian networks (BNs), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Murphy (2002)</ref> introduces Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). These are three examples of such graphical models that have been used extensively in the literature. Markov networks are undirected graphs that represent the conditional independence between the variables. On the other hand BNs and DBNs are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that encode conditional dependencies in a reduced factorization of the joint distribution. In DBNs, the size of the graphs depend on the time-homogeneity and the Markov order of the random processes. Therefore, in general, the size of the graphs can grow with time. As an example, the DBN graph of a vector autoregressive (VAR) introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dahlhaus and Eichler (2003)</ref> with m processes each of order L requires mL nodes. Hence, they are not suitable for succinct visualization of relationships between the time series.</p><p>Similar to the works by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Quinn et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Massey (1990)</ref>, we use directed information graphs (DIGs) to encode interconnections among the financial institutions in which each node represents a time series. Below, we formally introduce this type of graphical models. We use an information-theoretical generalization of the notion of Granger causality to determine the interconnection between time series. The basic idea in this framework was originally introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Wiener (1956)</ref> and later formalized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Granger (1969)</ref>. The idea is as follows: "we say that X is causing Y if we are better able to predict the future of Y using all available information than if the information apart from the past of X had been used."</p><p>Despite broad philosophical viewpoint of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Granger (1963)</ref>, his formulation for practical implementation was done using autoregressive models and linear regression. This version has been widely adopted in econometrics and other disciplines. More precisely, in order to identify the influence of X t on Y t in a VAR comprises of three time series {X, Y, Z}, Granger's idea is to compare the performance of two linear regressions: the first one predicts Y t using {X t-1 , Y t-1 , Z t-1 } and the second one predicts Y t given {Y t-1 , Z t-1 }. Clearly, the performance of the second predictor is bounded by the first one. If they have the same performance, then we say X does not Granger cause Y .</p><p>Below, we introduce directed information (DI), an information-theoretical measure that generalized Granger causality beyond linear models. DI has been used in many applications to infer causal relationships. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Quinn et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kim et al. (2011)</ref> used it for analyzing neuroscience data and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Etesami et al. (2017)</ref> applied for market data .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Directed Information Graphs (DIGs)</head><p>Consider a causal<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> dynamical system comprised of three time series {X, Y, Z}.</p><p>To answer whether X has influence on Y or not over time horizon [1, T ], we compare the average performance of two particular predictors over this time horizon. The first predictor is non-nested that uses the full history of all three time series while the second one is nested and it uses the history of all processes excluding process X. On average, the performance of the predictor with less information (the second one) is upper bounded by the performance of the predictor with more information (the first one). However, when the performance of the predictors are close over time horizon [1, T ], then we declare that X does not influence Y over this time horizon.</p><p>In order to consider higher order moments, our prediction lies in the space of probability measures. More precisely, the first prediction at time t is given by P(Y t |X t-1 , Y t-1 , Z t-1 ) that is the conditional distribution of Y t given the past of all processes and the second predictor is given by P(Y t |Y t-1 , Z t-1 ).</p><p>To measure the performance of a predictor, we use a nonnegative loss function which defines the quality of the prediction. This loss function increases as the prediction deviates from the true outcome. Although there are many candidate loss functions, e.g., the squared error loss, absolute loss, etc, for the purpose of this work, we consider the logarithmic loss. More precisely, when the outcome y t is revealed for Y t , the two predictors incur losses ℓ 1,t :=log P(Y t = y t |X t-1 , Y t-1 , Z t-1 ) and ℓ 2,t :=log P(Y t = y t |Y t-1 , Z t-1 ), respectively. This loss function has meaningful information-theoretical interpretations and it is related to the Shannon entropy. The log-loss is the Shannon code length, i.e., the number of bits required to efficiently represent a symbol y t . Thus, it may be thought of the description length of y t . For more justifications on this loss function, see the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Quinn et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>The reduction in the loss at time t, known as regret is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r t := ℓ 2,t -ℓ 1,t = log P(Y t = y t |X t-1 , Y t-1 , Z t-1 ) P(Y t = y t |Y t-1 , Z t-1 ) . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>Note that the regrets are non-negative. The average regret over the time horizon [1, T ], i.e., 1 T T t=1 E[r t ] is called directed information (DI). This will be our measure of causation and its value determines the strength of influence. If this quantity is close to zero, it indicates that the past values of time series X contain no information that would help in predicting the future of time series Y given the history of Y and Z. This definition can be generalized to more than three processes as follows, Definition 1. Consider a network of m time series R := {R 1 , ..., R m }. We define the directed information from R i to R j as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I(R i → R j ||R -{i,j} ) := 1 T T t=1 E log P(R j,t |R t-1 ) P(R j,t |R t-1 -{i} ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R -{i,j}</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">:=R\{R i , R j } and R t-1 -{i} denotes {R t-1 1 , ..., R t-1 m }\{R t-1 i }. We declare R i causes R j within time horizon [1, T ], if and only if I(R i → R j ||R -{i,j} ) &gt; 0. Definition 2. Directed information graph (DIG) of a set of m processes {R 1 , ..., R m } is a weighted directed graph G = (V, E, W), where nodes V represent processes and an arrow (R i , R j ) ∈ E denotes that R i influences R j with weight w j,i := I(R i → R j ||R -{i,j} ). Consequently, (R i , R j ) / ∈ E if and only if w j,i = 0.</formula><p>Pairwise comparison has been applied in the literature to identify the causal structure of time series. The works by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Billio et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Billio et al. (2010)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allen et al. (2010)</ref> are such examples. Pairwise comparison is not correct in general and fails to capture the true causal relationships. See Appendix A for an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Estimating the DIs</head><p>Given the definition of DI in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), it is straightforward to see that DI can be written as the summation of conditional mutual information,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I(R i → R j ||R -{i,j} ) = 1 T T t=1 I(R j,t ; R t-1 i |R t-1 -{i,j} , R t-1 j ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where I(X; Y |Z) denotes the conditional mutual information between X and Y given Z. For more details see the book by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cover and Thomas (2012)</ref>. Therefore, parametric and non-parametric estimators for the conditional mutual information can be used to estimate DI. There are different methods that can be used to estimate the terms in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) given i.i.d. samples such as plug-in empirical estimator, kernel estimator, and k-nearest neighbor estimator. For an overview of such estimators including their asymptotic behavior see the articles by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Paninski (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Noshad et al. (2019), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jiao et al. (2013)</ref>. For our experimental results, we used the k-nearest method since it shows relatively better performance compared to the other non-parametric estimators. For more details see Appendix B.</p><p>Moving Block Bootstrap. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned non-parametric estimators require large amount of i.i.d. data to output accurate DIs' estimations. However, often in practice (e.g., analysing financial market) such amount of i.i.d. data is not available for a short time window. To overcome this challenge, we adopt Moving block bootstrap (MBB) method. The MBB, introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kunsch (1989)</ref>, is a non-parametric bootstrap procedure that can be applied to time series for replicating data. It obtains replicated series of data by drawing with replacement from the blocks of consecutive data. This method is well investigated in the case of strictly stationary strong mixing time series by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kunsch (1989)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lahiri (1999)</ref> and also in non-stationary case by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fitzenberger (1998)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gonçalves and White (2002)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Synowiecki (2007)</ref>. In this work, we combined the rolling window method and MBB to estimate the DIs in (37) as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. More specifically, a window of length T rw is selected (this is the rolling window and will be moved throughout the entire horizon [1, T ]) and then batches of bootstrap resamples from the selected window are generated.

In this section, we show that the DI introduced in (2) can capture the strength of causal relationships as well. We do so using a simple linear example and then extend it to general systems.

The first one predicts X 1,t using {X t-1 1 , X t-1 3 } and the other one uses {X t-1 1 , X t-1 2 }. If the first predictor shows better performance compared to the second one, it implies that X 3 contains more relevant information about X 1 compared to X 2 . In other words, X 3 has a stronger influence on X 1 than X 2 . To measure the performance of these two predictors over the time horizon [1, T ], we consider the mean squared errors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">e 1 := min (a,b)∈R 2 1 T T t=1 E||X 1,t -(aX 1,t-1 + bX 3,t-1 )|| 2 ,</formula><p>(5)</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">e 2 := min (c,d)∈R 2 1 T T t=1 E||X 1,t -(cX 1,t-1 + dX 2,t-1 )|| 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>It is easy to show that e 1 = 1 + 0.1 2 and e 2 = 1 + 0.3 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">DIG in High-dimensional Settings</head><p>For large networks with thousands nodes or millions of edges, DIGs become too complex to infer (i.e., it requires large amount of data) and also too complicated for direct humans analysis. There are several approaches for inferring the DIG of large networks. To mention a few: approximate large networks with smaller and simpler networks, use side information (e.g., model class) to develop alternative simpler inferring algorithms, and reduce the complexity of DI by reducing the size of the conditioning set. Below, we will briefly discuss each of these approaches.</p><p>A major approach to manage large high-dimensional problems is to keep a few edges of the causal network which together best approximate the dynamics of the system. In this case, instead of the true DIG, we obtain an approximation of it with less number of edges (sparser network). For example, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> depicts the DIG of the system in (4) and a tree<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> approximation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Quinn et al.

This result shows that inferring the best tree approximation of a DIG can be obtained by calculating the pair-wise DI, i.e., I(R j → R i ) for all i ̸ = j ∈ {1, ..., m} instead of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(2)</ref>. It is important to emphasize that the complexity of (2) increases with the network size. On the other hand, the complexity of the terms in (10) are independent of the network size and hence, in large networks, inferring the best directed tree approximation might be more suitable than the complete DIG. A generalized version of this approximation is proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Quinn et al. (2017)</ref> in which they propose an algorithm to identify the optimal bounded in-degree approximations. In this algorithm, there is a trad off between the complexity and the accuracy of the approximation.</p><p>Using side information about the underlying dynamic (e.g., it is linear) or the structure (e.g., the true DIG is a directed tree) might help to develop alternative learning algorithms with lower complexities. As an example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Etesami and Kiyavash (2014)</ref> show that when the underlying dynamic is linear then the coefficient matrices of the model can determine the corresponding DIG of the system. Therefore, give the side information that the system is linear, one can infer its DIG by estimating the coefficient matrices of the model instead of estimating the DIs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(2)</ref>. Inferring the coefficients is a much simpler problem in terms of both computational and sample complexity compared to estimating the DIs.</p><p>Another approach to manage high-dimensional settings is substituting the conditioning set R -{i,j} in (2) with a smaller set that contains the parents of node R j . This will reduce both computational and sample complexity of the problem without introducing any approximation error. This is because, if I(R i → R j ||R -{i,j} ) = 0, then for any subset S j ⊆ R -{i,j} that contains all the parents of R j , we have I(R i → R j ||S j ) = 0. However, forming such subsets may not be possible. In this case, one approach is to form a subset S ′ j ⊂ R -{i,j} that contains the parents of R j with high probability. This will reduce the complexity but it may introduce approximation error. We use this approach in our experiment to infer the causal network of major 124 financial institutions. More precisely, we formed S ′ j by collecting 10 institutions that have the highest correlation with institute R j .</p></div>

However, it is quite possible that the causal relationships and information spillover among financial assets changes over time. Changes in causal relationships among financial assets usually indicate varying patterns, so it is important to detect and assess such dynamic relationships. Below, we introduce a framework using DI to capture such time-varying networks and compare it with a major approaches in literature for detecting time-varying causal relations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lu et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.">Sample Path Causal Influences</head><p>The definition of DI involves taking an expectation over the histories of the time series, and are thus well suited to address questions such as "Does the past of time series Y up to time t -1, i.e., Y t-1 cause X t ?" A natural next question that one might pose is "Did the past realization of Y up to time t -1, i.e., y t-1 cause X t ?" In other words, the goal of sample path causal influence is to identify the causal effect that particular values of Y have on the distribution of the subsequent sample of X. Examples of this include "When does the institute A have the greatest effect on another institute B?" Schamberg and Coleman (2019) develop a framework using sequential prediction for estimating the sample path causal relationships. In this framework, the influence from Y to X in the presence of other processes Z at time t is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">S Y →X (H t-1 ) := E log P(x t |H t-1 ) P(x t |H t-1 -y ) ,<label>(38)</label></formula><p>where H t-1 is the σ-algebra generated by {x t-1 , y t-1 , z t-1 } and H t-1 -y is the σ-algebra generated by {x t-1 , z t-1 }.

More precisely, X j is a parent of X i in the true network if and only if X i,t+1 functionally depends on X j,t in (39).

In order to capture the time-varying causal effects among these five time series, we used the Monte Carlo simulation and generated data using the nonlinear DGP in (41) for a period of T time steps. Afterwards, using the method introduced in Section 2.3, we estimated (37) between all pairs of time series for t ∈ {30τ : τ ≥ 0} and S = 800.

These changes of influences can be seen in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8(d</ref>) and (e). Similarly, the influence X 2 → X 1 , captured by [A t ] 2,3 = 8 sin 1.4 πt T , showcases a different type of dynamic interaction.

Our primary objective is to support policymakers and regulators in managing systemic risk, thus maintaining financial market stability and integrity through macroprudential approaches. While there is a rich and growing body of literature on static or time-invariant network estimation and systemic risk, research on estimating dynamic networks from time series data remains limited. This research focuses on understanding how cryptocurrencies might affect financial stability. We explore the changing interactions between different sectors in the financial industry, especially how cryptocurrencies influence other sectors.

Our application of this test to our data set revealed significant non-linear interactions, thereby rejecting the null hypothesis of linear dependency between the series.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Related Literature</head><p>Over the past decade, the cryptocurrency sector has evolved from an obscure asset to a wildly popular investment. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies experienced a meteoric rise from approximately US$7 billion at the end of 2015 to nearly US$3 trillion in November 2021, as per data from CoinMarketCap.com. This was followed by a significant contraction, where the market capitalization plummeted to around US$1 trillion during the recent cryptocurrency winter. The market value of cryptocurrencies has been characterized by substantial volatility. In early 2023, the cumulative market capitalization witnessed a resurgence after the decline in 2022, which was precipitated by the Terra/Luna collapse and the FTX crisis. The TerraUSD collapse eradicated over $50 billion in value as shown in Uhlig (2022), and the subsequent failure of FTX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, intensified skepticism towards the industry, highlighting issues related to regulatory oversight.</p><p>The dynamics of market capitalization in the cryptocurrency sector are indicative of the capital flow within this market. Although, the cryptocurrency market's size is relatively small in comparison to the nearly $300 trillion global financial system, its impact cannot be underestimated. Historical precedents, such as the financial crisis of 2008, demonstrate that even a small segment of the financial sector can catalyze significant stability concerns. For instance, the subprime mortgage market, va lued at approximately $1.2 trillion in 2008, was a key factor in the crisis <ref type="bibr">(Pinto (2010)</ref>). This underscores the importance of understanding the implications of the cryptocurrency market's evolution, not just in terms of its size but also in the context of its potential impact on broader financial stability. In response to the growing prominence of cryptocurrencies, governments worldwide, including the United States, are examining how to regulate them. A notable example is the executive order by the U.S. President on March 9, 2022, which mandates a comprehensive review of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. This review, conducted by federal agencies, focuses on evaluating the impact of digital currencies on overall financial stability and other relevant factors.</p><p>Building on the governmental efforts to regulate the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector, it's important to recognize that modeling and analyzing the cryptocurrency market, along with its interactions with other financial markets, presents a significant challenge. This complexity arises from the market's inherent volatility, its multifaceted nature, and the rapid pace of its evolution. Many cryptocurrency assets are characterized by a lack of clear fundamental value or cash flows, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Makarov and Schoar (2020)</ref>. These assets are prone to fragmentation, offering opportunities for arbitrage and being vulnerable to market manipulation, as indicated by studies like <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Griffin and Shams (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gandal et al. (2018)</ref>.</p><p>The crypto market's periods of rapid growth have drawn the attention of both retail and investors, as well as politicians and regulators, as Auer and Tercero-Lucas (2022) points out. Additionally, fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market may increasingly align with other asset classes. Research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Chuen et al. (2017)</ref>; Borri (2019); <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Petukhina et al. (2021)</ref> highlights a generally low correlation between cryptocurrencies and other asset classes. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Iyer (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dong et al. (2023)</ref> present evidence of growing links between U.S. equity markets and the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting a deeper integration of crypto markets with the equity cycle. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Iyer (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dong et al. (2023)</ref> demonstrate that the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 was initially low but has significantly increased since 2020. Most of these studies compare market indices, typically representing the stock market, with Bitcoin as the crypto market proxy.</p><p>The methodologies in the aforementioned work are often basic, relying on visual inspection and correlation-based analyses. Such methods can be misleading due to their sensitivity to the chosen time frame and the distribution of the sample data. They generally assume linearity and a time-invariant distribution of model parameters, which may limit their accuracy. Our understanding of the primary factors driving crypto asset prices in this immature industry, as well as the elements influencing the correlation between cryptocurrency and other markets, remains limited.</p><p>The existing literature offers a variety of potential and compatible explanations for these dynamics.</p><p>To elucidate why crypto assets may have become more correlated with other asset classes post-COVID, studies indicate an increase in retail trading during the pandemic lockdowns, encompassing both crypto and stock markets. This is highlighted in the research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Divakaruni and Zimmerman (2023)</ref> regarding crypto trading and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ozik et al. (2021)</ref> in the context of stock trading. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Toczynski (2022)</ref> estimates that approximately US$15 billion of the federal stimulus checks were invested in trading crypto assets. The landscape for crypto asset trading evolved to accommodate increasing demand. Notably, well-known mobile payment applications like Revolut and PayPal, along with trading platforms such as Robinhood, began offering crypto trading services to their clients. April 2021 saw Coinbase, a prominent centralized crypto exchange, make its debut on the Nasdaq. Additionally, new investment vehicles like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust emerged, providing investors with exposure to crypto assets without the need to hold the tokens directly.</p><p>Amid these developments, institutional investor engagement in crypto assets also saw a rise. Research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Liu et al. (2022)</ref> indicates a notable decrease in the volatility of crypto returns from 2011 to 2018. This trend suggests a diminishing risk factor, potentially making the crypto markets more appealing to institutional investors over time. Utilizing a supervisory database, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Auer et al. (2023)</ref> highlights the increasing role of traditional financial intermediaries in the crypto sphere. They observe that banks' involvement in crypto assets, although still a small fraction of their total balance sheets, has grown and holds significant implications for a market that was once dominated largely by retail investors.</p><p>However, the dynamics between crypto and stock markets may not be predominantly influenced by retail investors, as their trading patterns for these assets differ <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kogan et al. (2023)</ref>). It is posited that the post-COVID monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the resulting response from institutional investors are more crucial factors. These investors, now more active in the crypto markets, tend to trade cryptocurrencies and other high-risk assets in a correlated manner. In a lowinterest environment, it's logical for institutions to pursue higher returns by opting for riskier assets (Di Maggio and Kacperczyk (2017); <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Andonov et al. (2017)</ref>). This trend is underscored by findings from DeVault and <ref type="bibr">Wang (2021)</ref>, who note that investors in crypto assets often outperform their peers. Thus, the increasing institutional participation in crypto markets raises the possibility of heightened risk for spillovers into the broader economy. This is particularly relevant as these institu-   tions' portfolios often include a mix of crypto and traditional assets, and they are less likely to rebalance their portfolios as frequently as retail investors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">DIG of the Industry groups</head><p>We use this literature to explain the time-varying and dynamic nature of the interconnection between crypto and other assets in the financial network, and to investigate potential cross-sector spillovers. This approach enables us to indirectly track the flow of funds across different investment avenues, such as real estate, capital markets, the cryptocurrency market, and bank accounts. The insights gained from this model are valuable for policymakers and regulators. They can use this information to devise effective strategies and take actions that reduce systemic risk within financial networks.</p><p>To detect the cross-sector causal relationships, we obtained the DIG between them by estimating the DIs in Equation (34) in a rolling window moving block bootstrapping scheme (See Section 2.3) between 01/2018 and 12/2022. More precisely, we used rolling windows of size T rw =63 that is almost three months, L B =3, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref> illustrate four of the learned networks. In these networks, nodes with label [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] denote industries [Banks, Diversified Financial, Insurance, Real Estate Investment, Financial Technology, Crypto], respectively. More precisely, the causal influence from Banks to Insurance is I(0 → 3||1, 2, 4, 5) which is computed at 57 different time periods between 2018 and 2022. For instance, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref>(a), this influence between 3/6/2018 to 6/5/2018 is 1.15 which is shown by a weighted edges from node 0 to 3. In particular, node 5 which represents the Crypto has several outgoing edges that is an indication that the cryptocurrencies have non-negligible impacts on other industries. Please note that the thickness of the edges are proportional to the estimated DIs, i.e., the larger the causal influence from one node to another node is, the thicker the edge between the two nodes will be. Furthermore, the size of the nodes are proportional to their centrality, that is the ratio of their outgoing influences to the overall influences.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> reports the top three influential assets in each industry groups for four time windows that is arg max</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">A j ∈A C A→B (R A j ), where C A→B (R A j ) is defined in (35).</formula><p>For a better visualisation of the time-varying causal influences, we present a selection of estimated DIs between 01/2018 and 12/2022 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>. The x-axis of this figure presents the beginning of the 57 time periods in which the DIs defined in (34) are estimated. Note that each time period is about three months and the y-axis presents the estimated values of the DIs.</p><p>In the top right of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>, we observe that our method detects a heightened level of interaction between cryptocurrencies and assets in other industry groups during the first half of 2020. This increase coincides with the COVID-19 crisis and the Federal Reserve's response to it. Additionally, notable periods in 2022 are aligned with significant events, such as the collapse of Terra in May 2022, which erased $50 billion in valuation, and the FTX crisis in November 2020. The plot illustrates the influence of assets from other industry groups on cryptocurrencies, where all groups exhibit almost similar patterns. To quantify this influence, we applied a threshold to include only significant influences. Generally, as observed in the plot, the influence from assets in other industry groups on cryptocurrencies was comparatively lower before 2020. For complete list of the results, please see Appendix D.4.</p><p>In the top left of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>, we observe a surprising deviation from existing studies, which predominantly suggest that the influence of cryptocurrencies on the stock market was insignificant before 2020. These studies often focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, representing the crypto market, and their interactions with stock market indices using relatively simplistic models. However, our results reveal a different scenario when we concentrate on a specific segment of the market, including only assets in financial sectors, and incorporate a broader range of crypto assets. We found that, even before 2020, there were significant influences from cryptocurrencies to these industry groups, particularly Banks and Diversified Finance, indicative of the capital market. In 2020, an increase in the influence of cryptocurrencies on Banks and other sectors was observed. Although our study did not focus on other sectors and industries, similar analyses could be applied to them. Given these findings, we can assert that cryptocurrencies, as a new sector, have the potential to pose systemic risks within financial networks. These changes in influence can be tracked using our time-varying approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">DIG of the Assets</head><p>An alternative measure of the aggregated influences between different sectors and industry groups is the number of interconnections between the assets of those industries. For instance, the number of edges from assets of Financial/Banks to the assets of Financial/Insurances. Such measure has been used in various work such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Billio et al., 2012)</ref>. This requires the complete causal network between all 124 assets. Hence, we inferred the DIGs of the assets by estimating the time-varying causal network among all 124 assets by estimating the DIs in (37) in a rolling window moving bock bootstrapping scheme for 57 different time instances within the time horizon between 01/2018 and 12/2022. Estimating the complete network presents the challenge of high-dimensionality. As discussed in Section 2.2, to determine the influence of node i on node j at time t, it's necessary to estimate I t,S (R i → R j || R -{i,j} ). In this study, this required estimating a joint distribution with a dimension of 124. Generally, such non-parametric estimation, without any knowledge and assumption about the underlying distribution, demands a substantial volume of independent samples, which were limited in our empirical study. To address this, we approximated the DIs by dimension reduction. Instead of conditioning on the entire set R -{i,j} with 122 elements, we conditioned on a smaller subset S ′ j ⊂ R -{i,j} with only 10 elements, comprising assets most correlated with R j . Specifically, we ranked institutions in R -{i,j} by their correlation with R j and selected the top 10 for the conditioning set. This approximation is based on the fact that the conditioning set R -{i,j} can be reduced to only the set of all direct causes of R j within the set R -{i,j} . By postulating that these causes are among the highly correlated assets with R j , we obtained the approximation.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref> presents the resulting number of connections within and between different industry groups and crypto. For instance, the curve labeled with 'into Banks' demonstrates the number of edges from assets that are not categorized as Financial/Banks to assets that are categorized as Financial/Banks. The curve labeled with 'within industries' shows the number of edges that both of its end nodes are assets of the same industries, e.g., edges between assets of Insurances or edges between assets of Cryptos. The curve 'between industries' is the total number of edges from one industry to an another industry.</p><p>Comparing the results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>, we observe similarities. For instance, as it is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref> (top right), there is higher amount of influences from other industries on Crypto during 11/4/2019 to 11/3/2020 and similarly in this time window, the number of edges coming into the Crypto's assets from other assets are higher according to the 'into crypto' curve in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>As cryptocurrencies increasingly cement their position in the global financial landscape, understanding their dynamic interactions with other parts of the financial network has become crucial for policymakers and regulators. These assets, once peripheral, are now integral to financial markets, necessitating a deeper comprehension of their influence and interconnectedness. Addressing this need, our paper introduces a novel analytical framework that captures the evolving nature of these interactions through time series data.</p><p>Methodologically, our study introduces groundbreaking approaches in network analysis. The Time-Varying Directed Information Graph (TV-DIG) measure, a first-of-its-kind information-theoretic framework, allows for capturing time-varying causal relationships in a general network of time series. We complement this with a robust, non-parametric method for estimating TV-DI, utilizing rolling window moving block bootstrapping combined with advanced machine learning estimators for mutual information. This methodological innovation not only enhances the estimation process of Directed Information (DI) but also provides a powerful tool for inferring aggregated causal effects. Such tools are crucial for understanding complex influences within financial networks, like identifying the most or least influential sectors in the global financial network.</p><p>Empirically, this study marks a pioneering effort in analyzing the systemic risk posed by crypto assets to financial networks. We reveal the intricate and dynamic nature of interactions between cryptocurrencies and other financial assets, shedding light on potential cross-sector spillovers. The insights gleaned are invaluable for policymakers and regulators, providing a framework to track fund flows across various investment channels and to detect significant influences of cryptocurrencies on other sectors. Our findings challenge existing notions by illustrating significant pre-2020 influences of cryptocurrencies on certain financial sectors, underscoring the poten-tial systemic risks posed by this new asset class. The time-varying approach we developed offers a novel perspective in tracking these evolving influences, thereby contributing to the understanding and management of systemic risks in financial networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. Examples</head><p>Example 3. Consider a network of three times series {X, Y, Z} with the following VAR model also known as structural equation model (SEM):</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">  Z t X t Y t   =   -0.5 0 0 0.4 0.5 0 -1 √ 2 0 -0.2     Z t-1 X t-1 Y t-1   +   ϵ z,t ϵ x,t ϵ y,t   , (A.1)</formula><p>where ϵ x , ϵ y , and ϵ z are three independent stationary Gaussian processes with mean zero and covariance matrix diag(0.8, 0.9, 1) that is a diagonal matrix. Due to the functional relationships between these time series, the causal network of this model is X ← Z → Y , i.e., there are influences from Z to X and from Z to Y because X t and Y t both depend on Z t-1 . This can also be inferred using the DIs in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>); it is straightforward to show that</p><formula xml:id="formula_82">I(X → Y ||Z) = 0, I(X → Z||Y ) = 0, I(Y → X||Z) = 0, I(Y → Z||X) = 0, I(Z → Y ||X) ≈ 0.18, I(Z → X||Y ) ≈ 0.07.</formula><p>In this example, since the model is linear and the exogenous noises are Gaussian, the expression in (2) can be computed in terms of the covariance matrices, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_83">I(Z → Y ||X) = 1 2T T t=1 log |Σ Y t-1 YtX t-1 ||Σ Z t-1 Y t-1 X t-1 | |Σ Y t-1 X t-1 ||Σ Z t-1 Y t-1 YtX t-1 | , (A.2)</formula><p>where |Σ Y t-1 YtX t-1 | denotes the determinant of the covariance matrix of (Y t-1 , Y t , X t-1 ).</p><p>Note that none of the above DIs are pairwise as they have conditioned on the remaining time series.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof of Proposition 2</head><p>First, we need to show that if there is no arrow from R j to R i in the corresponding DIG, then ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">17</ref>) hold. This case is straight forward, since when I(R j → R i ||R -{i,j} ) = 0, then for all t, R i,t is independent of R t-1 j given R t-1 -{j} .

Thus, Y i,t is independent of Y t-1 j given {Y t-1 -{j} , S i,t }. If we show P(S i,t |Y t-1 ) = P(S i,t |Y t-1 -{j} ), using the above equality, we obtain that P(Y i,t |Y t-1 ) = P(Y i,t |Y t-1 -{j} ) for all t which implies I(Y j → Y i ||Y -{i,j} ) = 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D.2. Non-linearity Test</head><p>We applied a non-linearity test on the data to determine whether the underlying structure within the recorded data is linear or nonlinear. The non-linearity test applied is based on non-linear principle component analysis (PCA) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kruger et al. (2008)</ref>. This test works as follows, the range of recorded data is divided into smaller disjunct regions; and accuracy bounds are determined for the sum of the discarded eigenvalues of each region. If this sum is within the accuracy bounds for each region, the process is assumed to be linear. Conversely, if at least one of these sums is outside, the process is assumed to be nonlinear.</p><p>More precisely, the second step in this test requires computation of the correlation matrix for each of the disjunct regions. Since the elements of this matrix are obtained using a finite dataset, applying t-distribution and χ 2 -distribution establish confidence bounds for both estimated mean and variance, respectively. Subsequently, these confidence bounds can be utilized to determine thresholds for each element in the correlation matrix. Using these thresholds, the test calculates maximum and minimum eigenvalues relating to the discarded score variables, which in turn allows the determination of both a minimum and a maximum accuracy bound for the variance of the prediction error of the PCA model. This is because the variance of the prediction error is equal to the sum of the discarded eigenvalues. If this sum lies inside the accuracy bounds for each disjunct region, a linear PCA model is then appropriate over the entire region. Alternatively, if at least one of these sums is outside the accuracy bounds, the error variance of the PCA model residuals then differs significantly for this disjunct region and hence, a nonlinear model is required.  We divided the operating region into 3 disjunct regions. The accuracy bounds for each disjuct region and also sum of the discarded eigenvalues were computed. These bounds were based on thresholds for each element of the correlation matrix corresponding to confidence level of 95%. The processes were normalized with respect to the mean and variance of the regions for which the accuracy bounds were computed. Figure D.12 shows the accuracy bounds and the sum of the discarded eigenvalues. As figures D.12-(a) and D.12-(b) illustrate, the recorded data shows nonlinearity between series.</p></div>

The data sample is randomly divided into two subsets S 1 and S 2 of N and M points, respectively. In the first stage, an k-nearest density estimator P X,Y,Z at the N points of S 1 is estimated using the M realizations of S 2 as follows: Let d(x, y) denote the Euclidean distance between two vectors x and y and d k (x) denotes the Euclidean distance between a point x and its k-th nearest neighbor among S 2 . The k-nearest region is S k (x) := {y : d(x, y) ≤ d k (x)} and the volume of this region is V k (x) := S k (x) 1dn.</p><p>The standard k-nearest density estimator of <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sricharan et al.
