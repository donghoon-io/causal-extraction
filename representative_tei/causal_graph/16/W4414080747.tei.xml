<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A major goal of behavioural ecology is to explain how phenotypic and ecological factors shape the networks of social relationships that animals form with one another. This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood-and addressed-as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects-namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A major goal of behavioural ecology is to explain how ecological and evolutionary processes affect social structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Behavioural ecologists observe natural variation in social behaviour, and ask: "why?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Why do certain individuals cooperate by supporting each other against conspecifics, or by spending a substantial amount of time grooming? Why do other individuals confront each other in agonistic fights, sometimes at the risk of their lives? Ecology and evolution offer theoretical models to explain why individuals behave in certain ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Network Science provides valuable analytical tools to bridge theoretical predictions with empirical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To make inferences about the determinants of social structure, it is useful to first operationalise the system as a social network (see our Glossary in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). Typically, a social network is composed of nodes that represent individual animals, and edges, which represent the social interactions or relationships between them. We find it important to distinguish three levels of abstraction for any social network under investigation (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These levels differ regarding what the edges represent. In the highest level of abstraction, the network edges correspond to the theoretical construct that we most often wish to study (first level in <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>. That is the social relationship between two individuals, or an aspect of it like affiliation, dominance, agonistic support, tolerance, or friendship <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. These constructs cannot be observed directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. They are abstractions, often assumed to be composed of-or expressed as-a diverse range of behavioural interactions, and can only be approximated.</p><p>In the second level of abstraction, the network edges correspond to one type of quantifiable social interaction. These interactions are generally used as a proxy for the theoretical construct of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>-though it can be the target network in some cases, e.g., when studying disease spread. Hereafter, we refer to this level as the interaction network (Fig 1 ), and assume that it is used as a proxy for a latent construct of interest. Researchers choose which behavioural proxy to use based on knowledge of their study system ("How do I best approximate what I want to capture?"). For instance, allogrooming (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>), or spatial proximity </p></div>

(e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>), may capture affiliative relationships in different species. Researchers also determine which proxy to use based on practical constraints ("What can I measure?"). Certain behavioural interactions may be reliable indicators of affiliation, but occur too rarely to be of practical use (e.g., "bridging" behaviour in macaques, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). How the theoretical construct of interest relates to the interaction network is of critical importance for future research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). It is, however, beyond the scope of the present manuscript. That is, we take for granted that the interaction network is a reasonable proxy for the theoretical construct of interest. Third, it is typically impossible to observe every interaction event within the study system. Instead, researchers sample the study population using standardised behavioural protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The data generated through the use of these protocols-e.g., 1% of all grooming boutsare then used to approximate the network of all interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These data, which we also further refer to as sample or observations, correspond to the third level of abstraction (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>In the following sections, we use these concepts to describe common issues in animal social network analysis, and argue that they should be understood as problems of causal inference. We then introduce a novel, relatively simple, framework that explicitly addresses these issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common problems in animal social network analysis</head><p>Establishing the connection between observations (third level) and unobserved interaction network (second level) is a major inferential challenge in animal social network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A popular approach to approximate the interaction network is to aggregate the observed interactions at the individual-or dyad-level. These approaches include the use of Simple Ratio Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and composite "Dyadic Sociality Index" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, to quantify edge weight. The edge weights can be aggregated at the node level to calculate, for instance, node degree or strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. These metrics are then commonly used as predictor or outcome variables in multivariable regression procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>However, using such network summary metrics in statistical models amounts to treating the unobserved interaction network (second level) as being observed. In practice, the observed interactions are noisy samples of the interaction networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Suppose we are interested in studying the rate at which two individuals groom. In one case, we observe these two individuals for 1 hour, and record 1 grooming bout (i.e. a grooming "event") between them. In a second case, we observe the same two individuals groom 100 times over 100 hours of observation. In both cases, the observed rate (i.e., the Simple Ratio Index) is equal to 1 grooming bout per hour. Yet, we are more uncertain about the real grooming rate in the first case, where the individuals have been observed for a shorter period. The data-aggregating procedures mentioned above would typically treat them as equivalent, and this invalidates probability calculations-different amounts of evidence must be reflected in inferential uncertainty. To deal with the uncertainty inherent to aggregating observations (hereafter referred to as problem I), behavioural ecologists traditionally attempt to collect a large amount of data to produce an accurate approximation of the unobserved interaction network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. But whether a given amount of data is "sufficient" for an accurate approximation of the network is hard to determine.</p><p>A related issue is that of "biases" introduced by the sampling process (problem II). The sampling regime itself may make some individuals appear more or less sociable than they actually are. Farine <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> provides an example where females are more gregarious than males in a hypothetical population of animals. However, females are sampled less regularly than the males (e.g., because the males are more visible). As a result, the two sexes appear equally gregarious. Permutation methods have been proposed to solve these sorts of issues, sometimes framed as problems of "non-independence of social network data" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. However, the utility of permutation methods for social network analysis has been challenged, as they carry several, fundamental, flaws <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. A rich literature in network science <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and recent work in animal social network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> proposes to solve the issues of noise and biases introduced by the sampling process, by defining the true interaction rates as parameters in a Bayesian Model. We will return to this idea in detail, further below.</p><p>Social network data present yet another challenge-often framed as the "non independence in social network data" as well-but here, due to structuring features of the network. As opposed to the data dependencies caused to the sampling process, structural dependencies among edges are already present in the interaction network (second level). Consider, for instance, three edges from a hypothetical social network: the number of interactions given from an individual a to another individual b, the interactions from a to c; and those from a to d. The three edges will likely be more similar to each other than they are to the other edges in the network, because the actor, in the three cases, is a <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Interactions from a to b, and those in the opposite direction, from b to a, often covary as well. In the presence of dyadic reciprocity, dyads with a high rate of interaction in one direction will have a high interaction rate in the opposite direction too <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. A third example regards triadic closure: it is often possible to learn about the value of the edge between a-c, given knowledge about the value of the edges a-b and b-c. This can be the case because a, b, and c all belong to the same kin group, where they engage in more interactions than with non-kin. The line between the two types of dependencies we have introduced (i.e. due to sampling, and structural) is however not strict. An individual's features might affect how they behave-creating structural dependency among its edges-and, in turn, its behaviour can affect the sampling process, e.g., if more gregarious individuals are sampled more regularly.</p><p>Ignoring structuring features of the network can have deleterious consequences, when the goal of a statistical analysis is to make inference about the effect of a given variable, like sex or age, on social behaviour. First of all, the effect of interest might be confounded (problem III). In this case, a statistical model describing the association between the predictor of interest and social behaviour will not recover the effect of interest, even with infinite sample size. Second, statistical models that ignore this structure can have low efficiency and low predictive accuracy (problem IV). That is, the models won't precisely recover generative parameters, and won't accurately predict unobserved data from the inferred interaction network <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. How to build statistical models in light of structuring features of the network has received ample attention in the field of (human) Social Network Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Statistical models in behavioural ecology are rarely built in light of the structuring features of the social network, and might greatly benefit from incorporating these approaches.</p><p>In summary, inference from animal social networks implies several difficulties. Samples often look very different from the actual interaction network, because of noise (problem I) and potential biases (problem II) introduced by the sampling process. Structuring features of the social network further create associations between edges in the interaction network, and should be considered when building statistical models (problems III and IV). In the remaining sections of this manuscript, we argue that all of these issues are part of-and should be addressed as-one larger kind of problem: a problem of causal inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal inference in animal behavioural ecology</head><p>Behavioural ecologists ask mechanistic questions about behaviour, causal questions. However, like other scientists, they face a dilemma. Many are taught that the only way to infer causality from data is to run a randomised controlled experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Arguing otherwise can be perceived as endorsing the statement that "correlation implies causation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Yet, researchers often cannot run such experiments in their study system, for ethical or practical reasons. They must address causal questions using observational data, but under the idea that causal inference from non-experimental data is impossible.</p><p>As a result, many observational studies are causally ambiguous <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. It is common to see scientific papers reporting observational studies with causal claims in their titles and abstracts-e.g., X drives Y in species Z. These papers begin with a largely causal reading of the literature (e.g., authors J found an effect of X on Y in species W). The Methods section, however, rarely contains transparent causal assumptions, even if statistical models are usually adjusted by "control" variables to avoid confounding biases-a clearly causal consideration. The Results section is most of the time free of causal language as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. For instance, a variable, X, is said to be simply associated, or correlated, with the outcome of interest, Y. But the discussions and conclusions often turn to explicitly causal vocabulary again: the authors discuss causal explanations for the observed pattern of association, as well as their implications.</p><p>In the end, statistical models from which causal evidence is assessed have generally not been logically linked to licensing causal assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. For this reason, it can be hard to evaluate how strong the causal evidence actually is. It may be difficult to know what exactly is the quantity a statistical model is supposed to estimate (what is the causal estimand), why is a statistical model by certain variables and not others (under which assumptions is the effect identifiable); or how to interpret the statistical parameters in terms of the causal structure of the study system <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</p><p>Instead, inappropriate, non-causal approaches are often used to decide which "control" variables to include in a statistical model when the aim of the analysis is causal inference. A core problem is the use of predictive techniques that are given causal interpretation, for instance by selecting the predictor variables of a multivariable regression based on Information Criterion (e.g., AIC) or Cross-Validation procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Another approach is to select covariates based on their p-values, for example by dropping non-significant variables. Researchers may also be advised to include all predictors that are assumed to affect the response variable. These approaches are insufficient to licence a statistical model designed to estimate a causal effect, because their logic has nothing to do with control of confounding, but other goals like forecasting or error control under random treatment assignment. In fact, well-meaning use of covariates may introduce biases-e.g., collider bias or posttreatment bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>.</p><p>We propose an alternative to the approaches mentioned above, by integrating tools from the field of formal Causal Inference with Bayesian statistical modelling. Causal inference in experiments depends upon the logic of random treatment assignment for modifying a causal model of the system under study. Causal inference in observational settings depends upon the same logic, in the absence of random treatment assignment. Both settings, experiments and observation, require in principle an explicit model of the data-generating process, a causal model. The causal model, combined with one or more questions, can transparently and objectively justify one or more statistical models.</p><p>In our case, what is needed is a model of the causal factors driving the observed social interaction network, as well as a transparent workflow that links it to hypotheses and data analysis. We describe this workflow in three parts. First, we show how to represent hypotheses about social networks as formal causal models. For the sake of generality and communication, we use Directed Acyclic Graphs, or DAGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>, to describe the causal structures underlying animal social interaction networks. Second, we show how to explore the empirical implications of the DAG by building Structural Causal Models (SCM), which can be used for synthetic data simulation. Third, we combine these two types of causal models with matched multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model, a generative statistical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>, and show that it can recover structural parameters from the simulations. This provides the grounds for the development and justification of an empirical workflow in which statistical models have been developed and tested transparently under specific causal assumptions.</p><p>Our aim is not to provide a "one size fits all" model. Rather, the framework emphasises on the basic causal structure of animal social interaction networks, and on how they can be estimated with statistical models. Accordingly, empiricists interested in studying the drivers of social network structure can build upon our models, by tailoring them to their specific questions and study system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanics of the framework</head><p>We build the framework step by step, through four simulation studies that incrementally present its elements in detail.</p><p>In simulation 1, we introduce the basic elements of our causal model. They define the link between the observed network (third level of abstraction) and the interaction network (second level), and specify assumptions about the factors shaping the interaction network. We encode-i.e. translate to a formal language-these assumptions using two types of causal models, a DAG and a SCM. We start by assuming that the structuring features are random. We then introduce the Social Relations Model, and show that it can recover the parameters of the SCM.</p><p>Next, we show how individual-(simulation 2) and dyad-level features (simulation 3) can affect the interaction network. We highlight that well-specified statistical models can accurately recover the causal effects encoded in the simulations. We also show how statistical models that are not adjusted by the structuring feature are affected by the causal effects, through their varying-effects structure, and discuss the interpretation of these effects. The aim of simulations 1-3 is not to be realistic. Instead, they reveal the internal mechanics of our framework.</p><p>In simulation 4, we turn to a more realistic scenario. We build an estimator for the effect of genetic relatedness on affiliation in females of a population of Assamese macaques, where this effect is confounded by dominance rank. We first validate our statistical model using synthetic data, and then fit it to empirical observations. Throughout the simulations, we show how our framework naturally addresses the issues mentioned above (problems I to IV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation study 1: Random structuring features</head><p>Introduction to directed acyclic graphs. DAGs are a simple and powerful tool to describe how variables in a system causally affect one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>. The mathematical and applied literature on DAGs is large. We give here only a necessary conceptual introduction. DAGs are simple, but they are sufficient to describe the fundamental obstacles to, and derive solutions for, causal inference-including the design of experiments and observational studies.</p><p>DAGs are graphs. They are composed of nodes-here, representing variables-and directed edges, encoding causal relationships among these variables. For instance, the following DAG: X → Y can be read as: "X influences Y". There is no universal definition of what "influences" means in science, but in a DAG it means that an intervention on X changes the distribution of Y. In contrast, an intervention on Y would not change X, because of the direction of the arrow. It is important to note that DAGs are qualitative: they do not say anything about the functional form of the causal effects. They simply posit the presence and absence of causal relationships among a set of variables.</p><p>A path is a sequence of two or more adjacent nodes (i.e., nodes directly connected by an arrow). For example, consider:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X → Z → Y.</formula><p>Here, X transmits a causal effect to Y, through a mediator, Z. This specific structure (i.e., a path involving three nodes connected by two arrows pointing in the same direction) is referred to as a chain. Chains are a type of causal paths, as the arrows connecting its two ending points-here, X and Y-go in the same direction. Paths can also be non-causal, as in:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X ← Z → Y.</formula><p>This particular path, where a variable Z is a common cause of two other variables X and Y, is called a fork. It is non-causal because one of the arrows between X and Y goes "backwards".</p><p>Although causal effects (consequences of interventions) only flow through causal paths, statistical association can arise through non-causal paths too. This is a fundamental reason that statistical association does not imply causal relationships. For instance, X and Y are associated in a fork, because of their common cause Z. Their association arises from a common cause, not the influence of one on the other.</p><p>A graph is acyclic if it is impossible to start at any node, and return to it by following causal paths only, or in other words: a node never influences itself. If one were to model feedback loops, they would need to represent time explicitly on a DAG (e.g., X t → Y t → X t+1 ; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>). What makes DAGs directed is that causal arrows can only be single-headed. Double-headed arrows can however be used as shortcuts, to indicate that an unspecified non-causal path connects two variables. For instance, if an unobserved variable U affects both X and Y, it can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X ⟷ Y, which is equivalent to: X ← U → Y.</formula><p>For a general introduction to causal graphs, see Pearl <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> and McElreath <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Directed acyclic graph for simulation study 1. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, we introduce the core elements of our causal framework. It links observed social interactions y in a dyad to the unobserved true rate of interaction m in that dyad, which is caused by features of the individuals, 𝛾 and 𝜌, and of the dyad 𝜏. Each individual is assigned a general tendency to perform a particular behaviour, across all dyads. We call this giving, and represent it with the parameter 𝛾 ("gamma"). Each individual is also assigned a general tendency to receive a behaviour, across dyads. We call this parameter receiving, and represents it with 𝜌 ("rho"). In addition to these general tendencies to give and receive, each individual can have a specific tie with each other individual. We denote these ties with 𝜏 ("tau"). Ties, like m and y are directional-their values in the two directions (from a to b, and from b to a) are not necessarily the same.</p><p>We illustrate how these parameters affect one another in Fig 2A . This DAG embodies assumptions about which factors shape each observed edge y <ref type="bibr">[a,b]</ref> . It is the simplest datagenerating process in our framework: a system where 𝛾, 𝜌, and 𝜏 share no common influences. More formally, we can say that they are only affected by exogenous, independent variables. The most common way to represent this scenario on a DAG is to draw no arrow pointing into these variables. Thus, the propensity of an individual, a, to give interactions to others (𝛾 [a] ), its propensity to receive interactions from others (𝜌 [a] ), and the propensity it has </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝜏 [a,b] (direction 1) 𝜏 [b,a] (direction 2)</formula><p>Encodes assumptions about the effect of dyad-level features on the tendency of an individual, a, to give social interactions with a specific other individual, b.</p><p>Given that X |a,b| is the genetic relatedness between a and b, X |a,b| → 𝜏 [a,b] encodes the following assumption: "The relatedness between a and b affects how many interactions a gives to b".</p><p>We index symmetric dyadic variables, like genetic relatedness, using vertical bars (X |a,b| = X |b,a| ). We index directed dyadic variables using square brackets where the link between y and m was not explicitly causal. We now have a graphical representation of our causal model for simulation 1. However, what it exactly means for a variable to affect the "tendency" of an individual to give, or receive, interactions, as well as the exact nature of the above-mentioned "exogenous variation", depends on the mathematical function that we assign to it. This is why, in the next section, we turn the qualitative assumptions of the DAG into quantitative assumptions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(𝜏 [a,b] is not necessarily equal to 𝜏 [b,a] ).</formula><p>Structural causal model. Structural Causal Models (SCM) are a type of causal model where the functional relationship among variables is defined by a mathematical function <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. It means that they contain assumptions about whether the effects among variablescorresponding to arrows on a causal graph-are positive, negative, strong, linear, etc. SCMs are closely linked to causal graphs, such that there exists a causal graph for each SCM. As SCMs encode quantitative causal assumptions, they can be used as generative models, to simulate observations. Practically, we used SCMs for data simulations that "obey" the causal relations represented on the DAGs, and implemented them in R, version 4.2.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. For each arrow on the DAGs, we defined a function, with arbitrary parameter values. We did so with two main goals. First, each SCM serves as a simple example of data-generating process encoded by its DAG. These simulations can be more tangible than the abstract, non-parametric, knowledge encoded in causal graphs. Second, and perhaps most importantly, SCMs can be used to derive and validate statistical models. We will focus on the former goal in this section, before turning to the latter, in the next section. Below, we provide a mathematical description of the SCM for simulation study 1hereafter SCM 1. We start by defining f 𝛾 , the function determining 𝛾 for each individual:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f 𝛾 ∶ 𝛾 [a] ∼ Normal(0, 0.5)</formula><p>The function determining gamma is defined as follows:</p><p>(1.1.1)</p><p>The value of gamma, for each individual, a...</p></div>

This notation with the ∈ symbol implies that a represents an arbitrary individual index that can take any value from 1 to N, where N is the number of unique individuals in the sample. Accordingly, Eq 1.1.1 should be interpreted as follows: 𝛾 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> , 𝛾 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , … , 𝛾 [N] are distributed as a normal (or Gaussian) distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5. </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f 𝜌 ∶ 𝜌 [a] ∼ Normal(0, 0.5) (1.1.2) f 𝜏 ∶ 𝜏 [a,b] ∼ Normal(0, 0.5).

We can now turn to define how these structural parameters affect m, the true interaction rate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f m ∶ m [a,b] = exp(0.2 + 𝛾 [a] + 𝜌 [b] + 𝜏 [a,b] ).</formula><p>(1.1.4)</p><p>The intercept value 0.2 is the logarithm of how many interactions individuals give to, and receive from, others in the network for an average dyad. Here, this average rate is exp(0.2) ≃ 1.2 interactions. The exponential function of f m , in combination with the additive (or "linear") combination in terms, ensures that the interaction rate m is always positive. It also has the following consequence: the effects of 𝛾, 𝜌 and 𝜏 on m are now multiplicative. It means, for instance, that the effect of 𝜏</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">[a,b] on m [a,b] is larger if 𝛾 [a]</formula><p>and 𝜌 <ref type="bibr">[b]</ref> have large values themselves. We will come back to this issue, because it is a fundamental and unavoidable aspect of modelling behavioural count data with a Generalised Linear Model: causal effects are not simple and additive on the outcome scale, even though we model them as additive on the link scale.</p><p>The rate of behaviour m [a,b] is connected to the observable count y [a,b] through a stochastic process. The simplest choice is a Poisson process:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f y ∶ y [a,b] ∼ Poisson(m [a,b] ).</formula><p>(1.1.5) Eq 1.1.5 defines the relationship between the true interaction rate (second level of abstraction) and the observed number of interactions (third level), represented in Note that the number of individuals in the network, the value of the intercept in f m , or the distributions we have chosen (normal, Poisson), are flexible. We might have, for instance, decided to model binary social events (e.g., has a been seen grooming b during a focal-animal sampling protocol?) instead of unbounded counts, which would make a Bernoulli distribution rather than Poisson appropriate. The key idea in any case is that the target of inference, the rate m and its components, is not observed but must be modelled as filtered by a stochastic sampling process. This stands in contrast to aggregated indices of sociality (e.g., Simple Ratio Index) which produce point estimates of rates, without properly characterizing uncertainty, before decomposing them as functions of explanatory variables.</p><p>In the next section, using the simple simulation defined above, we build a statistical model that aims to uncover-or, in this case, because we are dealing with synthetic data, recover-the parameters of the data-generating process.</p><p>The social relations model. A non-parametric causal model, like a DAG, defines a qualitative hypothesis about how observations arise. A SCM makes this hypothesis into a datagenerating algorithm that can be used for planning, understanding, and validating projects. Using data, whether simulated or real, requires a statistical model. Here, we explain how a statistical network model relates to a DAG and SCM, and how it can be developed and validated together with the causal models.</p><p>Statistical models and causal models are similar but distinct. Causal models contain directionality-they define the consequences of interventions-while statistical models do not. Statistical models contain additional elements that are useful for estimation. Importantly, they can include hierarchical distributions that function to estimates. These elements exist in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches, because they produce better, more produce better, more efficient estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>The statistical models that we use in our framework are extensions of the "Social Relations Model", initially developed in the social sciences by Kenny &amp; La Voie <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Compared to the initial model, ours have a multilevel varying-effect structure, can include covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, and have non-Gaussian likelihoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. They are further implemented in a Bayesian framework (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>; chapter 14) and can incorporate flexible additive effects, such as a stochastic blockmodel, i.e. a model capable of estimating causal effects of observable categorical variables, like sex, on network structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. We wrote the models presented in this manuscript in the Stan probabilistic programming language <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, and ran them through R, using CmdStanR <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>-note however that the Social Relations Model can be implemented using R packages like Rethinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, STRAND <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, or BISoN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In practice, we use statistical models as estimators. Given (i) an estimand, and causal assumptions encoded in (ii) a DAG and (iii) a SCM, we build a statistical model whose goal is to estimate the estimand. In this section, we outline how such a model can learn, by fitting it to known data: the data generated through the simulation above (SCM 1). We feed the statistical model with the number of observed interactions y [a,b] for each directed dyad in the network. Given these data, the model has to recover the unobserved rates m [a,b] , as well as other structural parameters. In this first simulation, we do not focus on one particular estimand, but instead describe how the statistical model generally learns about the social network structure.</p><p>Below, we mathematically define the statistical model of simulation study 1 (hereafter statistical model 1). We start by describing the observed data y-here, one data point per directed dyad-using a conservative choice of probability distribution for unbounded count data: the Poisson distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">y [a,b] ∼ Poisson(m [a,b] ) (1.2.1)</formula><p>This line can be read as such: "y [a,b] is described using a Poisson distribution, whose average rate is m [a,b] ". Here, y [a,b] is known, and m [a,b] is not: it has to be estimated. Recall that as opposed to Eq 1.1.5, we are, here, describing a statistical model, which learns the value of unobserved variables, like m. For this reason, the model will return a posterior probability distribution for each parameter m <ref type="bibr">[a,b]</ref> . Statistical models and SCMs can be visually differentiated in this manuscript, because each structural equation is defined by a function f. m [a,b] is further defined in terms of several parameters:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">m [a,b] = exp(D + G [a] + R [b] + T [a,b] ) (1.2.2)</formula><p>As in the SCM, the exp (exponential) function ensures that m remains positive; it corresponds to the so-called inverse-link function. D, G, R, and T are all unobserved. Like m, they have to be estimated, and will be assigned a posterior probability distribution.</p><p>D, the intercept, is fixed across all dyads. It is equivalent to the intercept of 0.2 in SCM 1, which it should recover. In this simulation study, G, R, and T can be thought of as the statistical counterpart of the structural parameters 𝛾, 𝜌, and 𝜏 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>). G [a] captures the general propensity (i.e. the average rate, on the link scale), of an individual, a, to give social interactions to other individuals in the network. It is only affected by 𝛾 [a] , and hence, G <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> should, for instance, recover 𝛾 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> . R . In later simulation studies (e.g., in simulation study 3), we will see cases where the statistical and structural parameters are not equivalent.</p><p>To efficiently estimate the components of the rate m [a,b] , it is useful to employ hierarchical distributions that relate the components to one another and allow them to share information through those statistical relationships. In practice, this means that G [a] and R [a] are described as varying-effects in a Multivariate Normal distribution.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">( G [a] R [a] ) ∼ MVNormal [( 0 0 ) , ( s 2 G c GR s G s R c GR s G s R s 2 R )]</formula><p>The average individual giving and receiving rates... The distribution, in this case, has two dimensions: G and R. Its mean of {0, 0} implies that G [a] and R [a] are deviations from the average interaction rate in the network, D. Centring the distribution on {0, 0} also ensures that G and R can be uniquely estimated from the data. s G and s R describe the amount of variation in G [a] and R [a] , respectively. If, for instance, individuals vary a lot in how many interactions they give to others, but do not vary much in how many interactions they receive from others, then s G will be large, and s R will be small. The pattern of covariation between these two dimensions is then captured by c GR . Suppose a network where individuals who give a lot of interactions also receive a lot of interactions. This situation would result in a positive estimate for c GR .</p><p>Similarly the directed ties in the network are modeled hierarchically, using parameters for structure within and among dyads:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">( T [a,b] T [b,a] ) ∼ MVNormal [( 0 0 ) , ( s 2 T c TT s 2 T c TT s 2 T s 2 T )] . (1.2.4)</formula><p>Eq 1.2.4 is similar to Eq 1.2.3, with one exception. There is only one variance parameter in the variance-covariance matrix: s 2 T . Recall that a and b are only arbitrary labels. Thus, there is no reason why the variation in T [a,b] should be different from that of T [b,a] . c TT hence describes the association between the number of interactions that a gives to b, and those that b gives to a, conditional on their respective averages G [a] and R <ref type="bibr">[b]</ref> . We will see further below how this parameter may be interpreted biologically, in light of causal models. We provide details about the prior probability distributions, as well as the exact parametrisation of our statistical model, in the sections A.2-A.3 of S1 Text.</p><p>In this section, we have defined the basic architecture of the Social Relations Model (which we sometimes refer to as non-adjusted Social Relations Model). A feature of this model we want to highlight is that it describes the true rate of interactions m as a statistical parameter, for which a probability distribution is computed using Bayesian updating. This represents a principled solution to deal with the uncertainty and noise inherent to sampling social interactions (problem I). It notably contrasts with data-aggregation methods that we mentioned above, which treat data y (third level of abstraction) as the known, true interaction rates (second level). Moreover, the varying effects of the Social Relations Model explicitly describe several patterns of (co)variations-i.e. structural "dependencies"-present in social networks, like those mentioned in the introduction (problem IV). This results in more accurate and efficient estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</p><p>Posterior model. In this section, we describe posterior model 1: the model fit obtained by feeding the data generated by SCM 1 into statistical model 1. We ran 15 iterations of the SCM, and fitted the data from each iteration into the statistical model. Thus, we obtained 15 marginal posterior distributions per "fixed-effect", or population level parameters (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>). We show each parameter's posterior distributions with its target value, i.e. the value it should recover, given that we know the generative model. The pattern one would expect from an estimator that accurately recovers structural parameters is the following: over several iterations, the highdensity regions of the marginal distributions should overlap with the target value. Accordingly, we see that our estimator works, as the posterior distributions overlap well with the target values. This kind of model checking can be formalized as simulation based calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, but even a few simulations are often sufficient to spot problems in conceptualising and programming the SCM, the statistical model, or both. The general idea is: until we are prepared to interpret estimates from synthetic data, we are unprepared to interpret estimates from real data.</p><p>The mapping between the structural and statistical parameters is, in the case of SCM 1, rather straightforward. Starting with D, we expect the statistical parameter to recover the intercept value of 0.2 (Eq 1. Conclusions. In simulation 1, we have modelled a simple data-generating process, which describes the factors shaping the observed edges of a social network. We assumed that the general tendencies of individuals to interact with conspecifics, as well as their propensity to engage in social interactions with specific partners, were random. We started by describing the abstract causal structure of this system, using a DAG. Next, we implemented this DAG as a SCM: a type of data simulation, where we specified parametric features of the causal system. We then fed the synthetic data into a statistical model, and showed that the statistical model could recover the structural parameters of the SCM. In the following section, we will turn to the following question: how can we use the models introduced in this section, to estimate the causal effect of individual-level features on their general propensity to engage in social interactions?</p></div>

Suppose that we wish to study the effect of an individual-level phenotypic variable X [a] (e.g., age) on the overall tendency of individuals to give and receive social interactions (e.g., grooming), in a specific social system (e.g., a group of monkeys). We might, for instance, hypothesise that increasing age causes individual monkeys to generally disengage from their social group, and thus, to give and receive fewer grooming interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>. Such a system may be represented as a DAG where X [a] has a direct effect on 𝛾 [a] and 𝜌 [a] (see Fig <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</p><p>We wish to build an estimator that can estimate this effect. To do so, we specify quantitative causal assumptions using SCM 2.

Thus, we also fitted the data generated with SCM 2 into statistical model 1.</p><p>Posterior This means that our estimator is capable of producing valid causal inference under the assumptions embodied by the DAG and the SCM. On the right panel of Fig 4C , we observe important deviations between, on the one hand, the target values of the adjusted estimator, and, on the other hand, the posterior distributions of the non-adjusted statistical model. The posterior distributions of s G and s R -respectively quantifying the variation in G [a] and R [a] -are now consistently higher than 0.5. This is because G [a] and R [a] are caused by 𝛾 [a] and 𝜌 <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref> , which are themselves caused by two kinds of variables. They are affected by random noise, quantified by a Gaussian SD of 0.5, and by X [a] (see Eq 2.1.2-2.1.3). Hence, s G and s R are larger than 0.5 if we don't stratify by X [a] (right panel), but are equal to 0.5 once we do condition on-or "control for"-it (left panel).</p><p>Furthermore, the posterior distribution of c GR is positive in the non-adjusted model ( Conclusions. In simulation 2, we have modelled a data-generating process where an individual-level trait X [a] (e.g., age) affected the general tendency of individuals to give and receive social interactions. Following the same workflow as in simulation 1, we showed that a well-specified estimator-an adjusted version of the Social Relations Model-could accurately recover the causal effect of X [a] on social network structure. Next, we highlighted how the causal effect of X [a] impacted the varying-effects structure of the statistical model, when X [a] was not adjusted for. We refer the interested readers to the supplementary Sect C in S1 Text: there, we describe simulation study 2', a variation of simulation study 2, where X [a] is a categorical variable (e.g., sex). In the next section, we turn to the following question: how can we build a statistical model to estimate the effect of dyad-level features on the propensity of two individuals to socially interact with one another?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation study 3: Dyad-level features</head><p>Suppose that we wish to study how the genetic relatedness of individuals affects the way they interact with one another. We may hypothesise that individuals belonging to the same kin group engage in a greater number of affiliative interactions than non-kin. Furthermore, sampling effort may vary across individuals and dyads, for behavioural observation is conducted by following focal animals using standardised protocols. Individuals of some dyads might have been observed for several hours of behavioural sampling, while others might have been followed for very little time.</p><p>Causal model. We represent the causal structure of such a data-generating process on a DAG (Fig 5A ), where we specify these causal relationships, as well as the link between individual-and dyad-level features. The combinations of two individuals' kin groups, K (for a discussion on deterministic arrows, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>). Note that there is no path between Re |a,b| and m [a,b] that passes through S |a,b| . This means that S |a,b| does not confound the effect of Re |a,b| . Yet, we still want to include it in our estimator (see next section), for doing so will increase the model's precision.</p><p>Before building the estimator, we translate the assumptions of the DAG into SCM 3. We simulate 20 individual animals, belonging to 11 different kin groups: 10 individuals belong to one, large, kin group, and each of the 10 remaining individuals are alone in their kin group <ref type="bibr">(Fig I in S1 Text)</ref>. For simplicity, we dichotomise genetic relatedness, such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">f Re ∶ Re |a,b| = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 1 if K [a] = K [b] 0 if K [a] ≠ K [b] (3.1.1)</formula><p>We further assume that the variation in sampling effort is random:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">f S [a] ∶ S [a] ∼ Uniform(1, 2.5). (3.1.2)</formula><p>The observation effort per individual takes a value between 1 and 2.5 time units-e.g., the number of full days of focal-follows. We then combine the sampling effort of the two interacting individuals into their dyad-level sampling effort:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">f S |a,b| ∶ S |a,b| = S [a] + S [b] . (3.1.3)</formula><p>Then, we define how different variables affect 𝛾, 𝜌, and 𝜏:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">f 𝛾 ∶ 𝛾 [a] ∼ Normal(0, 0.5) (3.1.4) f 𝜌 ∶ 𝜌 [a] ∼ Normal(0, 0.5) (3.1.5) f 𝜏 ∶ 𝜏 [a,b] ∼ Normal(log(S |a,b| ) + 0.8 * ⋅ Re |a,b| , 0.5), (3.1.6)</formula><p>Where the ∼ symbol on top of Re |a,b| means that we standardised it using a z-transformation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">f m ∶ m [a,b] = exp(-1.2 + 𝛾 [a] + 𝜌 [b] + 𝜏 [a,b] ) (3.1.7) f y ∶ y [a,b] ∼ Poisson(m [a,b] ). (3.1.8)</formula><p>Compared to the SCMs above, the intercept is set to -1.2, to make the interaction rates similar to those in the simulation studies above. In SCM 3, an unrelated average dyad observed for 3.5 time units, would have an expected value of m To illustrate how the offset log(S |a,b| ) scales the rates m [a,b] -through its effect on 𝜏 [a,b] -, imagine two average, directed dyads <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, each composed of non-kin. Assume their respective rate of interaction per one time unit is identical, and is equal to: exp(-1.2 + log(1)) = exp(-1.2) = 0.3. Let S |1,2| = 4 and S |12,9| = 2. Consequently, the dyads' interaction rates will be scaled by their respective values of S |a,b| , such that: m <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> = exp(-1.2 + log( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">4</ref>)) = 1.2 and m <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> = exp(-1.2 + log(2)) = 0.6. Their meaning, thus, slightly differs from one another: m <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> is now the average number of interactions per four times units, and m <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> is the average number of interactions per two time units. In Sect E of S1 Text, we show an alternative parameterisation of SCM 3 model where S |a,b| affects y </p><formula xml:id="formula_27">y [a,b] ∼ Poisson(m [a,b] ) (3.2.1) m [a,b] = exp(D + G [a] + R [b] + T [a,b] ). (3.2.2) Like in statistical model 1, G [a] and R [a] are part of a Multivariate adaptive prior distribu- tion, ( G [a] R [a] ) ∼ MVNormal [( 0 0 ) , ( s 2 G c GR s G s R c GR s G s R s 2 R )] . (3.2.3)</formula><p>T [a,b] is, however, described by a submodel, stratified by the causes of 𝜏 [a,b] :</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">T [a,b] = log(S |a,b| ) + T [a,b] + b * T ⋅ Re |a,b| (3.2.4) ( T [a,b] T [b,a] ) ∼ MVNormal [( 0 0 ) , ( s 2 T c TT s 2 T c TT s 2 T s 2 T )] . (3.2.5)</formula><p>The submodel for T [a,b] is offsetted by log(S |a,b| ), which works like the offset of SCM 3. By making dyads comparable to one another, this term naturally deals with the issue of sampling biases that we introduced earlier (problem II). b * T , accordingly, captures the association between genetic relatedness and m [a,b] , conditional on the variation in S |a,b| among dyads. This parameter should recover our estimand by taking a value of 0.8. The full specification of statistical model 3 can be found in Sect D.2 of S1 Text. In addition to statistical model 3, we also fitted the data generated by SCM 3 to a version of statistical model 3 that was not adjusted by Re |a,b| . That is, Eq 3. , etc., such that the parameters capturing their patterns of (co)variation-s G , s R , c GRcould be directly mapped onto the structural model. However, this is not the case here. We see that the estimates for s G , s R and c GR substantially deviate from the grey dots-i.e., the value they wound take if none of the effect of 𝜏 Conclusions. In simulation study 3, we modelled a data-generating process where two dyad-level variables affected the observed social interactions among individuals. Genetic relatedness, a biological variable, affected the rate at which individuals interacted with one another; it was our estimand. Sampling effort, a variable describing the sampling process, further impacted the scale of the interaction rates. We then built our estimator in combination with a DAG and a SCM, and successfully recovered the true causal effect. Next, we showed that dyad-level causal effects could impact individual-and dyad-level varying parameters, when not accounted for. Once again, we refer the interested readers to simulation study 3' , a variation of simulation study 3, where we estimate the causal effect of a categorical dyad-level variable, like the combination of sexes, using a stochastic block model structure (Sect F in S1 Text). In the next section, building upon our previous models, we ask: how can we develop a statistical model to estimate the effect of a dyad-level variable if this effect is confounded (problem III)?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical example</head><p>In this section, we showcase the use of our framework to address a causal question in a specific empirical system. Our aim is to estimate the effect of maternal relatedness on affiliative behaviour in the females of a wild population of Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis). The causal assumptions that we will make about this social system are, although crude, reasonably realistic. Thus we will conclude the section by fitting our estimator to an empirical dataset, and we will show how to compute causal estimates on the outcome scale from the joint posterior probability distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation study 4: Kinship in female macaques</head><p>Verbal description. Kinship in female macaques, like in other Cercopithecinae species, is thought to be a major driver of social network structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. The kin group of a female macaque not only determines who she is genetically related to, it also affects her position in the group's dominance hierarchy. Females (non-genetically) inherit their rank from their mothers, such that individuals in the same kin group generally occupy adjacent ranks. Furthermore, kinship affects the formation of the social groups themselves. When groups of macaques permanently split, they usually divide along matrilines, and members of the same matrilines stay together in the newly formed groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. This phenomenon may result in smaller social groups-often, newly formed ones-to contain fewer kin groups, and thus to have a higher average degree of genetic relatedness.</p><p>The genetic relatedness between two individuals, as well as their respective positions in the dominance hierarchy, might both affect the pattern of affiliative interactions they exchange with one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As suggested earlier, genetically related individuals might exchange more affiliative interactions because of a preference for their kin. Additionally, dominant females may be attractive affiliation partners. Individuals might, accordingly, preferentially target their dominants-rather than their subordinates-with affiliative interactions.</p><p>Directed acyclic graph. We represent this causal system as a DAG (Fig 6A ), and assume that the rate of grooming bouts m [a,b] is a good proxy for affiliative relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The causal graph shares its basic structure with that of simulation study 3. We add an effect of kin group K [a] on individual rank Ra <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref> . Ra <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref> , in combination with Ra [b] then determine the rank difference between two individuals, ΔRa |a,b| , which in turn affects 𝜏 <ref type="bibr">[a,b]</ref> . Finally, we represent group size GS gr |a,b| as a group-level feature (hence the "gr" index). The double-headed arrow between K and GS gr means that they are both connected by an open path. It simply encodes that larger social groups tend to contain more kin groups while remaining agnostic about the complex, underlying, causal mechanism (i.e. group fission).</p><p>An important insight provided by the DAG is that our estimand is confounded by dominance rank (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">6A</ref>). There are now two paths connecting Re |a,b| and m [a,b] . There is, first, a "frontdoor" path, transmitting the causal effect of interest:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">Re → 𝜏 → m,</formula><p>Second, there is a "backdoor" path transmitting a spurious association between Re and m:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">Re ← K → Ra → 𝜏 → m.</formula><p>If we were to regress m [a,b] on Re |a,b| to estimate our estimand without stratifying by rank (as we did in simulation study 3), our effect would be biased by the backdoor path. Note that this would happen even with an infinitely large data set: the causal graph informs us that, because of the backdoor path, our effect simply cannot be estimated by looking at the raw association between Re |a,b| and m [a,b] . To develop a better intuition for this issue, we first translate this DAG into SCM 4.</p><p>Structural causal model. In SCM 4, we create three groups of 10, 15, and 20 individuals, which vary in their maximum number of kin groups N Kgr |a,b| : 3, 5, 7, respectively. Each individual's kin group K [a] is drawn with replacement from the vector {1, … , N Kgr [a] }. Doing so <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013370.g006">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013370.g006</ref> leads to a higher degree of average genetic relatedness in smaller social groups than in larger ones (double arrow in <ref type="bibr">Fig 6)</ref>. The kin groups are then assigned kin-group dominance rank Ra K [a] (i.e. a rank for the whole matriline):</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">f Ra K ∶ Ra K [a] = K [a] . (4.1.1)</formula><p>That is, kin groups are assigned a dominance rank at random. A lower Ra K [a] imply a higher rank. Thus, if Ra K [a] &lt; Ra K [b] , then the dominance rank of all of a's kin is higher than that of all of b's kin. Finally, within each kin group, individuals receive ranks at random too. Overall, these steps represent an implementation of the arrow from K to Ra, resulting in a dominance hierarchy that is stratified by matrilines of various sizes.</p><p>Next, sampling effort varies across individuals and dyads:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">f S [a] ∶ S [a] ∼ Uniform(<label>1, 2.5) (4.1.2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_33">f S |a,b| ∶ S |a,b| = S [a] + S [b] .<label>(4.1.3)</label></formula><p>Sampling effort, genetic relatedness, and dominance rank difference all affect the interaction rate through 𝜏 [a,b] :</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">f 𝜏 ∶ 𝜏 [a,b] ∼ ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ Normal(log(S |a,b| ) + 0.6 * ⋅ Re |a,b| +0.8 ⋅ (Ra [b] -Ra [a] ), 0.5) if R [a] &lt; R [b]</formula><p>Normal(log(S |a,b|</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">) + 0.6 * ⋅ Re |a,b| +0 ⋅ (Ra [b] -Ra [a] ), 0.5) if R [a] ≥ R [b]<label>(4.1.4)</label></formula><p>The main novelty of f 𝜏 , compared to SCM 3, regards the causal effect of rank; or rather, the effect of the difference in ranks Ra [b] -Ra <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref> . Here, individuals increase their interaction rate as a function of how much higher in the hierarchy their partner is: a larger increase for a larger difference. The effect is asymmetrical, and individuals are not impacted by how much lower in the hierarchy their partner is. The remaining structural equations are identical to those in SCM 3: Coming back to our backdoor problem, let us now imagine two directed dyads: [1,2] and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. We assume that the exogenous (random) causes of m <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and m <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> are set to zero. Suppose that the first dyad is composed of kin (Re |1,2| = 1) who occupy adjacent ranks in the dominance hierarchy (ΔRa |1,2| ≃ 0). Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">f 𝛾 ∶ 𝛾 [a] ∼ Normal(0, 0.5) (4.1.5) f 𝜌 ∶ 𝜌 [a] ∼ Normal(0, 0.5) (4.1.6) f m ∶ m [a,b] = exp(-1.2 + 𝛾 [a] + 𝜌 [b] + 𝜏 [a,b] ) (4.1.7) f y ∶ y [a,b] ∼ Poisson(m [a,b] ).

Therefore, m <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> = exp(-1.2 + 0.6 * ⋅ 0 + 0.8 ⋅ 0.7) ≃ 0.5.</p><p>Despite the positive effect of relatedness on grooming rate, m <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> ≃ m <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> , because the two dyads were not comparable to one another with respect to rank. The same applies in the rest of the population, where kin dyads are closer in the dominance hierarchy on average compared to non-kin dyads, thereby making the effect of relatedness unidentifiable by directly comparing kin and non-kin. Instead, to identify the effect of interest, we need to block the path created by rank by conditioning on it (we apply the backdoor criterion; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>). That is, to estimate our estimand, we need to build an estimator that can address the following question: "once we know the difference in rank between a and b, what association remains between genetic relatedness and grooming rate?".</p><p>Statistical model. Statistical model 4 is identical to statistical model 3, except that it includes dominance rank.</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">y [a,b] ∼ Poisson(m [a,b] )<label>(4.2.1</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">m [a,b] = exp(D + G [a] + R [b] + T [a,b] ) (4.2.2) T [a,b] = log(S |a,b| ) + T [a,b] + b * Re ⋅ Re |a,b| + ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ b Ra 1 ⋅ (Ra [b] -Ra [a] ) if R [a] &lt; R [b] b Ra 2 ⋅ (Ra [b] -Ra [a] ) if R [a] ≥ R [b]<label>(4.2.3)</label></formula><p>The stratification by ΔRa |a,b| allows for asymmetrical effects. b Ra 1 should recover the effect of 0.8, and b Ra 2 should recover 0 (Eq 4.1.4).

(4.2.5)</formula><p>The full specification of the model, as well as prior predictive simulations, can be found in Sects G.2 and G.3 of S1 Text. We also fitted the synthetic data to an estimator that was not stratified by rank-i.e. without the second and third lines of Eq 4.2.3-, so that we could visualise the confounding effect of the backdoor path.</p><p>Posterior model (simulated data). Statistical model 4 successfully recovered our estimand by deconfounding the biasing effect of dominance rank (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">6B</ref>). Looking at the left panel, we see that the marginal posterior distributions of b * Re are concentrated on the target value of 0.6. This is not the case for the panel on the right, where the model that was not adjusted by rank gives a consistently biased estimate, close to 0. These results confirm that given our causal assumptions, a statistical model that correctly blocks the backdoor path between Re |a,b| and m [a,b] is necessary to accurately estimate our estimand. More generally, the results validate our estimator for the effect of genetic relatedness in female Assamese macaques; insofar, at least, as we believe that our causal assumptions are good approximations of the data-generating process (we will come back to this issue in the discussion). We can thus turn to updating this estimator with empirical data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical data</head><p>The empirical observations that we fit to statistical model 4 were collected as part of a longterm research project on wild Assamese macaques at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, in Northeastern Thailand (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">7A</ref>). We focused on the adult females of three social groups. The data collection took place between July 2017 and July 2018. The animals were fully habituated to the presence of researchers. Observers recorded the monkeys' behaviour using continuous focal sampling protocols of 40 minutes, during which they recorded all instances of dyadic interactions between adult females, including grooming and submissive behaviours, from which dominance ranks were computed. Submissive behaviours were also recorded ad libitum.</p><p>We defined S [a] as the number of 12 hours periods that each individual was observed for (hereafter "days" of observations), summed over sampling protocols. The average sampling effort was equal to 6 ± 1. . Field workers recorded when a macaque would start, and when it would stop, to groom another individual. We then defined a directed grooming bout as a grooming "start" from a to b that took place at least 30 minutes following the previous grooming "stop" from a to b. We obtained a total of 481 directed bouts across 700 directed dyads. We counted bouts within each directed dyad to obtain y [a,b] -which we show in Fig 7B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">-7C</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr">Fig T in S1 Text)</ref>.

This figure is similar to figures we showed above (e.g., Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">6B</ref>), but differs in two ways. First, the red dots (i.e. the target values) are absent. The "true" structural parameters of the world are, of course, unknown; they are what we are trying to estimate. Second, there is only one posterior distribution per parameter. This is the case because we fitted the model to one empirical data set, instead of several iterations of a simulation.</p><p>We observe that 96% of b * Re 's posterior distribution is concentrated above 0, with a mean of 0.22 <ref type="bibr">(Fig 8A)</ref>. It means that the most plausible parameter values for b * Re are positive, given the data and the model. This marginal distribution cannot be intelligibly interpreted by itself in terms of the causal effect of interest nor, therefore, in terms of the species' biology. In fact, the computation of causal effects often requires more than just a slope. They are function of the whole statistical model-an issue we had so far ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Generalised linear models (GLM), like statistical model 4, are built-in interaction devices. Contrary to common beliefs, the effect of one parameter on the outcome typically depends on (i.e. interacts with) the value of the other predictors in GLMs, even in the absence of an ): the white end of an edge shows the giver, and its darker end shows the receiver. We highlight, as an example, the observed edge y <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> (1 interaction) from individual 39 to individual 32. The colour of the node depicts the individual dominance rank: lighter for low ranks (subordinates), and darker for higher ranks (dominants). Kin group are further highlighted by dashed outlines. This network corresponds to the third level of abstraction, in  (posterior mean contrast). We show this effect for three hypothetical dyads, respectively varying in their "baseline" level of grooming rate ψ j (see main text)-from darkest to lightest: low-, medium-, and high-baseline. C. Counterfactual rates m 0 and m 1 for a hypothetical average directed dyad, where the two individuals occupy the same rank in the dominance hierarchy. The difference between the two distributions represents the causal effect of genetic relatedness for that dyad. <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013370.g008">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013370.g008</ref> interaction term <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>. Imagine a simple GLM with a slope of value 2 quantifying the causal effect of a binary variable X ∈ {0, 1} on a rate 𝜇, for i observations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">𝜇 i = exp(𝛼 + 2 ⋅ X i )</formula><p>Now suppose that the intercept 𝛼 can take two different values: 0 and 1. In the case where 𝛼 = 0, the causal effect of X is the following: exp(0 + 2 ⋅ 1) ≃ 7.4, minus exp(0 + 2 ⋅ 0) = 1, which is equal to 6.4. If, however, 𝛼 = 1, then the average effect is exp(1 + 2 ⋅ 1) ≃ 20, minus exp(1 + 2 ⋅ 0) ≃ 2.7, equal to ≃ 17.4. So, the same slope implies two very different effects: 6.4 and 17.4. With an exponential "inverse-link" function, causal effects on the outcome scale are multiplicative: they are larger when the baseline value-here, the value of 𝛼-increases.</p><p>The same principle applies to statistical model 4, where the effect of the slope b * Re on the rate m [a,b] differs across dyads-i.e. a larger effect for dyads with a higher "baseline" level of grooming interactions. We define these differences in baseline using a parameter 𝜓 [a,b] ("psi"):</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">𝜓 [a,b] = D + G [a] + R [b] + T [a,b]</formula><p>Where the distribution of 𝜓 [a,b] captures the variation across dyads that is caused by the unobserved (or exogenous) network structuring features-like age, social group differences, "personality", or friendship-as captured by Eqs 4.2.2-4.2.3. We show the distribution of 𝜓 </p><formula xml:id="formula_43">C (n) j = exp( ψ j + 1 ⋅ b (n) Re ) -exp( ψ j + 0 ⋅ b (n) Re ),</formula><p>That is, we obtained a posterior distribution for the contrasts of interest C j from manipulating the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples of the posterior model: each contrast C j is composed of 8000 posterior samples n: C . This causal effect is sometimes called Conditional Average Treatment effect (CATE), because its value depends on-is conditional on-the value of the other predictors. Our model shows an expected increase of, respectively, 0.01, 0.04 and 0.11 grooming bouts per day due to genetic relatedness, for low-, medium-, and high-baseline interaction levels, respectively (that is, about an order of magnitude change from low-to high-baseline). These values correspond to the posterior CATE means. Note, however, that the estimates' distributions are rather broad. Albeit unlikely, small negative effects are still plausible from the estimator's perspective.</p><p>On the last panel (Fig 8C ), we show our causal estimate in a different way. We compare m Re=1 (m 1 ) and m Re=0 (m 0 ), where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">m (n) 1 = exp(D (n) + 1 ⋅ b (n) Re ) m (n) 0 = exp(D (n) + 0 ⋅ b (n) Re ).</formula><p>Again, the n index indicates 8000 draws from the posterior distribution. These two estimates represent two counterfactual outcomes for a hypothetical average dyad. That is, they correspond to estimated grooming rates of a dyad, if the two individuals were unrelated (left) or if they were kin (right), given that everything else remains identical: G [a] ,R [b] , and T [a,b] , and the difference in rank between them are set to zero. Comparing the two distributions allows us to visualise the relative effect of genetic relatedness. The posterior estimates have a mean of 0.16 and 0.20 grooming bouts per day, respectively. 0.20 is equal to 1.24 times 0.16; so relatedness is estimated to cause a relative increase of about 24% in grooming rate. Note that the difference between the two distributions roughly corresponds to C 2 in Fig 8B . 
Summary and discussion. We do not wish to further discuss these results in terms of the female Assamese macaques's biology-it would go beyond the scope of the manuscript. We also do not, in any way, argue that our estimator is optimal and that it captures all necessary factors at play. Instead, we built this example to illustrate two general points. Our first point regards the logical implications of causal assumptions for the development of an estimator. By examining our DAG, we showed that it was necessary to block a backdoor path (by conditioning on dominance rank) to identify our estimand. Not doing so resulted in a consistently biased results. Furthermore, encoding the DAG as a SCM has made visible that we needed to account for the dyadic difference in rank between individuals-not only for the individuals' ranks-, and to allow for this effect to possibly change depending on whether the difference was positive or negative. These considerations arose from relatively consensual biological knowledge about the social system (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>). Yet, they were not obvious from intuition alone.</p><p>Translating domain expertise into formal assumptions allowed us to logically connect causal assumptions and their implications for the estimator structure, thereby providing a licence for this estimator. Failing to establish this connection places an analysis on loose grounds, for it becomes impossible to know under which conditions it can work, even in theory. For instance, most empirical studies of the effect of maternal kinship on affiliation in Cercopithecinae have not considered the biasing path of rank (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>). It is, however, hard to know if the confounder was simply ignored, or if instead, the results hold under other assumptions-in which case, we do not know which ones.</p><p>Secondly, we discussed why computing causal estimates on the outcome scale usually involves not only a slope, but the rest of the posterior model too. We notably showed that in the population under study, the effect substantially changed across dyads depending on their baseline interaction level. These considerations are particularly important because they determine how to interpret evidence for causal effects in light of the species' biology. We refer the interested readers to supplementary sections where we explore other aspects of this study. We show MCMC diagnostics in Sect H.2 and posterior predictive checks in Sect H.3 of S1 Text. We also compute the effect of rank-which, like that of relatedness, cannot be interpreted from the marginal posterior distributions alone-in Sect H.5 of S1 Text. Finally, we introduce simulation study 4' , where group sizes also affects interaction rates through a novel parameter 𝛿: a group-level counterpart of 𝛾, 𝜌, and 𝜏 (Sect I in S1 Text).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p>Behavioural ecologists study the phenotypic and ecological factors that affect the structure of animal societies. This body of research is grounded in theoretical models, whether verbal or formal, that provide potential causal explanations for patterns of behavioural variation. These models have highlighted the roles of processes at the individual level (e.g., age, reproductive state; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>), at the dyad level (e.g., dominance, kinship, homophily, friendship; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96]</ref>), and at the supra-dyadic level that can shape the social relationships between individuals (first level of abstraction, <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>, and thus, the social network structure emerging from it. Apace with this, there has been growing interest in empirically studying these processes in wild and captive populations. However, the connection between empirical results and theoretical models is often unclear. Many empirical studies are causally ambiguous, and theoretical assumptions specifying how variables cause one another in the system are rarely spelled out <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. In addition, social network data analyses rarely integrate the measurement process, e.g., by assuming that the observed social interactions perfectly capture the underlying interaction network (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Statistical models that are not built in light of these biological and sampling processes can produce noisy and biased estimates, yielding incorrect results-as we outlined in problems I-IV.</p></div>

Fit the empirical data to the estimator, and compute causal effects from the joint posterior distribution.</p><p>Here, we have advanced a general framework for studying the causes of animal social network structure that allows empiricists to translate their theoretical domain expertise into an analytical strategy. Within each simulation study, we showcased how researchers may, first, define causal assumptions at various levels (e.g., individual, dyad, group), and second, how they can validate an estimator for the effect of interest given these assumptions. We highlighted how these models naturally deal with (I) the gap between the interaction network and the observed network (discussed in simulation 1), (II) variation in sampling effort across individuals and dyads (sim. 3), (III) counfounders (sim. 4) and (IV) unobserved network causes (sim. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Across the four studies, we built models layer by layer, and illustrated an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks, which we summarise in Box 1. In doing so, we provided empiricists with reproducible analytical tools that they can build upon to specify causal and statistical models for their own study system (see our GitHub repository).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical application</head><p>The steps in Box 1 represent the core components of a full workflow for causal inference in animal social networks. Yet, they omit certain complexities. First of all, there often exist several plausible causal models that are compatible with a researcher's domain expertise. In this case, it can be useful to run several analyses in parallel and to compare their outputs-that is, the list of Box 1 bifurcates into forking paths. Fitting empirical data to estimators of intermediate complexity can also be insightful to check whether we observe the conditional dependencies that are expected from the DAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Furthermore, predictive tools (e.g., Information Criteria, Cross Validation) can be useful to compare causally consistent estimators that differ in their parametric specifications (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>). Finally, we did not highlight common aspects of a Bayesian workflow in the main text, like prior and posterior predictive checks, or MCMC diagnostics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref>). These procedures are, however, important. We showed how they can be conducted for social network models in S1 Text (e.g., Sects H.2-H.3).</p><p>Finally, although the framework presented in Box 1 applies to empirical research across animal social network analysis, the modelling details may require substantial changes-this is notably the case when modelling association data, as measured by spatio-temporal cooccurrences. Association data are not truly dyadic, and much of the observed variation is often unrelated to the underlying social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Thus, we believe that the models presented in this manuscript may often be poor approximations of the processes generating them. The literature on hypergraph models <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> represents a promising avenue for the analysis of association data, though much work is still needed for accessible and principled causal inference in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future research avenues</head><p>Measurement model. Conducting causal inference in social networks forces us to carefully examine the mapping between latent constructs of interest and data. In this manuscript, we focused on two kinds of unobserved quantities: true interaction rates, and causal effects. However, empirical research often involves additional latent variables, whose true values are uncertain or unknown. Let us return to the macaque example. We notice that, in addition to the unobserved causal effect on the unobserved rate m [a,b] , the very variable whose effect we studied-genetic relatedness-was not directly measured either. In the study, we approximated it as a binary variable using pedigree and microsatellite data, thereby discarding the continuous variation and uncertainty in the true genetic relatedness among individuals. Furthermore, we were interested in studying its effect on affiliation, a theoretical construct that we approximated with grooming rate (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In doing so, we ignored the rich set of behavioural interactions that compose affiliation in this species. Finally, by using Elo-rating point estimates for dominance rank, we treated this variable as if it was directly measured.</p><p>It is important to realise that whenever a variable is unobserved, its relationship with observed variables depends on theoretical assumptions, whether explicit or implicit. In this case, we implicitly assumed that the proxies captured the latent variables without any uncertainty or error, thereby making a leap between levels of abstractions. This is far from optimal, for it can lead to inefficient and inaccurate estimators.</p><p>Moving forward, we argue that such latent variables should be modelled explicitly when possible, as part of a measurement model: i.e. a joint set of assumptions defining the connection between observed and unobserved variables. Doing this is natural with Bayesian models, where latent variables are assigned a posterior distribution like any other parameter. In the empirical study, genetic relatedness could for instance be estimated alongside the other components of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Similarly, dominance relationships and affiliation may be modelled as latent variables in multiplex network models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref>. In this regard, statistical model 4 can be considered an intermediate step towards more realistic estimators. These considerations further apply to traits like age, whose exact value is sometimes unknown, but which can be modelled given a plausible interval; e.g., if an individual is known to be born between two population surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Furthermore, we believe that explicit measurement models could clarify current debates in fields like animal personality research, where the link between the latent objects of study (personality, behavioural syndrome) and the observed variables (behavioural measures) is conceptually and analytically challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>.</p><p>Dynamical drivers of social network structure. Sometimes, the latent causes of network structure cannot be modelled directly, but instead, can be inferred from the multilevel structure of the statistical model. This is the case for dynamic processes like reciprocity, a plausibly important driver of social network structure across social species. For instance, the Social Relations Model's c TT parameter may be interpreted as quantifying the extent of dyadic reciprocity after (i) positing a specific mechanism for reciprocity in a SCM or a more finegrained agent based model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108]</ref>), (ii) under the assumption that all confounding paths between T [a,b] and T [b,a] have been blocked, and (iii) after verifying that given (i) and (ii), the pattern of interest could be detected with c TT . The same goes for c GR as a tool to quantify generalised-reciprocity. These considerations not only apply to animal social network analysis, but also to several disciplines in the Social and Behavioural Sciences-e.g., Psychology or Anthropology-where the Social Relations Model's parameters are interpreted in terms of latent processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>. In any case, we wish to insist that such inferences require extreme care. As we saw earlier, most causal paths flowing through 𝛾, 𝜌, and 𝜏 end up in c TT and/or c GR . Therefore, these paths would need to be all blocked for c TT and c GR to be interpret as meaningful signals of reciprocity. As always, the causal evidence will only be as strong as the causal assumptions are plausible. But remember, imperfect causal assumptions are still better than no explicit assumptions at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>.</p><p>An area where the causal tools presented here may be particularly useful is to study the drivers and consequences of social network structure in the context of longitudinal data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">114]</ref>. In our studies, we always assumed stationary systems, where time did not matter. However, many network structuring processes are intrinsically dynamic. For instance, an individual's gregariousness might affect its health, reproductive success, and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. These outcomes, in turn, can shape social relationships and the pool of individuals in the social network, thereby forming potential loops of reciprocal causation between social network structure and other phenotypic traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">119]</ref>. Another way for social network structure to affect itself over time regards triadic closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120]</ref>. Consider three individuals, a, b, and c. If a and b are both connected to c at time t, they might become more likely to form a connection a-b at time t + 1, because of their shared relationship with c ("friends of friends become friends").</p><p>Social network structuring processes, along with the measurement procedure to capture them, are intrinsically causal. They all pose the inferential challenges that we have outlined throughout the paper: when not integrated into an analysis, they can lead to inferences that are simply wrong. In this context, we believe that establishing a logical connection between theory and data, using transparently justified estimators, is crucial. We hope that our proposed tools and workflow will inspire future empirical research in this effort.</p></div>

Next, we describe Statistical model 2, an estimator for the causal effects of X on 𝛾 and 𝜌. This estimator maintains the basic architecture statistical model 1, but is slightly modified. Here, we define Ĝ[a] and R [b] as submodels of m [a,b] , where Ĝ[a] is stratified by the variables causing 𝛾 [a] , and R [b] is stratified by the variables causing 𝜌 [b] . Thus, both are stratified by X:</figDesc></figure>

Similarly, b ‡ R estimates the conditional association between X [b] and m [a,b] . On the DAG, b * G captures the path coefficient between X [a] and m [a,b] ; and b ‡ R the path between X [b] and m [a,b] . Therefore, b * G and b ‡ R should respectively recover the effect of X [a] on 𝛾 [a] (marked by *), and that of X [b] on 𝜌 [b] (marked by a ‡), and take a value of -0.7. Finally, G [a] , R [b] , and T [a,b] are varying effects. They are part of the exact same multivariate adaptive priors described in statistical model 1:</figDesc></figure>

Statistical model 2 successfully recovered the structural parameters of the simulation (Fig 4C, left panel). Most importantly, we accurately estimated our estimands: b * G recovered the true causal effects of X [a] on 𝛾 [a] , and b ‡ R , the effect of X [a] on 𝜌 [a] .</figDesc></figure>

Recall that c GR captures the association between G [a] and R [a] . Looking at the DAG, we see that these parameters are connected by X [a] . X [a] creates an open path, G ← 𝛾 ← X → 𝜌 → R, Which lets the association flow between G [a] and R [a] . Once we condition on X [a] , however, we block this path, cancel the association between G [a] and R [a] , and we return to a correlation coefficient c GR = 0 (left panel). Finally, notice that the dyadic parameters s T and c TT , were unaffected by X [a] . This can be deducted from the DAG, too, for there exist no open paths connecting 𝛾 [a] or 𝜌 [a] -carrying the effects of X [a] -and T [a,b] .</figDesc></figure>

Statistical model 3 successfully recovered the structural parameters of the generative model, SCM 3 (Fig 5C, left panel). Most notably, b *T , the statistical parameter whose aim was to estimate our causal estimand, accurately recovered the value of 0.8. This result validates our estimator, given the causal assumptions encoded in the DAG and SCM.Below, we briefly explain how the effect of genetic relatedness, a dyadic variable, results in variation in individual-and dyad-level varying effects, when relatedness is not included in the statistical model (Fig 5C, right panel). In simulation study 1 and 2, the structural and statistical parameters were equivalent: 𝛾 [a] was the only cause of G [a] , 𝜌 [a] the only cause of R [a] , and 𝜏 [a,b] the only cause of T [a,b] (e.g., Fig 4). As a result, G [a] fully recovered 𝛾 [a] , T [a,b] recovered 𝜏 [a,b]</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_17"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[a,b] "leaked" onto G [a] and R [b] . Recall that G [a] , R [b] , and T [a,b] are statistical parameters, meaning they only measure (conditional) averages. They cannot "see" that the effect was encoded as a dyadic effect through 𝜏 [a,b] . Instead, G [a] and R [b] measure interindividual differences in average interaction rates. Genetic relatedness, although it acts at the dyadic level, creates such differences. Individuals belonging to the large kin group give, and receive, more frequent social interactions, than those in the small kin groups (see Fig 5C, right panel, and Fig I in S1 Text). This interindividual variation is visible as an increase in s G and s R , and in covariation between these two individual features, indicated by a positive value for c GR . This pattern can also be explained with the DAG (Fig 5B): there is an open path between G [a] and R [a] , passing through Re |a,b| . The effect of Re |a,b| that can be attributed to interindividual variation is absorbed by G [a] and R [a] , and the residual variation is absorbed by T [a,b] . This residual variation does not correspond to a process in the SCM, and therefore, s T and c TT do not have a straightforward biological interpretation. Once we condition on Re |a,b| , we block the paths between G [a] and R [a] , and between T [a,b] and T [b,a] . Hence, the correlations captured by c GR and c TT disappear (Fig 5C, left panel).</figDesc></figure>

We then compute the causal effect of genetic relatedness C, for each of these three levels ψ j (Fig 8B):</figDesc></figure>
