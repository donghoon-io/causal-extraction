<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Identifying genuine causality is crucial to understanding physiological processes and discovering therapeutic targets, but it is also a tricky issue. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually regarded as the golden standard for causal inference but are restricted due to methodological, ethical, and economic concerns. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a promising approach to estimating causal effects using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sanderson et al, 2022)</ref>. In general, MR analysis relies on three core assumptions (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>): (i) relevance: a reliable correlation exists between the instrument and exposure; (ii) exogeneity or exchangeability: the instrument is independent with any confounders between the exposure and outcome (Z ⫫ U ); and (iii) exclusion restriction: the instrument should affect the outcome only through the exposure (Z ⫫ Y |X, U ).</p><p>Unfortunately, the rigorous assumptions are often violated <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1b)</ref>, making it challenging to identify appropriate genetic instruments. First, although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk loci, in particular single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the effect on a polygenic complex trait is usually small, leading to weak-instrument bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Davies et al, 2015)</ref>. The multiple testing burdens, 'winner's curse', linkage disequilibrium (LD), and population stratification increase the risk of false positive signals in GWAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tam et al, 2019)</ref>. It can be improved by applying multiple instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dudbridge, 2020)</ref>, whereas correlated instruments will also lead to unstable estimates and introduce additional genetic confoundings when including non-causal variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gkatzionis et al, 2022)</ref>. Proposed strategies such as LD stepwise pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Yang et al, 2012)</ref>, principal components analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burgess et al, 2017)</ref>, and penalization aim to extract a suitable number of independent instruments from a large set of correlated weak variants, but confront criticism on robustness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gkatzionis et al, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Another problem is that many IVs are actually invalid due to horizontal pleiotropy (a variant affects the outcome via alternative pathways other than the exposure of interest). Gene interactions, such as LD and epistasis, can also violate exclusion restrictions analogous to pleiotropy. For individual-level data, lasso-type methods like sisVIVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kang et al, 2016)</ref> and post-adaptive Lasso <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Windmeijer et al, 2019)</ref> help to control the influence of the pleiotropic effect. Recent approaches like TSHT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guo et al, 2018)</ref> and CIIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Windmeijer et al, 2021)</ref> mitigate pleiotropy by identifying valid instruments from candidate sets.</p><p>The above approaches relying on many implausible assumptions are tricky to model sophisticated real genetic patterns. In particular, due to complex gene interactions Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> The overview of BNMR. a. The three core assumptions of IV. b. The problems in current MR. Weak IVs are primarily due to the small individual contribution of a single locus to the trait and the low statistical power of GWAS, as well as the presence of linkage and interaction effects, leading to numerous false-positive discoveries. Invalid IVs are mainly caused by horizontal pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium, which break the exclusion restriction assumption. c. Correlated horizontal pleiotropy induced by gene interactions. Z D is a pleiotropic varaints with independent effect on X and Y , and Z I is associated with Z D . The causal pathway IV→ X → Y and horizontal pleiotropic pathway IV→ Y will be correlated when Z I is selected as IV. d. The BNMR model. In the learning stage, we leverage the random graph forest to prioritize variants from a large interacting set and select variants with a true effect on the exposure as instruments. In the inference stage, we impose shrinkage prior on the Bayesian MR model to obtain a pleiotropy-robust estimate. e. Notations used in the BNMR model.</p><p>(GxG), incorporating non-causal variants as IVs not only leads to unstable estimates and impacts statistical power but also may introduce GxG-induced correlated pleiotropy, violating the Instrument strength independent of direct effect (InSIDE) assumption that many methods for correcting pleiotropy that rely on (Fig <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). Causal diagram model provides an alternative way to represent the underlying causal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nogueira et al, 2022)</ref>. With causal diagrams, machine learning techniques like the causal Bayesian network (BN) are currently applied to identify genetic interactions and causal variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lyu et al, 2021)</ref>. They will also be a profitable complement to conventional MR <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Howey et al, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amar et al, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a two-stage Bayesian Network-based Mendelian Randomization (BNMR) approach by integrating causal discovery and inference (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>). We aim to tackle correlated weak instruments in learning stage and cope with pleiotropy in inference stage. Using the random graph forest (RGF), an ensemble approach comprised of a series of BN structure learning processes, we prioritize variants with effects that are small and interacting and identify variants with direct effect on exposure as instruments. Then we estimate the causal effects via the Bayesian MR framework with a shrinkage prior to cope with potential horizontal pleiotropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzuini et al, 2020)</ref>. We demonstrate that BNMR is superior to conventional approaches in both instrument selection and effect estimation via simulations. With application to the UK BioBank, we examine causal pathways from hematological parameters to blood pressures and psychiatric disorders, bringing new biological insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Overview of the BNMR model BNMR is a two-stage MR framework using individual-level data. In the learning stage, we propose RGF to select variants with reliable relevance from a large number of correlated weak instruments. We utilize BNs to characterize the complex conditional probability relationships and partition the variant set Z into three subsets according to their relationships with the exposure of interest X (DIE partition),</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Z = Z D ∪ Z I ∪ Z E .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We use notations in calligraphic font to represent the variant set, bold font to represent the vector of genotypes, and Italic capital letter to represent single genotype. Variants in Z D directly affect the exposure, variants in Z I indirectly affect the exposure via gene interaction or linkage, i.e. variants in Z I and X are d-separated by variants in Z D (Z Z Z I ⫫ X|Z Z Z D ), while variants in Z E do not affect the exposure (Z Z Z E ⫫ X). The three subsets are distinguished via BN under the causal Markov, faithfulness, and sufficiency assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nogueira et al, 2022)</ref>, and only Z D can be parents of X in the causal graph.</p><p>In the inference stage, we model the potential horizontal pleiotropy explicitly. Since quantitative traits are determined by both genetic and environmental factors, assuming linearity and no interaction, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X = α 0 + α α α T Z Z Z D + ε X ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y = γ 0 + γ γ γ T D Z Z Z D + γ γ γ T I Z Z Z I + γ γ γ T E Z Z Z E + ε Y ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where α α α and γ γ γ represent corresponding effect size on X and Y . Variants Z D ∈ Z D affect the outcome Y through two different pathways: with the mediation of exposure</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X (Z Z Z D α α α ⟶ X β ⟶ Y )</formula><p>, the causal pathway of interest, and via direct pathway or through other mediators other than X (Z Z Z D η η η ⟶ Y ), known as (horizontal) pleiotropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pingault et al, 2018)</ref>. Under the assumption that both pathways are independent (the InSIDE assumption) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pingault et al, 2018)</ref>, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">γ γ γ D = βα α α + η η η, (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where β is the causal effect of X on Y, while η η η represents the pleiotropic effects.

Actually, only a subset of variants in Z D need to be included as IVs, and consequently, variants in Z D are required to be identified with high precision. We then impose a shrinkage prior on nuisance parameters γ γ γ to make β identifiable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzuini et al, 2020)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BN structure learning in the random graph forest</head><p>To reduce the computational complexity of structure learning and assess confidence of each edge, we propose RGF, inspired by the random forest. In RGF, r sub-graphs are created using bootstrapping or subsampling, in which n s of n individuals and p s of p variants are sampled in each sub-graph. Consequently, we boil down the process of DIE partitioning to the structure learning of a series of causal BNs.</p><p>Since variants are reasons of traits naturally, we can simplify structure learning to graph skeleton determination. We identify Z D by scanning the variants directly adjacent to the exposure in each graph and calculating the adjacency score (the frequency of the Z -X edge presence in all sub-graphs) for each variant, which is the confidence of the variant-exposure relevance in the average causal graph. Variants with higher adjacency scores are at a higher confidence level to be identified as Z D ∈ Z D . We can select a specified number of lead variants or variants with scores higher than a given threshold α * p s p as IVs. Various algorithms are proposed for BN structure learning. Scored-based approaches ascertain the optimal network by exhaustively or heuristically exploring candidate graphs and maximizing the network score, while constraint-based approaches leverage a sequence of conditional independence tests to establish the edge constraints between nodes and subsequently refine the directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nogueira et al, 2022)</ref>. We implement score-based approaches including Hill-Climbing (hc) and Tabu Search (tabu), constrained-based approaches including stable PC (pc.stable), Incremental Association (iamb), and Grow-Shrink (gs), as well as hybrid learning methods including Max-Min Hill-Climbing (mmhc) and Restricted Maximization (rsmax2). All these methods are implemented using the R package bnlearn.</p></div>

To make causal parameter β identifiable, we assume that not all IVs selected take pleiotropic effects (i.e., some components of γ γ γ are zero) and impose a shrinkage prior on γ γ γ under the Bayesian framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzuini et al, 2020)</ref>. The Bayesian estimation is conducted using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) with Rstan and PyMC. The first half of the iteration is used for burn-in, and the second half is used for sampling.</p><p>BNMR can extend to binary outcomes by modifying the Eq. 7 to probit or logistic regressions, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Y |X, Z, U ∼ Bernoulli (h(β 0 + βX + J ∑ j=1 γ j Z j + δ 2 U )) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the link function h(⋅) can be inverse-probit or inverse-logit.</p><p>We compare estimates of BNMR with other IV selection and MR estimation approaches. We implement PCA with R package stats and penalized regressions with R package glmnet, where 10-fold cross validation is used to determine the best value of λ. Compared methods are implemented with the R package AER, ivmodel, Mendelian-Randomization, cause, R2BGLiMS, and CIIV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulations</head><p>We use both simulated and real genomics from UK Biobank in simulations. For simulated genomics, k independent loci sampled from multinomial distributions, whose genotype frequencies satisfy the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), with the effect allele frequency π from U (0.05, 0.95). m correlated loci for each locus are simulated according to LD squared correlation coefficient ( <ref type="formula">r</ref>2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001</ref>) that sampled from U (0.01, 0.99), and genomics with p = k(m + 1) loci are synthesized.

Confounder U is generated from the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, 1), with coefficients δ x = δ y = 1. Variants affecting X are randomly selected from the simulated genome, with effect size α j ∼ ), with µ γ = 0 (balanced pleiotropy)</p><p>or µ γ = 0.05 (directional pleiotropy). Although unilateral loci do not directly affect X, they can perform as a background noise to interfere IV selection through gene interactions. We utilize 100 replicates for each scenario and report the average. For scenarios with non-additive genetic effects, we simulate phenotypes using more complicated polygenetic models with simple multiplicative effects, interactive multiplicative effects, and interactive threshold effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marchini et al, 2005)</ref>. Details can be found at Supplementary Note SN3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>BNMR can efficiently identify effect variants from numerous weak, interacting variants with high precision in learning stage.</p><p>We first compare the fine-mapping performance of RGF with different hyperparameters and structure learning algorithms in simulated datasets <ref type="bibr">(Fig 2)</ref>. RGF exhibits a lower false discovery rate (FDR) and a higher AUC, with increasing subsample size and numbers of subsamples, though this improvement is accompanied by an increase in time consumption. Constrained-based approaches yield lower FDR, while the scorebased approaches are superior in speed. As the selection threshold increases, the number of identified variants diminishes with increased precision.</p><p>Compared to the conventional association test (linear regression), RGF, LD stepwise pruning, and penalized regressions (especially lasso and elastic net) can all reduce FDR, while the RGF achieves the highest precision, performing as a effective tool in prioritizing candidate effect variants and identifying true effect variants (Z D ) (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Before employing these variable selection strategies, we conduct pre-filtering to reduce the number of candidate variants. A more strict P threshold before RGF increases the precision in top variants but may cause more false discoveries. A threshold of around 1 p to 0.01 p may be proper. Besides, adjacency score can be regarded as the confidence that the variant belongs to Z D , and thus, it is also an assessment of instrument strength. The correlation between the adjacency score and the commonly used F statistics (Fig x ) for X 2 is imposed to be twice as much as that of X 1 to represent traits with lower heritability. RGF is conducted with n s = 2000, p s = 150, r = 5000 using hc algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S2</head><p>) indicate that RGF is capable of choosing instruments reliable relevance to reduce weak-instrument bias.</p><p>GWAS becomes tricky when dealing with non-additive genetic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tam et al, 2019)</ref>. We simulate phenotypes from the combination of three interacting polygenetic models, including simple multiplicative effects, interactive multiplicative effects, and interactive threshold effects (Supplementary Note SN3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marchini et al, 2005)</ref>. The results show that RGF performs well in settling the puzzle of gene interaction and epistasis (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>).</p><p>Since genotypes are notoriously difficult to simulate, we also generate phenotypes using the same procedures (Eq. 11) but based on real genotype data from the UK BNMR can effectively reduce mean square error of estimates, enhance statistical power, and is robust to horizontal pleiotropy in inference stage.</p><p>We first compare the performance of BNMR to other existing MR approaches (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>), including two-stage least square (TSLS), limited information maximum likelihood ratio (LIML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boehm and Zhou, 2022)</ref>, inverse-variance weighted (IVW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burgess et al, 2013)</ref>, MR-Egger <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bowden et al, 2015)</ref>, weighted median (Bowden et al, 2016), weighted mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hartwig et al, 2017)</ref>, JAM-MR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gkatzionis et al, 2021)</ref>, CAUSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Morrison et al, 2020)</ref>, and CIIV <ref type="bibr">(Windmeijer et al, 2021) (Fig 5a)</ref>. We include two types of pleiotropic loci in our simulation: pleiotropy loci that independently affect exposure and outcome, or the effects on the exposure and outcome correlated resulting from gene interaction like linkage. For each scenario, we examine the performance of various methods under settings where the expected average pleiotropic effect of all loci was either 0 (balanced pleiotropy) or non-zero (directional pleiotropy). Most prevailing approaches perform relatively well in balanced pleiotropy, but fail to cope with scenarios with complex directional and correlated pleiotropy. Due to its sensitivity to the InSIDE assumption, MR-Egger performs noticeably worse when the number of correlated pleiotropic variants increases. Some two-sample methods, like CAUSE, confront an inflated estimation variance, and bias from sample overlap when applying to one-sample studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burgess et al, 2016)</ref>. Methods based on plurality rule in a broad sense such as weighted median and mode estimator exhibits commendable stability. In general, BNMR is superior to the existing approaches in terms of mean squared error (MSE), particularly due to its smaller variance of estimates, yielding augmented statistical power. Despite relying on the InSIDE assumption, the process of using RGF for IV selection enhances the robustness of the InSIDE assumption, making it more resilient to correlated pleiotropy arising from gene-gene interactions.</p><p>To show the bonus BN brings to the conventional Bayesian MR, we then evaluate the improvement in Bayesian MR estimation by using IVs obtained from BN (BNMR) compared to using GWAS lead SNPs directly as IVs (BMR). A noticeable reduction in MSE can be observed when there is presence of correlated pleiotropy by gene interaction <ref type="bibr">(Fig 5b)</ref>. This enhancement primarily manifests in the attenuation of estimated variance in balanced scenarios, while both bias and variance deflate when the pleiotropic effect is directional. To better understand the role of BN, we examine the performance of RGF-selected IVs on other traditional MR methods (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c</ref>). Due to overlapping samples in single-sample designs and the requirement for IVW and MR-Egger to use independent IVs, while RGF aims to identify IVs that have a direct impact on the exposure (which may not be independent of each other), the use of RGFselected IVs does not perform well and even increases bias when using IVW estimator. Even so, on the other hand, when using MR-Egger estimator, the use of RGF-selected IVs reduced bias and variance in estimation compared to IVs obtained through LD pruning. We believe this is because MR-Egger and Bayesian MR are based on similar assumptions, the InSIDE assumption, requiring that the effect of Z on X and the pleiotropic pathways from Z to Y are independent. It is violated when Z affects the confounder U that affects both X and Y (i.e., correlated horizontal pleiotropy). If this correlated horizontal pleiotropy is caused by gene-gene interactions, where U is another genetic locus Z ′ (Fig <ref type="figure">1c</ref>), RGF will tend to select Z ′ as IV ensuring that the InSIDE assumption is still satisfied. And therefore RGF enhances the robustness of the InSIDE assumption.</p><p>We also conduct sensitivity analysis on the instrument numbers and iterations, and different shrinkage priors (Van Erp et al, 2019) (Fig 5, Supplementary Note SN4-SN5). Bias increases when there are too many or too few instruments. BNMR estimates are not sensitive to priors in general, despite the fact that uniform spike &amp; slab prior is a bit more inefficient than the others based on the error bars (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5d</ref>). The Bayesian Lasso prior shows the fastest sampling speed and a deflated standard error, but has a slightly higher bias. The horseshoe prior, although slightly less efficient, is superior in the performance of convergence due to the lowest Rhat (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">&amp; Fig S5).</formula><p>BNMR with large-scale biobank-level data vindicates causality from erythrocyte-related traits to blood pressures. Hematological indices usually vary in a variety of physiological processes and are potential indicators for related disorders. Correlational studies have proposed that erythrocyte-related characteristics, including red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), the proportion of RBCs to the plasma, and mean red cell volume (MCV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Enawgaw et al, 2017)</ref>, are in strong correlation with systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP), and abnormalities of erythrocytes might be indicators of some cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases such as hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tsuda, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>To examine the causal effects of erythrocyte parameters on blood pressures, we involve 246,659 participants of Caucasian ancestry, self-reported as free from hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases (UK Biobank Non-cancer Illness Coding 1065-1094), and with available blood routine measurements at the time of enrollment. Genome quality control is conducted using PLINK 2.0, with correspond thresholds for the SNP missing rate, minor allele frequency (MAF), and HWE test are 0.05, 0.01, and 1e-6. Fast posterior sampling with the large dataset is conducted with the Python packages PyMC and JAX. To increase power, we conducted preliminary GWAS filtering using summary statistics from a different dataset of the same ethnic group but with distinct samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Astle et al, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We exert two pre-filtering strategies to reduce the amount of candidate variants and then conduct BNMR analysis. The first strategy utilizes a more stringent GWAS P threshold of 1e-20, while the second strategy employs a looser P threshold of 5e-8, followed by LD clumping. The results (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6e</ref>) consistently show that RBC, HGB, and HCT show significant positive effects on both DBP and SBP, and the effect magnitude is larger on SBP than on DBP. Whereas MCV shows a non-significant negative effect on blood pressure instead. Alternative approaches use top GWAS significant SNPs after LD clumping as instruments, and the varied and even conflicting results (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>) remind us of the importance of MR methodology. MR-Egger test shows that all causal relationships are not significant. On the other hand, TSLS indicates that RBC, HGB, and HCT have a significant effect on DBP but not on SBP, while CIIV estimates a positive effect on DBP and a negative effect on SBP.</p><p>Comparing the causal variants identified by RGF and probabilistic fine-mapping methods such as Susie <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wang et al, 2020</ref>) is quite interesting. In general, RGF focuses on the genomic global landscape, while fine-mapping methods are more focused on local features. Taking RBC as an example, if we coarse fine-mapping using both methods on all candidate loci after preliminary screening, we would find that the majority of signals are shared between the two approaches (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6f</ref>). When we specifically examine the local structure near a GWAS peak (e.g., the region from 41,600,000 to 42,200,000 on chromosome 6), although Susie tends to identify more causal loci, the most significant signal (rs112233623) is the same for both methods <ref type="bibr">(Fig 6g)</ref>. Considering that in IV selection, we are more concerned about false-positive signals in GWAS caused by genetic correlation and winner's curse, the relative conservatism of RGF is not a disadvantage.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms may relate to blood viscosity. Higher RBC, HGB, and HCT mean an increase in blood viscosity and peripheral resistance to blood flow, resulting in hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Enawgaw et al, 2017)</ref>. Besides, erythrocytes and hemoglobin 3 , g/dl, %, fL, and mmHg. We adopt two different pre-filtering strategies: one uses a more strict GWAS P threshold (1e-20), the other uses a looser P threshold (5e-8) and then conducts LD clumping (threshold: window = 10000kb, r 2 =0.01, MAF=0.01). The variant loci obtained from pre-filtering are then further selected via RGF (n s = 4000, p s = 150, r = 5000) to identify 20 instruments for each exposure, shown in Supplementary Note SN6, and sample 4 chains with 5000 iterations per chain in MCMC. f.

Fine-mapping results of Susie and RGF in the GWAS peak region chr6 41,600,000 -42,200,000. also influence nitric oxide bioavailability, a crucial signal in the regulation of vessel psychology such as vasodilatation, thrombosis inhibition, and vessel formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helms et al, 2018)</ref>. Although the molecular mechanisms still remain to be uncovered, the findings indicate that those hematological indices may be not only indicators but potential therapeutic targets for hypertension.</p><p>BNMR indicates that increased leukocytes contribute to the risk of depression.</p><p>The neuro-immune interaction has been an appealing topic in recent years. Widespread bidirectional circuits exist between the two systems. The nervous system regulates immune activity and cytokine balance via the direct connection of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and some neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones can also serve as immunomodulators. Meanwhile, the immune system participates in the elimination and plasticity of synapses during development and modulates brain activity as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dantzer, 2018)</ref>. Immune-related hematological biomarkers provide a new insight into the pathological mechanisms of many psychiatric disorders. For instance, immune dysregulation has long been regarded associated with psychological disorders including depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Drevets et al, 2022)</ref>. Recent studies report the correlation between leukocyte count and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Reay et al, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sørensen et al, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>We leverage disease records from UK Biobank and construct a case-control study by randomly selecting the same number of healthy individuals of the same ethnicity to assess whether leukocyte count, as well as its two subtypes, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, will causally affect depression. Subjects with extreme values exceeding 3 σ are excluded, and 22324 cases and 22861 controls are included in the analysis. All participants are of Caucasian ancestry.</p><p>Significant differences in leukocyte, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts are manifested between the case and control groups <ref type="bibr">(Fig 7a)</ref>. Results from BNMR and weighted median indicate that an elevated leukocyte count will increase the risk of depression <ref type="bibr">(Fig 7b)</ref>. The reciprocal MR analysis supports the causal direction from leukocyte count to depression. However, when we examine the two subtypes of leukocyteslymphocytes and monocytes -this significant positive causal relationship disappears. This suggests that the causal mechanism from immune cells to mental disorders is more complex than anticipated, and warrants a careful examination of the influence of various cell type counts and compositional ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sørensen et al, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>We further conduct gene mapping and functional annotation by FUMA (Watanabe et al, 2017) using the top 1500 variants identified in RGF, which maps 273 depression-related protein coding genes. Functional analysis shows that these genes are enriched in the KEGG systemic lupus erythematosus and glycosaminoglycan Degradation pathway (Fig <ref type="figure">7c</ref>), both related closely with immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Handel and Dyer, 2021)</ref>. Depression-related genes also indicates enrichment in many cytokine and immune response pathways, including reactomes related to signaling of interleukin 9, Wnt, biocarta, and butyrophilin family (Supplementary Fig S6 ), consistent with previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wray et al, 2018)</ref>.

Our analysis supports the idea of modulating immune cell composition as an intervention for psychological depression. However, the results should still be interpreted with caution due to recipient inclusion and sample size, population heterogeneity, and other potential confounding factors. Noncollapsibility of the logistic model may damage the estimation of binary responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schuster et al, 2021)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Causality is challenging to identify in observational studies due to unmeasured confounders. The introduction of genetic instruments in MR makes it possible to estimate causal effect in the presence of unobserved confounders, making MR increasingly appealing in real-world studies.</p><p>Tackling imperfect IVs has always been a tricky issue in MR. We propose BNMR to address the challenges by leveraging machine learning techniques and integrating causal discovery and inference. We use RGF to reduce FDR and improve statistical power when selecting instruments with true effects from numerous correlated weak variants due to polygenicity, epistasis, and LD. Then we control horizontal pleiotropy by imposing a shrinkage prior on the Bayesian MR. The selection of SNPs with direct effect on exposure enhance the robustness of InSIDE assumption and reduce correlated pleiotropy due to gene interaction, and the avoidance false positive signals in IV selection also contributes to reducing weak instrument bias and enhancing statistical power.</p><p>To guarantee the faithfulness and sufficiency of causal diagrams, we impose constraints in RGF that limit the nodes in the graph to only include genetic loci and a single exposure. We tend not to involve multiple traits in a causal graph because the common causes of those traits may not be observed. Another advantage is that the criteria 'not d-separated from exposure by other variants' can be simply expressed as 'adjacent to exposure' in this scenario, which is convenient for DIE partition and IV selection.</p><p>Bayesian estimation with imposed shrinkage priors is conceptually similar to regularization in the traditional model but with some obvious advantages, like simultaneously estimated penalty parameters, easily obtained credible intervals, and intuitive interpretation. Additionally, domain-specific knowledge can be included as an informative prior. BNMR are not sensitive to priors, though we recommend horseshoe prior for better convergence performance if no additional information is accessible.</p><p>Although large-scale biobanks containing genotypes and phenotypes are now available, an increasing number of studies tend to report summary association statistics instead due to concerns on privacy and security. Bayesian meta-analysis is applied to assess pooled genetic relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sun et al, 2022)</ref>. Recent work has started to focus on learning causal diagrams with summary data <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhang et al, 2017)</ref>, while arduous task still remains.</p><p>BNMR is an example of post-selection inference and faces the issue that the inference stage does not account for uncertainty in the selection stage, causing more volatile results. The model also confronts computational challenges in BN learning and MCMC sampling, especially with increasing numbers of samples and variables. BN structural learning is an NP-hard problem. We leverage the bagging technique in ensemble learning and propose the RGF to split the whole genetic pattern into a series of subgraphs. The number of candidate variants is restricted via pre-filtering by GWAS association tests before RGF, since the removal of variants with low correlations will not influence the network structure severely due to the modularity of the causal diagram. To achieve a balance between sufficiently high precision and acceptable time consumption, we suggest conducting pre-filtering using a GWAS P threshold of approximately 1 p to 0.01 p and setting the value of p s r to be at least 100 times greater than the number of variants in RGF to ensure adequate sampling for each variant. We endorse the use of at least 4 chains and at least 2000 iterations in MCMC. For large-scale datasets, consolidation of posterior sampling in subsamples may be feasible.</p><p>In summary, BNMR is a practical model to prioritize and select proper instruments from massive, interacting, and weak variants and obtain pleiotropy-robust causal effect estimates. With accumulated genomic data available, BNMR will contributing to revealing more causal relationships and discovering potential therapeutic targets with real-world evidence.</p></div>
