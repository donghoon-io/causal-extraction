<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inferring causal links or subgraphs corresponding to a specific phenotype or label based solely on measured data is an important yet challenging task, which is also different from inferring causal nodes. While Graph Neural Network (GNN) Explainers have shown potential in subgraph identification, existing methods with GNN often offer associative rather than causal insights. This lack of transparency and explainability hinders our understanding of their results and also underlying mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of causal link/subgraph inference, called CIDER: Counterfactual-Invariant Diffusion-based GNN ExplaineR, by implementing both counterfactual and diffusion implementations. In other words, it is a model-agnostic and task-agnostic framework for generating causal explanations based on a counterfactual-invariant and diffusion process, which provides not only causal subgraphs due to counterfactual implementation but reliable causal links due to the diffusion process. Specifically, CIDER is first formulated as an inference task that generatively provides the two distributions of one causal subgraph and another spurious subgraph. Then, to enhance the reliability, we further model the CIDER framework as a diffusion process. Thus, using the causal subgraph distribution, we can explicitly quantify the contribution of each subgraph to a phenotype/label in a counterfactual manner, representing each subgraph's causal strength. From a causality perspective, CIDER is an interventional causal method, different from traditional association studies or observational causal approaches, and can also reduce the effects of unobserved confounders. We evaluate CIDER on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which all demonstrate the superiority of CIDER over state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>How to identify causal links or subgraph with respect to the samples' labels based only on measured data, attracts a great amount of attention in various communities, and such a problem is also different from inferring causal nodes. Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool in handling and learning graphstructured information for such a task. As a variant of neural networks, GNNs have been crafted to function on graph-structured data, including molecular compositions, social connections, and knowledge graphs.</p><p>Recently, Graph Neural Networks Explainer (GNNs Explainer) has shown potential in identifying subgraphs that associate with a specific GNN's output, but it provides only explanations at a model level. In other words, it would explain the association between subgraphs and the specific task GNN, rather than answering the important question "Which part of the graph results in such a label?".</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> estimate the contribution of each subgraph to the trained GNN's output, which can help to understand the GNN's mechanism but may fail in finding the causal subgraph that really affects phenomena or labels. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> aim to provide causal information by using causal theory, but the former considers each edge's contribution to the trained GNN's output by using a greedy algorithm to search for the most important subgraph without the consideration of the dependence between edges. The latter first maps the graph to a hidden space to compute the contribution of every causal factor to the trained GNN's output, and then uses the causal factors to reconstruct the graph's structure. However, the dependence between those factors is ignored, and thus, they may result in the reconstructed subgraph with no causal links. Therefore, in a low-sparsity situation, they have poor results.</p><p>To provide a causal subgraph from data, we propose a novel framework called CIDER: Counterfactual-Invariant Diffusion-based GNN ExplaineR, which can answer both "Which part of the graph causally affects a sample's label?" and "Which part of the graph results in the trained GNN's output?". CIDER is an intervention and Counterfactual-Invariant method that trains a diffusion-based model to divide the whole graph or network into one causal subgraph and one spurious subgraph. That  is, it directly predicts the distributions of causal and spurious subgraphs, enabling the estimation of causal strength, i.e., each subgraph's contribution to the graph's label. <ref type="bibr">Figure (1a)</ref> shows one example of CIDER for every graph with a label, where CIDER gives the causal subgraph and spurious subgraph. Note that we can use the measured data X to construct a graph (e.g., by correlation analysis) if the graph is not explicitly given. Our major contributions can be highlighted below.</p><p>We propose a novel framework called CIDER, which provides a causal explanation from a subgraph to a label or phenotype by training a GNN based only on the measured high-dimensional data. By implementing intervention and Counterfactual-Invariant to train a diffusion model, CIDER directly constructs the two distributions of one causal subgraph and another spurious subgraph, i.e. by dividing the whole graph into these two subgraphs, thus quantifying the contribution of each subgraph to the graph's label. Specifically, to achieve this, we first model the problem as a variant inference task that predicts the two subgraph distributions, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. Then, we use a VGAE-based framework with two channels to predict the distributions: one for the causal subgraph and the other for the spurious subgraph. The two distributions are further used to reconstruct the original graph's structure, and the contribution of each subgraph to the label is computed by doing sample counterfactual implementation in the spurious subgraph. Note that CIDER is an interventional causality method, different from traditional association studies or observational causality methods, and in particular, is able to reduce the influence of unobserved confounders, which is actually a long-standing problem in the field.</p><p>CIDER adopts a diffusion process to further enhance the inference capability, where denoising and distilling the spurious subgraph are performed at each diffusion step. After the T steps, each step's causal subgraph distribution and noise distribution are obtained. We use the noise distribution's significant attribute and counterfactual invariant to make CIDER trainable, even though the noise distribution is not required in the traditional diffusion model's training process. This results in a sparser and more reliable causal subgraph distribution.</p><p>CIDER provides not only a causal subgraph due to counterfactual implementation but also its causal links owing to the diffusion process. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including single-cell RNA-seq datasets, demonstrate such advantages, which shows that our CIDER outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Results</head><p>This section presents the theoretical and computational results of CIDER with a comprehensive set of experiments evaluating CIDER's performance. We begin outlining the result of the CIDER theory. Subsequently, we compare CIDER against several state-of-the-art methods on both benchmarks. Finally, we propose a framework to use CIDER to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data, illustrating its efficacy and applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data utilized in this work are readily accessible in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Theoretical results of CIDER to ensure interventional causality</head><p>We first show the theoretical result of CIDER, which is able to infer the causal subgraph (or a set of edges) against an output label or phenotype of a sample based only on data in the sense of interventional causality. The conceptual illustration is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>We define a random graph as G = (X, V, E) where |E| and |V | are numbers of edges and nodes, respectively. Each node has a d-dimensional feature vector, and X is a |V | × d matrix (the measured data of a sample or graph). We aim to derive the conditional distribution of the edges, P (E|X, V ) from the data, which is represented as P (E) for simplicity. As described in detail in Methods, by examining the relationship between the distribution of E c 0 that is the resultant causal subgraph E c , and E c T that is the (initial) original graph E against label (y), we can obtain Eq.(1). Then, for the (Tt)-th backward step (i.e., from T to 0) of the inference process regarding the distribution of E c t , we derive the main theoretical result Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>): interventional causality from the causal subgraph E c to the label y of the measured samples, in the sense of counterfactual intervention.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (E c T ) = P (E c 0 ) T -1 t=0 P (E s t |E c t )<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (y|CF (E s t )) = P (y|E c t+1 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where CF (E  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> depicts the causal inference block, which fits P (E c t-1 |E c t ). We can have N, M and K layers of GCNconv for Sharing GCN Block, Causal Infer Block and Task Model, where N, M, K are dataset dependent. In general, a model with more layers could have better performance. However, we use only one GCN layer in the Shared GCN Block and Infer Block for simplicity and ease of interpretation. Note that the Spurious Infer Block has the same structure as the Causal Infer Block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Computational results on benchmarks</head><p>We mainly follow the experimental settings of the prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> with some differences due to our goal of explaining both the GNN output and the underlying causal factors. As previously mentioned, we achieve the explainer task at a graph-level and thus evaluate our model on graph classification tasks. We use one synthetic dataset BA-2motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and two real-world datasets, MUTAG and NCI1, both widely used in graph classification, and summarize their statistics in Appendix.</p><p>BA2-motif: This synthetic dataset, constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, utilizes BA graphs as its base. These base graphs are generated through a Markov process, with half subsequently attached to "house" motifs and the remaining half attached to five-node cycle motifs. Each graph is then assigned to one of two classes based on the attached motif type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Baselines and experimental setup</head><p>We compare our model with the following baselines: GNNEplainer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, OrphicX <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, GEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, PGExplainer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We evaluate our model not only in explaining the task GNN model, but also in causally explaining the phenomenon itself. Hence, we conduct two parts of experiments: one is the traditional GNN explaining experiments where we use the origin task GNN's output as a criterion (the fewer edges used to predict, the closer to the origin output, the more powerful) without the consideration of the labels; the other one uses the ground truth of the labels as a criterion (the more edges used to predict the ground truth, the better).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Results on synthetic datasets</head><p>In this section, we show CIDER's performance in the BA-2motif dataset. The BA-2Motif Dataset, featured in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, serves as a synthetic dataset crafted for the assessment of explainability algorithms. This dataset comprises 1,000 randomly generated Barabási-Albert (BA) graphs, a selection designed to mirror the complexity and variability inherent in graph-based data structures. To introduce further complexity and to facilitate the evaluation of algorithmic explainability, these graphs are augmented with one of two distinct motifs: a HouseMotif or a five-node CycleMotif.</p><p>The presence of these motifs divides the dataset into two classifications. Graphs adorned with a HouseMotif fall into one category, while those featuring a five-node CycleMotif are allocated to the other. This bifurcation is central to the dataset's utility in testing the efficacy of explainability algorithms, as it presents a clear, binary classification challenge based on the type of motif attached to the underlying BA graph.</p><p>In the context of the synthetic BA-2Motif Dataset, CIDER demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving nearly 100% accuracy in classifying graphs based on the attached motifs. This remarkable level of precision underscores CIDER's effectiveness and power in addressing complex pattern recognition challenges within graph data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Results on real-world datasets</head><p>In this section, we aim to answer the question of which parts of the graph causally contribute to the label or phenotype. As our goal is the underlying phenomena and causality, we evaluate our model based on its ability to predict the ground truth of the labels by training a GNN from the observed data. To this end, we modify the loss function L 1 to</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nc i=1</head><p>Ns j=1 |ϕ f c (ϕ gc (X, CF (E s )) -y|. The results of our model and baselines on explaining phenomena tasks are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. We observe that our model outperforms all the baselines on all datasets. This indicates that our model can learn the causality from the subgraph to underlying phenomena. Consequently, our model can use fewer edges to predict the ground truth. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Real-world applications</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the application of CIDER in analyzing COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and AML bulk RNA-seq data, highlighting its potential and adaptable utility in real-world scenarios. The primary advantage of utilizing CIDER for RNA-seq data analysis lies in its capacity to simultaneously elucidate both causal genes and CellType network. This capability significantly facilitates the identification of underlying biological mechanisms at a molecular level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">COVID-19 dataset</head><p>We applied CIDER to a scRNA-seq dataset from COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which includes gene expression profiles from 8,361,000 single cells obtained from the blood of 124 individuals in three different states: COVID-19, influenza, and normal. These single cells have been annotated into 19 distinct cell types in the original study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Metric evaluation on the COVID dataset</head><p>Initially, we employed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for the COVID-19 gene network, consisting of 370 nodes (genes) and 498 edges, achieving a graph classification accuracy of 0.85. Following the application of CIDER, the network was significantly streamlined to merely 30 edges, while maintaining a classification accuracy of 0.82 with the same GNN. This result indicates that CIDER preserved approximately 96% of the performance in deducing gene-gene causal subgraphs, while substantially reducing the network's complexity for inference tasks. Moreover, CIDER managed to retain 91% of the performance in identifying cell type-cell type causal subgraphs, demonstrating its efficiency in network sparsification without significant loss of accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Biological analysis for COVID-19 dataset</head><p>To further elucidate the effectiveness of our CIDER method in the real-world data, we conducted additional validation using the COVID-19 RNA-seq dataset from blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Our CIDER method allowed us to refine the top 1% of highly variable genes (375 genes) in the dataset, from which we selected the top 30 genes (&lt; 0.08%) with the highest causal association scores as key genes for biological analysis using tools like the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and STRING database <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In the STRING network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>) with a score threshold &gt; 0.4, it is apparent that these 30 genes are partitioned into 3 independent subnetworks. One large subnetwork comprising genes such as CYBB and the S100 protein family, a smaller subnetwork formed by the RPS family of genes alongside FTL, and the standalone gene COTL1. These three separated subnetworks potentially indicate three or more distinct network functions, which will be a focal point in our further research work in combination with other analytical tools.</p><p>The isolated COTL1 may have a unique, yet unknown impact. Previous studies have reported the role of COTL1 in the immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and were also mentioned involved in the SuperPath's Innate Immune System <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, while the  COTL1 protein in the Airway mucus of COVID-19 patients was shown to be downregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. KEGG Pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> enrichment results (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>) revealed routes including ribosomes, apoptosis, tuberculosis, and COVID-19, hinting at a possible direct linkage of our filtered key genes with COVID-19. Of these, four key genes (CYBB, RPS3, RPS18, and RPS27) overlap with the COVID-19 pathway: CYBB is considered a major component of the phagocytic cells' microbicidal oxidase system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and has been shown to produce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> which are implicated in the exacerbation of clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Overactivation of Nox2, associated with CYBB, has been linked to thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients, suggesting a role for Nox2 as a mechanism favoring thrombotic-related ischemic events <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the Ribosomal Protein family has been reported as a potential inhibitor of COVID-19 replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, with RPS3, RPS18, and RPS27-members overlapping with our key network and the COVID-19 pathway-identified as critical. RPS3, in particular, was highlighted as a HUB gene in COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and a potential therapeutic target <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. COVID-19 exploits the mRNA-binding residues of RPS3 to influence both host and viral mRNA translation and stability <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Through the analysis of Gene Ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>) and Uniport Keywords <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>), the majority of genes were enriched in immune-related keywords, further supporting the effectiveness and credibility of our method in selecting COVID-19 related genes.</p><p>The S100 Calcium Binding Protein Family was mentioned multiple times concerning immune-related keywords across databases and reported to play a role in the inflammatory conditions in COVID-19 patients with potential applications in predicting the severity of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. These genes have a closely related function with CYBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, potentially acting to activate CYBB (the Activation of Phagocyte NADPH Oxidase, Nox2) in the immune response against COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, in Uniport Keywords Ligand analysis, Calcium and Lectin emerge as key terms worth our attention. Literature suggests that COVID-19 critically impacts calcium balance and serves as a biomarker of clinical severity at the onset of symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Hypocalcemia has been strongly positively associated with COVID-19 severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and calcium channel blockers have been shown to reduce mortality from the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Lectin also demonstrates efficacy in combating and treating COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>These analyses indicate that the CIDER method effectively filters and identifies key genes with causal associations with COVID-19, unraveling intricate networks and pathways that offer a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the disease's pathophysiology and contribute to identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">TCGA-LAML dataset</head><p>We applied CIDER to the TCGA-LAML (acute myeloid leukemia) RNA-seq dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which includes gene expression profiles from 179 individuals of three labels: Adverse, Intermediate and Favorable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Metric evaluation on the TCGA-LAML dataset</head><p>Initially, we cleaned the gene expression data before using STRING and correction networks to construct the original gene network. Subsequently, we applied our CIDER methodology to identify and refine the top 1.5% of highly variable genes from the original network.

Additionally, overexpression of RACK1 is linked to chemotherapy resistance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Discussion</head><p>This work developed a new method "CIDER" of causal subgraph inference by implementing a Counterfactual-Invariant Diffusion process, i.e., with both counterfactual and diffusion implementations. In other words, it is able to generate causal explanations, which provides not only causal subgraphs due to counterfactual implementation but reliable causal links due to the diffusion process, which can be applied in various fields as a general method for interventional causal inference in contrast to the traditional association studies or observational causal inference from data. However, there are several remaining issues that need further improvement in this framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Unobserved confounders</head><p>Handling unobserved confounders is a very important issue in causal inference, which limits the applications of many methods. In this work with the task model ϕ, CIDER can actually reduce the influence of unobserved confounders. Let E u to denote the unobserved confounders, where E u must have some causal effect to y and also to some part of E s . We can split E s into E su and E so while E u has causal effect to E su but has no effect to E so . Now we assume E c contributes more than E u . According to the assumption of DAG, there are some other unobserved factors which make more influence on E su , so it would make do(E c ∪ E su ) have less prediction ability for y than E c ∪ E s , which lets CIDER remove the E su from E c , thus reducing the influence of unobserved confounders, and is also one major advantage of this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>This paper introduces CIDER for causal subgraph inference. Leveraging both counterfactual and diffusion implementations, CIDER provides generalizability in evaluating a subgraph's causal impact on labels. The counterfactual implementation ensures causal interpretation, while the diffusion process further enhances reliability. Realworld evaluations demonstrate the significant advantages of CIDER over existing methods: theoretically and computationally infer interventional causal subgraph (a set of causal edges) and alleviate unobserved confounder effects. Notably, CIDER's modelagnostic and task-agnostic nature offers broad applicability across various domains. Our work underscores the importance of explainability in fostering transparency and trust in black-box AI and aiding researchers in comprehending underlying phenomena and uncovering intricate network-level patterns. While CIDER theoretically possesses the capability to infer causal subgraphs in real-world scenarios even with unobserved confounders, further experiment is needed to fully evaluate this feature, highlighting a potential topic for future research. Additionally, investigating causal subgraph inference in hypergraphs presents an intriguing avenue for exploration and potential real-world application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Methods</head><p>In this section, we introduce the new framework of CIDER. Different from previous association methods or observational causal works, CIDER is able to identify a causal subgraph for explaining both tasks 1) and 2) in the sense of counterfactual intervention. We first introduce an additive noise model and counterfactual invariant, and then a diffusion process to generate the causal subgraph by training the GNN based on the measured data (X, y). The overall framework of CIDER is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>.</p></div>

The goal is to find the subset E c that has the most causal effect on y. If E is not available, we can use the measured X to construct an association-based graph of nodes as an initial network instead. As mentioned above, there are two questions on the explainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>, i.e. 1) causally explain the phenomena itself, 2) transparently explain the given ϕ. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we drop X, so we can use E to denote the graph G.</p><p>This paper focuses primarily on answering question 1) due to its great importance and inherent challenge in real-world applications. Note that in numerous scientific fields, including biology and physics, researchers are particularly interested in comprehending the "why" behind a phenomenon, namely its underlying causal subsystem or subgraph.</p><p>We formulate the two explainabilities as a causal effect problem, with the difference being the task-GNN model condition. For addressing 1), we formulate Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) with an emphasis on the causal relationship between the causal subgraph E c of E and the label y. We elucidate why y is causally affected by E c . The aim of this paper is to learn such a F * in Eq.3, which gives us the causal subgraph E c .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E c = F * (E, y)<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (y|E c ) = P (y|E)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>To achieve 1) on causality rather than correlation, we must perform intervention or do-calculus on E. We use E s to represent the spurious subgraph of E, i.e., E\E c , in this paper. Hence, we formulate the problem using Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), so as to make the inference from association to causation. CF (E s ) is defined as Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">5</ref>), where Ẽs is a counterfactual sample of E s . Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) implies that we sample a new E s from the marginal distribution P (E s |E c ) without affecting the GNN's output, i.e. only changing E s without changing E c in this new pseudo-sample.

It is easy to prove that Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) is much stronger than Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) due to such a docalculus or counterfactual implementation.

ANMs are widely used in various machine learning fields, such as image processing and audio processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70]</ref>. The basic principle behind ANMs is that a signal of interest, X, is corrupted by random noise, N , resulting in the observed signal, Y = αX + N .

We view ϕ through a message-passing lens. The aggregation process essentially acts as a sequence of transformers based on the edges in the feature matrix X. This perspective allows us to form the problem as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task. We treat each edge as a transformer applied to X, and aim to identify a set of edges that can be removed without making the resulting representation ϕ gc (X) deviate from the original distribution. In other words, the ϕ gc (X) should be a counterfactual invariant representation that only is sensitive to changes in the distribution of edges deemed causal(E c ), not those deemed spurious(E s ). This concept is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>, which depicts our method's directed acyclic graph (DAG). Note that Z c and Z s may exhibit correlations that are not considered here. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref> further demonstrates how our approach integrates with the decision region framework discussed in Section 5.1.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Distribution of causal subgraph</head><p>In order to quantify the causal effect or strength of E c , we need to perform an intervention.

Instead, we use the framework of random graphs to solve this problem at the distribution level. Although a graph may not look like other structured data, such as images or lists, it also has distributions.

The relationships between them can be formulated by Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">9</ref>). As mentioned in section 5.4, E c is a set of edges, which induces a series of transformations resulting in OOD of ϕ gc (X) when their distribution changes.
