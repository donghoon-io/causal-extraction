<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great success in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) by modeling how entities and relations interact in recent years. However, most of them are designed to learn from the observed graph structure, which appears to have imbalanced relation distribution during the training stage. Motivated by the causal relationship among the entities on a knowledge graph, we explore this defect through a counterfactual question: "would the relation still exist if the neighborhood of entities became different from observation?". With a carefully designed instantiation of a causal model on the knowledge graph, we generate the counterfactual relations to answer the question by regarding the representations of entity pair given relation as context, structural information of relation-aware neighborhood as treatment, and validity of the composed triplet as the outcome. Furthermore, we incorporate the created counterfactual relations with the GNNbased framework on KGs to augment their learning of entity pair representations from both the observed and counterfactual relations. Experiments on benchmarks show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on the task of KGC, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed counterfactual relations-based augmentation also enhances the interpretability of the GNN-based framework through the path interpretations of predictions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Knowledge can be encoded in knowledge graphs (KGs), which store structured information of real-world entities as nodes and relations as edges. Real-world KGs are usually noisy and incomplete. Because of the nature of incompleteness of KGs, knowledge graph completion (KGC) is designed to predict missing relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>GNN-based KGC models have shown effects on the KGC task and attracted tremendous attention in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Many popular GNNs follow an iterative message passing then aggregate scheme to adaptively learn the representations of nodes in graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. When learning on a homogeneous graph, the representation of the center node is updated by aggregating the message gathered from the neighbors of the node while preserving the local structure around the node during each iteration, While a homogeneous graph could be viewed as a special version of KGs, GNNs are not able to be directly employed on KGs and are usually modified to model the interactions between entities and multiple relations. However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the distribution of relation types is usually imbalanced on KGs. Most of the current GNN-based approaches fail to capture this information and could not generalize well. This failure calls for a better learning regime on KGC.</p><p>In this work, we propose to alleviate this failure with data augmentation on KGs, especially from the perspective of causal inference by answering the following counterfactual question:</p><p>Would the relation still exist if the neighborhood of entities became different from observation? If a GNN-based KGC model learns this causal relationship via answering the counterfactual question above, such knowledge will help to discover causal effects on relation types and improve the accuracy of prediction as well as the generalization ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Note that the causality here falls into the scope of causal inference models, where we focus on taking advantage of existing basic yet effective causal models to enhance the task of KGC. This aligns with a line of research works <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, and is not related to the explicit semantic relations in KGs.</p><p>A counterfactual question is often associated with three factors: context (as a data point), treatment (as a type of manipulation), and outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. Previous effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> proposes to use whether two nodes live in the same neighborhood to define such treatment on a homogeneous graph. However, we argue that this definition has flaws in KGs since it ignores the specific relation connected entities. Taking Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> as an example. Let the blue and orange ovals be two detected communities by treating the KG as a homogeneous graph. Hedwig and Ron Weasley obviously share the same neighborhood within the ovals if we ignore the relation type on edges. Then the treatment definition from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> would be confused and make no distinction between Ron Weasley, who is a person, and Hedwig, which is an owl. As a result, it is even harder to help predict the different relations "pet of " and "friend" that are associated with them and Harry Potter. Therefore, it is non-trivial to directly migrate the treatment definition from a homogeneous graph to KGs due to the multi-relation nature.</p><p>Based on the idea of considering relation types with causal learning on KGs, we propose an instantiation of causal models on KGs with a new definition of treatment for context. By answering the counterfactual questions, we discover the counterfactual relations for all observed contexts and calculate their counterfactual treatments accordingly. Then, we integrate the representation learning of a pair of entities given a query relation with both their factual and counterfactual treatments and propose a counterfactual relation augmented GNN-based framework (KGCF) for KGC. Specifically, since this counterfactual treatment is not available from the observed data (valid triplets on KGs), we match it with the nearest neighbor of an entity pair in hidden embedding space and use the neighbor's factual treatment as a substitution. To further address the imbalanced distribution of relation types, we first embed the entities to an embedding space that is associated with each relation type, then find the nearest neighbors within this embedding space. After obtaining both the factual and counterfactual views of training data, we consociate them into an encoder-decoder style framework to learn better representations and predict missing relations.</p><p>The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: • Motivated by the need for data augmentation on KGs, we propose the first instantiation of the causal model for KGs via answering counterfactual questions and considering the relation types.</p><p>• We present KGCF that utilizes counterfactual relations to augment the representation learning on KGs with special consideration on the imbalanced relation distribution.</p><p>• Extensive experiments show the superiority of KGCF on KGC task. We further demonstrate that counterfactual relations also enhance the interpretation ability through path-based explanation of predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC)</head><p>Popular research KGC models mainly fall into three categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>: embedding-based methods, relation path inference, and rule-based reasoning. While the last two research directions focus on exploring the multi-step relationships, we focus on the recently preliminary direction of KGC in this paper: embedding-based KGC methods with GNNs and cover some of the recent progress in this line of research due to a large amount of literature. Jung et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> propose a new GNN encoder, which can effectively capture the query-related information from the temporal KG and is interpretable in the reasoning process. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> verify by experiments that the graph structure modeling in GCNs has no significant impact on the performance of the KGC model. Instead, they propose a simple and effective LTE-KGE framework by removing the GCN aggregation. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> propose a new model called CFAG, which uses a coarse-grained aggregator (CG-AGG) and a fine-grained generative adversarial net (FG-GAN) to resolve the emergence of new entities. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> propose a KG inference framework SS-AGA based on self-supervised graph alignment. Despite the progress of the above-mentioned models, most of them fail to consider the imbalanced distribution of relation types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Causal Inference</head><p>Finding causal relationships between different variables from observational data is a long-standing scientific problem in the field of statistics and artificial intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Causal inference for GNNs is an emerging field of research, which can be divided into three categories: counterfactual learning, causal graph-guided representation learning, and causal discovery. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> use causal inference to improve the explainability of GNNs. They transform the explainability problem of reasoning decisions in the GNNs into a causal learning task, and then a causal explanation model is trained based on the objective function of Granger causality. Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> propose a new framework called causal inference under spillover effects, which solves the problem of individual treatment effect estimation with high-order interference on hypergraphs. Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> first propose to use causal inference to improve link prediction on homogeneous graphs, which is the most related one to this paper. They propose the concept of counterfactual link prediction (CFLP) and representations are learned from observed and counterfactual links which are used as augmented training data. In contrast, we focus on KGs in this paper, to which CFLP could not be trivially migrated as discussed in Sec. 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data Augmentation on Knowledge Graph</head><p>Graph Data Augmentation (GraphDA) is to find a mapping function that enriches or changes the information in a given graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, which is a relatively underexplored area for KGs. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> propose a rumor data augmentation method called graph embedding-based rumor data augmentation (GERDA) to solve the data imbalance of rumor detection, which uses KGs to simulate the rumor generation process from the perspective of knowledge. Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> propose positive-unlabeled learning with adversarial data augmentation (PUDA). PUDA alleviates the problem of false negatives through positive-unlabeled learning and positive sample sparsity through adversarial data augmentation. Different from them, we propose to use the causal model to generate counterfactual augmentations to facilitate representation learning on KGs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PRELIMINARIES 3.1 Knowledge Graphs (KGs)</head><p>A knowledge graph (KG) is denoted as a set of triplets:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G = {(𝑒 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑒 𝑘 )} ⊂ (E × R × E),</formula><p>where E and R represent a set of entities (nodes) and relations (edges), respectively. 𝑒 𝑖 and 𝑟 𝑗 are the 𝑖-th entity and 𝑗-th relation, and the types of relations could be in great numbers within a KG. We also usually distinguish the entity pair (𝑒 𝑖 , 𝑒 𝑘 ) with (ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑘 ), considering the direction of the two entities. Note that a homogeneous graph G = (V, E) can be viewed as only one relation type for all edges versions of KGs. Throughout this paper, we use bold terms, 𝑾 or 𝒆, to denote matrix/vector representations for weights and entities, respectively. And we select italic terms, 𝑤 ℎ or 𝛼, to denote scalars. We can also use a third-order binary ten-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">sor A ∈ {0, 1} | E |× | R |× | E |</formula><p>to uniquely define a KG, which is also known as the adjacency tensor of G. The (𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘) entry A 𝑖 𝑗𝑘 = 1 if (ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ) is valid or otherwise A 𝑖 𝑗𝑘 = 0. The 𝑗-th frontal slice of A is the adjacency matrix of the 𝑗-th relation 𝑟 𝑗 , which we denote as A 𝑟 𝑗 for specification. To ease the notation, we also use A (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) to denote the entry of a given triplet (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) in the adjacency tensor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">GNN-Based framework for KGC</head><p>GNN-Based framework dealing with KGC usually adopts an encoderdecoder style framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, where GNNs perform as the encoder and embedding-based score functions (e.g., TransE, DistMult, Ro-tatE and ConvE) perform as the decoder. A KG's entities and relations are first represented as embeddings by the GNN encoder. After having the embeddings from GNN (encoder) for entities and relations, KGC models usually simulate how entities and relations interact with the help of a score function (decoder) 𝑠 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E × R × E → R.</formula><p>The decoder then predicts the entries in the adjacency tensors A utilizing the derived representations. The prediction could be viewed as a recovery of the original graph structures since adjacency tensors and graph structures are in bijection. In this way, the score function-based decoder can detect missing relations in the original KG while completing the KG by recovering the graph structure. It is worth mentioning that in some GNN-based frameworks for KGC, such as NBFNet, the aforementioned score functions are implicitly included in the procedure of message passing, and a simple feedforward neural network is employed as decoder on the learned entity pair representations to predict the missing links given the head/tail entity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PROPOSED METHOD 4.1 Incorporating GNN-based framework for KGC with Causal Model</head><p>Previous works on GNN-based framework for KGC <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have shown that message passing and aggregating scheme is able to generate more structure-enriched representations. However, recalling the example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the distribution of relations appears to be quite imbalanced in KGs. This imbalanced distribution might lead the learning of GNNs to be trapped into the dominant relation types and fail to generalize to other relations during inference. Nevertheless, with the help of recent progress of data augmentation on graph learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, we propose to enhance the generalization ability of current GNN-based learning frameworks on KGC from the perspective of a causal model. Counterfactual causal inference seeks to determine the causal relationship between treatment and outcome by posing counterfactual questions. An illustration of the counterfactual question is "would the outcome be different if the treatment was different?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In order to address the counterfactual question, researchers would next develop a causal model and apply causal inference accordingly. For example, the left subfigure from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> is a typical triangle causal-directed acyclic graph (DAG) model. In this example, we denote the context (confounder) as 𝒁 , the treatment as 𝑻 , and the outcome as 𝒀 . Once three of them are decided, the counterfactual inference methods could determine the effect of treatment 𝑻 on the outcome 𝒀 given context 𝒁 . Two statistics, individual treatment effect (ITE) and its expectation averaged treatment effect (ATE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, are usually employed to measure this effect. Given a binary treatment variable 𝑇 = {0, 1}, we denote 𝑔(z,𝑇 ) as the outcome of z, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ITE(𝒛) = 𝑔(𝒛, 1) -𝑔(𝒛, 0), ATE = E 𝒛∼𝒁 ITE(𝒛).</formula><p>Bigger ATE/LTE indicates a stronger causal relationship between treatment and outcome. Recent effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> proposes to develop a causal model to enhance the representation learning on graphs. Through proper definitions of context, treatments, and their corresponding outcomes on graphs, promising performance on plain link prediction problems for homogeneous graphs is obtained.</p><p>On the contrary, in this work, we focus on a more comprehensive version of graphs, the KG, and focus on the KGC task. Given a pair of head entities and relation (ℎ, 𝑟, ?), our model needs to predict the existence of a tail relation 𝑡. Hence, we aim to learn an effective representation 𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡) of head-tail pair (ℎ, 𝑡) given a query relation 𝑟 . As shown in the right subfigure from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we define the context as the entity pair representation 𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡), and the outcome in the adjacency tensor A (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) is the validity of triplet (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡). Therefore, our causal DAG contains the following nodes: • 𝒛 (Confounder; unobservable): latent entity pair representations; • T (Treatment; observable): KG structural information (e.g., whether two entities belong to the same neighborhood); • A (Outcome; observable): triplet existence. And the edges in our DAG are: 𝒛 -&gt; T , 𝒛 -&gt; A and T -&gt; A.</p><p>In this way, we instantiate the typical causal model on the KG by leveraging the estimated ITE(A (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) |T (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) ) to improve the learning of 𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡). Here, the objective is different from classic causal inference, as well as the definition of the plain link prediction in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, considering the multiple types of relations. More specifically, for each pair of entities (ℎ, 𝑡) given a query relation 𝑟 , the corresponding ITE can be estimated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ITE (ℎ,𝑡 ) = 𝑔(𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡), 1) -𝑔(𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡), 0).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In the next, we will incorporate the information of ITE from the counterfactual relations to augment the KG and improve the learning of 𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡), accordingly. Both the entity pair representation 𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡) and the outcome A (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) need to consider the presence of multiple types of relations. Furthermore, the imbalanced distribution also makes the design of incorporation to the GNN-based embedding framework on KGC difficult.</p><p>As a preparation for the next step of incorporation, we denote the observed adjacency tensor by A 𝐹 as factual outcomes. In other words, A 𝐹 is constructed with all triplets from the training set. We also denote the unobserved tensor of the counterfactual relations by A 𝐶𝐹 when the treatment is different from the counterfactual outcomes. For the definition of treatment, we denote</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T 𝐹 ∈ {0, 1} | E |× | R |× | E |</formula><p>as the binary factual treatment tensor, where T 𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) indicates the treatment of the entity pair (ℎ, 𝑡) given a query relation 𝑟 . Then we denote T 𝐶𝐹 as the counterfactual treatment matrix where T 𝐶𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) = 1 -T 𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) . We are interested in two aspects: 1) Estimating the counterfactual outcomes A 𝐶𝐹 2) learning from both factual (observed data) outcomes A 𝐹 and counterfactual (augmented data) outcomes A 𝐶𝐹 to enhance the ability of GNN-based framework on KGC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Treatment Variable on KG</head><p>In this section, we describe how we design to acquire the factual treatment variable T 𝐹 . As in many GNN-based embedding frameworks for KGC, we assume the entities that share similar neighborhoods would tend to share similar relations as well. Therefore, finding the individual treatment for a pair of entities from their neighborhood under a special consideration to relation type is intuitively effective for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, as pointed out by recent works on homogeneous graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, models may fail to identify more global but also important factors purely from the association between local structural information and link presence. Therefore, in this work, we use both local and global structural roles of each entity pair as its treatment.</p><p>In KGs, since the relations are divided into multiple types, we need to define treatment based on the adjacency tensor A 𝑟 w.r.t the query relation 𝑟 , rather than simply dealing with a collapsed adjacency matrix as the regular practice in GNN-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Note that though in this work, we define the treatment from the structural information w.r.t the view of each relation 𝑟 𝑗 on KGs for illustration, the causal models shown in 3 do not limit the treatment to be structural roles on the graph. The treatment variable T 𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) can be defined from any property of triplet (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡). Then for each adjacency tensor in A 𝑟 𝑗 , we define the binary treatment variable according to whether the two entities in a pair belong to the same community/neighborhood from a global perspective and calculate them separately. In this way, the relation types are explicitly considered in our treatment definition. We denote 𝑐 : V → N as any graph clustering or community detection approach that assigns each entity with an index of the community/cluster/neighborhood that the entity belongs to. The treatment tensor T is defined as T 𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) = 1 if 𝑐 (ℎ) = 𝑐 (𝑡) on adjacency tensor A 𝑟 , and T 𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) = 0 otherwise. For the choice of 𝑐, without the loss of generality, an unsupervised approach K-core <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> that is widely used for clustering graph structure is utilized in our work as an example. K-core is strongly related to the concept of graph degeneracy, which has a long history in graph theory. Given a graph G and an integer 𝑘, a K-core of a graph G is a maximal connected subgraph of G in which all vertices have degrees at least 𝑘. Equivalently, it is the connected components that are left after all vertices of degree less than 𝑘 have been removed.</p><p>The reason that we choose the K-core algorithm falls into three aspects: 1) The core decomposition-based approach can be used to quantify node importance in many different domains efficiently and effectively. Precisely, the K-core algorithm for a graph G can be computed in linear time w.r.t the number of edges E of G, which is of great importance considering the massive entities in a KG. 2) By assigning to each graph node an integer number 𝑘 (the core number), K-core could capture how well the given node is connected w.r.t its neighbors, which could also reflect the first-order proximity on graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, which is a desired structural property for neighborhood. 3) As one of the generally used clustering methods that consider the global graph structural information, the role of each entity pair from a global perspective could also be reserved to complement the local structure information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Counterfactual Relations</head><p>Once we have defined the treatment from the observed space, we can discover the counterfactual treatment T 𝐶𝐹 and outcome A 𝐶𝐹 for each pair of entities given a query relation. However, this counterfactual relationship is not available from the observed data. As a substitution, we would like to find T 𝐶𝐹 and A 𝐶𝐹 from the nearest observed context as substitution <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. It is a common practice to estimate treatment effects from observational data using this form of matching on covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. In this way, for a pair of entities (ℎ, 𝑡) given a relation 𝑟 as a candidate, we can match their counterfactual treatment T 𝐶𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) to their nearest neighbor with the opposite treatment. Accordingly, the outcome of their nearest neighbor is treated as counterfactual relation.</p><p>Formally, ∀(ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ) ∈ S, where S is a selected set of entity pair candidates, its counterfactual relation (ℎ 𝑎 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑏 ) with the same type of relationship is (ℎ 𝑎 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑏 ) = arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(ℎ 𝑎 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑏 ) ∈ E×E 𝑑 ((ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ), (ℎ 𝑎 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑏 )) T 𝐹 (ℎ 𝑎 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑏 ) = 1 -T 𝐹 (ℎ 𝑖 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑘 ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where 𝑑 (•, •) is a distance measuring metric between a pair of entity pairs (a pair of contexts) in the factual adjacency tensor A 𝐹 𝑟 𝑗 given a query relation 𝑟 𝑗 . Here we omit the index in relation 𝑟 since the counterfactual relation should have the same relation type as the factual one. Nevertheless, there are still two challenges remaining for the above practice:</p><p>• It needs 𝑂 (𝑁 4 ) comparisons for finding the nearest neighbors if we choose the commonly used all 𝑂 (𝑁 2 ) entity pairs as S = E × E, which is inefficient and infeasible in the application and hard to scale to large graphs. Considering the validity does not hold for all entity pairs, we design to set S as all entity pairs that have appeared in the dataset, but we eliminate the types of relations as well as the validity of the formed triplets, which prevents the risk of data leakage. Thus, the number of comparisons is greatly reduced by this selection of S. • Directly calculating the closest distance of entity pairs from A 𝐹 is still trapped in the observed space and could not bring extra counterfactual information. Therefore, we propose to find the nearest observed context of entity pairs from hidden low-dimensional embedding space. We take the unsupervised embedding method node2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to learn the embedding space for entities since it could effectively preserve the proximity in the graph. This aligns with our second reason for choosing K-core for defining factual treatment in the observed space.</p><p>After the aforementioned two challenges are solved, we propose to use an entity embedding matrix, which is denoted as 𝑴, to find the counterfactual substitutes of triplets from candidates. Especially, taking the imbalanced distribution into account, we design to learn 𝑴 w.r.t the proportion 𝜓 𝑗 of a given relation 𝑟 𝑗 in the distribution of all relation types. That is for every A 𝐹 𝑟 𝑗 , we employ node2vec to get the embeddings accordingly as 𝑴 𝑟 𝑗 , and the overall embedding matrix is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝑴 ∈ R E×𝑑 = R ∑︁ 𝑟 𝑗 𝜓 𝑗 𝑴 𝑟 𝑗 .</formula><p>where 𝑑 is the dimension of embedding. Thus, ∀(ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ) ∈ S, we define its substitution for counterfactual relation (ℎ 𝑎 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑏 ) as (ℎ 𝑎 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑏 ) = arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(ℎ 𝑎 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑏 ) ∈ E×E 𝑑 (𝒎 𝑖 , 𝒎 𝑎 ) + 𝑑 (𝒎 𝑘 , 𝒎 𝑏 ) T 𝐹 (ℎ 𝑎 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑏 ) = 1 -T 𝐹 (ℎ 𝑖 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑘 ) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where we specify 𝑑 (•, •) as the Euclidean distance on the hidden embedding space of 𝑴, and 𝒎 𝑖 indicates the embedding of entity ℎ 𝑖 in the weighted node2vec space and so on. It is worth mentioning that in comparison with the approximated solution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, our introduced pair candidates could not only enhance the validity of potential triplets but also cast off the need for another hyperparameter for constraining the maximum distance.</p><p>To guarantee that all neighbors are sufficiently comparable (as substitutes) in the hidden embedding space, we do not assign counterfactual treatments for the given entity pair if there does not exist any entity pair satisfying Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">3</ref>), Thus, ∀(ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ) ∈ S the counterfactual treatment matrix T 𝐶𝐹 and the counterfactual adjacency tensor A 𝐶𝐹 𝑟 𝑗 given a query relation 𝑟 𝑗 are substituted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T 𝐶𝐹 (ℎ 𝑖 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑘 ) , A 𝐶𝐹 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 =            T 𝐹 (ℎ 𝑎 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑏 ) , A 𝐹 𝑎,𝑗,𝑏 , if ∃ (ℎ 𝑎 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑏 ) ∈ E × E satisfies 3; T 𝐹 (ℎ 𝑖 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑘 ) , A 𝐹 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘</formula><p>, otherwise.</p><p>(4) Note that the embeddings 𝑴 from hidden space is only used once for finding the substitutes for counterfactual treatment and outcome. Both 𝑴 and the nearest neighbors are also computed only once and remain unchanged during the learning process.</p><p>After the instantiation of the causal model on KGC, we can design our model on how to learn the embeddings for the KG from the counterfactual distributions, which we denote as KGCF. We denote 𝑃 𝐹 as the factual distribution of the observed contexts and treatments, and 𝑃 𝐶𝐹 be the counterfactual distribution that is composed of the observed contexts and opposite treatments. For all possible triplets (ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ) and their treatments, the empirical factual distribution P𝐹 ∼ 𝑃 𝐹 is defined as P𝐹 = {((ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ), T 𝐹 (ℎ 𝑖 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑘 ) )} E 𝑖,𝑘=1 , and define the empirical counterfactual distribution P𝐶𝐹 ∼ 𝑃 𝐶𝐹 as P𝐶𝐹 = {((ℎ 𝑖 , 𝑟 𝑗 , 𝑡 𝑘 ), T 𝐶𝐹 (ℎ 𝑖 ,𝑟 𝑗 ,𝑡 𝑘 ) )} E 𝑖,𝑘=1 . While existing GNN-based KGC models only use the information from P𝐹 as input, we benifit from the counterfactual distribution P𝐶𝐹 by augment the training data with the counterfactual relations.</p></div>

Decoder. For the relation decoder that predicts whether a triplet is valid between a pair of entities with a query relation 𝑟 , we remain consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and adopt a simple decoder based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict the conditional likelihood of the tail entity 𝑡. With the pair representation 𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡) from the output of the last layer in encoder 𝑓 and the treatments of the triplet, the decoder 𝑔 is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p𝐹 (𝑡 |ℎ, 𝑟 ) = 𝑔(Z, T 𝐹 ) = MLP([𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡), T 𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) ]),<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">p𝐶𝐹 (𝑡 |ℎ, 𝑟 ) = 𝑔(Z, T 𝐶𝐹 ) = MLP([𝒛 𝑟 (ℎ, 𝑡), T 𝐶𝐹 (ℎ,𝑟,𝑡 ) ]),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where [•, •] stands for the concatenation of vectors. The outputs are the conditional likelihood of the tail entity 𝑡: p𝐹 (𝑡 |ℎ, 𝑟 ) and p𝐶𝐹 (𝑡 |ℎ, 𝑟 ) for both factual and counterfactual empirical distribution. The conditional likelihood of the head entity ℎ can be predicted by p𝐹 (ℎ|𝑡, 𝑟 -1 ) and p𝐶𝐹 (ℎ|𝑡, 𝑟 -1 ) with the same model. Note that only the factual output p𝐹 (𝑡 |ℎ, 𝑟 ) will be used in inference. Loss design. During the training process, data samples from the empirical factual/counterfactual distribution P𝐹 / P𝐶𝐹 are fed into decoder 𝑔 and optimized towards 𝑝 𝐹 (𝑡 |ℎ, 𝑟 ) and 𝑝 𝐶𝐹 (𝑡 |ℎ, 𝑟 ), respectively. We follow the previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> to minimize the negative log-likelihood of positive and negative triplets from factual and counterfactual views. The negative samples are generated according to Partial Completeness Assumption (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> as in NBFNet, which creates a negative sample by corrupting one of the entities in a positive triplet. The corresponding losses are defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">L 𝐹 = -log p𝐹 (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) - 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 1 𝑛 log(1 -p𝐹 (ℎ ′ 𝑖 , 𝑟, 𝑡 ′ 𝑖 )),<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">L 𝐶𝐹 = -log p𝐶𝐹 (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) - 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 1 𝑛 log(1 -p𝐶𝐹 (ℎ ′ 𝑖 , 𝑟, 𝑡 ′ 𝑖 )).

Note that LTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> is not exactly a GNNbased model but we include it here since it shares the same design framework with other GNN-based models. Implementation Details.. Our implementation is similar with <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. For the encoder, we closely follow the official implementation for NBFNet and keep all architecture details as reported to maintain a fair comparison. In NBFNet, we set GNN layers as 6 and hidden 1 <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke/tree/master/examples">https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke/tree/master/examples</ref> states as 32.

We use a public implementation for node2vec and the output dimension for node2vec is set to 32. We decide the hyperparameters in loss through grid search within: 𝛼 ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1} and 𝛽 ∈ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1}. The batch size is set to 32.

We report the results regarding the filtered ranking protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We have the following observations: 1) Our KGCF achieves the best performance across all measurements on both datasets, which aligns with our motivation that balancing the distribution of relation types with augmentation could contribute to better pair representation learning. 2) The pathbased GNN approaches generally outperform other GNN baselines, which implies that the local subgraph structure that maintains the proximity between an entity pair is more essential to the massagepassing mechanism in the GNN-based KGC framework. This is consistent with the observation from LTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> that the contribution of current convolutional GNN-based designs to KGC is somehow unnecessary and needs further exploration. 3) We further use a two-sided t-test to evaluate the significance of KGCF over NBFNet. Due to limited space here, we only show the result of the p-value on WN18RR here: We can find that KGCF achieves strongly significant improvements (P &lt; 0.005) over NBFNet across all metrics, which statistically confirms that KGCF's scores in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are significantly better than NBFNet's.</p></div>

With the help of the interpretation tool from NBFNet, we could interpret the KGC prediction p𝐹 (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) of KGCF through paths from ℎ to 𝑡 that contribute most to the results. The importance of a path interpretation for p𝐹 (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) is defined as its weight from a linear model, where the weight is approximated by the sum of the importance of edges in that path. In other words, the top-k path interpretations are equivalent to the top-k longest paths on the edge importance graph.

Note that SoCR does not have to be a valid triplet. Either way, its validity could augment the learning with a counterfactual view of information. This augmentation helps  Our observations from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> are: 1) The reasoning over two entities is conducted over the paths among them with both information from factual and counterfactual treatments. Our method provides two additional views of the learned factual and counterfactual relations, which helps enhance the confidence level of reasoning by answering the counterfactual question. 2) The nearest observed context that is used as a substitution for counterfactual estimation is effective on the KG. We can find that similar entities (e.g., the films Bridesmaids and The Hangover) are close to each other in the proximity-preserving embedding space and with analogous context. 3) The interpretation answers our question from Section 1 that the relationship could not exist when the neighborhood information varies. In the first example, Argentina did not bid for the 1976 summer Olympics thus the relation is not valid in counterfactual treatment. This augmented counterfactual view of information helps the learning avoid false prediction because analogical reasoning from only observed factual neighborhoods might infer it as a valid one otherwise. Running time comparison. In complementary of the complexity analysis from Section 4.4, we report the wall time on the FB15k-237 dataset for inference efficiency comparison over a single Tesla V100 GPU. It is obvious that the KGCF is very comparable to the NBFNet encoder, which indicates that our augmented framework brings no burden to the existing GNN-based method. Meanwhile, we can find that the convolutional GNN-based methods are the most efficient since they do not consider a path-based strategy, which results in worse KGC performance conversely. Ablation study on L 𝐶𝐹 and L 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐 . To investigate how L 𝐶𝐹 and L 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐 affect the overall KGC performance, we conduct sensitivity analysis on the performance of KGCF w.r.t different combinations of 𝛼 and 𝛽. While we tune 𝛼 and 𝛽 through grid search within the same set {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1}, we search through all combinations on WN18RR and report the corresponding H@10 performance in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.

Given a pair of entities and a query relation, we first explore the factual treatments for the observed context from the view of the proximity of entities. Considering the imbalance of the distribution of relation types, we define the counterfactual relations with the help of their nearest neighbors in the embedding space from relation type weighted node2vec. The counterfactual relations augment the training data with causal relationships and facilitate pair representation learning for KGC. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KGCF achieves the SOTA performance on benchmarks as well as endows the interpretability of the path-based GNN models on KGC from a new causal perspective.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example of why simply considering neighborhood information for causal learning from a homogeneous graph view would fail on KGs.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C EVALUATION METRICS</head><p>We follow the standard filtered ranking protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and evaluate the performance of models by five metrics Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank (MR), and Hits@K (H@K). The detailed definitions of five metrics is introduced below: MRR. For a test triplet (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡), we rank it against all negative triplets (ℎ ′ , 𝑟, 𝑡) or (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡 ′ ) obtained by corrupting the head (or the tail) of the relation. Let rank ℎ (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) be the ranking of (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) among all head-corrupted relations, and let rank 𝑡 (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) denote a similar ranking with tail corruptions. MRR is the mean of the reciprocal rank:</p><p>where T is the test set. MR. MR is the mean of both ranks:</p><p>rank ℎ (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) + rank 𝑡 (ℎ, 𝑟, 𝑡) , Hits@K. Hits@K measures the proportion of triples in T that rank among top-K after corrupting both heads and tails.</p></div>			</div>
