<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we study linear non-Gaussian graphical models from the perspective of algebraic statistics. These are acyclic causal models in which each variable is a linear combination of its direct causes and independent noise. The underlying directed causal graph can be identified uniquely via the set of second and third order moments of all random vectors that lie in the corresponding model. Our focus is on finding the algebraic relations among these moments for a given graph. We show that when the graph is a polytree these relations form a toric ideal. We construct explicit trek-matrices associated to 2-treks and 3-treks in the graph. Their entries are covariances and third order moments and their 2-minors define our model set-theoretically. Furthermore, we prove that their 2-minors also generate the vanishing ideal of the model. Finally, we describe the polytopes of third order moments and the ideals for models with hidden variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Featuring prominently in a wide variety of applications, directed graphical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> capture intuitive cause-effect relations among a set of random variables by hypothesizing that each variable is a noisy function of its causes. For a number of statistical tasks, such as model selection, it has proven useful to obtain insights about the algebraic structure of the moments of the joint distributions in the graphical model for a given graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. A prominent example are results on algebraic relations among second moments, i.e., covariances, in models that postulate linear functional relationships among the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Available results include, in particular, a characterization of the vanishing of subdeterminants of the covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, which covers conditional independence in Gaussian models as a special case.</p><p>In contrast to earlier work in algebraic statistics, we conduct here a first systematic study on algebraic relations that also involve higher moments of a linear directed graphical model. Specifically, we focus on second and third order moments. Higher moments are crucial for non-Gaussian models. Indeed, in non-Gaussian cases, different models may have identical structure in second but not in all higher moments, allowing for the development of methods for causal discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. In this area, an algebraic perspective features, for instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where a particular type of relations among second and third moments was used to design a model selection method suitable for high-dimensional data.</p><p>We begin by reviewing linear non-Gaussian graphical models. Let G = (V, E) be a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and let (X i , i ∈ V ), be a collection of random variables that represent statistical observations indexed by the vertices in V . A vertex j ∈ V is a parent of vertex i if there is an edge pointing from j to i, i.e., if (j, i) ∈ E which we will also write as j → i ∈ E. We denote the set of all parents of i by pa(i). The graph G gives rise to the linear structural equation model consisting of the joint distributions of all random vectors X = (X i , i ∈ V ) such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X i = j∈pa(i) λ ji X j + ε i , i ∈ V,<label>(1.1)</label></formula><p>where the ε i are mutually independent random variables representing stochastic errors. The errors are assumed to have expectation E[ε i ] = 0, finite variance ω</p><p>(2) i = E[ε 2 i ] &gt; 0, and finite third moment ω</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(3) i = E[ε 3 i ].</formula><p>No other assumption about their distribution is made and, in particular, the errors need not be Gaussian (in which case we would have E[ε 3  i ] = 0 by symmetry of the Gaussian distribution). The coefficients λ ji in (1.1) are unknown real-valued parameters, and we fill them into a matrix Λ = (λ ji ) ∈ R V ×V by adding a zero entry when (j, i) / ∈ E. We denote the set of all such sparse matrices as R E . We note that for simplicity, and without loss of generality, the equations in (1.1) do not include a constant term, so we have E[X i ] = 0 for all i ∈ V .</p><p>Example 1.1. The simplest non-trivial case pertains to two random variables X 1 and X 2 and the DAG G with vertex set V = {1, 2} and edge set {1 → 2}. Then the model specified via (1.1) postulates that X 1 = ε 1 and X 2 = λ 12 X 1 + ε 2 . Let S = (s ij ) = (E[X i X j ]) be the covariance matrix of (X 1 , X 2 ). Using that ε 1 and ε 2 are independent and have zero mean, we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s 11 ≡ E[X 2 1 ] = ω (2) 1 , s 12 ≡ E[X 1 X 2 ] = λ 12 ω (2) 1 , s 22 ≡ E[X 2 2 ] = ω (2) 2 + λ 2 12 ω<label>(2) 1 . (1.2)</label></formula><p>As we assume ω</p><p>2 &gt; 0, the covariance matrix S given by (1.2) is positive definite. Conversely, setting ω</p><p>(1.4)</p><p>The third moments now exhibit an algebraic relation, namely, t 111 t 122t 2 112 = 0.</p><p>(1.5)</p><p>The ideal of all algebraic relations among the covariances and third moments is generated by None of the polynomials in <ref type="bibr">(1.6)</ref> vanishes over the set of moments for the model given by the second graph G ′ (for which indices 1 and 2 would be switched). Hence, the third moment structure differs for G versus G ′ and provides a way to distinguish the two hypotheses encoded by G and G ′ . The first relation in <ref type="bibr">(1.6)</ref> was used in <ref type="bibr">[17, p. 45</ref>]. It arises from the fact that s 12 /s 11 = t 112 /t 111 = λ 12 for graph G. The ratio based on second moments corresponds to the usual least squares estimator. For asymmetrically distributed ε 1 , the ratio of third moments provides an alternative (less efficient) estimator.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{s</formula><p>Returning to our general setting and forming the random vectors X = (X i ) i∈V and ε = (ε i ) i∈V , the model from <ref type="bibr">(1.1)</ref> states that X = Λ T X + ε.</p><p>(1.8)</p><p>When Λ ∈ R E , with E being the edge set of a DAG, it holds that det(I -Λ) = 1 and (1.8) always admits the unique solution X = (I -Λ) -T ε.</p><p>(1.9)</p><p>Let Ω (2) = (E[ε i ε j ]) and Ω (3) = (E[ε i ε j ε k ]) be the covariance matrix and the tensor of third moments of ε, respectively.

Here • denotes the Tucker product.</p><p>This fact follows from standard results about how moments of random vectors change after linear transformation; we include a proof to recall this calculus and the definition of the Tucker product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof. With</head><formula xml:id="formula_9">X i = k∈V [(I -Λ) -T ] ik ε k , the covariances are s ij = E[X i X j ] = a,b∈V [(I -Λ) -T ] ia [(I -Λ) -T ] jb E[ε a ε b ] = a,b∈V [(I -Λ) -T ] ia [(I -Λ) -T ] jb Ω (2) ab</formula><p>as claimed by the matrix product formula. Similarly, the third moments are</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">t ijk = E[X i X j X k ] = a,b,c∈V [(I -Λ) -T ] ia [(I -Λ) -T ] jb [(I -Λ) -T ] kc E[ε a ε b ε c ] = a,b,c∈V [(I -Λ) -T ] ia [(I -Λ) -T ] jb [(I -Λ) -T ] kc Ω (3) abc ,</formula><p>which by definition is the (a, b, c)-entry in the given Tucker product.</p><p>We emphasize that as we are assuming positive error variances, E[ε 2 i ] &gt; 0, the matrix Ω (2) is positive definite and the same is true for the covariance matrix S of X. Since Ω (3) is diagonal, the third moment tensor T of X is a symmetric tensor of symmetric tensor rank at most |V |; this need not be the case for a general V × V × V tensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In the sequel, we write PD (V ) for the positive definite cone in R V ×V and Sym 3 (V ) for the space of symmetric tensors in R V ×V ×V . Definition 1.3. Let G = (V, E) be a DAG. The third-order moment model of G is the set M ≤3 (G) that comprises all pairs of covariance matrices and third moment tensors that are realizable under the linear structural equation model given by G. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">M ≤3 (G) = (I -Λ) -T Ω (2) (I -Λ) -1 , Ω (3) • (I -Λ) -1 • (I -Λ) -1 • (I -Λ) -1 : Ω (2) ∈ PD (V ) diagonal, Ω (3) ∈ Sym 3 (V ) diagonal, Λ ∈ R E ⊆ PD (V ) × Sym 3 (V ).</formula><p>Furthermore, the third-order moment ideal of G is the ideal I ≤3 (G) of polynomials in the entries S = (s ij ) and T = (t ijk ) that vanish when (S, T ) ∈ M ≤3 (G).</p><p>In this paper, we are focusing on models M ≤3 (G) in the case where G is a polytree, i.e., a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we show how to parametrize the third-order moment model using the simple trek rule (Proposition 2.3), a variation of the trek rule that reveals the toric structure of I ≤3 (G) in the case of polytrees (Corollary 2.5). Sections from 3 to Section 6 mainly focus on polytrees and exploit their algebraic-geometric properties. Section 3 introduces trekmatrices (Definition 3.2) and provides algebraic relations that are sufficient to characterize when a pair of second and third order moments belongs to the model M ≤3 (G) (Theorem 3.5). In Section 4, we obtain a Markov basis of the vanishing ideal of M ≤3 (G) (Theorem 4.10). Section 5 focuses on DAGs with latent variables. For polytrees, we can provide generators of the ideal of observed variables in terms of the trek-matrices (Proposition 5.4). In Section 6 we present the third-order moment polytope associated to a polytree and highlight the differences with respect to the covariance polytope in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Finally, Section 7 displays several computational examples of non-trees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Simple Trek Parametrization</head><p>The graphs that appear in this paper are acyclic, i.e., they do not contain a closed directed path. We may thus assume that the vertices of the graph are topologically ordered, so that if i → j ∈ E, then i &lt; j. We now define the concept of multitrek introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 2.1. A k-trek between k vertices i 1 , . . . , i k is an ordered collection of directed paths τ = (P 1 , . . . , P k ) where P r has sink i r and they all share the same source v. We call v the top of the trek and denote it by top τ . A k-trek is called simple if its top node is the only node lying on all the k directed paths that form the trek. We denote the set of simple k-treks between i 1 , . . . , i k by T (i 1 , . . . , i k ). Example 2.2. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> we depict a graph G and three of its treks. The paths of the treks can use the same edge of the graph several times, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>. Note also that the directed paths forming the trek might also be empty, as is the case for the right path in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>. In fact, the only simple k-trek between the k vertices i, . . . , i is the trek consisting of empty paths, making the trek in Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref> nonsimple.</p><p>The statistical significance of 2-treks is that they provide a combinatorial way to parametrize covariance matrices through what is known as the trek rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 2]</ref>. This extends analogously to third-order moment tensors via 3-treks.</p><p>Furthermore, an advantage of working with DAGs is that one can simplify the description given by the trek rule by focusing only on simple treks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">Section 2]</ref> it is shown that simple 2-treks give a different parametrization of the covariance matrix, by introducing a new set of indeterminates a i for each vertex in the graph defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">a i := l1∈pa(i) l2∈pa(i) λ l1,i λ l2,i s l1,l2 + ω (2) i . (2.1)</formula><p>This triangular, and thus invertible, transformation allows one to recursively pass from the diagonal entries in the matrix Ω (2) to the a i . The same is true for the entries of the tensor Ω (3) , via the transformation (2.2) in the proof of Proposition 2.3 below. We therefore obtain the shorter simple trek rule parametrization induced by the polynomial ring map</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">φ G : C[s ij , t ijk | 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n] → C[a i , b i , λ ij | i → j ∈ E], s ij → τ ∈T (i,j) a top(T ) k→l∈τ λ kl , t ijk → τ ∈T (i,j,k) b top(T ) m→l∈τ λ ml .</formula><p>Dually, we get the rational parametrization</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">φ * G : R V × R V × R E → R ( n+1 2 ) × R ( n+2 3 ) (a, b, λ) →     τ ∈T (i,j) a top(T ) k→l∈τ λ kl   ij ,   τ ∈T (i,j,k) b top(τ ) m→l∈τ λ ml   ijk   .</formula><p>Proposition 2.3 (Simple trek rule). Let G = (V, E) be a DAG, and let φ G the ring morphism defined above. Then the map φ * G gives a parametrization of the model M ≤3 (G), and, therefore,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">I ≤3 (G) = ker φ G .</formula><p>Proof. For i ≤ j &lt; k, the third moments are</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">t ijk := E(X i X j X k ) = l∈pa(k) λ lk t ijl , for i &lt; j we have t ijj := E(X i X 2 j ) = l1∈pa(j) l2∈pa(j) λ l1j λ l2j t il1l2 ,</formula><p>and for all i we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">t iii := E(X 3 i ) = l1∈pa(i) l2∈pa(i) l3∈pa(i) λ l1,i λ l2,i λ l3,i t l1l2l3 + ω<label>(3)</label></formula><p>i .</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Set b i := l1∈pa(i) l2∈pa(i) l3∈pa(i) λ l1,i λ l2,i λ l3,i t l1,l2,l3 + ω<label>(3)</label></formula><p>i .</p><p>(2.2)</p><p>An analogous construction for the entries of the covariance matrix, s ij via (2.1) is displayed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In Proposition 2.3 of that paper, Sullivant proves the simple trek rule parametrization for covariance matrices by checking that the covariance matrices in the image of φ * G for valid parameters a are precisely the covariance matrices in M ≤3 (G).</p><p>Next we prove that the set of third moment tensors in</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">M ≤3 (G) is the second component of φ * G (R V × R V × R E ). By definition, t iii = b i for all i. Assume that t ijk =   τ ∈T (i,j,k) b top(τ ) m→l∈τ λ ml   ijk for all 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k &lt; r. Then, t ijr = l∈pa(r) λ lr t ijl = l∈pa(r) λ lr τ ∈T (i,j,l) b top(τ ) m→q∈τ λ mq = τ ∈T (i,j,r) b top(τ ) m→q∈τ λ mq .</formula><p>The last equality comes from the fact that any 3-trek in T (i, j, r) is a union of a 3-trek in T (i, j, l) and an edge l → r for any parent l of r. Similarly,  In case the graph G is a polytree, the simple trek parametrization simplifies to a monomial map as T (i 1 , . . . , i k ) has at most one element: the unique simple k-trek between i 1 , . . . , i k , if it exists. Therefore, we have the following fact.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">t irr = l∈pa(r) λ lr t ilr = l∈pa(r) λ lr τ ∈T (i,l,r) b top(τ ) m→q∈τ λ mq = τ ∈T (i,</formula><p>Corollary 2.5. If G is a polytree, then the ideal I ≤3 (G) is toric.</p><p>Example 2.6. Let G be the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. The corresponding ideal I ≤3 (G) is toric and therefore generated by binomials. We will revisit this example in the next section, where we give a concrete generating set given as 2-minors of suitable matrices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Low-Rank Trek-Matrices</head><p>In this section we find equations defining the model M ≤3 (G) when G is a polytree. In this case, the model has a monomial parametrization, and we show that it is cut out by quadratic binomials. These arise from 2-minors of matrices A i,j whose columns encode certain 2-treks and 3-treks involving i and j as endpoints. In fact these matrices are crucial not only for finding polynomials that cut out the variety, but also for the description of generating sets of the ideal of the model, as will be shown in Section 4.</p><p>Since the simple k-trek between i 1 , . . . , i k on a polytree, if it exists, is unique, then the notion of top is well-defined just by setting the end vertices. Definition 3.1. Let G be a polytree and let i 1 , . . . , i k be vertices such that a k-trek exists. We define top(i 1 , . . . , i k ) as the top node of its unique simple k-trek. Definition 3.2. Let G be a polytree. Let i, j ∈ V be two vertices such that a 2-trek between i and j exists. We define the trek-matrix between i and j as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">A i,j := s ik1 • • • s ikr t iℓ1m1 • • • t iℓqmq s jk1 • • • s jkr t jℓ1m1 • • • t jℓq mq ,</formula><p>where</p><p>• k 1 , . . . , k r are vertices such that top(i, k a ) = top(j, k a ) for a = 1, . . . , r, and Lemma 3.4. Let G = (V, E) be a polytree, and i, j ∈ V . Then (a) if there is no 2-trek between i and j, then s ij ∈ I ≤3 (G), and for all k ∈ V such that there is no 3-trek between i, j and k, we have that t ijk ∈ I ≤3 (G).</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">• (l 1 , m 1 ),. . . ,(l q , m q ) are such that top(i, l b , m b ) = top(j, l b , m b ) for b = 1, . . . ,</formula><p>(b) if there is an edge between i and j, the 2-minors of the trek-matrix A i,j lie in I ≤3 (G).</p><p>Proof. (a) For all i, j ∈ V such that there is no trek between them, by the trek rule, φ G (s ij ) = 0. Similarly, by the 3-trek-rule, if there is no 3-trek between i, j, k, then φ</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">G (t ijk ) = 0. (b) Since top(i, k a ) = top(j, k a ) and top(i, l b , m b ) = top(j, k b , m b ), then φ G (s ika ) = λ ij φ G (s jka ) and φ G (t il b m b ) = λ ij φ G (t jl b m b ).</formula><p>Thus, the second row of A i,j is the first row of A i,j multiplied by λ ij and all 2-minors of A i,j belong to ker φ G = I ≤3 (G). Theorem 3.5. Let G be a polytree and J be the ideal generated by the linear generators of I ≤3 (G) and the 2-minors of the matrices A i,j for i → j ∈ E. Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">M ≤3 (G) = V(J) ∩ (P D(V ) × Sym 3 (V )).</formula><p>Proof. Let S and T be the second and third moments of a distribution such that (S, T ) ∈ M ≤3 (G). For any edge i → j ∈ E, consider the matrix A i,j . Note that it contains as a column the vector s ii , s ij T . Let λ ij = sij sii , and let Λ ∈ R E contain these as its entries. Recall from Lemma 3.4 that the ratio between every other column vector in A i,j will also be λ ij . Consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">S ′ = (I -Λ) T S(I -Λ), T ′ = T • (I -Λ) • (I -Λ) • (I -Λ).</formula><p>We will now show that S ′ and T ′ are diagonal. For any i = j, we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">s ′ ij = k,ℓ (I -Λ) ki s kℓ (I -Λ) ℓj = s ij - k→i∈E λ ki s kj - ℓ→j∈E λ lj s iℓ + k→i,ℓ→j∈E λ ki λ ℓj s kℓ .</formula><p>We are going to consider 3 cases. Case 1: There is no 2-trek between i and j. In this case, s ij = 0. Furthermore, if a 2-trek between k and j exists, then we can complete it to a 2-trek between i and j. Thus, s kj = 0, and the first sum is 0. Similarly, the other two sums are also 0. Therefore, s ′ ij = 0. Case 2: There is a 2-trek between i and j.</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Set v = top(i, j). Case 2.0: v = i, j. The simple 2-trek between i and j is of the form i ← i 0 • • • ← v → • • • → j 0 → j.</formula><p>Then, in the sums k→i∈E λ ki s kj , ℓ→j∈E λ lj s iℓ , and k→i,ℓ→j∈E λ ki λ ℓj s kℓ the only nonzero terms appear when k = i 0 and ℓ = j 0 (otherwise, there cannot be a 2-trek between k and l). When k = i 0 , since top(i, j) = top(k, j), (s ij , s kj ) T is a column in the matrix A k,i , therefore λ ki = sij s kj .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Ideal Generators for Polytrees</head><p>In the previous section we provided a set-theoretic description of the model M ≤3 (G) in terms of the trek-matrices corresponding to directed edges of the polytree G and linear equations corresponding to the case where treks do not exist. However, the quadratic binomials considered in Theorem 3.5 are in general not sufficient to generate the vanishing ideal of the model I ≤3 (G). We illustrate this with an example.</p><p>Example 4.1. Consider again the polytree G in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. Note that there are quadratic binomials, such as s 25 s 34s 24 s 35 or t 255 t 345t 245 t 355 , that vanish on the model but do not arise as 2-minors of the trek-matrices listed in Example 3.6. One can check that I ≤3 (G) is minimally generated by 557 quadratic binomials. A Macaulay2 computation shows that the remaining 125 generators of the vanishing ideal of the model arise as 2-minors of trek-matrices that do not correspond to directed edges i → j, namely A 2,3 , A 2,4 , A 2,5 , A 3,4 , A 3,5 and A 4,5 .</p><p>The rest of this section is devoted to prove that I ≤3 (G) is indeed generated by the linear generators from Theorem 3.5 and the quadratic binomials occurring as 2-minors of all trek-matrices associated to a polytree. Proposition 4.2. Let G = (V, E) be a polytree, and i, j ∈ V . If there is a 2-trek between i and j, the 2-minors of the trek-matrix A i,j lie in I ≤3 (G).</p><p>Proof. Consider a trek-matrix A i,j . Fix any two columns of the matrix with indices k (out of the s-columns) and l, m (out of the t-columns). Set a := top(i, k) = top(j, k) and b := top(i, l, m) = top(j, l, m).</p><p>The 2-treks between i and j with tops a and b, respectively, factor through the simple 2-trek between i and j, which has top(i, j) as top. Moreover, there is exactly one path between two nodes of a polytree, hence both the 2-treks (encoded in s ik and s jk ) and 3-treks (encoded in t ilm and t jlm ) go through top(i, j) as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>From Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Proposition 2.3, it follows that s ik t jlms jk t ilm belongs to ker φ G .</p><p>Cases corresponding to two s columns or two t columns are dealt with analogously since only the central part of Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> matters. Remark 4.3. Note that top(i, j) is a choke point between I = {i, j} and J = {k, l, m} in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In terms of trek-separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> this can be understood as the sets I and J being trek-separated by ({top(i, j)}, {∅}).</p><p>Even more, trek-matrices A i,j can be defined -up to zero-columns that correspond to linear generators of the vanishing ideal -in terms of trek-separation as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">A i,j := s ik1 • • • s ikr t iℓ1m1 • • • t iℓqmq s jk1 • • • s jkr t jℓ1m1 • • • t jℓq mq ,</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">• all vertices k 1 , . . . , k r</formula><p>• and all pairs of vertices (l 1 , m 1 ),. . . ,(l q , m q ) such that ({i, j}, {k 1 , . . . , k r , (l 1 , m 1 ), . . . , (l q , m q )}) are trek-separated by ({top(i, j)}, {∅}).</p><p>For the covariance case, all quadratic binomials arise from 2-minors of A i,j as in [13, Tetrad representation]. However, this is no longer the case for third moments or combinations of covariance and moments, as the next example shows.</p><p>Example 4.4. For the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, f = s 23 t 145s 45 t 123 ∈ I ≤3 (G), and because of the lack of repeated indices in s, this cannot come from a 2-minor of A i,j . However, this binomial is not necessary in order to generate the vanishing ideal of the model. Indeed,</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">f = (s 23 t 145 -s 34 t 125 ) + (s 34 t 125 -s 45 t 123 )</formula><p>is the sum of 2-minors of the trek-matrices A 2,4 and A 3,5 , respectively.</p><p>In fact, all quadratic binomials in I ≤3 (G) can be expressed as the sum of at most two 2-minors of trek matrices: Proposition 4.5. Let G be a polytree. Then all quadratic binomials in I ≤3 (G) are linear combinations of 2-minors of trek-matrices A i,j for i, j ∈ V .</p><p>Proof. Let f = m 1 + m 2 ∈ I G be a quadratic binomial. By Proposition 2.3, the tops of the underlying 2-or 3-treks of m 1 must be pairwise equal to the tops associated to m 2 . Moreover, the indices of the variables in m 2 must be a permutation of the indices of m 1 .</p><p>Case I: f is a quadratic binomial on variables s. Without loss of generality we can assume f = s ij s kls il s jk . If top(i, j) = top(i, l) and top(k, l) = top(k, j), then</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">i k j s ij s kj l s il s kl (4.1)</formula><p>is a 2-minor of the matrix A j,l in Definition 3.2. Otherwise, since the tops of the underlying 2-treks must be pairwise equal, we have top(i, j) = top(k, j) and top(k, l) = top(i, l). Then f is the determinant of a 2-minor of matrix A i,k (it is enough to interchange the elements in the skew-diagonal of (4.1).</p><p>Case II: f is a quadratic binomial on variables t. Then f = t ijk t lmnt σ(i)σ(j)σ(k) t σ(l)σ(m)σ(n) , where the {i, j, k} ∪ {σ(i), σ(j), σ(k)} has either one or two elements.</p><p>If the intersection consists of a single element, then we can assume f = t ijk t lmnt ilm t jkn . If top(i, j, k) = top(j, k, n) and top(i, l, m) = top(l, m, n), then j, k l, m i t ijk t ilm n t jkn t lmn If the intersection consists of two elements, we can proceed analogously.</p><p>Case III: f is a quadratic binomial in both variables s and t. Then f is of the form s ij t klms σ(i)σ(j) t σ(k)σ(l)σ(m) where {i, j} ∩ {σ(i), σ(j)} is either a single element or empty. As in case II, it can be proved that either f arises as a 2-minor of a matrix in 3.2 or it is a sum of two such matrices.</p><p>Remark 4.6. In (4.3) of the proof above, we see that t ijk t lmnt ilm t jkn is the sum of the determinants of</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">A k,l (i, j) (m, n) k t ijk t kmn l t ijl t lmn and A j,m (i, l) (k, n) j t ijl t jkn m t ilm t kmn . (4.4)</formula><p>The indices in A k,l and A j,m indicate which paths in the 3-trek we exchange between the two terms of the determinant, as represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>.  Definition 4.7. We consider the following lexicographic ordering on the variables:</p><p>• s ij &lt; t klm , or equivalently, 2-treks come before 3-treks;</p><p>• s ij &lt; s kl (analogously for 3-treks) iff either top(i, j) &lt; top(k, l), i.e. treks with lower top values come first;</p><p>or top(i, j) = top(k, l) and the path from the top to i goes through the node with the lowest value compared to the path from the top to k, or i = k but the path from the top to j goes through the node with the lowest value compared to the path from the top to l.</p><p>We can represent monomials in variables s ij , t ijk in a tableau with 3 columns. Each column encodes a path of the trek as a string of numbers denoting the nodes in the path. For 2-treks, we will leave the last column empty. Monomials can be represented by adding rows to the tableau. Considering the previous lexicographic ordering, the tableau is uniquely determined. We call this a standard form tableau representation, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In order to prove that all binomials in I ≤3 (G) are generated by quadratic binomials we will extend Sullivant's strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> of reducing disagreements via quadratic moves to both 2 and 3-treks using tableaux with 3 columns as in Example 4.8.</p><p>Example 4.9. Let f be as in Example 4.8. We will use the third row of the second term to reduce the disagreements between the two terms in the first row. The quadratic move q = 13 14 12 13 14 -12 14 13 13 14 = s 34 t 234s 24 t 334 ∈ I ≤3 (G) yields a polynomial with fewer disagreements, namely The first row of f ′ can be factored out and only remains a quadratic binomial already in I ≤3 (G). In polynomial notation, we have f ′ = f + s 45 q = s 24 (s 35 t 344s 45 t 334 ) ∈ I ≤3 (G), hence we can now write f as a linear combination of quadratic binomials of the ideal.</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">f ′ =  <label>12</label></formula><p>Let I G be the ideal generated by matrices A i,j in Definition 3.2 and linear generators s ij and t ijk when there is no 2-trek between i, j or no 3-trek between i, j, k. Sketch of the proof: For binomials in C[s ij ], see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">Theorem 5.8</ref>]. In the remaining cases, we will reduce disagreements via quadratic moves on both 2 and 3-treks as in Example 4.9.</p><p>For binomials in C[t ijk ], we start by considering disagreements right after the top in the first row of the tableau representation of f = m 1 + m 2 . Thanks to the lexicographic ordering in Definition 4.7, we can assume that disagreements are never in the first column. Moreover, the ordering is used to ensure the occurrence of the pattern of interest in the first row of m 1 in some inferior row of m 2 . In the general case, the number of disagreements is reduced with a single quadratic move.</p><p>The special case occurs when the quadratic move is not applicable because it does not correspond to variables in C[t ijk ] and this is described by certain equalities among the entries in the tableau. If we can ensure the existence of a third row in m 2 with at most one occurrence of the pattern, we obtain two quadratic moves that reduce disagreements. There is a special case of this special case in which the two moves are not applicable. This is a very degenerate situation that turns out to be reducible in a single quadratic move. On the other hand, if the existence is not ensured, it yields a certain equality and we deal with that particular case analogously.</p><p>Next we need to consider disagreements that appear not right after the top but later on. The strategy is the same but now the required quadratic moves might have different top than the 3-treks we are considering. If this occurs, we can think of them as partial moves.</p><p>Finally, we deal with binomials in C[s ij , t ijk ] with both variables s and t. Note that the fact that 2-treks always come before 3-treks (see Example 4.9) in the lexicographic ordering removes the assumption that disagreements are never in the first column but the rest of the proof follows analogously.</p><p>A complete proof of this theorem is presented in Appendix A.</p><p>Example 4.11. Recall the graph from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. Let J be the ideal in Theorem 3.5 generated by all 2-minors of trek-matrices corresponding to edges of the graph, namely A 1,2 , A 1,3 , A 1,4 , A 1,5 .</p><p>Computations in Macaulay2 show that I ≤3 (G) = (J : s ∞ 11 ). In particular, it holds that</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">M ≤3 (G) = V(I ≤3 (G)) ∩ (PD (V ) × Sym 3 (V )) = V(J) ∩ (PD(V ) × Sym 3 (V )) .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Latent Variables</head><p>It often happens in statistical practice that some of the random variables cannot be observed. Such variables are called latent or hidden. These include psychological or sociological constructs such as anxiety or extroversion, random variables coming from sensitive (e.g., medical) data that have been censored, as well as data that have been lost, for instance an extinct biological species. Latent variables imply the existence of correlations between observed variables, even if there are no causal relations among them.</p><p>In this section we show that for a class of graphs with hidden variables, the observed variable ideal is generated by 2-minors of certain submatrices of the trek-matrices A i,j defined in Section 3. </p><formula xml:id="formula_48">(G) = I ≤3 (G) ∩ C[s ij , t ijk : i, j, k ∈ O]</formula><p>be the vanishing ideal of the model over the observed variables. Computations with Macaulay2 show that it is a binomial ideal irredundantly generated by 126 quadratic binomials. In fact, this ideal is generated by minors of submatrices of the trek matrices A i,j for i, j ∈ O after removing all columns containing variables with the first index, such as The behavior displayed in Example 5.2 is known to be true for vanishing ideals of partially observed Gaussian models arising from polytrees with an upstream partition[13, Section 6]. In the rest of this section we focus on proving this result for ideals of third moments.</p><p>For an upstream partition H ∪ O we now define a multigrading on the ring C[a, b, λ], which induces a multigrading on C[s, t] such that the corresponding moment ideal is homogeneous. Let Proof. For any monomial m that appears in the image of s ij there are two possibilities. That monomial arises from a 2-trek whose top is either in the observed part of the graph or in the hidden one. By having an upstream partition, the first case can only occur if both i and j are observed vertices and this also implies that all the λ kl arising from edges in the trek have degree (0, 0), since all edges are between vertices in the observed part. Therefore the degree of m is equal to the degree of a top(i,j) which is <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. In the second case, the variable a top(i,j) will contribute the multidegree (1, 1). Again by having an upstream partition, there will be exactly as many edges from a hidden vertex to an observed one as number of elements in the multiset {i, j} in O. But this implies deg s ij = (1, 1 + number of elements in the multiset {i, j} in O).</p><p>The argument transfers almost verbatim to the degree of t ijk .</p><p>Proposition 5.4. For any polytree G with an upstream partition of its edges, the observed variable ideal given by the intersection</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">I ≤3 O (G) = I ≤3 (G) ∩ C[s ij , t ijk : i, j, k ∈ O]</formula><p>is generated by the minors of the submatrices of A i,j with i, j both in O, with columns indexed by k and pairs (l, m) where k, l, m are all in O.</p><p>Proof. We first show that for a polytree G, the ideal I ≤3 (G) is homogeneous with respect to the multigrading introduced in Lemma 5.3. By Theorem 4.10, the ideal I ≤3 (G) is generated by determinants of 2 × 2 matrices. Their rows are given by vertices i and j. Similarly the columns are parametrized either by vertices k or pairs (l, m), or a combination of the two. In any case, one can readily check that the resulting binomial is homogeneous. Since the ideal is homogeneous, it is enough to show that each homogeneous polynomial f ∈ I ≤3 O (G) is generated by minors of the required form. Since all indeterminates in C[s ij , t ijk : i, j, k ∈ O] have degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>, we obtain deg f = (r, 3r), for some natural number r. Since f belongs to I ≤3 (G) it can be written as a finite sum f = l u l M l , where the u i are monomials and each M l is 2-minor coming from a trek-matrix A i,j . Since the minors M l are homogeneous, we can decompose the sum into</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">f = deg u l M l =(r,3r) u l M l + deg u l M l =(r,3r) u l M l .</formula><p>But then the second part must be zero, implying f = deg u l M l =(r,3r) u l M l . This can only be achieved if all indeterminates appearing in u l and M l are in the set {s ij , t ijk : i, j, k ∈ O}. Indeed, using any of the remaining indeterminates would force the degree to be (p, q) with q strictly less than 3p. Thus we have found a description of f of the required form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Moment Polytopes</head><p>A natural approach to understanding the algebro-geometric properties of a toric variety is to consider the polytope associated to its monomial parametrization.

Nevertheless, we observe that some features persist when considering their third-order moment varieties.</p><p>Example 7.1. Let G be the graph with edges 1 → 2, 2 → 3 and 1 → 3 depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>. The ideal I ≤3 (G) of the model is generated by the ideal I 3 of the 3-minors of the matrix , so we note that even in the presence of cycles, there are matrices similar to the trek-matrices that define the model. Example 7.4. Let V = {1, 2, 3} and consider G to be the 3-cycle with edges 1 → 2, 2 → 3 and 3 → 1. We observe that the maximal minors of the following matrix vanish on M ≤3 (G): In fact, 12 of the 3-minors also vanish, although they are not enough to describe the ideal. We computed that the ideal I ≤3 (G) is actually minimally generated by 148 polynomials: 12 cubics, 41 quartics, 67 quintics, 24 sextics and 4 septics. It would be interesting to better understand these generators, in particular, the origin of higher degree generators.</p><p>The examples above motivate the further study of generators involving second and third order moments for general non-Gaussian linear structural equation models, and we expect substantial future work in this direction.

Otherwise, we need to exchange the elements in the skew-diagonal in order to have equal tops b 1 := top(i, j, k) = top(i, l, m) and b 2 := top(j, k, n) = top(l, m, n) arranged in columns. The resulting matrix i n j, k t ijk t jkn l, m t ilm t lmn(4.3)    has not the desired shape. Consider the two 4-treks between j, k, l and m, one with top b 1 and the other with top b 2 . Because G is a polytree, one must factor through the other. Assume b 1 ≤ b 2 , then the determinant of (4.3) can be written as the sum of the determinants of the corresponding 2-minors in A k,l and A j,m .</figDesc></figure>

If one allows saturations, then f becomes redundant as we haveI ≤3 (G) = I 3 + I 2 + f = (I 3 + I 2 ) : s ∞ 11 .Example 7.2. Let G be the diamond graph on 4 vertices with edges 0 → 1, 0 → 2, 1 → 3 and 2 → 3. The ideal I ≤3 O (G) is minimally generated by 77 quadratic binomials (2-minors) and 138 cubics. It is possible to give a (non-minimal) set of generators that are 2-or 3-minors analogous to what we have seen for Example 7.1. If we partition the random variables into hidden and observed ones as H = {0} and O = {1, 2, 3}, then the ideal I ≤3 O (G) is given by the vanishing of 3-minors of the matrix 11 s 12 t 111 t 112 t 113 t 122 t 123 2 s 12 s 22 t 112 t 122 t 123 t 222 t 223 3 s 13 s 23 t 113 t 123 t 133 t 223 t 233 . Note that for this observed variable ideal no indexing with the empty set is necessary. Example 7.3. Let V = {1, 2} and consider G to be the 2-cycle with edges 1 → 2 and 2 → 1. The model M ≤3 (G) is a hypersurface in PD (V ) × Sym 3 (V ).
