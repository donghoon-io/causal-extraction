<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As network data applications continue to expand, causal inference within networks has garnered increasing attention. However, hidden confounders complicate the estimation of causal effects. Most methods rely on the strong ignorability assumption, which presumes the absence of hidden confounders-an assumption that is both difficult to validate and often unrealistic in practice. To address this issue, we propose CgNN, a novel approach that leverages network structure as instrumental variables (IVs), combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, to mitigate hidden confounder bias and improve causal effect estimation. By utilizing network structure as IVs, we reduce confounder bias while preserving the correlation with treatment. Our integration of attention mechanisms enhances robustness and improves the identification of important nodes. Validated on two real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that CgNN effectively mitigates hidden confounder bias and offers a robust, GNN-driven IV framework for causal inference in complex network data.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>Causal inference is essential in fields such as epidemiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Estimating causal effects in network data is often complicated by confounding factors, especially hidden confounders, which introduce significant challenges. When hidden confounders influence both the treatment and the outcome, they can create spurious associations, leading to inaccurate causal effect estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, as illustrated in the causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In such scenarios, traditional methods frequently fail to properly identify causal effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Most existing causal inference methods for network data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> rely on the strong ignorability assumption. This assumption posits that, given covariates (i.e., features), the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes. Consequently, the estimation of treatment effects is not affected by hidden confounders. In other words, this assumption Corresponding author: Feiyu Yang, feiyu@my.swjtu.edu.cn requires that all confounders influencing the treatment effect be fully observable. However, in real-world applications, identifying all potential confounders is often unrealistic, making it challenging to maintain the strong ignorability assumption in practice.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X X Y Y T T U U X X Y Y T T (a) (b)</formula><p>The instrumental variable (IV) method is an effective approach for identifying causal effects in the presence of hidden confounders in independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. An IV is an exogenous variable that is related to the treatment but does not directly affect the outcome. IV-based methods typically follow a two-stage process: first, the IV is used to estimate the treatment, then the estimated treatment is used to predict the outcome. The two-stage least squares (2SLS) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is a widely used IV approach that applies a linear model to estimate treatment effects.</p><p>Peer interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is common in network data because individuals are interconnected and can influence each other's outcomes. This means that one person's treatment can affect the outcomes of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. For example, in epidemiology, as shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we want to estimate the causal effect of vaccination on individual infection status. Suppose we have a social network where each node represents an individual, and edges represent social relationships between individuals. X i represents individual i's features (e.g., health conditions). The variable T i indicates whether individual i has been vaccinated, and Y i represents their health status. Y i can also be influenced by the treatment T j of peers (details are discussed in the preliminary section). Hidden confounders U i , such as lifestyle or socioeconomic status, can affect both the decision to get vaccinated and the subsequent infection status, leading to biased estimates of the vaccination effect.</p><p>The topology of networks is ubiquitous in various types of observational data, such as patient social networks and disease transmission networks. When certain confounding factors are difficult to measure directly, we can attempt to capture their patterns using the network structuree <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. To address these hidden confounding factors, the network structure can be employed as an IV.</p><p>In summary, by leveraging network structure information, we can effectively control for hidden confounding factors within networks. Moreover, by integrating GNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> with attention mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we can capture the complex dependencies between nodes and accurately distinguish the influence of different peer (i.e., neighboring) nodes on the target node.</p><p>The key contributions of work are outlined as follows:</p><p>• Problem. We propose a GNN-based approach that integrates causal inference with IVs to address hidden confounders in network data, especially in the presence of peer interference. • Method. We introduce CgNN, a novel model that effectively distinguishes peer influences to better capture complex dependencies between nodes. • Experiments. We conduct extensive experiments on realworld datasets, demonstrating the ability of the CgNN approach to effectively handle hidden confounders.</p><p>II.

The treatment t i ∈ 0, 1 is binary, with t i = 1 indicating treatment.</p><p>The outcome Y i for unit i is determined by its own features X i , treatment T i , hidden confounders U i , and the features {X j } j∈Ni and treatments {T j } j∈Ni of its peers, where j ∈ N i represents the first-order neighboring nodes, as illustrated in Fig 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation</head><p>To estimate the ME, PE, and TE in networks, we adopt a two-stage IV approach driven by GNNs, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.

We evaluated our model against five baselines: (1) CFR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which uses integral probability metric (IPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to balance distributions on independent and identically distributed data; (2) TARNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a variant of CFR that omits the IPM; (3) NetDeconf <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, an extension of CFR designed for networks, using GNNs to address confounding variables.

We estimate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Precision in Estimating Heterogeneous Effects (PEHE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. MSE, defined as ϵ M SE = 1 m m i=1 ( Ŷi -Y i ) 2 measures the accuracy of counterfactual predictions. PEHE evaluates the precision in estimating causal effects, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ϵ P EHE = 1 m m i=1 ( Ŷi (t ′ ) -Ŷi (t)) -(Y i (t ′ ) -Y i (t)) 2 .</formula><p>Ŷi and Y i are predicted and ground truth outcomes, respectively. Lower values indicate better performance.</p><p>Results. We use the CgNN model to estimate ME, PE, and TE, evaluating both "within-sample" performance on the training network and "out-of-sample" generalization on the test network. The process is repeated 5 times, with the average and standard deviation reported. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> presents the ϵ P EHE results for the BC and Flickr datasets. CgNN consistently outperforms baseline models, showing that the objective function effectively minimizes counterfactual prediction errors. Following the setup from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we simulate outcomes by adjusting treatment flip rates (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1). As shown V. CONCLUSION Summary of Contributions. In this work, we propose CgNN, a novel method to address hidden confounder bias in network data while accounting for peer effects. CgNN distinguishes between ME, PE, and TE in networks. Since the underlying network structure captures critical information about hidden confounders, we design a GNN-driven IV approach that leverages the network structure as an IV to mitigate confounding bias. Combined with attention mechanisms, this approach distinguishes the varying influence of different peers, leading to more accurate effect estimation. Validated on two semi-synthetic datasets, CgNN demonstrates robustness in complex network settings.</p><p>Limitations &amp; Future Work. While CgNN effectively addresses hidden confounder bias in network data, it assumes the network structure provides sufficient information as valid IVs. Future work will focus on relaxing these assumptions to enhance its applicability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Causal DAGs illustrating challenges in causal effect estimation within networks.
