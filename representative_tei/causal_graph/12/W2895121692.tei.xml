<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The export-growth nexus has been a hot topic of discussion in the international economics and economic development literature over the past decades. This is mainly due to the role granted to trade in promoting economic well-being in the trade literature. Export expansion is expected to be an important factor fostering output growth through raising capital formation by increasing opportunity to finance imports of capital and intermediate goods. Furthermore, export growth causes countries to expose to raising foreign market competition, knowledge transfer and new production technologies. This in turn leads to more efficient allocation of resources, utilization of scale economies and greater capacity exploitation and thus stimulates productivity growth. Exports can also directly affect economic growth by increasing level of employment and income via multiplier effect.</p><p>The relationship between export expansion and economic growth has been extensively studied over the past decades, yet the channels and even the direction of causality have remained unresolved in theory and empirics. Broadly speaking, there are two competing hypotheses on the nature of the causality between exports and growth: the export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis suggests a causal flow from exports to productivity, while the growth-led export (GLE) hypothesis asserts that causality runs from productivity growth to exports. The establishment of the direction of causality between the two has important ramifications on countries' trade policies and development strategies.</p><p>The empirical literature on export-growth nexus is again equivocal and finds conflicting results.</p><p>The early studies, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awokuse (2006)</ref>, primarily relied on cross country analyses and mostly find evidence in favor of ELG hypothesis (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Emery, 1967 and</ref><ref type="bibr">1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Severn, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Syron and Walsh, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kravis, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Michaely, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balassa, 1978 and</ref><ref type="bibr">1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Krueger, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bhagwati, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tyler, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Feder, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kavoussi, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ram, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Helpman and Krugman, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Heitger, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rana, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Moschos, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kohli and Singh, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Otani and Villaneuva, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fosu, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Esfahani, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lopez, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dodaro, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sheehey, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Gregoria, 1992, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Edwards, 1993)</ref>. However, these cross sectional analyses were criticized for their restrictive assumption of causality going from exports to growth, ignoring the possible reverse causal flow and causality running in both directions.</p><p>Another limitation of this approach was the irrational assumption of similar economic and demographic structures and production technology across different countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ram, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>To account for this issue, the subsequent studies switched to individual country studies mostly employing the <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Granger (1969)</ref> non-causality or Sim (1972) causality tests and find inconsistent results (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jung and Marshall, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chow, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hsiao, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sung-Shen et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Grabowski et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmad and Kwan, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bahmani-Oskooee et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Marin, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dodaro, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Love, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Paul and Chowdhury, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Riezman and Whiteman, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jin and Yu, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Yamada, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Richards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Awokuse, 2003)</ref>. Nevertheless, this approach has its drawbacks as well. Granger causality/noncausality approach is very sensitive to the omitted variables, so that the results can be spurious or measure wrong feedback relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Granger, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lutkhepohl, 1982)</ref>. On the other hand, this approach does not account for indirect causal paths resulting from the correlation of the stochastic disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Awokuse, 2006)</ref>. Concerning the studies investigating the ELG hypothesis in the context of Turkey, the findings provide mixed results. These studies mostly rely on the concept of Granger non-causality to test the causal link between exports and growth and employ VAR methodology to model the linear relationship between the two. Some support the ELG hypothesis (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alici and Ucal, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karagoz and Sen, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Halicioglu, 2007)</ref>, while some others suggest reverse causality or report no significant relationship between the two (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr">Cetintas, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Saatcioglu and Karaca, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cil, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Temiz and Gokmen, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In light of these contradicting results and reported limitations of the methodologies used in the literature, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awokuse (2006)</ref>, we examine the causal structure of export-productivity nexus in Turkey, in conjunction with some other economic factors by employing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) approach. In doing so, we attempt to illustrate both the direct and indirect causal paths between exports and productivity growth with respect to capital formation, foreign output of OECD nations, and terms of trade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS (DAGs)</head><p>DAGs, which are the most widely used graphs in causal modeling, are simply directed graphs (DGs) with no directed cycles. A directed graph (DG) or digraph is a mathematical object consisting of an ordered pair (V, E). V is a set of vertices (variables) or nodes, whereas A is a set whose elements are called arrows (a set of directed edges). Adjacent variables (vertices) are connected by an edge (line).</p><p>For example, let V = {K, L, M} and A = {(L, K), (M, K)}. Then G = (V, E) is a directed graph, illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (a). G does not contain any directed cycle because there is no way to start and end at the same vertex, implying that G is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In contrast, G' = (V, E'), where V = {K, L, M} and E' = {(L, K), (K, M), (M, L)} is not acyclic because a move from A to B ends at A by way of C as seen in Figure <ref type="figure">1 (b)</ref>. In this article, we discuss only acyclic graphs as cyclic graphs are not identifiable <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Li et al., 2013)</ref>. (1) where 𝑝𝑎 𝑖 represents the realization of some subset of the variables that precede 𝑣 𝑖 in order (𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 ,𝑣 3 ,…..,𝑣 𝑛 ). <ref type="bibr">Verma and Pearl (1988)</ref> showed that the conditional independencies implied by the decomposition (1) can be graphically characterized using d-separation (directional separation)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> .</p><p>The PC algorithm is developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Spirtes et al. (2000)</ref> to incorporate the concept of d-separation to build directed graphs. Simply put, the PC algorithm commences with a graph in which all the variables are connected with an undirected edge. Then, these edges are removed recursively by using a stepwise testing approach, based upon Fisher's z test of zero correlation or zero partial (conditional) correlation.</p><p>The remaining edges are then directed by using the notion of sepset.</p><p>Based on Monte Carlo simulations, the PC algorithm may assign the directions of edges incorrectly and may make mistakes of edge exclusion/inclusion, especially for small sample size less than 100 observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Spirtes, et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Demiralp and Hoover 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zhang et al. 2006</ref>). Spirtes at al. 2000 suggests using higher significance levels as the sample size drops (e.g., 0.2 at sample size less than 100) and lower significance levels as the sample size increases (e.g., 0.1 at sample size which is between 100 and 300). Given our 69 time series observations (2000q1-2017q1), we choose 20 per cent significance level, which provides an unambiguous directed ordering for most of the variables in this analysis. The PC algorithm and its extensions are available in TETRAD VI which is the software program we use for the estimations in this study<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">DATA</head><p>Fur our purpose in this study, we employ Turkish time series data which covers the period 2000:Q1 to 2017:Q1. The variables included in this study are motivated by the choice of indicators in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awokuse (2006)</ref>. Real exports variable is defined as nominal exports divided by export unit value. Real GDP per employed person is used as a proxy for productivity. Gross capital formation is a proxy for capital and the variable of real terms of trade is defined as export unit value divided by import unit value.</p><p>We use industrial production index for OECD countries as a proxy for foreign output shock, and as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awokuse (2006)</ref>, this variable captures export growth affected by growth in the rest of the world.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ANALYSIS AND RESULTS</head><p>First, as a starting point, we present the preliminary results by examining the correlation matrix in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. The unconditional correlation between each of the variables is summarized in this matrix and processed by TETRAD VI without a priori knowledge of causal relationships among the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Zhang et al., 2006)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> shows that productivity is strongly and positively correlated to exports, capital formation and foreign output shock, with correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.96 and 0.91, respectively. On the other hand, terms of trade seems to have no correlation with other variables. The correlation matrix also reveals that foreign output shock is highly correlated with exports and capital formation. Furthermore, the matrix indicates a strong and positive correlation between exports and capital formation as the unconditional correlation between them is 0.96. Thus, one can reasonably expect significant direct and indirect causal paths among productivity, exports, capital, and foreign output.</p><p>The resulting patterns from the DAG analysis are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  variable in the system, implying that t_o_t is exogenous to the system. On the other hand, the algorithm does not detect any indirect path among the variables in the system. Also we should note the undirected edges between export and capital, and capital and shock, implying causations between these variables.</p><p>However, the identification of the direction of the associations between them requires higher number of observations and inclusion of some other omitted variables into the system. As an example, with 40% significance level (the results are not presented here), the resulting DAG pattern suggests a causal flow from export to capital, implying a possible indirect effect of exports on productivity. Overall, it can be argued that the results from DAG support the ELG hypothesis as exports growth directly cause productivity growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this study, we employ the DAG approach to examine the causal pattern among exports and productivity, and some other economic factors. Using the Turkish quarterly data, time series analysis of export-productivity nexus is examined. Causal patterns, revealed by the PC algorithm, indicate a causal flow from exports, capital and foreign output to productivity. This implies the validity of export-led growth hypothesis for Turkey for the period 2000:Q1 to 2017:Q1.
