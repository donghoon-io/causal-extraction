<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Deciphering the relationships between genes and complex traits could help us better understand the biological mechanisms leading to phenotypic variations and disease occurrence. Univariate gene-based association analyses are widely used to characterize gene-phenotype relationships, but are subject to the influence of confounders.

The identified (direct) causal genes were found to be significantly enriched for genes highlighted in the OpenTargets database, and the enrichment was stronger than achieved by conventional univariate gene-based tests. Encouragingly, many enriched pathways were supported by the literature, and some of the enriched drugs have been tested or used to treat patients in clinical practice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>With the rapid development of genomic technologies, our knowledge of the genetic basis of complex traits has substantially improved in the past decade. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be instrumental in uncovering the susceptibility genes and variants underlying complex traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> .</p><p>Traditionally, GWAS is performed in a SNP-based manner; however, as most trait-associated variants usually have minor effects and reside in the non-coding region, it has proved very challenging to translate these findings into clinical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</p><p>Gene-based analyses, especially those based on imputed gene expression profiles (e.g., PrediXcan), have gained increasing popularity in deciphering disease genes. However, most studies have mainly focused on pairwise (gene-disease) associations, which may be subject to the influence of confounders. Furthermore, while some susceptibility genes directly contribute to complex traits variations, others probably exert their effects through influences on other genes. This mechanistic information could provide valuable insights on biological processes and pathophysiology of traits and diseases. At present, most gene-based association studies focus on simply identifying trait-associated genes and do not go on to characterize the exact roles of these genes on phenotypes. A 'systems' approach that considers the contribution of not only one but a network of genes will facilitate our understanding of the pathophysiology of complex diseases. Such an approach would quantify the diverse direct and indirect effects of multiple genes on complex traits, providing a deep and quantitative characterization of underlying disease mechanism. The biological knowledge gained would benefit the prioritization of novel drug targets.</p><p>Recently, Boyle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> suggested that complex traits/diseases are 'omnigenic', with numerous genetic influences, some with direct causal effects ('core genes') and others with indirect effects ('peripheral genes') connected to the phenotype through the core ones. The model raised much attention and discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . with some even questioning the usefulness of GWAS, as many genes considered as 'susceptibility' genes may be only tenuously connected to the disease, and such genes may be hard to differentiate from those of direct biological relevance.</p><p>In this work, we propose a novel framework to estimate the gene-phenotype network and to quantify the direct and indirect causal effects of genes on the studied disease/trait. In addition, joint causal effects (the causal effects of each gene when intervention is performed on a group of genes) are computed under the same framework, leveraging GWAS-predicted expression profiles and raw expression data from a reference sample (e.g., GTEx). The framework is based on a Bayesian network (BN) approach, which produces a directed graph showing the causal relationships among genes and between genes and the phenotype. It aims to identify the overall causal network and quantify the effects of genes on the studied trait, including both direct and indirect effects. The inferred causal network can be used to predict the consequences of external interventions on various genes, in isolation or combination, on target traits. By pinpointing core (driver) genes from peripheral or irrelevant genes for various traits and diseases, the causal network approach can potentially predict the effects of interventions on various genes and identify novel druggable targets for various diseases.</p><p>Our proposed causal network methodology is based primarily on gene expression, since most GWAS associations are located in non-coding DNA sequences and their effects are likely to be mediated through changes in gene expression. Furthermore, gene expression data is relatively comprehensive and abundant compared to other types of omics data and, once the effects of genetic variations on gene expression have been unravelled by eQTL analyses, the gene expression changes associated with a disease can be "predicted" from GWAS data. The use of predicted gene expression is an attractive approach since studies based on measured gene expression studies typically have very small sample size because of the difficulties and cost in accessing the relevant tissues for the disease, and gene expression data collected after disease onset may be confounded by medication usage and other consequential clinical/environmental factors. Our proposed approach of leveraging large-scale GWAS-predicted expression data avoids many of these issues.</p><p>We summarize our contributions as follows: (1) Our proposed approach avoids the difficulties of building gene-disease networks from raw expression data described above, by leveraging large-scale GWAS-predicted transcriptome data. As far as we know, our study is the first to use large-scale GWASpredicted and raw gene expression data from different samples to construct structural networks of genes and phenotypes and to estimate the strengths of the causal connection. Our proposed framework integrates data from multiple sources to infer the causal model, greatly enhancing its flexibility and applicability. (2) The proposed method for gene-outcome causal relationship estimation (which is one component of our framework), i.e., PC-simple algorithm, has not been applied to GWAS before; it can thus be considered a novel approach to uncover important genes in the context of GWAS analysis. (3) Previous works mainly focused on estimating structural networks between genes and phenotypes, and most did not provide quantitative estimates of the effects of genes on phenotypes. In this study, we proposed to use IDA and jointIDA incorporating a novel p-value-based regularization approach to quantify the causal effects (including total causal effects, direct causal effects, and mediation effects) of genes. The regularization approach is in fact generally applicable to any IDA/jointIDA analyses. The proposed framework has high specificity and precision (a.k.a., positive predictive value), making it particularly useful for selecting specific genes for follow-up studies. (4) We have proposed a combination of methods to validate our framework, including split-half validation and stability selection. We also propose stability selection for statistical inference as it enables control of the expected number of false positive findings. (5) Our proposed approach is general and can potentially be extended to other forms of omics data, such as proteomic or methylomic data, and to construct joint causal networks for 2 or more traits. Lastly, we applied the proposed framework to a wide variety of 52 phenotypes in the UK Biobank, revealing the role of different genes in various diseases. To our knowledge, this is among the most comprehensive causal network analyses on large-scale GWAS data to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The proposed Bayesian causal network consists of 3 parts, i.e., gene-phenotype causal network inference, gene-gene causal network inference, and penalty-based causal effects estimation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As can be seen, we have used GTEx data for gene-gene causal network inference, and UK Biobank data (coupled with PrediXcan and Trans-QTL) for gene-phenotype causal network inference. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene-phenotype causal network inference</head><p>Based on the assumption of independent cis-and trans-eQTL effects, we used "PrediXcan" 9 to map the tissue-specific cis-eQTLs, and then separately imputed tissue-specific gene expression levels from genotypic data on UK Biobank subjects. In brief, we first built a prediction model for expression data by a regularized regression model based on a the GTEx genotype and gene expression reference data. Genotype data on UK Biobank subjects were then inputted to the prediction model to generate and output "imputed" gene expression data on the corresponding subjects (for details, see supplementary material). Publicly available trans-eQTL data 10 was used to complement the cis-predicted gene expression levels. To avoid possible bias introduced by population structure, we adjusted both the genotype-predicted expression levels as well as target phenotypes by the top 10 principal components (PCs) of the corresponding genotype datasets. Then, we employed the PC-simple algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> to infer the causal relationships between genes and corresponding traits. Briefly, PC-simple can be regarded as a generalization of correlation screening that utilizes ordered independence screening to infer the causal relationships between covariates and response.</p><p>To start with, we define a few necessary notations. Suppose Z and Y are two random variables and 𝑆 is a variable set. Z and Y and conditionally independent if:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∃𝑠 ⊆ 𝑆, 𝜌(𝑍, 𝑌|𝑆) = 0<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here |𝑆| defines the order of the conditional independence, 𝜌(𝑍, 𝑌|𝑆) denotes the partial correlation between Z and Y given S. Let 𝑋 = [𝑋 1 , 𝑋 performing independence screening with increased order of conditional set, we could exclude genes from previous candidate active gene set until it does not change anymore. To improve the computational efficiency of this algorithm, we set the maximum order for partial correlation screening to be 3. Fisher's Ztransform is employed to test whether a partial correlation is zero, i.e.,:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑍𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑌, 𝑍|𝑆) = 1 2 { 1 + 𝜌 ̂(𝑌, 𝑍|𝑆) 1 -𝜌 ̂(𝑌, 𝑍|𝑆) }<label>(2)</label></formula><p>As suggested by Buhlmann et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , the null hypothesis 𝜌 ̂(𝑌, 𝑍|𝑆) = 0 would be rejected if</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(𝑛 -|𝑆| -3) 1/2 |𝑍𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑌, 𝑍|𝑆)| &gt; 𝜙 -1 (1 -𝛼/2)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Here 𝛼 and 𝜙 respectively denote the significance level and standard normal cumulative distribution function. In this study, we set 𝛼 = 0.001. After employing the PC-simple algorithm, we could get the causal relationship between genes and clinical phenotypes, with a vector 𝑍 𝑝×1 indicating the reliability of the inferred causal relationships. Notably, we could convert the Z score vector into a p-value vector by: 𝑃 = 2 * 𝜙(-𝑎𝑏𝑠(𝑍)). Please refer to the supplementary file for a more detailed description of the PC-simple algorithm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene-gene causal network inference</head><p>For the gene-gene causal network inference, we used tissue-specific gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database (note that any reference expression dataset can be used). To avoid possible biases introduced by confounders like population structure, batch effects, and so on, we performed confounder adjustment for the tissue-specific gene expression profiles first. This study implemented two different gene analysis strategies (exploratory and selective analysis). For the first one (exploratory analysis), we kept genes consistent with those of the gene-phenotype causal network. In other words, we took the intersection of tissue-specific genes from GTEx and the ones from imputed expression profiles. For the second strategy (selective analysis), we only selected a subset of genes from the first strategy. Suppose 𝑁 𝑐 is the number of identified directly causal genes for the studied traits. If 𝑁 𝑐 &gt; 150, then the top 150 directly causal genes with the largest z scores will be selected. If 20 &lt;= 𝑁 𝑐 &lt; =150, then all directly causal genes will be selected. PC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> will be employed to estimate the gene-gene causal graphs for the exploratory analysis while the bootstrapped-PC algorithm will be used for the selective analysis.</p><p>Graphical lasso is an efficient algorithm extensively used to estimate graphical models in highdimensional settings. In this study, we utilized graphical lasso <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to identify independent variables in the overall gene set analysis. In brief, it was employed to enforce sparsity on our estimated causal graphs. Genes 𝑖 and 𝑗 are conditionally independent if the 𝑖𝑗 𝑡ℎ component of the inverse covariance matrix (Σ -1 ) is zero. If we pose an L1-penalty for the estimation of Σ -1 , we could get a sparse gene-gene network. Friedman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> suggested setting the penalty parameter to 𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡(log (𝑛/𝑝)), where 𝑛 and 𝑝 respectively indicate the sample size and number of variables.</p><p>Like the PC-simple algorithm, the PC-algorithm also utilizes ordered independence screening to estimate the skeleton of the underlying causal structure for high-dimensional data. To begin with, we assume that all variables were connected, i.e., we have a complete undirected graph. Then we could recursively delete edges based on the ordered independence test. After this step, we could derive a p-value matrix 𝑃𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑝×𝑝 , which indicates the reliability of the inferred correlations between different pairs of genes. The derived undirected skeleton could be further partially directed by Pearl's inductive causation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Precisely, for each pair of non-adjacent variables (𝑋 𝑖 , 𝑋 𝑗 ) with a common neighbor variable 𝑋 𝑘 , if 𝑋 𝑘 does not belong to the separation set of 𝑋 𝑖 and 𝑋 𝑖 , then we could orient the edges among them as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑋 𝑖 → 𝑋 𝑘 ← 𝑋 𝑗 (𝑣 -𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒)</formula><p>After identifying all the v-structures in the graph, we could iteratively apply Meek's four rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> to orient as many undirected edges as possible. For more details about the algorithm, please refer to the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Meek's rules</head><p>R1: orient 𝑿 𝒋 -𝑿 𝒌 into 𝑿 𝒋 → 𝑿 𝒌 whenever there is an arrow 𝑿 𝒊 → 𝑿 𝒋 such that 𝑿 𝒊 and 𝑿 𝒌 are nonadjacent R2: orient 𝑿 𝒊 -𝑿 𝒋 into 𝑿 𝒊 → 𝑿 𝒋 whenever there is chain 𝑿 𝒊 → 𝑿 𝒌 → 𝑿 𝒋 R3: orient 𝑿 𝒊 -𝑿 𝒋 into 𝑿 𝒊 → 𝑿 𝒋 whenever there are two chains 𝑿 𝒊 -𝑿 𝒌 → 𝑿 𝒋 and 𝑿 𝒊 -𝑿 𝒍 → 𝑿 𝒋 such that 𝑿 𝒌 and 𝑿 𝒍 are non-adjacent R4: orient 𝑿 𝒊 -𝑿 𝒋 into 𝑿 𝒊 → 𝑿 𝒋 whenever there are two chains 𝑿 𝒊 -𝑿 𝒌 → 𝑿 𝒍 and 𝑿 𝒌 → 𝑿 𝒍 → 𝑿 𝒋 such that 𝑿 𝒌 and 𝑿 𝒋 are non-adjacent and 𝑿 𝒊 and 𝑿 𝒍 are adjacent Sometimes, we may not be able to identify a valid causal graph, i.e., a completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG), for the high-dimensional gene expression data. For example, there may exist circles in our derived causal graphs. We could resolve this by utilizing auxiliary methods to re-orient undirected edges to get a valid CPDAG. Also, we could incorporate domain knowledge to re-orient undirected edges. This study employed the additive noise model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , which was implemented in R package "CAM", to re-orient undirected edges. In brief, "CAM" is a structure learning algorithm that decouples order search between variables based on additive regression models. While using the "CAM" method, we selected "Lasso" as the feature selection method and linear model to estimate causal structures. Due to the comparatively small sample size, we set the number of basis functions for the pruning method to 1.</p><p>We employed a bootstrapped-PC algorithm for the selective gene analysis to infer the underlying genegene causal network. Briefly, we randomly resampled the available GTEx data with replacement and estimated the gene-gene network using PC algorithm. We repeated this process 100 times to get the ultimate gene-gene network. Causal relationships identified in &gt;= 60% of the iterations were deemed actual relationships. In other words, we only retained the edge with the condition that it existed in more than 60% of the inferred causal graphs. Notably, the p-value matrix 𝑃𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑝×𝑝 was the average p-value of all positive iterations. For example, if the causal relationship 𝑖 → 𝑗 existed in 70% of the iterations, then the ultimate pvalue 𝑝 𝑖→𝑗 = ∑ 𝑝 𝑖→𝑗 𝑚 70 𝑚=1 /70, with 𝑚 indicating the iteration index where causal relationship 𝑖 → 𝑗 existed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Penalty-based causal effects estimation</head><p>We could derive the overall gene-outcome causal network and the corresponding p-value matrix by combining the gene-gene and gene-outcome causal networks derived from the above two steps. As mentioned above, we could separately get a 𝑝 × 1 p-value vector (𝑃 𝑋-𝑌 ) and 𝑝 × 𝑝 p-value matrix (𝑃 𝑋-𝑋 )for the inferred gene-outcome and gene-gene causal networks. The overall p-value matrix can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑃 𝑋𝑌 = [ 𝑃 𝑋-𝑋 𝑃 𝑋-𝑌 𝑃 𝑋-𝑌 𝑇 0</formula><p>]. In this study, we employed the "add background knowledge" function, implemented in R package "pcalg" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , to merge gene-gene and gene-outcome causal networks into one integrated causal graph.</p><p>After deriving the tissue-specific causal graph for each studied trait, we could estimate the total and direct causal effects of different genes on our studied traits. Maathuis et al. proposed efficient methods IDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and jointIDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> to infer total and direct intervention effects from high dimensional observational data based on the covariance matrix. Given a causal graph 𝐺, the causal effects of a particular node 𝑿 𝒊 can be estimated by intervention calculus. IDA estimates the total causal effect of the intervention node 𝑿 𝒊 by regressing the target 𝑌 on the intervention node 𝑿 𝒊 and its parents node set (𝑃𝑎(𝑿 𝒊 )). Given a causal graph 𝐺, we could find the parents node set for any given node. jointIDA is an extension of this method with multiple simultaneous interventions. When the causal graph is known, we could identify paths from node 𝑿 𝒊 to the target 𝑌. If we intervene on 𝑿 𝒊 and all parents nodes set of the target 𝑌 (𝑃𝑎(Y)), then the estimated causal effect for intervention node 𝑿 𝒊 is the direct causal effect. For more details about these two methods, please refer to the supplementary text.</p><p>In this study, we proposed novel penalty-based IDA and jointIDA approaches, which enable us to quantify the total and direct causal effects of different genes on studied traits. More specifically, we regularized the covariance matrix by the p-value matrix 𝑃 𝑋𝑌 derived from our inferred causal graph.</p><p>Intuitively, the derived p-value matrix 𝑃 𝑋𝑌 reflected the credibility of the inferred causal relationships between genes and phenotypes. The smaller the p-value, the more credible the estimated relationship is, and the less we penalized for the covariance. We proposed two different strategies to estimate the target covariance matrix. For the 1 st strategy (p-value adjustment), we obtained the target covariance matrix by solving the following optimization problem for the penalized log-likelihood of the covariance matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">max Σ (log 𝑑𝑒𝑡Σ -1 -𝑡𝑟(𝑆Σ -1 ) -‖𝑃 𝑋𝑌 * Σ -1 ‖ 1 )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Here Σ is the covariance matrix we aim to estimate, 𝑆 is the estimated covariance matrix from the imputed expression profiles and raw phenotypes. * indicates component-wise multiplication. ‖𝑃 𝑋𝑌 * Σ -1 ‖ 1 is the L1 norm: the sum of absolute values of elements in matrix 𝑃 𝑋𝑌 * Σ -1 . For the 2 nd strategy (iterative p-value adjustment), we iteratively penalized the covariance matrix by the overall p-value matrix 𝑃 𝑋𝑌 until the change of log-likelihood of the covariance matrix was less than 10 -4 , i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|(log detΣ m+1 -1 -tr(SΣ m+1 -1 )) -(log detΣ m -1 -tr(SΣ m -1 ))| &lt; 10 -4<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Here 𝑚 = 1,2,3, … denotes the number of iterations. After deriving the penalized covariance matrix, we could respectively estimate the total and direct causal effects of various genes on the studied traits by IDA and jointIDA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal structure simulation</head><p>In our study, a graphical model was used to represent the causal relations between genes and phenotypes. Firstly, we randomly generated a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which the nodes represent the variables that we are studying (including genotypes, genes, and phenotype), and the weight refers to the causal effect. All the causal effects were randomly generated by a given range (minimum and maximum weight), following the uniform distribution. We fitted 20 replicates to all combinations of: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strategy for sample generation</head><p>Simulated samples were generated for further analysis based on the causal structure of DAG.</p><p>Multivariate datasets with dependency structures were generated by the function 'rmvDAG' from R package 'pcalg' based on the earlier parameter settings. For each scenario, we divided the simulated dataset into two subsets, A and B. The sample size of dataset A was set to 800, which is close to the available sample size from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. We imputed gene expression data by training a prediction model in dataset A, and applied it to the genotypes of dataset B. The predicted gene expression dataset was marked as dataset C. An elastic-net regularized regression model was used for the prediction model. Notably, cross-validation was utilized to tune the optimal parameters for the prediction model. These two datasets, A and C, were separately used for further gene-gene and gene-phenotype causal network inference. R package 'glmnet' <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> was used in this section. Different scenarios were tried with varied GTEx sample sizes (More details are provided in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal structure inference</head><p>We applied our framework to the simulated datasets to estimate the causal structure. PC-algorithm was used to infer the gene-gene network based on actual expression data (dataset A). The PC-Simple algorithm was used to infer the gene-phenotype network based on imputed expression data (dataset C). Then we merged the inferred gene-gene and gene-phenotype networks to get the overall causal structure. After obtaining the overall causal structure, total and direct causal effects could be estimated for further analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Framework performance evaluation</head><p>Univariate tests were also performed on the imputed expression data to reveal trait-associated genes.</p><p>They were widely used for gene-based analyses to identify trait-associated genes. Then, we performed different comparative analyses between univariate test and our proposed framework, including causal effect estimation and core gene detection. We calculated the correlations and RMSEs between the actual and estimated effects from both methods to compare their performances.</p><p>Notably, we applied the proposed regularization strategies (p-value matrix and iterative p-value adjustment) to estimate the covariance matrices (please refer to 'Penalty-based causal effects estimation' for more details). The estimated covariance matrices were used to calculate the total and direct causal effects.</p><p>As for core gene detection, we compared the differences between our framework and the univariate test in terms of sensitivity, Type I error, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV).</p><p>Also, we are interested in finding mediating genes, which could provide valuable information for understanding the biological mechanisms of complex traits. Therefore, peripheral gene detection ability was also evaluated. Again, sensitivity, Type I error, PPV and NPV were separately calculated to demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in uncovering mediating genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Split-half replication and stability selection analysis</head><p>Split-half replication was performed to assess the robustness and validity of our method in uncovering causally relevant genes for studied phenotypes. Firstly, we randomly split the dataset for our studied phenotypes into 2 subsets. Then our proposed framework was applied to these two subsets independently.</p><p>We evaluated the validity and robustness of our proposed framework by calculating the replication rate of the identified directly causal genes from these two subsets for the same traits.</p><p>Apart from this, stability selection 26 was performed to quantify the stability of our proposed method in identifying core genes or causal relationships. This approach also provides statistical inference as it can control the expected number of false positives (i.e., E(V)). In brief, it combines subsampling with a highdimensional feature selection algorithm to improve the accuracy of the estimated causal structure and control for the expected number of false positive findings. Notably, core genes could also be regarded as causal relationships between genes and clinical outcomes. Suppose there are 𝑝 variables and 𝑛 samples for our structure estimation problem. 𝐼 𝑏 indicates a random subset of the samples with size 𝑚 = ⌊𝑛/2⌋ .</p><p>𝑆 𝐼 𝑏 denotes the set of identified core genes/causal relationships by our proposed method based on subset 𝑆 𝐼 𝑏 .</p><p>The set of all identified core genes/causal relationships can be expressed as: 𝑆 = ⋃ 𝑆 𝐼 𝑏 𝐼 𝑏</p><p>. Let 𝑞 be the average number of identified core genes/causal relationships, 𝑞 = 𝐸(|𝑆 𝐼 𝑏 |). 𝜋 𝑡ℎ𝑟 defines the cutoff that is used to determine whether an inferred core gene (causal relationship) is falsely identified. The number of falsely identified core genes/causal relationships 𝐸(𝑉) under 𝜋 𝑡ℎ𝑟 is bounded by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝐸(𝑉) ≤ 1 2𝜋 𝑡ℎ𝑟 -1 𝑞 2 𝑝 (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>As suggested by Meinshausen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , 𝜋 𝑡ℎ𝑟 has an almost negligible effect on the results when it falls into the sensible value range [0.6, 0.9]. In this study, the cutoff (𝜋 𝑡ℎ𝑟 ) was set to 0.6. By employing this method, we could quantify the average number of identified variables ( 𝑞 ), the number of false identified variables(𝐸(𝑉)), and the expected proportion of false positives when compared to the (average) number of selected features, 𝐸(𝑉)/𝑞.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OpenTargets enrichment analysis</head><p>To further evaluate the reliability and accuracy of our proposed method in identifying causally relevant genes, we performed enrichment analysis of potential targets associated with studied disorders. The targets of disorders were downloaded from the Open Targets Platform. Open targets provide us with measures of relevance (from 0 to 1) between diseases and targets based on various factors, like associations with known drugs, hits from GWAS, expression studies, etc. Specifically, we tested whether the direct causal genes from our proposed framework were more likely to be a listed target in the Open Targets. In addition, we compared our identified direct causal genes with the susceptibility genes from standard univariate tests.</p><p>Since our proposed method is more stringent regarding definition of trait-associated genes, the number of identified genes from our method tends to be much smaller than that from the univariate test under the same p-value cutoff. We selected the same number of genes for comparison, to avoid possible bias due to imbalanced sample sizes. Concretely, we ranked the analysis results from the univariate test by p-value in an increasing order first. Then we select the top 𝑁 𝐶 genes, where 𝑁 𝐶 equals the number of identified direct causal genes from our proposed framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survival and replication analysis for breast cancer</head><p>We also performed a survival analysis for breast cancer to verify the validity of our framework. Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the influence of the identified causally relevant genes from our framework on survival. We used expression data from the Kaplan Meier Plotter database as the source to validate the importance of our identified genes. There are 4929 available patients for the survival analysis, which is much larger than the sample size of TCGA dataset. Survival analysis was performed using default settings. Additionally, we performed survival analysis on gene sets identified from conventional univariate tests. The same number of genes were separately selected from analyses on breast mammary tissue and whole blood. Then we compared the survival analysis results from our method to those from univariate tests.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined whether our proposed method could identify more oncogenic 'driver' genes than expected. We compared the identified core genes from our method with known driver genes for breast cancer (extracted from OncoVar 27 ) and enrichment was tested by Fisher's Exact test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further enrichment analyses</head><p>To better understand the mechanisms underlying the studied traits, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis on the identified gene sets by the "ConsensusPathDB" 28 platform. More specifically, overrepresentation analysis was performed on the directly causal genes by hypergeometric test. In addition, enrichment analyses were performed by "Enrichr" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> to identify transcription factors and drugs related to the studied diseases. We also performed univariate analyses for all studied tissue-trait pairs. Then we compared the gene set identified from the univariate test with that from our proposed method. Also, we compared the estimated effects of these genes on the studied traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incorporation of external knowledge</head><p>Notably, our proposed framework could incorporate external knowledge to estimate the causal graph. In this study, we performed exploratory analyses on whole blood-related traits by incorporating external knowledge (gene-gene links) from SIGNOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis on multiple traits</head><p>The proposed causal inference framework could also be extended to more than one trait. Here, we take two traits (e.g., BMI and coronary artery disease (CAD)) as a demonstration example. Firstly, we need to identify the causal directions between the studied traits, which could be inferred from Mendelian Randomization or extracted from literature. Then, we picked one trait as the "ultimate" outcome (e.g., CAD).</p><p>As for the 'exposure' trait (e.g., BMI, the trait not designated as outcome), we first calculated the polygenic risk scores (PRS) of all involved subjects based on external GWAS summary data. Then we randomly selected 5,000 subjects to build a prediction model to predict the exposure trait based on calculated PRSs.</p><p>Subsequently, we applied the built model to predict the value of exposure trait for the remaining subjects. In this study, a linear model was used to predict the value of the continuous exposure trait, while a logistic model was used for the binary exposure trait. The predicted exposure trait could be regarded as a special (imputed/genetically predicted) 'gene'. After that, we combined the predicted exposure trait with the imputed gene expression profiles to infer the "gene"-outcome causal network. The whole causal graph for the exposure trait could be regarded as a special "gene-gene" causal network. The complete causal graph could be derived by combining the inferred "gene"-outcome network and "gene-gene" network. The workflow for the causal graph inference for more than 2 traits is similar to that for 2 traits. Similar to singletrait analysis, we could quantify the total and direct causal effects of various genes on the "outcome" trait.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of causal effects estimation</head><p>Firstly, we compared the correlation and root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual and estimated causal effects. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the comparison results of total causal effect (IDA) and direct causal effects (JointIDA; the effect controlled for other variables) for 20 replicates. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, our proposed p-value regularization strategy could significantly improve the accuracy of total causal effects estimation. More specifically, for a simulated GTEx sample size =800, the median correlation of 20 replicates increased from 0.7 to 0.82, while the RMSE decreased from 1.26 to 0.68. Correlation and RMSE improved with increased sample size (of the simulated 'GTEx' dataset, the dataset we used for gene-gene causal network inference). A similar trend was observed for the estimation of direct causal effects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref> and 2D). Overall, our proposed framework performed well in quantifying the total and direct causal effects of various genes on the studied trait. Most importantly, it consistently achieved superior performance than univariate analysis.</p><p>The p-value adjustment strategy significantly improved the accuracy of estimated causal effects compared to the original IDA and JointIDA methods. The correlation between the observed and true effect sizes was generally higher with the adjustment (regularization) strategy, as compared to the origin estimation approach. The correlation after the adjustment was also high (generally &gt;0.8). The RMSE was also generally lower. The p-value adjustment approach also appeared to produce more stable results, with smaller variability and less outlying values in the performance metrics, especially under large sample sizes.</p><p>Of note, when estimating the direct causal effects (i.e., effects controlled for other variables), the univariate testing approach performed considerably worse than other methods. For more details, please refer to Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>-3.   <ref type="table">S3</ref> for more details).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the comparison results with varied gene numbers. The performance of our framework was relatively stable as the gene number increased. Generally, the actual and estimated IDA correlations were around 0.75 after applying the p-value adjustment strategy. We also compared the results from different perspectives, including varying graph densities and causal effect sizes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1-11</ref>). Overall, our proposed framework performed well in uncovering the causal effects of genes on studied traits under various parameter settings.</p><p>Comparison of the univariate test and PC-simple in detecting 'core' (directly causal) geneshigher positive predictive value and lower false positive rate with PC-simple</p><p>The core (directly) causal genes refer to those directly connect to the outcome in the causal graph. Our framework leveraged imputed gene expression data (instead of raw gene expression data, because of the limited sample size for most RNA-seq or microarray datasets) to infer the gene-phenotype links, revealing the potential direct causal genes. We employed the PC-simple approach to detect such genes, which to our knowledge has not been utilized for similar purposes. Here we conducted a comparison between PC-Simple and the univariate test.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the comparison results between the PC-simple and univariate tests in identifying direct causal genes. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, PC-simple had superior performance than the univariate test in uncovering relevant genes. It showed a much higher positive predictive value (PPV) and a lower false positive rate (FPR). The performance improved with an increased GTEx sample size.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> demonstrates the performance of the PC-simple and univariate test with different gene numbers. Obviously, the performance of the PC-simple remained stable with increased gene numbers. Even though the sensitivities for the PC-simple were in general lower than the univariate test, it achieved much better specificity and PPV. Since the PC-Simple method was more stringent than the univariate test in picking associated genes, it tended to select fewer genes, leading to the lower sensitivity. However, PCsimple may serve as a very useful tool for selecting genes for follow-up investigations, as in practice usually only a limited number of genes can be chosen for in-depth experimental studies. A high PPV ensures that the selected genes are likely direct causal genes of interest. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of peripheral(indirect causal) gene detection</head><p>The peripheral genes refer to those connects to the outcome through other genes in the causal graph.</p><p>We simulated different scenarios to demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in peripheral gene detection. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the results of peripheral gene detection with varied gene numbers (50,70,100,150), graph densities (0.02, 0.05, 0.1), causal effect sizes (0.1, 0.3, 0.5), and GTEx sample sizes (800, 2000, 8000).</p><p>Overall, our proposed method performed well in detecting peripheral genes. The PPV for peripheral gene detection of our framework can reach 0.88, while the false positive rates were controlled around/under 0.1.</p><p>The sensitivity and PPV were relatively stable with increased gene numbers. In view of our computational costs, the maximum gene number in all simulated scenarios was set to 150. Since the performance of our framework is not sensitive to gene numbers, we believe it will still have satisfactory performance even if more genes are included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of further analyses using bootstrap</head><p>The accuracy of the estimated gene-gene causal network could be affected by the available sample size of which we based for the estimation. To improve the performance of our framework, we used bootstrap for the inference of gene-gene networks. We resampled the data with replacement for 100 times to deduce our final gene-gene network; we only retained edges that can be learned from &gt;= 60% of the estimated graphs.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the performance of our proposed method in identifying gene-gene interactions with and without bootstrap. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) in detecting true gene-gene links in the network. Apparently, bootstrap could significantly improve the accuracy of identified causal relationships between genes, with median PPV increased from 0.57 to 0.9.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> demonstrates the results of peripheral gene detection under two different strategies. Again, bootstrap significantly improved the performance of the proposed method in detecting peripheral genes.</p><p>More specifically, median PPV increased from 0.7 to 0.935 while the false positive rate decreased from 0.34 to 0.038.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application to UKBB phenotypes</head><p>We applied our proposed approach to 41 continuous and 11 binary traits. Details about the studied phenotypes are summarized in Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>. The individual-level phenotypes and genotypes data were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKBB) with application no. 28732. In this study, continuous traits were directly extracted from the UKBB dataset. The binary traits diabetes (UDI:2443-0.0) and COVID-19 were also directly extracted from the UKBB. For COVID-19, we considered two different analysis strategies. For the first, cases were defined by the presence of COVID-19, while controls were subjects without known history of COVID-19. For the second, cases were defined by hospitalized/severe COVID-19, while controls included both non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects and subjects without known history of COVID-19. The remaining binary traits were defined by a combination of self-reported and ICD10-coded diseases. For more details about the combination of self-reported and ICD-10 coded diseases, please refer to Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>. The number of cases for each of the 11 binary traits were larger than 2,000.</p><p>The inferred causal graphs were tissue specific. In this study, we imputed the gene expression levels of UKBB subjects based on genotypes for several different tissues, including whole blood, adipose subcutaneous, adipose visceral omentum, liver, lung, pancreas, breast mammary, prostate, cortex, frontal cortex, coronary artery, left ventricle, nucleus accumbens and putamen. The tissues were selected based on relevance to our studied phenotypes. We inferred the causal graphs for all 52 phenotypes for the whole blood tissue. As for the remaining tissues, we only inferred the causal graphs if the tissue is considered relevant to the trait. the number of identified directly causal genes. The length of the outer bars scale with the total number of identified causal genes. The lighter the color, the higher the proportion of indirect causal genes.</p></div>

As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, some traits, especially those anthropometric-related traits, tended to have more causally relevant genes than other traits regardless of tissue types. For example, the number of identified causal genes for weight and BMI were top ranked in all relevant tissues. On the contrary, simple  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proportion of indireclty causal genes</head><p>lab test traits, like Oestradiol and lipoprotein A, were more likely to have less causally relevant genes.</p><p>Overall, the number of identified directly causal genes for all traits except one was less than 150.</p><p>The numbers of identified causally relevant genes for binary traits were in general less than that for continuous traits (Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">S6</ref>). This was expected due to the much smaller effective sample size for these binary traits. In the UKBB dataset, the sample sizes for continuous traits were, in general, no less than 400,000. However, most of the subjects in the dataset were controls for binary traits. The cases sizes were generally less than 20,000, most &lt; 10,000. Among the 11 binary traits, only 4 of them had case sizes &gt; 20,000. As can be seen from Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">6</ref>, the power of our proposed method improves with the increase of effective sample sizes.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> The estimated causal graph for LDL (low density lipoprotein) in the whole blood Some traits were more likely to have a complex causal graph (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>). In other words, they tended to have a high proportion of indirect causal genes than others, such as several lipid traits (LDL, cholesterol, apolipoprotein B), C-reactive protein and BMI (based on expression in whole blood and subcutaneous adipose tissues). Interestingly, the proportion of indirect causal genes (prop_indirect) for neuroticism score (based on imputed expression in blood) is also high(42.1%). Among the binary traits studied, prop_indirect is also high for anxiety disorder and coronary artery disease (CAD). It has been reported that a substantial proportion of the identified susceptibility genes for CAD were found to be involved in the metabolism of its risk factors like low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . Prop_indirect for some other traits tended to be smaller, for example, we did not detect any indirect causal genes for IGF-1. Notably, causal graphs inferred from the whole blood and adipose usually had a high proportion of indirect causal genes compared with other tissues. We note that the power to detect indirect genes is also affected by the available sample sizes of the GTEx dataset, and that successful detection of indirect genes (mediation effects) likely requires higher statistical power than detecting genes with total causal effects. Whole blood and adipose tissue are the top ranked tissues regarding the available sample sizes in GTEx. Thus, the inferred gene-gene networks for these tissues had a better chance to reflect the actual links between various genes. The identified causally relevant genes for the same trait may vary between tissues. While some causally relevant genes were shared among different tissues, others were specific to unique tissues. Take BMI for example, we separately identified 114 and 120 directly causal genes for BMI in the adipose subcutaneous and whole blood tissues. Among these identified causally relevant genes, 20 of them were shared between two tissues. These shared genes were significantly enriched in the centriole, which has been proven to be involved in regulating body size <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</p><p>Please refer to the following site for more examples of the inferred causal graphs: <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/LiangyingYin/BayesianNetwork/tree/main/Causalgraphs">https://github.com/LiangyingYin/BayesianNetwork/tree/main/Causalgraphs</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The distribution of causal effects varies across different traits</head><p>The estimated total and direct causal effects for various genes for the exploratory analysis were summarized in Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> demonstrates some examples of genes with estimated causal effects on different traits. While some of the identified core genes had substantial effects on studied traits, others only had minor/mild effects. For example, ALDH2 was found to have strong effect on CAD in the whole blood, while IL20RB only had minor effect. In this study, we regarded genes whose estimated total effect smaller than one-tenth of the largest estimated effect as 'small-effect' genes. Some traits were estimated to have a high proportion of small-effect core genes while others were not. For example, the proportions of smalleffect core genes for WHR (waist-hip ratio) in all relevant tissues were around/over 60%. For full results please refer to Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>. Also, we noticed that the proportion of small-effect core genes was high for binary traits, usually no less than 45%. For example, the proportion of small-effect core genes for breast cancer was ~75% (from whole blood). Compared with cardiometabolic disorders, the estimated effect sizes of core genes for psychiatric disorders were much smaller. For example, the maximum absolute total causal effect of the core genes for depression was only one-fifth of that for CAD. The estimated causal effects for core genes may vary between tissues, but generally they show the same direction of effects. A few indirect causal(or 'peripheral') had relatively strong mediating effects, e.g., LAMB1 for BMI, HLA-H for LDL, PLTP for weight, although the effects were weak for most other genes.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">S9</ref> summarized the estimated causal effects of various genes on studied traits for the selective analysis. As the numbers of identified directly causal genes for all traits excluding weight in adipose subcutaneous were less than 150, the selective analysis included all directly causal genes for almost all studied traits. Compared with exploratory analysis, the proportion of multiple-path genes (have direct and indirect link through other genes to the outcome) were much higher for most traits. In other words, many genes, which only directly affected the studied traits in exploratory analysis, were now perceived to exert their effect on the studied trait through multiple paths. This is expected due to more spurious associations between core genes when the confounders(genes) are missing in the selective analysis. Even so, the estimated total causal effects for most genes were close to that from an exploratory analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Split-half replication</head><p>In this study, we performed a split-half replication analysis on 9 different traits in the whole blood tissue. Table <ref type="table">7</ref> summarizes the replication result. The replication rates for most continuous traits were high.</p><p>For example, the replication rate for HDL was around 70%. Most importantly, the proportions of shared genes for all traits were significantly higher than expected by chance. The results provide further support to the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method in identifying causally relevant genes for different phenotypes.</p><p>We note that the replication rate for binary traits was comparatively lower. This is expected due to the more complex genetic architecture of some of these binary traits. Some core genes may only have small/moderate effects on the studied traits, which made it difficult to replicate these identified core genes from a different dataset. While a small set of large effect genes stand out all the time, different sets of small/moderate effect genes may contribute to trait variations in different datasets. Importantly, inadequate statistical power may also lead to unfavorable replication rates for these binary traits. Compared with continuous traits, the effective sample sizes for binary traits are relatively modest, especially after we split the corresponding dataset into 2 halves. Regardless, the proportion of shared genes for all tested traits were higher than expected, though further increase in sample sizes is desirable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability selection analysis as a way for statistical inference and evaluating stability of selected genes</head><p>Stability selection was performed to quantify the stability of our proposed method in identifying core genes, with the number of subsampling set to 50. Stability selection also provides a formal way to perform statistical inference, controlling the expected number of false positives (E(V)). Table <ref type="table">8</ref> summarizes the stability selection results for 4 different traits in the whole blood tissue. As expected, the number of falsely identified core genes increases with the average number of identified core genes. Overall, our proposed framework performed well in identifying core genes. The false positive proportion( 𝐸(𝑉)/𝑝, where 𝑝 is the total number of genes tested) were kept under 0.05 for all 4 traits. Also, we performed stability selection to evaluate the reliability of our proposed method in identifying gene-gene links for selected gene set analysis. The number of subsampling was set to 100. Again, our method performed well in identifying causal relationships between genes, the false positive proportions were all kept under 0.05 for all studied traits (Table <ref type="table">S10</ref>). Notably, we did not assess the performance of our method in identifying the gene-gene links for the exploratory gene set analysis, as it is too time-consuming.</p><p>We believe the performance will be similar to the selective analysis.</p></div>

We tried 10 different association score cutoffs between 0 and 1 with a step size of 0.1 to define the disease-associated genes (such disease genes are also referred to as 'targets' below). Meta-analysis was performed using harmonic mean p-value (HMP) to combine p-values derived under different score cutoffs. Briefly, HMP 36 is a meta-analysis method based on Bayesian model averaging, which combines p-values derived from dependent hypotheses while appropriately controlling for family-wise error rate (FWER). Table <ref type="table">9</ref> summarizes the enrichment analysis results (full results in Table <ref type="table">S11</ref>). The identified directly causal genes for 6 binary traits were found to be significantly or nominally enriched for their corresponding targets. For the remaining 5 binary traits (anxiety, COVID-19, depression, heart failure, stroke), the number of identified directly causal genes in relevant tissues was no more than 3.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it's difficult to find potential targets from such a small set of candidates, which unavoidably limit the power of the fisher's exact test in detecting significant differences. This problem could be alleviated when the available samples(cases) increase. These enrichment analysis results further verified the validity of our proposed framework in identifying causally relevant genes for different traits.</p><p>The proposed methodology showed stronger enrichment for OpenTargets genes than univariate test, and identified novel genes</p><p>In addition, we examined whether our proposed method showed stronger enrichment for 'targets' than the conventional univariate-based analysis. We only consider traits with &gt;= 5 directly causal genes (since the power of comparison test is too weak with very small number of causal genes). Tables <ref type="table">10</ref> and<ref type="table">S12</ref> summarize the comparison results. For all studied binary traits with &gt;= 5 causal genes, our method was able to identify significantly more targets than the univariate test. Most importantly, it consistently achieved superior performance than the univariate test regardless of the number of directly causal genes (Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>.b).</p><p>Furthermore, we compared the two approaches under the same p-value cutoff, i.e., p=0.001. Even though the univariate test identified much more trait-associated genes, our method still achieved better performance by identifying a higher proportion of targets for most disorders (Table <ref type="table">S12</ref>.c and S12.d). In this regard, the identified core genes, especially those novel genes not identified by univariate analysis(Table <ref type="table">S13</ref>), have the potential to serve as targets for new drugs and therapeutic treatments for studied disorders.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">11</ref> demonstrates the identified novel genes that were top ranked (z score) in our inferred causal graphs for the studied binary traits. We highlight a few genes here. For example, our method identified PIGIS as a novel core gene for CAD in the artery coronary. In a previous study, Yi et al. found it played a significant role in the regulation of blood flow and platelet activity, which is implicated in the development of atherothrombosis and acute coronary syndromes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . FXYD2, a top core gene identified from our method for diabetes in the pancreas tissue, was proven to be intensively involved in the Akt pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , which controls pancreatic beta cell growth and proliferation. For breast cancer in the breast mammary tissue, ATXN3 was one of the top ranked core genes identified by our method. Through deubiquitinating KLF4, it could accelerate the metastasis of breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . The comparison results further corroborated the validity and superiority of our proposed method in identifying disease-related genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of survival and enrichment for 'pathogenic' genes listed in OncoVarstudy of top genes for breast cancer</head><p>We separately performed survival analysis on gene sets identified from the breast mammary and whole blood tissues. We have chosen breast cancer for further analysis as there are abundant independent datasets for verifying the importance of the top genes. Based on imputed expression in breast mammary tissue, we identified 7 directly causal genes for breast cancer. As can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S12</ref>, six of them were significantly associated with survival of breast cancer. Based on the imputed expression in the whole blood tissue, we identified 8 genes, all of which were significantly associated with survival. Table <ref type="table">S14</ref> demonstrates the survival analysis results for gene sets identified from our method and those from the univariate-based analysis. Almost all the genes identified from both methods were associated with altered survival of breast cancer patients. Overall, our method achieved slightly better performance with a much lower combined p-value (3.9E-12) than the univariate test (2.33E-11) based on the Simes test. Some of the identified core genes, for example NOTCH2 and PTK6, were also known pathogenic/likely pathogenic genes for breast cancer based on the OncoVar database. Importantly, the proportion of identified pathogenic genes (as defined by OncoVar) identified by our framework were significantly higher than expected by chance (p=0.037). According to the OncoVar, three of the identified core genes, i.e., NOTCH2, SLC22A5, PTK6, were drug-target genes for breast cancer. All of the above genes were also known to harbor mutations for breast cancer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings from multiple-trait analysis</head><p>Two-and three-traits analyses were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed framework in identifying causally relevant genes for multiple traits. We performed 6 two-traits and 2 threetraits analyses (Table <ref type="table">S15</ref>, S16, S17). We inferred the causal graphs for multiple traits; BMI, HbA1c, LDL were included as exposures, and CAD, diabetes, COVID-19 were modeled as outcomes. The selection was based on previous studies which supported causal relationships between the exposure and outcome traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple-trait analysis revealed genetic effects mediated via other clinical risk factors</head><p>As expected, the inferred causal graphs for multiple traits were much more complex than those for single traits. All inferred causal graphs had a high proportion of indirect causal genes, with some even reaching 90%(Table <ref type="table">S17</ref>). Take CAD for example, when we performed a single-trait analysis in the whole blood tissue, the proportion of indirect causal genes was 30.7%. If we incorporated other risk factors like BMI and LDL, the proportion of indirect causal genes increased to around 90%. These results suggested that a large proportion of genes probably contribute to disease development through their effects on other risk factors, which can be uncovered by the proposed multiple-trait analysis. We also compared the direct causal genes identified from single-trait with those from multiple-trait analyses for the same outcome trait (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S16</ref>). Some identified core genes in the single-trait analysis became indirect causal genes after incorporating other risk factors. Take UHRF1BP1 for example, it was identified as a core gene for CAD in the whole blood tissue. However, after we incorporated BMI into the analysis, it became an indirect causal gene. We hypothesized that UHRF1BP1 might exert its effect on CAD through obesity, which indeed was supported by a recent work by Nikpay et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> Comparison of identified directly causal genes and proportion of indirect causal genes between multiple and single trait analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Total and direct causal effect estimates</head><p>We also estimated the total and direct causal effects of different genes on the "outcome" traits for all multiple-trait analysis scenarios (Table <ref type="table">12</ref>(BMI-&gt;CAD) and S17). There is relatively high proportion (89%) of indirect causal (i.e., 'peripheral') genes, with very small jointIDA estimates (i.e., the causal effects diminished after controlling for other variables). However, we also observed some genes which were directly causal (i.e., 'core') in single-trait analysis (only CAD considered), and remained so after BMI was also considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pathway and drug enrichment analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table">S18</ref> summarizes the enriched pathways for all studied traits. As expected, most of the enriched pathways were associated with the studied traits or related pathophysiology. Different researchers have studied their roles in the corresponding traits. Some of them were even identified as new therapeutic targets.</p><p>For example, NR1H3 &amp; NR1H2(LXRs) regulate gene expression linked to cholesterol transport and efflux, and it was the top enriched pathway for CAD in the coronary artery tissue. These LXRs (Liver X receptors)</p><p>were suggested to be intensively involved in the efflux, transport, excretion of cholesterol and lipid in different cell types and responsible for the development of CAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> . Also, they had direct effects on the development of cardiovascular disease. In a previous study, Cannon et al. suggested that activation of LXRs could lead to cardiomyocytes damage and loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . Other researchers have proven that synthetic LXRs agonists are effective in inhibiting the development of atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . Take LDL in the whole blood tissue as another example, Lysosome Vesicle Biogenesis, and Lysosome were the top 2 enriched pathways. They were both intimately connected to the biogenesis and transport of lipid <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . For more details about the enriched pathways, please refer to Table <ref type="table">S18</ref>. Table <ref type="table">S19</ref> demonstrates the drug enrichment analysis results of identified core genes for our studied binary traits. Some of the enriched drugs have been tested/used for the treatment of patients in clinical practice. For example, dasatinib was significantly enriched for breast cancer in the breast mammary tissue.</p><p>In a related study, Tian et al. demonstrated that dasatinib combined with paclitaxel could inhibit tumor growth in triple-negative breast cancer patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . For COVID-19 in the lung, niclosamide was the top enriched drug. There are several studies suggesting the potential clinical usefulness of this drug <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> . Also, there is an ongoing clinical trial to evaluate whether it could be repurposed for the treatment of mild/moderate COVID-19 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</p><p>Also, we analyzed the enriched transcription factors for different traits. Again, most of the enriched transcription factors were intimately connected to the underlying pathophysiology of the corresponding disorders. For example, BHLHA15, which was significantly enriched for the diabetes, was proven to be essential in maintaining the secretory cell architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> . For more details on the enriched transcription factors, please refer to Table <ref type="table">S20</ref>. These enrichment analysis results provide further support for the validity and efficacy of our proposed method in identifying core genes for different traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of causal effect estimates by IDA/jointIDA and the univariate test</head><p>In this study, we compared the "core" genes and "peripheral" genes as well as their estimated effects from our proposed method to the susceptibility genes identified from the univariate test (Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>). Our proposed method tended to identify fewer genes than the univariate test when the p-value cutoffs were all set to 0.001. This was expected due to the more stringent criteria of our proposed method. For some traitassociated genes, the estimated effects from IDA and jointIDA were very close to those from the univariate test. For example, the estimated effects of LPL on CAD in the whole blood tissue from both methods were approximately equal. Previously, Khera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> reported its significant role in the clearance of triglycerides, which could lead to the onset of CAD. Based on the comparison result, we may postulate that the effect of LPL on CAD is probably not influenced by other CAD-associated genes. However, there also existed many genes for which their estimated effects from IDA and the univariate test were quite different. Take SLC22A5 for example, the estimated effect on breast cancer (based on expression in the whole blood) from the univariate test was obviously stronger than that from our method. SLC22A5 has been proven to have a critical role in regulating breast cancer cell proliferation. Wang et al. demonstrated that the expression of SLC22A5 in breast cancer patients was induced by estrogen signaling, a key pathway underlying breast cancer pathophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . In other words, other causally relevant genes may regulate its expression. The IDA and jointIDA methods take the influence of other genes in the network into account while estimating the effects of the identified gene. Thus, the estimated effects were less likely to be biased by other factors.</p><p>Even though the estimated effects from the two methods were not always consistent, the directions of the effects were generally concordant. For more detail about the comparison results, please refer to Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incorporation of external knowledge into the network</head><p>We also explored the use of external knowledge on gene-gene interaction from the SIGNOR database for causal graph estimation. We focused on the trait-associated genes, and included genes linked to them based on external knowledge. Table <ref type="table">S21</ref> summarizes the estimated causal graphs for various traits in the whole blood tissue after incorporating external knowledge. As expected, the incorporated external knowledge only mildly affected our estimated causal graphs.</p><p>Comparison of causal effect estimates from IDA/jointIDA vs univariate test under multiple-trait analysis</p><p>Univariate-based analyses were also performed for all the multiple-trait analyses. All the genetically predicted traits were regarded as "genes" while performing the univariate test. Table <ref type="table">S17</ref> summarizes the comparison results of the estimated causal effects from our method and that of the univariate test. Again, our method identified fewer trait-associated genes (here we mainly refer to core genes) than the univariate test.</p><p>While the directions of the estimated effects from both methods were consistent with each other, the difference between estimated effects varied for different genes. For many identified core genes, the estimated total causal effects (from IDA) were very close to the effects derived from the univariate test. For example, ALDH2 was identified as a core gene for CAD after we incorporated BMI as a risk factor, the estimated causal effects from both IDA and jointIDA were approximate to the effect estimated from the univariate test. However, there still existed some core genes for which the estimated effects from our method were obviously different from that of the univariate test. For example, SENP6 was another identified core gene for CAD with BMI as a risk factor, the estimated effects the univariate test were significantly larger than the causal effects estimated from both IDA and jointIDA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>We proposed a novel framework (BN-GWAS) capable of identifying different types of causal genes and quantifying their total and direct causal effects on different traits, as well as eliminating spuriously associated genes confounded by actual core genes. Simulation results demonstrated the validity and efficacy of our proposed method in uncovering causally relevant genes and estimating their causal effects. It is worth noting that it consistently outperformed the commonly used univariate gene-based analysis in simulations.</p><p>While the univariate test was able to identify more disease genes, from our extensive simulations, the PPV (proportion of directly causal genes among the selected ones) is considerably higher under our proposed BN-GWAS framework. We also applied our BN-GWAS framework to 52 UKBB traits, and provide further insight into the genetic architecture of these traits. In addition, we conducted split-half validation and proposed stability selection for statistical inference. Importantly, we showed that genes identified by BN-GWAS are more strongly enriched for disease genes listed in an external database (OpenTargets), compared to the univariate test. BN-GWAS is also able to estimate the gene network involved in a particular disease/trait. Since many genes may have more than one action path to our studied traits, quantifying both the direct and indirect causal effects could help us comprehensively understand their influence on the development of certain diseases. Most importantly, these identified causal genes as well as the estimated causal effects may shed light on prioritizing new targets for therapeutic treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths of the proposed framework</head><p>The present framework has several strengths. A distinct advantage is that it is a unified framework that can estimate the overall causal structure/network of the studied genes and traits. The current approach allows one to estimate direct causal ('core'), indirect causal ('peripheral') and 'mediator' genes, which provides deeper insight into the genetic architecture of different diseases/traits. Such knowledge may also be very useful in prioritizing drug targets. Secondly, the proposed framework also allows the total, direct and mediating causal effects to be quantified, with confounding effects controlled for. Our newly proposed regularization approach was shown to further improve the effect estimates. Thirdly, our framework allows the overall causal structure/network to be estimated from different samples (GWAS data can be from one sample and expression data from an independent reference sample), which leverages the wide availability of GWAS data and dramatically improves the flexibility of the proposed method. Fourth, since the expression profiles were imputed from genotypes, reverse causality and unmeasured confounding (e.g., medication usage) can be much reduced. Furthermore, it can be potentially extended to more than one trait. While we focused on expression data in this study, the framework is general and can be applied to methylomic, proteomic, and other kinds of omics data to decipher their causal effects. In simulations, we showed that by increasing the sample size for inferring gene-gene connections, the performance of the method can be improved. Although we primarily employ GTEx as the reference dataset, one may use other reference datasets and our method may even be extended to single-cell data, which are usually of large sample sizes.</p><p>Apart from the above, external knowledge could be incorporated into the estimated causal networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other related approaches</head><p>Several methods have been developed to identify genes linked to complex traits based on GWAS.</p><p>However, their focus and methodology were different from the current work. For example, SMR (Summarydata-based Mendelian Randomization) was developed to combine GWAS and eQTL data to prioritize genes linked to a trait/disease based on principles of MR. Some top associated cis-eQTL could be in LD with two distinct causal variants, one affecting gene expression and the other affecting the trait of interest. To distinguish from pleiotropy (the same cis-eQTL affecting both expression and trait), Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> also developed the HEIDI test. Another closely related line of work is to 'impute' expression based on a reference dataset (e.g., GTEx), also known as TWAS (transcriptome-wide association study). Please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> for details.</p><p>The current work is different from the above in several ways. Firstly, one of our main aims is to produce a directed network uncovering links between genes and phenotypes, whereas the above methods focus on univariate associations. Here we present a unified framework that enables the total, direct and mediating effects of a single or any set of genes to be estimated, building on the principles of the Bayesian network and do-calculus for causal inference. We also propose ways to extend the approach to incorporate external knowledge (e.g., other pathways or protein-protein interaction databases), and analyze more than one clinical trait/disease. In addition, in MR (on which most current methods are based) a key assumption is that the instruments should be free from (imbalanced) horizontal pleiotropy, i.e., the instrument SNP(s) should not have its effects mediated through other pathways other than the exposure. It is hard to test this assumption in expression-based MR studies as the number of instrumental SNPs is often small. Also, SNPs in LD with the instrument SNP(s) can also have pleiotropic effects. While the HEIDI test can partially ameliorate the latter issue (also referred to as 'linkage'), it has its own limitations. For example, HEIDI was not designed for multiple causal variants at the locus, and pleiotropy and linkage cannot be distinguished. Here we tested for the association of each gene with the outcome, controlling for all possible subsets of other genes. A SNP can affect the outcome via other pathways other than through the exposure, but it is reasonable to believe that biologically it is common (although not always) that the instrumental SNP exerts its pleiotropic effect on the outcome via expression changes of some other genes (or via other downstream pathways/risk factors). By controlling for other genes in our model, we also reduce the chance of pleiotropic pathways affecting our result. The principle holds no matter whether the instrumental SNPs themselves exert pleiotropic effects or they are in LD with other variant(s) which show horizontal pleiotropy.</p><p>Another assumption of MR is that the instruments are not associated with measured or unmeasured confounders. In ordinary MR, it is possible that the SNP instruments, or those in LD with them, are associated with confounders such as other genes (e.g., a gene may lead to both expression changes in the studied gene and the outcome). Again, by controlling for expression of other genes, the risk of confounding can be reduced. Our approach is similar to multivariable MR (MVMR), but here we controlled for all possible subsets of other 'exposures'(genes) instead of performing a single MVMR. MVMR has been used</p><p>to control for confounders that may violate MR assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . The above study also shows that MVMR gives correct estimates of the direct causal effect no matter whether the covariates are confounders, mediators, or colliders.</p><p>Bayesian network (BN) has been used to infer gene regulatory networks and has been employed in several works <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> . Nevertheless, the main applications of BN were mainly concentrated on microarray/RNAseq data. A limitation is that typically only small sample sizes are available for a given disease, especially if the tissue of interest is hard to access (e.g., the brain). In addition, reverse causality is a concern as expression changes may be a result of the disease or medications. As a result, building a network integrating both gene-gene connections and clinical phenotypes is challenging. The presented framework allows gene expression and disease trait(s) to be estimated in different samples, greatly improving the flexibility and applicability of the approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A note on our two types of analysis with different number of genes modeled</head><p>Here we performed two sets of analyses, in which the first is restricted to around a hundred and fifty (or less) genes that are selected by PC-simple. With a smaller number of genes to model, the network can be constructed more accurately and visualized more readily, and with lower computational costs. A drawback is that there may be hidden confounders not modeled. Also, the genes selected by PC-simple are likely to have a relatively strong direct effect on the outcome, while genes with indirect causal effects (mediated by other genes) are unlikely to be included and modeled. We also conducted an analysis that includes a much large number of genes (~ 3000) whose expression can be imputed. Based on a previous study 64 , it was observed that IDA could discover top causal genes from expression studies much better than by chance and other methods with a large number of features (5,361) and a very modest sample size (N=63). The number of genes is smaller in our case, but the sample size is around 10 times higher. We therefore believe the method can perform reasonably well in identifying the top causal genes. The entire gene network may not be estimated very accurately compared to the case when the gene number is small, but IDA or jointIDA methods only require the local neighborhood of the network to be estimated accurately. When we model a larger number of genes, an advantage is that the risk of hidden confounders is further reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>There are a few limitations in this study. The correction estimation of IDA/jointIDA requires several assumptions, including that the variables should follow a multivariate normal distribution, and that the distribution of the variables should be faithful to the true underlying DAG. The latter (faithfulness assumption) is satisfied if the data is generated from a DAG with no hidden confounding variables. In practice, it is almost impossible to guarantee the lack of hidden confounders. Here we model the effects of genes on diseases/traits similar to a two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach in instrumental regression, in which instrument-predicted expressions were used, which substantially reduces the risk of confounding. We note that the instrumental SNPs may be associated with (unknown) confounders, which is a limitation.</p><p>However, we did not model one gene at a time but also considered a number of other genes. As explained earlier, the inclusion of other genes further reduced the risk of confounding as their effects can be controlled for. Another assumption is that the graph is acyclic, which is likely violated in real biological networks where feedback loops are often present. Nevertheless, previous applications on simulated data (simulated with loops and hidden variables) and yeast expression profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> showed that IDA is still able to perform reasonably well despite that the above assumptions may not fully hold in practice.</p><p>Genes whose expression cannot be reliably imputed are not included in estimating causal effects, but we argue that they are unlikely to be major confounders. This is because our assumption requires the instrumental SNPs to be uncorrelated with confounders, but genes without reliable imputed expressions are unlikely to have strong associations with existing eQTLs (i.e., the instruments).</p><p>As shown in our simulations, a larger sample leads to a more accurate estimation of causal effects. The current sample size of GTEx is still relatively modest, but larger eQTL consortiums (e.g., <ref type="url" target="https://www.eqtlgen.org/">https://www.eqtlgen.org/</ref>) are becoming available <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> , which may further improve the performance of our method in the future. We also note that the larger sample size is for estimation of gene-gene connections; we assume that the samples size is fixed at ~800 for the detection of eQTLs. As a result, if one may leverage larger reference transcriptome datasets, the performance can also be improved. This may be a direction for future work.</p><p>In view of the above limitations, we consider our framework a useful way to prioritize genes with relatively large causal or direct causal effects, and as a way to estimate the 'causal importance' of such genes. Experimental studies are required to further delineate the exact effects of the prioritized genes. We hope the current work will open a new avenue for a systems-based and causal inference-oriented approach to GWAS and omics analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Workflow of the proposed causal inference framework based on GWAS data</figDesc><graphic coords="6,57.60,467.96,479.74,199.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>

At the same time, there also existed a few genes which could regulate the related trait through multiple paths. In other words, some identified genes were both direct and indirect causal. Examples of these genes including CARD9, IL18RAP for C-reactive protein, PLTP for HDL, and HLA-DQB1 for LDL.</figDesc><graphic coords="21,124.07,208.86,346.85,378.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The presented framework also involves estimating expression from eQTLs, which share the advantages of MR, but we also model other genes in a BN and estimate causal effects by accounting for other genes. A distinct advantage is that we may also model the effect of mediating genes and direct causal effects, hence gaining insight into the mechanisms underlying the gene's effect on the phenotype(s). For example, gene A may exert its effect on the outcome via gene B, i.e., gene B is a mediator. The total causal effect of A and causal mediation effect via B can be obtained under the current framework, but not by existing methods like SMR or TWAS. Compared with standard mediation analysis method, our proposed methods (i.e., IDA and jointIDA) are more rigorous as they account for all confounding effects.</figDesc><table /></figure>
