<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Disease prediction based on electronic health records (EHRs) is essential for personalized healthcare. But it's hard due to the special data structure and the interpretability requirement of methods. The structure of EHR is hierarchical: each patient has a sequence of admissions, and each admission has some co-occurrence diagnoses. However, the existing methods only partially model these characteristics and lack the interpretation for non-specialists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>This work proposes a time-aware and co-occurrence-aware deep learning network (TCoN), which is not only suitable for EHR data structure but also interpretable: the co-occurrence-aware self-attention (CS-attention) mechanism and time-aware gated recurrent unit (T-GRU) can model multilevel relations; the interpretation path and the diagnosis graph can make the result interpretable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The method is tested on a real-world dataset for mortality prediction, readmission prediction, disease prediction, and next diagnoses prediction. Experimental results show that TCoN is better than baselines with 2.01% higher accuracy. Meanwhile, the method can give the interpretation of causal relationships and the diagnosis graph of each patient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>This work proposes a novel model-TCoN. It is an interpretable and effective deep learning method, that can model the hierarchical medical structure and predict medical events. The experiments show that it outperforms all state-of-the-art methods. Future work can apply the graph embedding technology based on more knowledge data such as doctor notes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are increasingly popular and widely used in hospitals for better healthcare management. A typical EHR dataset consists of much patient information, including demographic information and medical information. The medical information is an irregular hierarchical patient-visit-code (patientadmission-diagnosis) form, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a:</ref> (1) Each patient has many visit records as he/she may go to see a doctor many times. The visit records have corresponding time stamps and form a sequence; (2) Each visit contains many codes, which are usually disease diagnoses. The codes have the co-occurrence relation without order. For example, in a patient record, the chronic kidney disease is recorded after a cold record, but we can't conclude that the patient didn't have chronic kidney disease before he caught a cold. Two diagnoses have an uncertain time Open Access *Correspondence: sun_chenxi@pku.edu.cn 1 School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, No. 5 Yiheyuan Road, Beijing 100871, People's Republic of China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article relation. We call such issues as the co-occurrence relation, such as complication, causation, and continuity. Thus, EHR has both the time relation and the co-occurrence relation.</p><p>Medical tasks such as disease prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, concept representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, and patient typing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are essential for personalized healthcare and medical research. Nevertheless, the tasks are challenging for physicians, considering the complex patient states, the amount of diagnosis, and the real-time requirement. Thus, a datadriven approach by learning from large accessible EHRs is the desiderata.</p><p>In recent years, the Deep Learning (DL) model has made remarkable achievements due to its strong learning ability and flexible architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: some DL methods can model the sequential time relation of medical data. For example, RETAIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> utilizes gated recurrent unit (GRU) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> to predict medical events, Dipole <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> uses Bidirectional RNN (BRNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to integrate the information in the past and the feature, and T-LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> injects the time decay effect to handle irregular time intervals. Using these methods, the EHR structure is modeled as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>; Some DL methods can model the cooccurrence relation of medical data. For example, Word-2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, Med2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and MiME <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> model the medical relations to better express the original data by the idea of representation learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Using these methods, the EHR structure is modeled as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>.</p><p>However, no method can model both relations simultaneously. Because t there is a conflict between the two relations: The time relation makes data distributed longitudinally but the co-occurrence relation makes data distributed bipartite graph-like. If considering both these two relations, the EHR structure is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the real-world application, the datadriven method is required to be interpretable to facilitate the use of doctors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, the DL method is the black-box model which is troubled by poor interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>To address the above issues, in this work, we define EHR as the hierarchical co-occurrence sequence and propose a novel model called Time-aware and Co-occurrence-aware Network (TCoN). TCoN can not only model the two relations simultaneously but also has the ability of interpretation. TCoN has the pre-train and fine-tune mechanism for the imbalanced data and is more accurate than all baselines in medical prediction tasks.</p></div>

CS-attention has two different heads-Local Head and Global Head. The local head learns the co-occurrence relations between every two codes in the same visit. A code is affected by the other codes equally. The global head learns the co-occurrence relations between every two codes in different visits.

For a prediction P , the last visit is v n . In v n , we find the code c ni that contributed the most to v n according to ∼ β . For c ni , we find the closest code c (n-1)i in visit v n-1 according to the largest α * C ni . Similarly, we find c (n-2)i , c (n-3)i , . . . c 1i . So far, we find a path c 1i → • • • → c ni → P .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prediction results</head><p>TCoN predicts more accurately than all baselines. The results of binary classification (mortality, readmission, sepsis, and heart failure) and multi-classification (next diagnoses) are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>(a, b). Baselines may not match EHR characteristics and partially model data features. For example, T-LSTM has the worst performance as it is not suitable for short visit sequences like MIMIC-III. TCoN performs well on imbalanced datasets. In binary classification tasks, all datasets are imbalanced, especially the sepsis dataset (6.16%). But the results show that the more imbalanced the data, the greater the advantage of TCoN over baselines.</p><p>TCoN can accurately predict multiple diagnoses in the next admission. In the multi-classification task, we evaluate methods with k = 5, 15, 25, 35. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2b</ref>, as k increases, the accuracies of all methods decrease, but the advantage of our approach is still obvious.</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref> is the heat map of α for the death prediction. The diagnosis 'hypoxemia' contributes the most to the last admission as its weighted vector's norm is the biggest. For 'hypoxemia' , the closest diagnosis is 'pulmonary collapse' with the biggest α * i = 0.892 . For 'pulmonary collapse' , the closest diagnosis is 'unspecified pleural effusion' with the biggest α * i = 0.803 . And for 'unspeci- fied pleural effusion' , the closest diagnosis is 'unspecified sleep apnea' with the biggest α * i = 0.782 . So far, an inter- pretation path 'unspecified sleep apnea -&gt; unspecified pleural effusion -&gt; pulmonary collapse -&gt; Hypoxemia -&gt; death' is found as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4c</ref> shows cases of interpretation paths of sepsis prediction and heart failure prediction. Each path is the summary results by using the most frequent diagnosis. Thus, we find sepsis-related pre-diagnoses/symptoms, such as 'Fever' , 'Chills' , 'Immunity disorders' , ' Anemia' and 'Coma' . And we find heart failure-related pre-diagnoses/ symptoms, such as 'Ventricular fibrillation' , 'Myocarditis' , 'Coronary atherosclerosis' and 'Hypertension' .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In recent years, deep learning (DL) technology has shown its superior performance in medical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, such as medical image recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and medication recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. And many methods have achieved good performance for specific disease prediction, such as Alzheimer's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, sepsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and heart disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. However, most of them pursue the task accuracy but ignoring the interpretability. DL-based approaches are black-box models, which is not easy to understand for non-professionals, especially doctors without artificial intelligence backgrounds. Thus, the explainable DL method is needed. This study aims at this problem and puts forward a solution, interpretation path, to make the predictions explainable.</p><p>In EHR, the patient's records are irregular in time due to the unpredictability of the diseases and inevitable data loss. The current disease could be more closely related to the disease a week ago than the disease a year ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Thus, the time perception mechanism is needed. This study aims at this issue and proposes a time gate to explicitly learn the irregular time information by the time decay function.</p><p>The experiments show that using two kinds of head for relations of inter-visit and intra-visit is necessary. The difference between these two relations is not just the time interval, but also the pathology. We emphasize the code relations are more likely to be complications in the same visit, but causations and continuities among different visits. For example, in our experiments, the relation of 'diabetes' with 'cellulitis and abscess of legs' in one visit is more prone to be a short-term complication, but the relation of 'diabetes' and 'long-term use of insulin' in two different visits is more prone to be causation. Thus, for each patient, we can give a disease association graph. The weight of the edges between two diagnoses in the same admission represents the adjoint coefficient, and the weight of the edges between two diagnoses in different admissions represents the causal coefficient. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the diagnosis graph case of patient 32,790.</p><p>The interpretation path is not symmetrical, which means</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">α ij = α ji . α ij = # of i-j occurrences</formula><p>#of i occurrences and α ji = # of i-j occurrences # of j occurrences , they have different denominators. For example, code i , j , k represent the diagnoses of 'malaria' , 'fever' , 'periodic cold fever' respectively. In our experiment, i is mostly accompanied by j as α ij = 0.762 . But j is not always accompanied by i as α ji = 0.023 . It is mostly accompanied by code k with α ki = 0.701 . Com- paring α ji and α ki , the results show that 'periodic cold fever' is a better explanation for 'malaria' than 'fever' . In research <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, 'periodic cold fever' is a special clinical manifestation of 'malaria' and there are very few other diseases with this symptom. It illustrates that our interpretable method can explain the results by reflecting the relation (such as complication, causation, and continuity) between the diagnoses and α * i is a more important stand- ard to find the maximum co-occurrence code for i than α i * .</p><p>In medical applications, the data is usually imbalanced. The normal state of patients is the majority, while the disease records may be the small sample. But the small sample is more important for the disease prediction. Thus, a DL model should be robust on the imbalanced dataset. In this paper, our pre-train and fine-tune framework can help.</p><p>Further, there is room for further improvement. The current modeling method is based on pure EHRs data. Integrating prior information will make the results of the data relation modeling and medical prediction more accurate and reasonable. The available method is knowledge graph embedding based on ICD code. Besides, more data in EHRs such as doctor notes, medications, and laboratory tests can be used for better performance. Future work will focus on these aspects.</p></div>

It consists of a set of records R = {r i |i = 1, . . . , M} with M patients P . Each record r i has a visit sequence V = {v i |i = 1, . . . , N } mapped in time. For each (See figure on next page.)

The data form b arranges codes in a random order, but different sequences have different effects on results. For example, the sequence 'heart disease -&gt; influenza -&gt; coronary' has closer relation between 'heart disease' and 'influenza' than the sequence 'heart disease -&gt; coronary -&gt; influenza' . The data form c can make every two codes have the equal relation, but if 'heart disease' , 'atrial fibrillation' and 'diabetes' are in three different visits, the equal relation will fail as there are different time intervals among them. The data form d is the combination. it describes both the equal code relation in the same visit and the time relation in different visits</figDesc></figure>
