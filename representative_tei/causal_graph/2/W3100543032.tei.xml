<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Graphical models have become an important tool for the statistical analysis of complex multivariate data sets, which are now increasingly available in many scientific fields. The key feature of these models is to merge the probabilistic concept of condi-tional independence with graph theory by representing possible dependences among the variables of a multivariate distribution in a graph. This has led to simple graphical criteria for identifying the conditional independence relations that are implied by a model associated with a given graph. Further important advantages of the graphical modelling approach are statistical efficiency due to parsimonious parameterisations of the joint distribution of the variables and the visualization of complex dependence structures, which allows an intuitive understanding of the interrelations among the variables and, thus, facilitates the communication of statistical results. For an introduction to graphical models we refer to the monographs by Whittaker <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, Edwards <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and Cox and Wermuth <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; a mathematically more rigorous treatment can be found in Lauritzen <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>While graphical models originally have been developed for variables that are sampled with independent replications, they have been applied more recently also to the analysis of time dependent data. Some first general remarks concerning the potential use of graphical models in time series analysis can be found in Brillinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>; since then there has been an increasing interest in the use of graphical modelling techniques for analyzing multivariate time series (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>). However, all these works have been restricted to the analysis of linear interdependences among the variables whereas the recent trend in time series analysis has shifted towards non-linear parametric and non-parametric models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>). Moreover, in most of these approaches, the variables at different time points are represented by separate nodes, which leads to graphs with theoretically infinitely many vertices for which no rigorous theory exists so far.</p><p>In this paper, we present a general approach for graphical modelling of multivariate stationary time series, which is based on simple graphical representations of the dynamic dependences of a process. To this end, we utilize the concept of strong Granger causality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>), which is formulated in terms of conditional independences and, thus, can be applied to model arbitrary non-linear relationships among the variables. The concept of Granger causality originally has been introduced by Granger <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and is commonly used for studying dynamic relationships among the variables in multivariate time series.</p><p>For the graphical representations, we consider mixed graphs in which each variable as a complete time series is represented by a single vertex and directed edges indicate possible Granger-causal relationships among the variables while undirected edges are used to map the contemporaneous dependence structure. We note that similar graphs have been used in Eichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> as path diagrams for the autoregressive structure of weakly stationary processes or-without undirected edges-in Didelez <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for graphical modelling of time-continuous composable finite Markov processes based on the concept of local independence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Formally, the graphical encoding of the dynamic structure of a time series is achieved by a new type of Markov properties, which we call Granger-causal Markov properties. We introduce various levels, namely the pairwise, the local, the block-recursive, and the global Granger-causal Markov property, and discuss the relationships among them. In particular, we give sufficient conditions under which the various Granger-causal Markov properties are equivalent; such conditions allow formulating models based on a simple Markov property while interpreting the associated graph by use of the global Granger-causal Markov property.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the concepts of Granger-causal Markov properties and graphical time series models; some examples of graphical time series models are presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we discuss global Markov properties, which relate certain separation properties of the graph to conditional independence or Granger noncausality relations among the variables of the process. Finally in Sect. 5, we compare the presented graphical modelling approach with other approaches in the literature and discuss possible extensions. The proofs are technical and put into the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Graphical time series models</head><p>In graphical modelling, the focus is on multivariate statistical models for which the possible dependences between the studied variables can be represented by a graph. In multivariate time series analysis, statistical models for a time series X V = (X V (t)) t∈Z are usually specified in terms of the conditional distribution of X V (t + 1) given its past X V (t) = (X V (s)) s≤t in order to study the dynamic relationships over time among the series. Thus, a time series model may be described formally as a family of probability kernels P from R V ×N to R V , and we write X V ∼ P if P is a version of the conditional probability of X V (t + 1) given X V (t).</p><p>For modelling specific dependence structures, we utilize the concept of Granger (non-)causality, which has been introduced by Granger <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and has proved to be particularly useful for studying dynamic relationships in multivariate time series. This probabilistic concept of noncausality from a process X a to another process X b is based on studying whether at time t the next value of X b can be better predicted by using the entire information up to time t than by using the same information apart from the former series X a . In practice, not all relevant variables may be available and, thus, the notion of Granger causality clearly depends on the used information set. In the sequel, we use the concept of strong Granger noncausality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>), which is defined in terms of conditional independence and σ -algebras and, thus, can be used also for non-linear time series models.</p><p>Let X V = (X V (t)) t∈Z with X V (t) = (X v (t)) v∈V ∈ R V be a multivariate stationary stochastic process on a probability space (Ω, F , P). For A ⊆ V , we denote by X A = (X A (t)) t∈Z the multivariate subprocess with components X a , a ∈ A. The information provided by the past and present values of X A at time t ∈ Z can be represented by the sub-σ -algebra X A (t) of F that is generated by X A (t) = (X A (s)) s≤t . We write X A = (X A (t), t ∈ Z) for the filtration induced by X A . This leads to the following definition of strong Granger noncausality in multivariate time series; for ease of notation, we subsequently usually drop the attribute "strong".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.1</head><p>Let A and B be disjoint subsets of V .</p><p>(i) X A is strongly Granger-noncausal for X B with respect to the filtration X V if</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X B (t + 1) ⊥ ⊥ X A (t) | X V \A (t)</formula><p>for all t ∈ Z. This will be denoted by X</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A X B [X V ].</formula><p>(ii) X A and X B are contemporaneously conditionally independent with respect to the filtration X V if</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X A (t + 1) ⊥ ⊥ X B (t + 1) | X V (t) ∨ X V \(A∪B) (t + 1)</formula><p>for all t ∈ Z. This will be denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X A X B [X V ].</formula><p>Intuitively, the dynamic relationships of a stationary multivariate time series X V can be visualized by a mixed graph G = (V, E) in which each vertex v ∈ V represents one component X v and two vertices a and b are joined by a directed edge a -→ b whenever X a is Granger-causal for X b or by an undirected edge a --b whenever X a and X b are contemporaneously conditionally dependent. Conversely, for formulating models with specific dynamic dependences, a mixed graph G can be associated with a set of Granger noncausality and contemporaneous conditional independence constraints that are imposed on a time series model for X V . Such a set of conditional independence relations encoded by a graph G is generally known as Markov property with respect to G. In the context of multivariate time series, graphs may encode different types of conditional independence relations, and we therefore speak of Granger-causal Markov properties when dealing with Granger noncausality and contemporaneous conditional independence relations. In the following definition, pa(a) = {v ∈ V |v -→ a ∈ E} denotes the set of parents of a vertex a, while ne(a) = {v ∈ V |v --a ∈ E} is the set of neighbours of a; furthermore, for A ⊆ V , we define pa(A) = ∪ a∈A pa(a)\A and ne(A) = ∪ a∈A ne(a)\A. </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">V with a = b (i) a -→ b / ∈ E ⇒ X a X b [X V ], (ii) a ---b / ∈ E ⇒ X a X b [X V ]; (LC) the local Granger-causal Markov property with respect to G if for all a ∈ V (i) X V \(pa(a)∪{a}) X a [X V ], (ii) X V \(ne(a)∪{a}) X a [X V ]; (BC) the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property with respect to G if for all subsets A of V (i) X V \(pa(A)∪A) X A [X V ], (ii) X V \(ne(A)∪A) X A [X V ].</formula><p>Similarly, if P is a probability kernel from R V ×N to R V , we say that P satisfies the pairwise, the local, or the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property with respect to a graph G whenever the same is true for every stationary process X V with X V ∼ P.</p><p>Example 2.1 To illustrate the various Granger-causal Markov properties, we consider the graph G in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Suppose that a stationary process X V satisfies the pairwise Granger-causal Markov property with respect to this graph G. Then the absence of the edge 1 -→ 4 in G implies that X 1 is Granger-noncausal for X 4 with respect to X V . Next, in the case of the local Granger-causal Markov property, we find that the bivariate subprocess X {1,2} is Granger-noncausal for X 4 with respect to X V since vertex 4 has parents 3 and 5. Similarly, if X V obeys the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property, the graph encodes that X {1,2} is Granger-noncausal for X {4,5} with respect to X V since pa(4, 5) = {3}.</p><p>The block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property obviously implies the other two Granger-causal Markov properties and, thus, is the strongest of the three Markov properties; similarly, the pairwise Granger-causal Markov property clearly is the weakest of the three properties. The question arises whether and under which conditions the three Granger-causal Markov properties are equivalent. In the case of random vectors Y V = (Y v ) v∈V with values in R V , the various levels of Markov properties for graphical interaction models are equivalent if the distribution of Y V satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Y A ⊥ ⊥ Y B | Y C∪D ∧ Y A ⊥ ⊥ Y C | Y B∪D ⇒ Y A ⊥ ⊥ Y B∪C | Y D (2.1)</formula><p>for all disjoints subsets A, B, C, and D of V <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. A necessary and sufficient condition for this intersection property is that the information common to Y B∪D and Y C∪D equals the information provided by Y D . More precisely, let (Ω, F , P) be the underlying probability space and let Y S be the sub-σ -algebra generated by Y S , S ⊆ V . Furthermore, we denote the σ -algebra generated by Y S and the P-null sets in F by Y S . Then the above intersection property holds if and only if Y C∪D ∩ Y B∪D = Y D <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>; we say that Y C∪D and Y B∪D are measurable separable conditionally on Y D . For more details on measurable separability we refer to Appendix A and the references therein.</p><p>In order to ensure validity of the intersection property in the time series case, we impose the following condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(S) for all subsets A, B, C of V, X A (t) and X B (t) are measurably separable condi- tionally on X A∩B (t) ∨ X C (t -k) for all k ∈ N and t ∈ Z.</formula><p>Here,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">X A∩B (t) ∨ X C (t -k) denotes the smallest σ -algebra generated by X A∩B (t) ∪ X C (t -k).</formula><p>The condition implies that for every F -measurable random variable Z and all t ∈ Z,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Z ⊥ ⊥ X A (t) | X B∪C (t) ∧ Z ⊥ ⊥ X B (t) | X A∪C (t) ⇔ Z ⊥ ⊥ X A∪B (t) | X C (t). (2.2)</formula><p>In the case of random vectors Y V , a commonly used sufficient condition for the intersection property and thus for conditional measurable separability is that the joint distribution of Y V is absolutely continuous with respect to some product measure and has a positive and continuous density (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr">Prop. 3.1]</ref>). The following result establishes a similar condition in terms of conditional distributions for the time series case; it requires an additional regularity condition on partial tail-σ -algebras <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Proposition 2.1 Let X V = (X V (t)) t∈Z be a strictly stationary stochastic process on some probability space (Ω, F , P) taking values in R V and suppose the following two conditions hold:</p><p>(P) the conditional distribution P X V (t+1)|X V (t) , t ∈ Z, has a regular version that is almost surely absolutely continuous with respect to some product measure ν on R |V | with ν-a.e. positive and continuous density;</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(M) for all A ⊆ V and t ∈ Z k∈N X A (t) ∨ X V \A (t -k) = X A (t).</formula><p>Then the process X V satisfies condition (S).</p><p>For an interpretation of condition (M), we note that it is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">lim k→∞ E (Z | X A (t) ∨ X B (t -k)) = E (Z | X A (t))</formula><p>for all random variables Z and subsets A, B ⊆ V <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Thus condition (M) implies that the process X V is conditionally weakly mixing. For many types of non-linear time series stronger forms of mixing-but not conditional mixing-have been established (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>). We believe that the above condition of conditional mixing is satisfied by most stationary time series models but a discussion of this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>The intersection property now allows us to derive the following relations among the three Granger-causal Markov properties. Theorem 2.1 Suppose that X V satisfies condition (S). Then the three Granger-causal Markov properties (BC), (LC), and (PC) are related by the following implications:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(BC) ⇒ (LC) ⇔ (PC).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Furthermore, if X V additionally satisfies the composition property X</head><formula xml:id="formula_12">A X B [X V ] ⇔ X A X b [X V ] ∀b ∈ B, (2.3)</formula><p>then the three Granger-causal Markov properties (BC), (LC), and (PC) are equivalent.</p><p>The theorem shows that, similarly as in the case of chain graph models with the Andersson-Madigan-Perlman (AMP) Markov property <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the pairwise and the local Granger-causal Markov property are in general not sufficiently strong to encode all Granger-causal relationships that hold among the components of a multivariate time series with respect to full information X V . This suggests to specify graphical time series models in terms of the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2.3 (Graphical time series model)</head><p>Let G be a mixed graph and let P G be a statistical time series model given by a family of probability kernels P ∈ P G from R V ×N to R V . Then P G is said to be a graphical time series model associated with the graph G if, for all P ∈ P G , the distribution P satisfies the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property with respect to G.</p><p>The three Granger-causal Markov properties considered so far encode only Granger noncausality relations with respect to the complete information X V . The discussion of phenomena such as spurious causality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>), however, requires also the consideration of Granger-causal relationships with respect to partial information sets, that is, with respect to filtrations X S for subsets S of V . To this end, we introduce in Sect. 4 a global Granger-causal Markov property that more generally relates pathways in a graph to Granger-causal relations among the variables, and we establish, under condition (S), its equivalence to the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property; this shows that the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property is indeed sufficiently rich to describe the dynamic dependence structure in multivariate time series.</p><p>Before we continue our discussion of Markov properties in Sect. 4, we illustrate the introduced concept of graphical time series models by a few examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Examples</head><p>In the previous section, graphical time series models have been defined in terms of the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property. For many time series models, however, condition (2.3) in Theorem 2.1 holds, and, hence, the pairwise, the local, and the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property are equivalent. This enables us to derive the constraints on the parameters from the pairwise or the local Granger-causal Markov property.</p><p>There are no simple conditions known that are both necessary and sufficient for (2.3). The following proposition lists some sufficient conditions that cover many examples, as will be shown subsequently. Proposition 3.1 Suppose that X V satisfies condition (S) and one of the following conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(i) X V is a Gaussian process; (ii) X v (t + 1), v ∈ V ,</formula><p>are mutually contemporaneously independent, that is, the joint conditional distribution factorizes as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P X V (t+1) | X V (t) = ⊗ v∈V P X v (t+1) | X V (t) ∀t ∈ Z;</formula><p>(iii) X V (t + 1) depends on its past only in its conditional mean, that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">X V (t + 1) -E [X V (t + 1) | X V (t)] ⊥ ⊥ X V (t) ∀t ∈ Z.</formula><p>Then the three Granger-causal Markov properties (BC), (LC), and (PC) are equivalent.</p><p>We note that processes satisfying condition (ii) can be described by directed graphs, that is, graphs without undirected edges. Thus the proposition implies that for directed graphs the pairwise and the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property are always equivalent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Nonlinear autoregressive models</head><p>As a first example, we consider the general class of multivariate nonlinear autoregressive models given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">X V (t) = f V (X V (t -1), . . . , X V (t -p)) + ε V (t),</formula><p>where f V is an R V -valued Borel measurable function on R p×V and ε V = (ε V (t)) t∈Z is a sequence of independent and identically distributed zero mean random vectors with density q V and such that ε V (t) is independent of X V (t -1). Such models have been considered by many authors; in particular, conditions on f V and q V that guarantee geometric ergodicity and thus strong mixing of X V have been established (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>). We note, however, that currently there are no conditions known that ensure the conditional mixing condition (M). An exception are Gaussian autoregressive processes that will be briefly discussed below.</p><p>For the general class of multivariate nonlinear autoregressive models, the constraints imposed by a graph G are best formulated in terms of the local Granger-causal Markov property. More precisely, X V satisfies the local Granger-causal Markov property with respect to G if for all a ∈ V <ref type="bibr">(t)</ref>, which is equivalent to X a and X V \(ne(a)∪{a}) being contemporaneously conditionally independent with respect to X V as required by the local Granger-causal Markov property. Since X V (t) depends on its past X V (t -1) only in its conditional mean, it follows from Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 3.1(iii) that the local and the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov properties are equivalent, that is, the above conditions on f V and q V define indeed a graphical nonlinear autoregresssive model of order p associated with the graph G.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(L1) f a (X V (t -1), . . . , X V (t -p)) = f a X pa(a)∪{a} (t-1), . . . , X pa(a)∪{a} (t-p) ; (L2) q V factorizes as q V (z V ) = g a z ne(v)∪{a} h a (z V \{a} ). The second condition implies ε a (t) ⊥ ⊥ ε V \(ne(a)∪{a}) (t) | ε ne(a)</formula><p>The general class of multivariate nonlinear autoregressive models covers many interesting and important models, of which we discuss only the following three.</p><p>(a) Vector autoregressive (VAR) model Suppose that X V is a stationary Gaussian process given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">X V (t) = p u=1 Φ(u) X V (t -u) + ε V (t), ε V (t) iid ∼ N (0, Σ), (<label>3.1)</label></formula><p>where Φ(u) are V × V matrices and the variance matrix Σ is non-singular with inverse K = Σ -1 .

Furthermore, let</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">f (λ) = (2π) -1 Φ(e -iλ ) -1 Σ Φ(e -iλ ) -1 , λ ∈ [-π, π], be the spectral density matrix of X V , where Φ(z) = I V -Φ(1) z -• • • -Φ( p) z p and I V is the V × V identity matrix.</formula><p>Then, if the eigenvalues of f (λ) are bounded and bounded away from zero uniformly for all λ ∈ [-π, π], the process X V satisfies the separability condition (S) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma A.2]</ref>. (b) Self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model: A stochastic process X V is said to follow a multivariate SETAR model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">if for each a ∈ V X a (t) = p u=1 b∈V φ (n) ab (u) X b (t -u) + ε a (t) if X a (t -d) ∈ I a,n ,</formula><p>where {I a,1 , . . . , I a,N } is a partition of R, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ε V (t) iid ∼ Q V , say. Then X V obeys the local Granger-causal Markov property with respect to a graph G = (V, E) if, for a = b, φ (n) ab (u) = 0 for all n = 1, . . . , N and u = 1, . . . , p whenever b -→ a /</formula><p>∈ E and Q V has density q V satisfying condition (L2). (c) Nonparametric additive autoregressive model: A very useful class of nonparametric autoregressive models, which avoid the "curse of dimensionality", are the additive models given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">X a (t) = p u=1 b∈V f (u) ab (X b (t -u)) + ε a (t), a ∈ V, t ∈ Z,</formula><p>where f (u) ab are real-valued functions on R.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(i) Constant conditional correlations:</head><p>The constant conditional correlation model of Bollerslev <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> provides the most parsimonious parametrisation of Σ(t). The conditional variances are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">σ aa (t) = σ 0 aa + q u=1 k∈pa(a)∪{a} α a k (u)X k (t -u) 2 ,</formula><p>whereas the conditional covariances are determined by the set of equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">σ ab (t) = σ aa (t) 1/2 σ bb (t) 1/2 ρ ab if a ---b ∈ E, K ab (t) = 0 i f a ---b / ∈ E.</formula><p>Here K (t) = Σ(t) -1 is the inverse conditional covariance matrix. (ii) Constant conditional correlations with interaction: In this parametrisation the conditional variance σ aa (t) additionally depends on interaction terms X k (tu)X l (tu) if k and l are both parents of a. Thus the conditional variance can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">σ aa (t) = σ 0 aa + q u=1 k,l∈pa(a)∪{a}:k&lt;l α a kl (u)X k (t -u)X l (t -u).</formula><p>The entries σ ab (t) have the same form as in (i). (iii) Vector ARCH model: In the general vector ARCH model due to Kraft and Engle <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, also the correlation between the components of X V (t) may depend on the past values of X V . This leads to conditional covariances σ ab (t), a ≤ b, of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">σ ab (t) = σ 0 ab + q u=1 k,l∈P ab :k&lt;l α ab kl (u)X k (t -u)X l (t -u) if a = b or a ---b ∈ E, where P ab = (pa(a) ∪ {a}) ∩ (pa(b) ∪ {b}), while the conditions K ab (t) = 0 for a = b and a ---b / ∈ E remain unchanged.</formula><p>For the constant conditional correlation models it is easy to derive conditions to ensure that the conditional covariances are positive definite almost surely for all t. In contrast, such conditions are difficult to impose and verify for the vector ARCH model. Therefore Engle and Kroner <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> suggested an alternative representation for the multivariate ARCH(q) model in which Σ(t) is guaranteed to be positive definite almost surely for all t. In this so-called BEKK representation, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> the conditional covariances of a graphical ARCH model are parametrised by</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">σ ab (t) = σ 0 ab + N n=1 q u=1 k,l∈P ab :k&lt;l α (n) ka (u)α (n) lb (u)X k (t -u)X l (t -u).</formula><p>In this form it is immediately clear that if σ ab (t) depends on the past of X k then at least one of the conditional variances σ aa (t) and σ bb (t) must also depend on X k .</p><p>Although less obvious the same can be shown for the vector ARCH model in the original parametrisation noting that the conditional covariance matrix Σ(t) must be positive definite. Hence graphical vector ARCH models fulfill condition (2.3). For the constant conditional correlation model condition (2.3) is trivially fulfilled.</p></div>

Suppose that the data consist of the recorded spike trains for a set of neurons, that is, of the sequences of firing times (τ v,n ) n∈N for neurons v ∈ V , and let X v be the binary time series obtained by setting X v (t) = 1 if neuron v has fired in the interval [t, t + 1) and X v (t) = 0 otherwise. We assume that the hypothesized neural pathways between the observed neurons can be depicted by a purely directed graph G; in particular, we thus exclude the possibility that the dependences among the observed neurons are affected by unmeasured confounders. Then the interactions between the neurons can be modelled by the conditional probabilities</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">P X b (t) = 1 X V (t -1) = Φ ⎛ ⎝ a∈pa(b) U ba (t) -θ ⎞ ⎠ , (<label>3.2)</label></formula><p>where Φ(x) denotes the normal cumulative function, measures the influence of process a on process b, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">U ba (t) = γ b (t) u=1 g ba (u) X a (t -u) (3.3) (a) (b)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_32">γ b (t) = min u ∈ N X b (t -u) = 1</formula><p>is the time elapsed since the last event of process X b .

Then the pairwise and the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property are equivalent by Proposition 3.1(ii) and, thus, we can use the former for modelling dependences between the processes.

This implies that the process X V satisfies the pairwise Granger-causal Markov property with respect to the graph (a) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. On the other hand, X k Granger-causes the subprocess (X 1 , X 2 ) since the bivariate conditional distribution of (X 1 (t), X 2 (t)) depends on the value of X 3 (t -1) through the conditional correlation ρ(t). Thus X V obeys the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property with respect to the graph (b) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, but not with respect to the graph (a). We note that the example can be easily generalized by considering models where the conditional variances var(X a (t) X V (t -1)), a ∈ V , and the conditional correlation matrix corr(X V (t), X V (t) X V (t -1)) are modelled separately as functions of the past values X V (t -1), . . . , X V (tp).</p><p>Next, consider the trivariate process X V given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">X 1 (t) = f (X 2 (t -1)) + ε(t), X 2 (t) = g(X 3 (t -1)), X 3 (t) = η(t),</formula><p>where ε(t) and η(t) are independent sequences of i.i.d. random variables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Global Markov properties</head><p>The interpretation of graphs describing the dependence structure of graphical models in general is enhanced by global Markov properties that merge the notion of conditional independence with a purely graph theoretical concept of separation allowing one to state whether two subsets of vertices are separated by a third subset of vertices. In this section, we show that the concept of p-separation introduced by Levitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> for chain graph models with the AMP Markov property <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> can be used to obtain global Markov properties in the present context of graphical time series models. Throughout this section we assume that condition (S) in Sect. 2 holds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The global AMP Markov property</head><p>We start with some further graphical terminology. Let G = (V, E) be a mixed graph. Then a path π between two vertices a and b in G is a sequence π = e 1 , . . . , e n of edges e i ∈ E such that e i is an edge between v i-1 and v i for some sequence of vertices v 0 = a, v 1 , . . . , v n = b. The vertices a and b are the endpoints of the path, while v 1 , . . . , v n-1 are the intermediate points on the path. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> we do not require that the points v j on a path π are distinct; this means that paths in general may be self-</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">intersecting. A path π in G is called a directed path if it is of the form a -→ • • • -→ b or a ←-• • • ←-b.</formula><p>Similarly, if π consists only of undirected edges it is called an undirected path. Furthermore, a path π is a subpath of π if π = e i , e i+1 , . . . , e j-1 , e j for some 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.</p><p>An intermediate point c on a path π is said to be a p-collider on the path if the edges preceding and suceeding c on the path either have both an arrowhead at c or one has an arrowhead at c and the other is a line, i.e. -→ c ←-, -→ c ---, --c ←-; otherwise the point c is said to be a p-noncollider on the path. Notice that this classification only applies to the intermediate points of a path π ; the endpoints are neither p-colliders nor p-noncolliders. We also note that a vertex can take different roles in different positions on a path: for example, on the path 1 -→ 3 ←-2 -→ 3 -→ 4 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, vertex 3 appears both as a p-collider and a p-noncollider.</p><p>A path π between vertices a and b is said to be p-connecting given a set S if (i) every p-noncollider on the path is not in S, and (ii) every p-collider on the path is in S, otherwise we say the path is p-blocked given S. In graphs encoding Markov properties of variables, p-connecting paths are exactly those paths inducing associations between the variables; conversely, if there are no p-connecting paths the corresponding variables are independent. This leads to the following definition. We note that the above conditions for p-separation are simpler than those in Levitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> due to the fact that we consider the larger class of all possibly selfintersecting paths. The equivalence of the two notions of p-separation is shown in Appendix D. The following results show that the concept of p-separation can be applied to graphs encoding dynamic relationships in multivariate time series and allows reading off conditional independences among the stochastic processes that are represented by the vertices in the graph.</p></div>

All other paths between 1 and 5 contain the subpath 2 ←-4 ←-5 and, thus, are blocked by vertex 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The global Granger-causal Markov property</head><p>In this section, we apply the concept of pathwise separation to the problem of deriving general Granger noncausality relations from mixed graphs. To motivate the approach, we firstly consider the graphical VAR(1) model of all trivariate stationary processes</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">X V = (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ) given by X 1 (t) = φ 11 X 1 (t -1) + φ 12 X 2 (t -1) + ε 1 (t), X 2 (t) = φ 22 X 2 (t -1) + φ 23 X 3 (t -1) + ε 2 (t), (4.1) X 3 (t) = φ 33 X 3 (t -1) + ε 3 (t)</formula><p>for t ∈ Z with independent and standard normally distributed errors ε V (t), t ∈ Z.</p><p>The associated graph G that encodes the restrictions imposed on the model consists simply of the path 3 -→ 2 -→ 1, which is p-connecting given the empty set. This indicates that the components X 1 and X 3 are, in general, not independent in a bivariate analysis. However, an intuitive interpretation of the directed path 3 -→ 2 -→ 1 suggests that X 3 Granger-causes X 1 but not vice versa if only the bivariate process X {1,3} is considered. Indeed, the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property implies that X 3 (t + 1) ⊥ ⊥ X {1,2} (t) | X {3} (t), from which it follows by decomposition (see Appendix A) that X 1 is Granger-noncausal for X 3 with respect to X {1,3} . Obviously, the p-separation criterion is too strong for establishing this Granger-noncausality relationship between X 3 and X 1 since it requires that all paths between the two vertices are p-blocked whereas it seems sufficient that only certain paths, namely those ending with an arrowhead at vertex 3, are p-blocked. This suggests the following definitions. A path π between two vertices a and b in G is said to be b-pointing <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> if it has an arrowhead at the endpoint b. More generally, a path π between two disjoint subsets A and B is said to be B-pointing if it is b-pointing for some b ∈ B.</p><p>For the derivation of contemporaneous conditional independences, we also need to consider paths with arrowheads at both endpoints; such paths π will be called bipointing. Furthermore, let π = π 1 , . . . , π n be a composition of paths π i that are undirected or bi-pointing. Then π is said to be an extended bi-pointing path. In particular, this implies that any undirected or bi-pointing path is also an extended bi-pointing path; similarly, the composition π = π 1 , π 2 of two extended bi-pointing paths π i is again extended bi-pointing. Moreover, every extended bi-pointing path π is of the form π = u 1 , β, u 2 for some paths u 1 , u 2 , and β of possibly length zero, where u 1 and u 2 are undirected paths and β is a bi-pointing path (hence the term 'extended bi-pointing'). With these definitions, we define the following global Granger-causal Markov property, which gives a path-oriented criterion for deriving general Granger noncausality relations from a mixed graph.</p></div>

In Example 4.1, we have seen that vertices 1 and 4 are not p-separated given S = {3}, that is, X 1 and X 4 are in general not conditionally independent given X 3 . We now employ the global Granger-causal Markov property to examine the dynamic relationships between the components X 1 and X 4 further.</p><p>We start by examining the 4-pointing paths between 1 and 4. Straightforward considerations show that all 4-pointing paths end with either 3 -→ 4, 3 -→ 5 -→ 4, or 2 ←-4 ←-5 -→ 4; three instances of such paths are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. The paths ending with either 3 -→ 4 or 3 -→ 5 -→ 4 are clearly p-blocked by vertex 3 whereas the paths ending with 2 ←-4 ←-5 -→ 4 are p-blocked by vertex 4. It follows that every 4-pointing paths between 1 and 4 is p-blocked by {3, 4} and thus X 1 does not Granger-cause X 4 with respect to X {1,3,4} . Similarly, we can examine all extended bi-pointing paths between vertices 1 and 4 to show that X 1 and X 4 are contemporaneously conditionally independent with respect to X {1,3,4} . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> shows three examples of such paths: the first two are p-blocked by vertex 3 (notice that on the second path, the vertex 3 is once a p-collider and once a p-noncollider) whereas the last path is p-blocked by vertices 3 and 4. For similar reasons as above, these three paths are exemplary for all extended bi-pointing paths between 1 and 4, and we conclude that X 1 and X 4 are indeed contemporaneously conditionally independent with respect to X {1,3,4} .</p><note type="other">123</note><p>Finally, we note that every 1-pointing path between 4 and 1 must end with the directed edge 3 -→ 1. Since this edge has a tail at vertex 3, every such path must be p-blocked given S = {1, 3}, which implies that X 4 does not Granger-cause X 1 with respect to X {1,3,4} .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>In this paper, we discussed a graphical modelling approach for multivariate time series that is based on mixed graphs in which each vertex represents one complete component series while the edges in the graph reflect possible dynamic interdependencies among the variables of the process. The constraints imposed by the graphs are formulated in terms of strong Granger noncausality and, thus, allow modelling arbitrary non-linear dependencies. The graphical modelling approach can help to reduce the number of parameters involved in modelling high-dimensional non-linear time series while encoding the constraints on the parameters in a simple graph, which is easy to visualize and allows an intuitive understanding of the dependencies in the model.</p><p>We have shown that the interpretation of these graphs, which for many models are built only from pairwise Granger noncausality relations, is enhanced by so-called global Markov properties, which relate separation properties of the graph to conditional independence or Granger noncausality statements about the process. In this paper, we have used the path-oriented concept of p-separation, which allows us to attribute Granger-causal relationships among the variables to certain pathways in the graphs.</p><p>Our objective has been to provide a general framework for modelling the dynamic interdependencies in multivariate time series; in particular, we focused on a simple graphical representation, which has been achieved by representing each component of a multivariate time series by a single vertex in the associated graph. The approach presented here, however, is not the only possible, and since the first papers on the application of graphical models in time series analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, there has been an increasing interest in the topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. All these approaches are basically restricted to the analysis of linear interdependencies, and most of them repre-sent each variable at each time point by a separate vertex in the associated graph. In the following, we briefly compare our approach with alternative graphical representations and point out possible extensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modelling processes of variables at separate time points</head><p>A more detailed modelling of dependencies among the components of a vector time series can be achieved by representing each random variable X v (t) by a different vertex v t , say, in a graph G. This alternative approach has been discussed, for example, by Reale and Tunnicliffe Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, Dahlhaus and Eichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and Moneta and Spirtes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. On the one hand, it leads to a more flexible class of graphical models and has the advantage that many of the concepts and methods that have been developed for the multivariate case carry over to the time series case. On the other hand, the increased flexibility leads to (sometimes much) larger graphs, which easily can become unwieldy and difficult to interpret, and it clearly also aggrevates the model selection problem. Moreover, the underlying graph for such graphical time series models theoretically has infinitely many vertices, and it is not immediately clear how to prune this graph to a finite representation while preserving the Markov properties. In contrast, Lemma D.1 provides a simple local criterion that restricts the search for p-connecting paths in the type of graphs considered in this paper.</p><p>Apart from these theoretical and practical issues, we think that a high level of detail as provided by these models is not always wanted nor always appropriate. We give two examples. Firstly, Baccalá and Sameshima <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposed a frequency-domain approach for the discussion of Granger-causal relationships based on the concept of partial directed coherence. Although this approach still requires the fitting of VAR models, the identification of interactions is performed in the frequency-domain and hence only relations on the level of Granger noncausality can be identified. The results in Baccalá and Sameshima <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> were summarized by path diagrams associated with the identified VAR model as discussed in Eichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Our approach of representing each time series by one single vertex in the graph provides a theoretical framework for such frequency-domain based analyses.</p><p>Secondly, multivariate time series are often obtained by high-frequency sampling of continuous-time processes such as EEG-recordings or neural spike trains. Here, our approach yields a graphical representation of the interrelationships that does not depend (to some extent) on the sampling frequency (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Moreover, many sophisticated models that have been proposed, for example, for analysing neural activity do not show a dependence on the past values only at specific lags. For instance, in the binary time series model discussed in Example 3.3, the conditional distribution of X b (t) given the past history X V (t -1) depends on another process X a through the past values X a (t -1), . . . , X a (t -γ b (t)), where γ b (t) is the time elapsed since the last event of process X b . In other words, the number of lagged variables X a (tu) on which X b (t) depends varies over time depending on the past of X b itself. Consequently, it seems inappropriate to break down the dependence of X a (t) on X b (t) further into dependencies of X a (t) on X b (tu) as required by the detailed modelling approach.</p></div>

Consequently, the class of graphical time series models for which the pairwise and the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov properties are equivalent would be smaller under the alternative approach based on contemporaneous independence. Alternatively, if modelling is to be based on m-separation, one might consider use of an adapted variant of the connected set Markov property as in Drton and Richardson <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> instead of the pairwise Markov property.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-loops</head><p>In this paper, we have focused on modelling and analysing the interrelationships in multivariate time series. Therefore, we have not considered the possibility of directed self-loops v -→ v, which could be used to impose additional constraints of the form X B (t + 1) ⊥ ⊥ X B (t) | X V \B (t) on a model. We note that, for a discussion of the dynamic interrelationships among variables, these self-loops are irrelevant. In fact, it can be shown that two disjoint sets A and B are p-separated given S in a graph with self-loops if and only if they are also p-separated given S in the same graph with all self-loops removed. Similar statements can be formulated for pointing and extended bi-pointing paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-stationary time series</head><p>One of our main assumptions has been that the considered multivariate time series are stationary. This assumption, however, has been made mainly for the sake of simplicity, and the graphical modelling approach presented can be extended easily also to the case of non-stationary time series by requiring that the Granger noncausality and contemporaneous conditional independence constraints encoded by a graph hold at all time points in an interval T ⊆ Z, say; in that case, we say that the time series obeys a Granger-causal Markov property with respect to the graph over the time interval T . This allow us to consider non-stationary time series models in which the pattern of dependencies remains fixed whereas the strength of the dependencies may change over time. An interesting extension would be models where also the graphical structure changes at certain times. For instance, Talih and Hengartner <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> consider covariance selection models for multivariate time series where changes in the dependence structure occur at random times; this approach, however, does not model dynamic dependencies among the variables. Finally, we note that, despite their practical relevance, non-stationary models have attracted much less-particularly theoretical-interest than stationary models due to the involved inferential problems.</p><p>Two important issues have not been addressed in this paper. Firstly, in many applications there is little prior knowledge about the causal relationships between the variables, and empirical methods have to be used to find an appropriate graphical model. This step of model selection is hampered by the large number of possible models by which an exhaustive search becomes infeasible even for moderate dimensions. Therefore, model search strategies are required to lessen the computational burden.</p><p>A second issue, which is related to the problem of model selection, is the identification of causal effects. It is clear from the definition of Granger causality that we may conclude from Granger causality to the existence of a causal effect only if all relevant variables are included in a study, whereas the omission of important variables can lead to spurious causalities. However, Hsiao <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> noted that such spurious causalities may vanish if the information set is reduced. In other words, two processes that both satisfy the pairwise causal Markov property with respect to a graph G may exhibit different Granger noncausality relations with respect to partial information sets due to the presence or absence of spurious causalities. Some concepts as to how this observation could be exploited for causal inference have been discussed in Eichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>Let F i , i = 1, . . . , 4 be sub-σ -algebras of F .

The sets of parents, children and neighbours of a vertex a are denoted as pa(a), ch(a), and ne(a), respectively.

If all edges of π are edges in G, π is also p-connecting given S in G. Thus, we may assume that there exist edges in π, e j 1 , . . . , e j m say, that do not occur in G. These edges e j k are necessarily undirected since all directed edges in G [an(A∪B∪S)] also occur in G. Let e j k = v j k ---v j k +1 . Then by definition of the marginal graph there exists an undirected path φ j k between v j k -1 and v j k which bypasses an(A ∪ B ∪ S)\{v j k -1 , v j k } and therefore is p-connecting given S. Replacing all edges e j k in π by the corresponding paths φ j k we obtain a new path π which connects A and B in G. This path π is also p-connecting given S since the replacement of e j k by the undirected and p-connecting path φ j k does not change the p-collider resp. p-noncollider status of the points v j k -1 and v j k .</p><p>Conversely for sufficiency, let π = e 1 , . . . , e n be a p-connecting path between A and B given S in G. Then all edges in π with both endpoints in an(A ∪ B ∪ S) also occur in G [an(A∪B∪S)] since G an(A∪B∪S) is a subgraph of G [an(A∪B∪S)] . We firstly show that the endpoints of any directed edge e j in π are in an(A ∪ B ∪ S). Let e j = v j -→ v j+1 (the case e j = v j ←-v j+1 is treated similarly). Then there exists a directed subpath e j , . . . , e j+r of maximal length such that either v j+r is an endpoint of π and, thus, in A∪ B or e j+r +1 is of the form v j+r ---v j+r +1 or v j+r ←-v j+r +1 . In the latter case v j+r is a p-collider and, thus, in S since π is p-connecting given S.

For the proof of the second part, let U = A ∪ B ∪ S and assume that every extended bi-pointing path between A and B is p-blocked given U . This includes in particular all bi-pointing paths π between a ∈ A and b ∈ B, which are of the form π = e 1 , π, e n , where e 1 and e n are directed edges a ←p a and p b -→ b, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7a</ref>). Then π is p-blocked given U if and only if p a ∈ U, p b ∈ U , or π is p-blocked given U . This implies that, if all bi-pointing paths between A and B are p-blocked given U, pa(A)\U and pa(B)\U are p-separated given U .</p><p>Next, we seek to find subsets S A and S B of S such that all extended bi-pointing paths between the enlarged sets A ∪ S A and B ∪ S B are still p-blocked given U . Then, by the same argument as above, pa(A ∪ S A )\U and pa(B ∪ S B )\U are p-separated given U . As an example, consider the extended bi-pointing path in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7b</ref> and suppose that For a formal definition of the sets S A and S B , we first set S 0 = {s ∈ S|pa(s) ⊆ U }, which in particular includes all s ∈ S that have no parents. Then adding any vertex in S 0 to either S A or S B to either A∪ S A or B ∪ S B will not increase the sets pa(A ∪ S A )\U or pa(B ∪ S B )\U .Therefore, we set For a formal argument, we need to define the sets S A and S B slightly differently. More precisely, let S 0 = {s ∈ S|pa(s) ⊆ U }, which in particular includes all s ∈ S that have no parents. Furthermore, let S A be the set of all s ∈ S\S 0 such that every extended bi-pointing path between s and B is p-blocked given U and set S B = S\(S 0 ∪ S A ). Notice that for all s ∈ S B there exists an extended bi-pointing path between s and B that is p-connecting given U . We show that every extended bi-pointing path between A ∪ S A and B ∪ S B is p-blocked given U . Since all extended bi-pointing paths between A ∪ S A and B must be p-blocked by assumption on A and B or by definition of S A , we only have to show that all extended bi-pointing paths between A ∪ S A and S B are p-blocked given U . Suppose to the contrary that π is an extended bi-pointing path between A ∪ S A and s ∈ S B that is p-connecting given U . Then, as mentioned above, there exists a p-connecting extended bi-pointing path π s between s and B. If s is a p-collider on the composed extended bi-pointing path π = π, π s then π is p-connecting given U contradicting the assumption about A and B. Otherwise, if s is a p-noncollider, the two adjacent edges must be undirected (i.e. --s ---) because extended bi-pointing paths never have a tail at either endpoint. Since s / ∈ S 0 there exists a path π = π, s ←-v -→ s, π s with v ∈ pa(s)\U . The two instances of s on π that are adjacent to v are p-colliders and π thus is p-connecting given U . Since π is composed of extended bi-pointing paths, it is itself an extended bi-pointing path. Thus, by definition of S A , π must have endpoints in A and B, which contradicts again the assumption about A and B.</p><p>Since in particular all bi-pointing paths between A ∪ S A and B ∪ S B are p-blocked given U , we have Moreover, since undirected paths are special cases of extended bi-pointing paths, we find that every undirected path between A ∪ S A and B ∪ S B intersects S 0 . Then, by a standard argument of graph theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemma 3.3.3]</ref>), there exists a partition (A * , B * , S 0 ) of V such that A ∪ S A ⊆ A * , B ∪ S B ⊆ B * , and every undirected path between A * and B * intersects S 0 ; in particular, this implies ne(A ∪ S A ) ⊆ S 0 .

Now, suppose that π is a B-pointing path between A and B with some intermediate points in B. Then π can be partitioned as π = π 1 , π 2 where π 1 is a path between A and some b ∈ B with no intermediate points in B. Because of the assumption, the path π 1 is p-blocked given S and, since it has no intermediate point of π 0 and π 1 . Noting that π 0 is already a trail, we continue to partition π 1 in the same way. After finitely many steps, we obtain the partition π = π 0 , λ 1 , π 1 , λ 2 , . . . , π r -1 , λ r , π r such that the subpaths π j are all trails. Thus, the shortened path π = π 0 , . . . , π r is also a trail. We show that π is a p-active trail relative to S. We firstly note that all subtrails π j are p-connecting and hence p-active. We therefore have to show that the vertices u j i satisfy the conditions for a p-active trail.</p><p>Suppose that u j i is a p-collider that is not in S. Then at least one of the edges adjacent to u j i has an arrowhead at u j i and we may assume that π i-1 is u j i -pointing (otherwise consider the reverse path). Since u j i / ∈ S, it must be a p-noncollider on π and hence λ i starts with a tail at u j i . On the other hand, since u j i must be a p-noncollider on all its occurrences on π and π i does not start with a tail, the loop λ i cannot be a directed path (otherwise u j i would not be a p-collider on λ i , π i ). Consequently there exists an intermediate point w i such that the subpath between u j i and w i is directed and w i is a p-collider. It follows that w i ∈ S and u j i ∈ an(S).</p><p>Next, suppose that u j i is a p-noncollider on π that is in S. Since u j i has been a p-collider on π , the two edges adjacent to u j i on π must be undirected and λ i must be a bi-pointing path. Hence λ i is of the from λ i = u j i ←-w i , λ i with w i / ∈ S (since w i is a p-noncollider and π is p-connecting). Therefore, the set pa(u j i )\S is not empty and u j i satisfies the above condition (ii). Altogether it follows that π is p-active relative to S.</p><p>In a remark on our simplified version of p-separation, Levitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> argue that there are infinitely many possibly self-intersecting paths in a graph as opposed to finitely many trails. The following lemma shows that it is possible to restrict the search for p-connecting paths in G to a finite number of paths, namely all paths in which no edge occurs twice with the same orientation. Lemma D.1 Let G = (V, E) be a mixed graph and suppose that π is a p-connecting path of the form π = π 1 , e, π 2 , e, π 3 , where e is an oriented edge between some vertices u and v.

For any subσ -algebra H of F , H denotes the completed σ -algebra generated by H and the P-null sets in F . Thus the sets in the completed σ -algebra H are still measurable sets in F . Next, let F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 be sub-σ -algebras of F . The smallest σ -algebra generated by F i ∪ F j is denoted as F i ∨ F j . Then F 1 and F 2 are said to be independent conditionally on F 3 if E(X |F 2 ∨ F 3 ) = E(X |F 3 ) a.s. for all real-valued, bounded, F 1 -measurable random variables X . Using the notation of Dawid <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> we write F 1 ⊥ ⊥ F 2 | F 3 <ref type="bibr">[P]</ref> or F 1 ⊥ ⊥ F 2 | F 3 if the reference to P is clear.</p><p>Proposition A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Suppose that X V is a stochastic process such that conditions (M) and (P) hold.

Accordingly, we have by the definition of conditionally measurable separability</p><p>for all t ∈ Z and k ∈ N. Since the σ -algebras on both sides are monotonically decreasing as k increases, this yields for k → ∞ k&gt;0 Because of Lemmas B.1 and B.2, it is often sufficient in the proofs to consider only the case of A p B | S with S = V \(A ∪ B). In this case, p-separation can be characterized in terms of pure-collider paths-paths on which every intermediate node is a collider-or in terms of local configurations (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma C.1 Suppose that X V satisfies the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property with respect to the mixed graph G, and let U ⊆ V .

We first note that, since an(U ) is an ancestral set and, thus, contains the parents of all its subsets A, the parents of A in both graphs are the same, that is, P = pa G (A) = pa H (A). By the blockrecursive Granger-causal Markov property of X V with respect to G, X V \(P∪A) does not Granger-cause X A with respect to X V , which by (CI2) implies that X an(U )\(P∪A) is Granger-noncausal for X A with respect to the smaller filtration X an(U ) as required by the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property of X an(U ) with respect to H .</p><p>Next, let N = ne H (A). Then A and an(U )\(N ∪ A) are separated by N in H u , that is, a and b are not adjacent in the undirected subgraph H u whenever a ∈ A and b ∈ an(U )\(N ∪ A).

By the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property, it follows that</p><p>and, with (CI2) and (CI3),</p><p>Combining these two relations by using (CI2) to (CI4), we find that X an(U )\(N ∪A) and X A are contemporaneously conditionally independent with respect to X an(U ) as required by the block-recursive Granger-causal Markov property of X an(U ) with respect to the graph H .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D: p-Separation in mixed graphs</head><p>The definition of p-separation presented in this paper is based on paths that may be self-intersecting. This leads to simpler conditions than in the original definition by Levitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The latter is formulated in terms of paths on which all intermediate points are distinct, that is, these paths are not self-intersecting; such paths are called trails. According to Levitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, a trail between vertices a and b is said to be p-active relative to S if (i) every p-collider (head-no-tail node) on π is in an(S), and (ii) every p-noncollider v is either not in S or it has two adjacent undirected edges (---v ---) and pa(v)\S = ∅.</p><p>Otherwise the trail is p-blocked relative to S.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposition D.1 Let G = (V, E) be a mixed graph and A, B, S disjoint subsets of V .

If all p-colliders on π are in S and all p-noncolliders are outside S, then π is also p-connecting given S. Otherwise, π is p-blocked by vertices u j 1 , . . . , u j r on the path. If u j i is a p-collider then u j i ∈ an(S) since π is p-active. Hence there exists a directed path τ i = u j i -→ • • • -→ s i for some s i ∈ S such that all intermediate points on τ i are not in S and we set σ i = τ i , τi , where τi denotes the reverse path of τ i , that is, τi = s i ←-• • • ←u j i . On the other hand, if u j i is a p-noncollider on π , then the two edges adjacent to u j i are undirected. Thus, there exists w i ∈ pa(u j i )\S and we set σ i = u j i ←-w i -→ u j i . Now, let π i be the subpath of π between u j i-1 and u j i with u j 0 = a and u j r +1 = b and set π = π 0 , σ 1 , π 1 , σ 2 , . . . , π r -1 , σ r , π r .</p><p>Then all p-colliders on π are in S and all p-noncolliders are not in S, which yields that π is p-connecting given S.</p><p>Conversely, suppose that π is a p-connecting path between a and b given S.
