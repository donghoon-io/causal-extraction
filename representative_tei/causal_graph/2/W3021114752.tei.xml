<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Wolfram Model, which is a slight generalization of the model first introduced by Stephen Wolfram in A New Kind of Science (NKS), is a discrete spacetime formalism in which space is represented by a hypergraph whose dynamics are determined by abstract replacement operations on set systems, and in which the conformal structure of spacetime is represented by a causal graph. The purpose of this article is to present rigorous mathematical derivations of many key properties of such models in the continuum limit, as first discussed in NKS, including the fact that large classes of them obey discrete forms of both special and general relativity. First, we prove that causal invariance (namely, the requirement that all causal graphs be isomorphic, irrespective of the choice of hypergraph updating order) is equivalent to a discrete version of general covariance, with changes to the updating order corresponding to discrete gauge *</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Perhaps the single most significant idea conveyed within Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>,</p><p>and the initial intellectual seedling from which the contents of the book subsequently grow, is the abstract empirical discovery that the "computational universe" -that is, the space of all possible programs -is far richer, more diverse and more vibrant than one might reasonably expect. The fact that such intricate and complex behavior can be exhibited by computational rules as apparently elementary as the Rule 30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>[3] and Rule 110 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>[5] cellular automata, which are so straightforward to represent that they can easily be discovered by systematic enumeration, is profoundly counterintuitive to many people. However, once one has truly absorbed and internalized this realization, it leads to an exceedingly tantalizing possibility: that perhaps, lying somewhere out there in the computational universe, is the rule for our physical universe <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. If an entity as remarkable as Rule 30 could be found just by an exhaustive search, then perhaps so too can a theory of fundamental physics. The idea that there could exist some elementary computational rule that successfully reproduces the entirety of the physical universe at first seems somewhat absurd, although there does not appear to be any fundamental reason (neither in physics, nor mathematics, nor philosophy) to presume that such a rule could not exist. Moreover, if there is even a remote possibility that such a rule could exist, then it's slightly embarrassing for us not to be looking for it. The objective of the Wolfram Physics Project is to enact this search.</p><p>Conducting such a search is far from straightforward, since (more or less by definition) any reasonable candidate for our universe will inevitably be rife with computational irreducibility. Definite lower bounds on the degree of computational irreducibility in the laws of physics were first conjectured by Wolfram <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and one such bound was proved recently by the author <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, with the corollary that there exists an infinite class of classical physical experiments with undecidable observables. Furthermore, explicit complexity-theoretic bounds have also been recently demonstrated by the author for the case of a discrete spacetime formalism, in collaboration with Shah <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>If one wants to construct a minimal model for the physical universe, then a cellular automaton is clearly an inappropriate formalism, as it already contains far too much inbuilt structure (such as a rigid array of cells, an explicit separation of the notion of space from the notion of states of cells, etc.). In NKS, Wolfram argued that a more suitable model for space would be a collection of discrete points, with connections defined between them in the form of a trivalent graph; laws of physics can then be represented by transformation rules defined on this graph (i.e. rules which replace subgraphs with other subgraphs, in such a way as to preserve the total number of outgoing edges). More recently, we have discovered that a slightly more general approach is to model space as a hypergraph, and hence to define transformation rules as replacement operations on set systems; an example of such a transformation rule is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">1</ref>, and an example of its evolution is shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">1</ref>: An example of a possible replacement operation on a set system, visualized as a transformation rule between two hypergraphs (which, in this particular case, happen to be equivalent to ordinary graphs). Adapted from S. Wolfram, A Class of Models with Potential to Represent Fundamental Physics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The present article begins by outlining a basic mathematical definition of the Wolfram Model and its causal structure (in terms of discrete causal graphs) in Section 2.1, before proceeding to formalize these definitions using the theory of abstract rewriting systems from mathematical logic in Section 2.2, and discussing some connections to λ-calculus and category theory. Section 2.3 builds upon these formalizations to develop a proof that causal invariance (namely, the requirement that all causal graphs be isomorphic, irrespective of the choice of hypergraph updating order) is equivalent to a discrete form of general covariance, with changes to the updating order corresponding to discrete gauge transformations. This fact allows one to deduce a discrete analog of Lorentz covariance, and the resultant physical consequences of discrete Lorentz transformations, as demonstrated in Section 2.4, using techniques from the theory of automated theorem-proving.</p><p>In Section 3.1, we introduce a discrete analog of the Ricci scalar curvature (namely the Ollivier-Ricci curvature for metric-measure spaces) for hypergraphs, and prove that the correction factor for the volume of a discrete ball in a spatial hypergraph corresponding to curved space of fixed dimensionality is trivially proportional to the Ollivier-Ricci curvature. We subsequently introduce discrete notions of parallel transport, holonomy, sectional curvature, the Riemann curvature tensor and the spacetime Ricci curvature tensor in Section 3.2, and use these notions to prove the corresponding result for volumes of discrete spacetime cones in causal graphs corresponding to curved spacetimes of fixed dimensionality, demonstrating that the correction factors are now proportional to timelike projections of the discrete spacetime Ricci tensor. In Section 3.3, we use this fact, along with the assumption that the updating rules preserve the dimensionality of the causal graph in limiting cases, to prove that the most general set of constraints on the discrete spacetime Ricci tensor correspond to a discrete form of the Einstein field equations, using an analogy to the Chapman-Enskog derivation of the continuum hydrodynamics equations from discrete molecular dynamics.</p><p>Finally, in Section 3.4, we discuss a potential formalism for general relativity in hypergraphs of varying local dimensionality, using techniques from algebraic topology and geometric group theory, and the implications that this formalism may have for inflationary cosmology and the value of the cosmological constant.</p><p>2 Space, Time and Causality in the Wolfram Model</p></div>

The essential idea here is to model space as a large collection of discrete points which, on a sufficiently large scale, resembles continuous space, in much the same way as a large collection of discrete molecules resembles a continuous fluid. A geometry can then be induced on this collection of points by introducing patterns of connections between them, as defined, for instance, by a hypergraph or set system. Here, a hypergraph denotes a direct generalization of an ordinary graph, in which (hyper)edges can join an arbitrary number of vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Definition 1 A "spatial hypergraph", denoted H = (V, E), is a finite, undirected hypergraph, i.e: E ⊆ P (V ) \ {∅},<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P (V ) denotes the power set of V .</p><p>We assume henceforth that all hypergraphs are actually multihypergraphs, in the sense that E is actually a multiset, thus allowing for hyperedges of arbitrary multiplicity.</p><p>Note that, for many practical purposes, it suffices to consider a special case of the more general hypergraph formulation, in which space is simply represented by a trivalent graph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Definition 2 A "trivalent spatial graph", denoted G = (V, E)</formula><p>, is a finite, undirected, regular graph of degree</p></div>

In other words, the evolution history for an arbitrary candidate universe will, in most cases, correspond to a directed acyclic graph (known as a "multiway system"), rather than a single path. A simple example of such a multiway system, corresponding to the evolution of an elementary string substitution system, is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>. However, it turns out that there exist many situations in which one is able to mitigate this problem, and effectively obtain deterministic evolution of the hypergraph, by considering only replacement rules that exhibit a particular abstract property known as "confluence", as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Abstract Rewriting, the Church-Rosser Property and Causal Invariance</head><p>Firstly, one is able to make the notions of update rules and transformations between hypergraphs more mathematically rigorous, by drawing upon the formalism of abstract rewriting systems in mathematical logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Definition 5 An "abstract rewriting system" is a set, denoted A (where each element of A is known as an "object"), equipped with some binary relation, denoted →, known as the "rewrite relation".</p><p>Concretely, a → b designates a replacement rule, indicating that object a can be replaced with (or rewritten as) object b.</p><p>More generally, there may exist situations in which two objects, a and b, are connected not by a single rewrite operation, but by some finite sequence of rewrite operations, i.e: In other words, → * is the smallest preorder that contains →, or the smallest binary relation that contains</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">a → a → a → • • • → b → b,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>→ and also satisfies both reflexivity and transitivity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a → * a, and a → * b, b → * c =⇒ a → * c.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The concept of "confluence" allows us to formalize the idea that some objects in an abstract rewriting system may be rewritten in multiple ways, so as to yield the same eventual result:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Definition 7 An object a ∈ A is "confluent", if: ∀b, c ∈ A, such that a → * b and a → * c, ∃d ∈ A such that b → * d and c → * d.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Definition 8 An abstract rewriting system A is (globally) "confluent" (or exhibits the "Church-Rosser property") if every object a ∈ A is confluent.</p><p>Thus, within a (globally) confluent rewriting system, every time there exists an ambiguity in the rewriting order, such that distinct objects b and c can be obtained by different rewrite sequences from some common object a, those objects can always be made to reconverge on some common object d after a finite number of rewriting operations. (Global) confluence is demonstrated explicitly for four elementary string substitution systems in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. The notion of confluence hence allows us to assuage the reader's potential fears regarding the potentially ambiguous ordering of update operations on spatial hypergraphs. If we consider only confluent hypergraph replacement rules, then, for any apparent divergence in the spatial hypergraphs that one obtains by following different paths of the multiway system (i.e. any divergence resulting from ambiguity in the ordering of the update operations), there will always exist a new path in the multiway system (i.e. a new sequence of update operations) which causes that ambiguity to disappear. We can formalize this notion by stating that confluence is a necessary condition for such rules to exhibit an asymptotic property known as "causal invariance": Definition 9 A multiway system is "causal invariant" if the causal graphs that it generates (i.e. the causal graphs generated by following every possible path in the multiway graph, corresponding to every possible updating order) are all, eventually, isomorphic as directed, acyclic graphs.</p><p>A pair of simple but nontrivial string substitution systems exhibiting causal invariance is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>.</p><p>There are some subtleties here, since the definition of (global) confluence only guarantees that the rewrite sequences b → * d and c → * d must exist for a given b, c, but it does not guarantee anything about their potential length. As such, the paths that one must follow in order to obtain convergence may be arbitrarily long, so although causal invariance necessitates that the causal graphs generated by following every path through the multiway system must eventually become isomorphic, those causal graphs are not guaranteed to be isomorphic after any finite number of update steps. As such, causal invariance is best interpreted as a limiting statement about the global structure of the multiway system.</p><p>Outside of the theory of abstract rewriting systems, there are many equivalent ways to formalize these notions of update rules, confluence, causal invariance, etc. For instance, one can formulate a categorytheoretic version of the same ideas, by first considering the rewrite relation → of the abstract rewriting system (A, →) to be an indexed union of subrelations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">→ 1 ∪ → 2 =→ . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>This system is mathematically equivalent to a labeled state transition system, (A, Λ, →), with Λ being the set of indices (labels), and this system is itself simply a bijective function from A to the powerset of A indexed by Λ, i.e. P (Λ × A), given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">p → {(α, q) ∈ Λ × A : p → α q}.<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Now, using the fact that the power set construction on the category of sets is a covariant endofunctor, the state transition system is an F-coalgebra for the functor P (Λ × (-)). Then, the more general case in which → is not an indexed union of subrelations, which corresponds to an unlabeled state transition system, is simply the case in which Λ is a singleton set. Therefore, in general, if P is considered to be an endofunctor on the category Set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P : Set → Set,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>then the system (A, →) is the object A equipped with a morphism of Set, denoted →:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">→: A → PA.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Statements about confluence and convergences between states in the multiway system thus translate into purely category-theoretic statements regarding limits of functors and the relationship between cones and co-cones (which can be thought of as being, respectively, the category-theoretic analogs of the notions of critical pair divergence and convergence in abstract rewriting theory) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>There exist certain weakenings of the property of (global) confluence, including "local confluence", in which only objects which diverge after a single rewrite operation are required to reconverge:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∀b, c ∈ A, such that a → b and a → c, ∃d ∈ A such that b → * d and c → * d,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>and "semi-confluence", whereby one object is obtained by a single rewrite operation and the other is obtained by an arbitrary rewrite sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∀b, c ∈ A, such that a → b and a → * c, ∃d ∈ A such that b → * d and c → * d.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>There are also various strengthenings, such as the strong "diamond property", in which objects that diverge after a single rewrite operation are also required to reconverge after a single rewrite operation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∀b, c ∈ A, such that a → b and a → c, ∃d ∈ A such that b → d and c → d,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>and "strong confluence", whereby, for two objects which diverged after a single rewrite operation, one is required to converge with a single rewrite operation (or no rewrite operations at all), whilst the other can converge via an arbitrary rewrite sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">∀b, c ∈ A, such that a → b and a → c, ∃d ∈ A such that b → * d and (c → d or c = d) .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>These properties, and their relation to the critical pair lemma in mathematical logic, are believed to be of foundational relevance to the derivation of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory within the Wolfram Model, as outlined in the accompanying publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>The property of global confluence is often referred to as the Church-Rosser property for largely historical reasons; Alonzo Church and J. Barkley Rosser proved in 1936 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that β-reduction of λ terms in the λcalculus is globally confluent. In other words, if one considers the operation of replacing bound variables in the body of an abstraction as being a rewrite operation of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">((λx.M ) E) → (M [x := E]) . (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>then two λ terms are equivalent if and only if they are joinable. Here, "equivalence" of terms x and y refers to the binary operation x ↔ * y, which is the reflexive transitive symmetric closure of →, or the smallest equivalence relation containing → (otherwise described as the transitive closure of ↔ ∪ =, where ↔ denotes the symmetric closure of →, i.e. → ∪ → -1 ). Moreover, "joinability" refers to the binary operation x ↓ y, which designates the existence of a common term z to which x and y are both reducible:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">∀x, y, x ↓ y ⇐⇒ ∃z such that x → * z ← * y.<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Having shown that (global) confluence is a necessary condition for causal invariance, we now proceed to prove that causal invariance implies an appropriately discretized form of general covariance, from which one is able to deduce both special and general relativity (in the form of Lorentz covariance and local Lorentz covariance, respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Causal Graph Hypersurfaces and Discrete Lorentz Covariance</head><p>The first essential step in the derivation of special relativity for causal-invariant Wolfram Model systems is to make precise the formal correspondence between directed edges connecting updating events in a discrete causal graph, and timelike-separation of events in a continuous Minkowski space (or, more generally, in a Lorentzian manifold). In doing this, it is helpful first to introduce a canonical method for laying out a causal graph in Euclidean space, which can be defined as an optimization problem of the following form <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>[22]:</p><p>Definition 10 A "layered graph embedding" is an embedding of a directed, acyclic graph in the Euclidean plane, in which edges are represented as monotonic downwards curves, and in which crossings between edges are to be minimized.</p><p>The ideal case of a layered graph embedding, which is not guaranteed to exist in general, would be a so-called "downward planar embedding":</p><p>Definition 11 A "downward planar embedding" is an embedding of a directed, acyclic graph in the Euclidean plane, in which edges are represented as monotonic downwards curves without crossings.</p><p>In the standard mathematical formalism for special relativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, one starts by considering the (n + 1)dimensional Minkowski space R 1,n , in which every point p is a spacetime event (specified by one time coordinate and n spatial coordinates). If one now considers performing a layered graph embedding of a causal graph into the discrete "Minkowski lattice" Z 1,n , then one can label updating events by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">p = (t, x) ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where t ∈ Z is a discrete time coordinate, and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">x = (x 1 , . . . , x n ) ∈ Z n ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>are discrete spatial coordinates.

In the ADM formalism, one decomposes a 4-dimensional spacetime (consisting of a manifold and a Lorentzian metric) by foliating it into a parameterized family of non-intersecting spacelike hypersurfaces; it is fairly straightforward to extend this notion to the case of discrete causal graphs:</p><p>Definition 15 A "discrete spacetime" is any pair (M, g), where M is a discrete metric space (taken to be the discrete analog of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold), and g is a discrete Lorentzian metric of signature (Note that the mathematical details of how such a discrete Lorentzian metric tensor can be explicitly obtained are outlined in the next section.)</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">(-+ ++).</formula><p>Definition 16 A "discrete Cauchy surface" is a discrete spacelike hypersurface, i.e a set of updating events:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Σ ⊂ M,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>with the property that every timelike or lightlike (i.e. null) path through the causal graph, without endpoints (taken to be the discrete analog of a smooth timelike or lightlike curve), intersects an updating event in Σ exactly once .</p><p>We proceed on the assumption that our spacetime is globally discretely hyperbolic, in the sense that there exists some universal "time function":</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">∃t : M → Z,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>with non-zero gradient everywhere:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">∆t = 0 everywhere,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>such that our spacetime can be discretely foliated into non-intersecting level sets of this function, and that the collection of such level sets successfully covers the entire spacetime, i.e. the level surfaces t = const. are discrete hypersurfaces, with the property:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">∀t 1 , t 2 ∈ Z, Σ t1 = {p ∈ M : t(p) = t 1 }, and Σ t1 ∩ Σ t2 = ∅ ⇐⇒ t 1 = t 2 .<label>(24)</label></formula><p>Then, by correspondence with the standard ADM decomposition, the proper distances on each discrete hypersurface, denoted ∆l, are determined by the induced 3-dimensional discrete spatial metric, denoted γ ij :</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">∆l 2 = γ ij ∆x i ∆x j ,<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where the spatial coordinates x i (t) label the points on the discrete hypersurface, for a given coordinate time t.

Analogously, a set of three gauge variables, known collectively as the "shift vector", denoted β i , determines how the spacetime is discretely foliated in the spacelike direction. The shift vectors effectively relabel the discrete spatial coordinates in accordance with the following scheme:</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">x i (t + ∆t) = x i (t) -β i ∆t,<label>(27)</label></formula><p>such that the overall spacetime line element in our discrete analog of ADM becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">∆s 2 = -α 2 + β i β i ∆t 2 + 2β i ∆x i ∆t + γ ij ∆x i ∆x j .<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Thus, we can see that, under this formal analogy, the gauge freedom of the ADM formalism (i.e. our freedom to choose values of α and β i for each normal observer) corresponds directly to our freedom to choose an updating order, and hence a discrete foliation, for a given causal graph. In particular, α designates the effective number of updating events required to map between an input subhypergraph and the corresponding output subhypergraph in two neighboring hypersurfaces, and β i designates the effective graph distance between those corresponding subhypergraphs.</p><p>Note that, in the above, we have implicitly made a correspondence between the combinatorial structure of causal graphs, and the causal structure of Lorentzian manifolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>[27] <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.

In the most generic case, this can be interpreted as the claim that the eventual outcomes of updating events are independent of the reference frame (i.e. discrete hypersurface) in which the observer is embedded, which is a discretized version of the principle of general covariance, or diffeomorphism invariance, of the laws of physics.</p><p>In the particular case in which the discrete hypersurfaces contained within the foliation are required to be "flat" (a rigorous definition of curvature for a discrete hypersurface will be presented within the next section), those hypersurfaces will thus correspond to inertial reference frames, and the statement of causal invariance reduces to a statement of discrete Lorentz covariance. Since the other fundamental postulate of special relativity -namely constancy of the speed of light -is enforced axiomatically by our definition of the edge lengths in causal graphs, this completes the proof. More explicit details of how the physical consequences of discrete Lorentz transformations may be derived are outlined below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>It is worth noting that the true distinction between inertial and non-inertial frames in the Wolfram</head><p>Model is ultimately a computability-theoretic one; one may think of an observer in relativity as being an entity which, upon observing the evolution of a collection of clocks, attempts to construct a hypothetical gravitational field configuration which is consistent with that evolution (i.e. to "synchronize" these clocks).</p><p>Therefore, the relative computational power of the observer and the clocks places constraints upon the types of field configurations (i.e. reference frames) that the observer is able to construct within their internal model of the world.

Therefore, an inertial reference frame corresponds to the limiting case of an arbitrarily computationally-bounded observer, and other constraints on the geometry of spacetime (and the resultant energy conditions regarding the matter content of that spacetime) follow from the observer's own position in the arithmetical hierarchy. A formal statement of this argument, and a derivation of its computability-theoretic and relativistic consequences, will be outlined in a subsequent publication.</p><p>Note also that causal disconnections in spacetime, such as event horizons and apparent horizons, are now represented as literal disconnections in the combinatorial structure of the causal graph (for instance, the problem of determining whether null rays can escape to future null infinity from a region of spacetime can now be represented as a concrete reachability problem for vertices of the causal graph).

To understand the precise details of how concepts such as relativistic mass emerge within this new formalism, we must first introduce a notion of (elementary) particles in spatial hypergraphs. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the particular case of ordinary graphs (i.e. hypergraphs in which each edge connects exactly two vertices). We now exploit a fundamental result in graph theory, known as "Kuratowksi's theorem", which states that a graph is planar (i.e. can be embedded in the Euclidean plane without any crossings of edges) if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of either K 5 (the complete graph on 5 vertices), or K 3,3 (the "utility graph", or bipartite complete graph on 3 + 3 vertices) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>[34]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_57">Definition 27 A "subdivision" of an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a new, undirected graph H = (W, F )</formula><p>which results from the subdivision of edges in G. This implies that any nonplanarity in a spatial graph must be associated with a finite set of isolable, nonplanar "tangles", each of which is a subdivision of either K 5 or K 3,3 , as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">14</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">14</ref>: On the left is a trivalent spatial graph containing an irreducible crossing of edges. On the right is an illustration of how this irreducible crossing is ultimately due to the presence of a nonplanar "tangle" that is a subdivision of K 3,3 . Adapted from S. Wolfram, A New Kind of Science, page 527. Thus, if the update rules for spatial graphs have the property that they always preserve planarity, then this immediately implies that each such nonplanar tangle will effectively act like an independent persistent structure that can only disappear through some kind of "annihilation" process with a different nonplanar tangle. As first pointed out in NKS, these persistent nonplanar structures are therefore highly suggestive of elementary particles in particle physics, with the purely graph-theoretic property of planarity playing the role of some conserved physical quantity (such as electric charge). The mathematical details of how one is able to generalize this correspondence, in order to yield a graph-theoretic analog of Noether's theorem (by virtue of Wagner's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, the Robertson-Seymour theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and a correspondence between conserved currents in physics and graph families that are closed under the operation of taking graph minors in combinatorics) is outlined in our accompanying publication on quantum mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In this context, relativistic mass can be understood in terms of the so-called "de Bruijn indices" <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> of mathematical logic. In the λ-calculus, abstractions of the form (λx.M ) cause the variable x to become bound within the expression, and therefore one must perform α-conversion of the λ-terms, i.e. one must perform renaming of the bound variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">(λx.M [x]) → (λy.M [y]) ,<label>(44)</label></formula><p>in order to avoid name collisions. However, if one instead indexes the bound variables in such a way as to ensure that λ-terms are invariant under α-conversion, i.e. such that checking for α-equivalence is the same as checking for syntactic equivalence, then one can avoid having to perform α-conversion at all. The central idea underlying the de Bruijn index notation is to index each occurrence of a variable within a λ-term by a natural number, designating the number of binders (within scope) that lie between that variable occurrence and its associated binder. For instance, the K and S combinators from combinatory logic, namely: λx.λy.x, and λx.λy.λz.xz (yz) ,</p><p>respectively, can be represented using de Bruijn indices as:</p><p>λλ2, and λλλ3 1 (2 1) ,</p><p>De Bruijn indices are correspondingly used within automated theorem-proving systems as a naming convention for generated variables. In constructing an automated proof of an equational theorem, such as</p><p>x = y, a standard technique is to treat the problem as one of abstract term rewriting: one can think of the axioms of the system as being abstract rewriting rules, and then the problem of finding a proof of x = y is ultimately the problem of determining a rewrite sequence that transforms x to y and vice versa, i.e one wishes to determine that x ↔ * y. In constructing this proof, one may consider rewriting rules of the form f (x, y) → g (x, y, z), in which the variable z is a generated variable (i.e. it appears on the right-hand-side, but not the left-hand-side, of the rule), which automated theorem-proving systems generally tend to index using de Bruijn index notation. These generated variables will eventually be eliminated, for instance by rules of the form g (x, y, z) → h (x, y), but they may be necessary for certain intermediate steps of the proof.</p><p>The key point here, however, is that the longer the path that one traverses through the proof graph, the more intermediate (generated) variables will be produced; as such, the generated variables can be thought of as being consequences (artefacts) of particular choices of updating orders. Since all abstract rewriting formalisms are mathematically equivalent (and therefore, in particular, hypergraph substitution systems are ultimately isomorphic to automated theorem-proving systems), this statement corresponds to the claim that, the longer the path that one traverses through a multiway system (i.e. the steeper the angle of "slicing" in the foliation of the causal graph), the more intermediate/generated vertices will be produced. As such, elementary particles will appear to be "heavier" (i.e. to have more vertices associated with them) on steeper "slices" in the foliation of the causal graph, without changing the eventual outcomes of the updating events. This is the discrete analog of relativistic mass increase due to a Lorentz transformation -a concrete demonstration of this idea is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>3 Discrete Geometry, Curvature and Gravitation in the Wolfram Intuitively, the notion of curvature in Riemannian geometry is some measure of the deviation of a manifold from being locally Euclidean, or, more formally, a measure of the degree to which the metric connection fails to be exact. For the case of an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, (M, g), we can make this statement mathematically precise, in the following way: the Ricci scalar curvature (i.e. the simplest curvature invariant of the manifold) is related to the ratio of the volume of a ball of radius , denoted B ⊂ M, to the volume of a ball of the same radius in flat (Euclidean) space <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">Vol (B (p) ⊂ M) Vol (B (0) ⊂ R n ) = 1 - R 6 (n + 2) 2 + O 4 ,<label>(47)</label></formula><p>as → 0, where R denotes the Ricci scalar curvature of (M, g) at the point p ∈ M. However, an equivalent method of defining R, which extends more readily to the discrete case of a directed hypergraph, is related to the ratio of the average distance between points on two balls to the distance between their centres, when those balls are sufficiently small and close together. More specifically, if B (p) ⊂ M is a ball of radius , centred at point p ∈ M, and it is mapped via parallel transport to B (q) ⊂ M, a corresponding ball of radius centred at point q ∈ M, then the average distance between a point on B (p) and its image (i.e. its corresponding point on B (q)) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">δ 1 - 2 2 (n + 2) R + O 3 + 2 δ ,<label>(48)</label></formula><p>as , δ → 0, where δ = d (p, q) denotes the distance between the centres p and q.</p><p>This local characterization of curvature in terms of average distances between balls, crucially, allows one to extend the notion of Ricci scalar curvature to more general metric spaces (including hypergraphs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>[42] <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>If one now considers an arbitrary metric space (X, d), with distance function d, then the natural generalization of the concept of a volume measure is a probability measure, with the natural generalization of an average distance between volume measures being the so-called "Wasserstein distance" between probability measures:</p><p>Definition 29 For a Polish metric space (X, d), equipped with its Borel σ-algebra, a "random walk" on X, denoted m, is a family of probability measures:</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">m = {m x : x ∈ X},<label>(49)</label></formula><p>each satisfying the requirement that m x has a finite first moment, and that the map x → m x is measurable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Parallel Transport, Discrete Holonomy, and the Discrete Spacetime Ricci Tensor</head><p>In standard differential geometry, the Ricci scalar curvature, R, is often introduced as being the trace of the Ricci curvature tensor, denoted R ab :</p><formula xml:id="formula_85">R = Tr (R ab ) = g ab R ab = R a a ,<label>(66)</label></formula><p>for a metric tensor g ab . In much the same way as the Ricci scalar curvature can be interpreted as a measure of the ratio of the volume of a ball in an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, (M, g) to the volume of a ball of the same radius in flat (Euclidean) space, the Ricci curvature tensor also has the following direct geometrical interpretation: R (ξ, ξ) is a measure of the ratio of the volume of a conical region in the direction of the vector ξ, consisting of geodesic segments of length emanating from a single point p ∈ M, to the volume of the corresponding conical region in flat (Euclidean) space.</p><p>The Ricci curvature may, in turn, be defined as being the contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor, denoted R abcd , between the first and third indices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_86">R ab = R c acb ,<label>(67)</label></formula><p>where the Riemann curvature tensor effectively quantifies how the direction of an arbitrary vector, v, changes as it gets parallel transported around a closed curve in (M, g):</p><formula xml:id="formula_87">δv α = R α βγδ dx γ dx δ v β ; (<label>68</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_88">)</formula><p>in other words, the Riemann curvature tensor is a measure of the degree to which a Riemannian manifold fails to be "holonomic" (i.e. fails to preserve geometrical data, as that data gets transported around a closed curve). A more algebraic way of stating the same thing is that the Riemann curvature tensor is the commutator of the covariant derivative operator acting on an arbitrary vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_89">∇ c ∇ d v a -∇ d ∇ c v a = R a bcd v b . (<label>69</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_90">)</formula><p>When defining the Ricci curvature tensor, the reason for contracting R abcd between the first and third indices specifically is that, due to the intrinsic symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor, it is not difficult to prove that any other choice of contraction will either yield zero, or ±R ab .</p><p>In order to have some coherent notion of parallel transport on a standard Riemannian manifold (and hence to introduce such concepts as holonomy and Riemann curvature), it is necessary first to define a connection on that manifold. The standard choice in Riemannian geometry is the Levi-Civita connection (otherwise known as the torsion-free or metric connection), whose components in a chosen basis are given by the Christoffel symbols, denoted Γ ρ µν , and which can be expressed in terms of the first derivatives of the metric tensor as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">Γ ρ µν = 1 2 g ρσ (∂ µ g σν + ∂ ν g µσ -∂ σ g µν ) . (<label>70</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_92">)</formula><p>Intuitively, the Christoffel symbols designate how the basis vectors change as one moves around on the manifold. In the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor can be written explicitly in terms of second derivatives the metric tensor as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_93">R a bcd = ∂ c Γ a bd -∂ d Γ a bc + Γ a ec Γ e bd -Γ a ed Γ e bc .<label>(71)</label></formula><p>In a locally flat, inertial reference frame (i.e. one in which the Christoffel symbols, but not their derivatives, all vanish), these components can be expressed in lowered-index form as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_94">R αβγδ = 1 2 (∂ β ∂ γ g αδ -∂ β ∂ δ g αγ + ∂ α ∂ δ g βγ -∂ α ∂ γ g βδ ) .<label>(72)</label></formula><p>These concepts now allow us to make the geometrical interpretation of the Ricci curvature tensor more precise: if one chooses to use geodesic normal coordinates around the point p ∈ M, i.e. coordinates in which all geodesics passing through p correspond to straight lines passing through the origin, then the metric tensor can be approximated by the Euclidean metric:</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">g ij = δ ij + O x 2 , (<label>73</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_96">)</formula><p>where δ ij denotes the standard Kronecker delta function, indicating that the geodesic distance from p can be approximated by the standard Euclidean distance, as one would expect.

Note that, in the formal definition of the Ollivier-Ricci scalar curvature for (directed) hypergraphs given above, we have implicitly employed a discrete notion of parallel transport when mapping points on one hypergraph ball onto corresponding points on a nearby hypergraph ball. To make this definition more explicit, and hence to derive the discrete analog of the full Riemann curvature tensor, it is helpful first to consider the notion of sectional curvature on Riemannian manifolds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_100">K (u, v) = R (u, v) v, u u, u v, v -u, v 2 , (<label>77</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_101">)</formula><p>where R is the full Riemann curvature tensor, and u and v are linearly independent tangent vectors at some point p ∈ M. Geometrically, the sectional curvature at point p ∈ M designates the Gaussian curvature of the surface obtained from the set of all geodesics starting at p, and proceeding in the directions of the tangent plane σ p defined by the tangent vectors u and v. In particular, when u and v are orthonormal, one has:</p><formula xml:id="formula_102">K (u, v) = R (u, v) v, u .<label>(78)</label></formula><p>Consider now an arbitrary metric space (X, d). If γ denotes a unit-speed geodesic whose origin is the point x ∈ X, and whose initial direction is v, then we denote the endpoint of that geodesic by exp x (v), so-called because of its relation to the exponential map from tangent spaces to manifolds in Riemannian geometry. Now, a natural generalization of the Riemannian sectional curvature, K (u, v), to the metric space (X, d) is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">d (exp x ( w x ) , exp y ( w y )) = δ 1 - 2 2 K (v, w) + O 3 + 2 δ ,<label>(79)</label></formula><p>as , δ → 0. In the above, v and w x denote unit-length tangent vectors at some point x ∈ X, point y ∈ X denotes the endpoint of the vector δv, w y is the vector obtained by the parallel transport of vector w x from point x to point y, and δ = d (x, y) denotes the distance between the points x and y. In this more general context, the sectional curvature is a measure of the discrepancy between the distance between points x and y, and the distance between the points lying a distance away from x and y along the geodesics starting at w x and w y , respectively. The Ollivier-Ricci scalar curvature for an arbitrary metric space can then be recovered by taking the average of the sectional curvature K (v, w) over all vectors w. More formally, if S x is the set of all tangent vectors of length at point x ∈ X, and similarly for S y , and if S x is mapped to S y via parallel transport, then the average distance between a point in S x and its image is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_104">δ 1 - 2 2 (n + 2) R + O 3 + 2 δ ,<label>(80)</label></formula><p>as , δ → 0, where R is the Ollivier-Ricci scalar curvature, as required.</p><p>In the case of a (directed) hypergraph, one can set, as usual, all hyperedges to be of unit length, and hence one can also take = δ = 1 in all of the definitions given above. Geodesics in the hypergraph are then given by solutions to the shortest paths problem. We also assume that all pairs of hyperedges which are not parallel (i.e. incident to the same set of vertices) can be considered to be orthonormal. These assumptions allow us to translate the generalized definition of sectional curvature given above to the case of (directed) hypergraphs, in a manner that is fully consistent with the discrete definition of the Ollivier-Ricci scalar curvature as discussed earlier. Rather gratifyingly, since the components of the sectional curvature tensor completely determine the components of the Riemann curvature tensor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_105">K (u, v) = R (u, v) v, u ,<label>(81)</label></formula><p>one immediately obtains discrete analogs of the Riemann curvature and Ricci curvature tensors for the case of (directed) hypergraphs.</p><p>Finally, in addition to asking about how the number of vertices, N (r) contained within a ball of radius r in a particular spatial hypergraph grows as a function of r, we now also have the requisite technical machinery to ask about how the number of updating events, denoted C (t), contained within a cone of length t within a particular causal graph grows as a function of t (where t can be thought of as corresponding to the number of discrete spacelike hypersurfaces intersected by the cone, for a particular discrete foliation of the casual graph). Henceforth, we assume that special relativity holds (i.e. that all update rules referenced are causal-invariant).</p><p>By direct analogy to the spatial hypergraph case, for a causal graph corresponding to flat, n-dimensional spacetime, the number of updating events reached will clearly scale like t n :</p><formula xml:id="formula_106">C (t) = at n , a ∈ Z,<label>(82)</label></formula><p>as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">17</ref>.</p><p>However, in the presence of non-zero spacetime curvature, there exists (again, by analogy to the purely spatial case) a correction factor, in the form of a coefficient of t n+2 , which we now proceed to compute explicitly, by exploiting the fact that the discrete spacetime Ollivier-Ricci curvature tensor, R ij , determines </p><formula xml:id="formula_107">dµ g = 1 - 1 6 R jk x j x k + O x 3 dµ Euclidean ,<label>(83)</label></formula><p>one now obtains, in the discrete case:</p><formula xml:id="formula_108">C (t) = at n 1 - 1 6 R jk t j t k + O t 3 ,<label>(84)</label></formula><p>i.e. the correction factor is indeed found to be a coefficient of t n+2 , and is proportional to the projection of the discrete spacetime Ollivier-Ricci curvature tensor along the discrete time vector, t, defined by the particular choice of foliation of the causal graph into discrete spacelike hypersurfaces. In terms of the discrete ADM decomposition introduced earlier, this time vector has the generic form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_109">t a = αn a + β a ,<label>(85)</label></formula><p>for a given choice of lapse function α and shift vector β i .</p><p>All that remains is to deduce an appropriate set of constraints on the spacetime Ollivier-Ricci curvature tensor, and to show (subject to certain assumptions about the limiting conditions of the causal graph) that these constraints are equivalent to an appropriately discretized form of the Einstein field equations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Discrete Einstein Field Equations</head><p>In all that follows, we shall assume one further condition on the hypergraph update rules, beyond mere causal invariance: namely, "asymptotic dimensionality preservation". Loosely speaking, this means that the dimensionality of the causal graph show converge to some fixed, finite value as the number of updating events grows arbitrarily large. We can express this requirement more formally by stating that the growth rate of the "global dimension anomaly", i.e. the correction factor to the global dimensionality of the causal graph, should converge to zero as the size of the causal graph increases (since converging to anything non-zero would imply a global dimension anomaly that grows without bound, and would therefore correspond to a causal graph with effectively unbounded dimensionality). Since, as established above, the local correction factor to the dimensionality of the causal graph is proportional to a projection of the discrete spacetime Ollivier-Ricci curvature tensor R ij , we begin by computing an average of this quantity across both all possible projection directions and all possible vertices, in order to obtain a value for the global dimension anomaly; averaging out over all timelike projection directions t corresponds to a standard tensor index contraction, thus reducing R ij to the discrete spacetime Ollivier-Ricci scalar curvature R, and hence yielding a volume average (i.e.</p><p>global dimension anomaly) given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_110">S g ab = dµ g R.<label>(86)</label></formula><p>Our condition that the rules be asymptotically dimensionality preserving therefore corresponds to the statement that the change in the value of the global dimension anomaly, with respect to the discrete causal graph metric tensor, should converge to zero in the limit of a large causal graph:</p><formula xml:id="formula_111">δS g ab δg ab → 0,<label>(87)</label></formula><p>In the continuum limit of an arbitrarily large causal graph, this sum becomes (subject to a weak ergodicity assumption on the dynamics of the causal graph) an integral, with the volume element now being given by the determinant of the metric tensor, as demonstrated earlier:</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">S g ab = d 4 x √ -gR,<label>(88)</label></formula><p>such that the constraint that the update rules must be asymptotically dimensionality preserving becomes mathematically equivalent to the statement that the classical (vacuum) Einstein-Hilbert action <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, with the standard general relativistic Lagrangian density:</p><formula xml:id="formula_113">L G = √ -gR,<label>(89)</label></formula><p>must be extremized. Therefore, we can adopt the standard approach of taking a functional derivative of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to the inverse metric tensor, and enforcing the assumption of zero surface terms, to obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_114">δS g ab δg ab = √ -g R ab - 1 2 Rg ab ,<label>(90)</label></formula><p>with minimization of the action hence yielding the vacuum Einstein field equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_115">R ab - 1 2 Rg ab = 0.<label>(91)</label></formula><p>Thus, for any set of hypergraph updating rules that are both causal-invariant and asymptotically dimensionality preserving, then if a continuum limit exists in which the causal graph becomes a Riemannian manifold, that limiting manifold must satisfy the vacuum Einstein field equations, as required. A more intuitive statement of this derivation, in which the argument is made that any local appearance of curvature in the causal graph must disappear globally in order to allow the curvature to be "distinguishable" from a global dimension change, is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Amongst many other consequences, this implies that the trajectory, denoted x (s), of a test particle (e.g. a persistent nonplanar tangle embedded within a spatial hypergraph) through a causal graph, will, in the continuum limit and in the absence of any non-gravitational forces, obey the relativistic geodesic equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_116">d 2 x µ ds 2 + Γ µ αβ dx α ds dx β ds = 0.

Then, by introducing a scalar variable, λ, by which to parameterize the action:</p><formula xml:id="formula_120">S = -g µν dx µ dλ dx ν dλ dλ,<label>(95)</label></formula><p>we are now able to vary the action with respect to the curve x µ , thus yielding the geodesic equation via the principle of least action. Analogous derivations exist for geodesics between lightlike-and spacelike-separated events too. The qualitative consequences of the geodesic equation for spatial hypergraphs are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">18</ref>. the number of crossing edges, i.e. the number of edges bound within nonplanar tangles of some spatial hypergraph, which pass through a given discrete hypersurface in the causal graph (a more formal statement of this idea is presented towards the end of this subsection). This increase in the effective number of hyperedges increases the number of reachable vertices, N (r), lying within a distance r of a given vertex, and hence must be corrected for within the dimensionality calculation. We can accommodate this correction term by effectively adding a matter contribution to the relativistic Lagrangian density:</p><formula xml:id="formula_121">L = L G + C M L M ,<label>(96)</label></formula><p>where C M is an arbitrary constant (which we assume, by convention, to be equal to 16π in the case of scalar field matter).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Topology, Variable Dimensionality and Implications for Cosmology</head><p>One assumption that has been implicit in the reasoning presented above is that, when computing the dimensionality of spatial hypergraphs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_138">N (r) = ar n 1 - R 6 (n + 2) r 2 + O r 4 ,<label>(116)</label></formula><p>or causal graphs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_139">C (t) = at n 1 - 1 6 R jk t j t k + O t 3 ,<label>(117)</label></formula><p>we have assumed that the dimensionality, n, is constant, and that the curvature, R, varies from point to point on the manifold. However, it is equally mathematically consistent to fix the value of R, and to allow n to vary as a function of position, effectively treating curvature as a highly localized change in the dimensionality of the manifold. Of course, this involves slightly generalizing the notion of a manifold, since for an ordinary manifold M, dimensionality is a local invariant. This indicates that the function f : M → R, mapping every point in M to the dimensionality of its neighborhood, is locally constant, in the sense that <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_140">∀x ∈ M, ∃ neighborhood U ⊂ M, such that f is constant on U,<label>(118)</label></formula><p>which, in turn, entails that every connected component of M must have a fixed dimensionality.</p><p>Developing an extension of general relativity that can accommodate spacetime geodesics with varying fractal dimension has been investigated in the context of so-called "Scale Relativity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>[58] <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, in which the principle of general covariance is extended to accommodate scale invariance, i.e. in which physical laws are taken to be valid in all coordinate systems, irrespective of their absolute scale. Within general scale relativity, this variation in fractal dimension is constrained by a logarithmic version of the Lorentz transformation, and is treated as a form of "curvature in scale space". However, a complete general theory of scale relativity, including scale-invariant versions of the Einstein field equations, has yet to be constructed.</p><p>For our present purposes, we shall consider one possible method of formalizing the treatment of curvature as a local change in dimensionality: a unification of the topological concepts of coordinate charts and covering maps. In standard topology, if M is a topological manifold, then a coordinate chart is a homeomorphism <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>[61]: n. An atlas of M is then an indexed family of charts:</p><formula xml:id="formula_141">ϕ : (U ⊂ M) → (ϕ (U ) ⊂ R n ) ,<label>(119)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_142">A = {(U α , ϕ α ) : α ∈ I},<label>(120)</label></formula><p>which covers M:</p><formula xml:id="formula_143">α∈A U α = M.<label>(121)</label></formula><p>However, there also exists the related notion of a covering map in algebraic topology, which is a continuous surjective map between topological spaces X and C <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>[63]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_144">p : C → X,<label>(122)</label></formula><p>such that, for every point x ∈ X, there exists an open neighborhood of x, denoted U ⊂ X, such that the pre-image of U under the map p, i.e. p -1 (U ), is a union of disjoint open sets in C, and such that p maps each such open set homeomorphically onto U . Here, C is known as the total space (or covering space) of the covering, and X is known as the base space.</p><p>If the covering space C is simply connected, then it is known as a universal covering space, since it covers any connected cover of the base space X <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. More precisely, if p : C → X is a universal cover of X, and if q : D → X is an arbitrary cover of X, then there must exist a covering map f : C → D such that q • f = p.</p><p>In particular, in the case where the base space X is a Riemannian manifold, then so too is its universal cover C, and the map p becomes a local isometry. Therefore, one is able to generalize the concept of a Riemannian manifold to allow for connected components with variable dimensionality in the following way: one fixes a base space of a fixed dimensionality, and then allows for a universal covering space of variable dimensionality, with the universal cover of the space playing the role of the coordinate chart of the manifold.</p><p>Thus, the "curvature" of such a generalized manifold becomes a measure of the discrepancy between the local dimensionality of the universal covering space and the global dimensionality of the base space. In the discrete case of (directed) hypergraphs, the base space can be considered to be a group-theoretical lattice, produced by some "modding-out" procedure. Then, the relationship between the discrete generalized manifold and the underlying base space is directly analogous to the relationship between a Bethe lattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>[66] and its underlying Cayley graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> in geometric group theory.</p><p>More specifically, if G is a group and S is its generating set, then the Cayley graph of G, denoted Γ = Γ (G, S), is the colored directed graph whose vertex set is given by the elements of G <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>[69]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_145">V (Γ) = {g : g ∈ G},<label>(123)</label></formula><p>and whose edge set is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_146">E (Γ) = {(g, gs) : g ∈ G, s ∈ S},<label>(124)</label></formula><p>where the element s ∈ S determines the color of the edge. On the other hand, the Bethe lattice for a given coordination number, z ∈ N, is an infinite, connected, acyclic graph (i.e. a rooted tree), in which each vertex has exactly z neighbors, such that the number of vertices contained within the kth shell surrounding the root vertex is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_147">N k = z (z -1) k-1 , k &gt; 0.<label>(125)</label></formula><p>In the context of geometric group theory, the Bethe lattice with coordination number z = 2n may be considered to be the Cayley graph of the free group on n generators. Since any presentation of a group G by a set S of n generators can be thought of as a surjective map from the free group on n generators to the group G, all group presentations are effectively maps from the Bethe lattice (with the root vertex corresponding to the identity element) to the associated Cayley graph. In algebraic topology, this map is interpreted as the universal cover of the Cayley graph (i.e. the base space), where the Bethe lattice (the universal covering space) is guaranteed to be simply connected, even though the corresponding Cayley graph is not. More complete mathematical details of these variable-dimensionality "pseudo-manifolds", their connections to geometric group theory, and the possibility of formulating an analog of general relativity in which dimension is treated as a dynamical variable, will be presented in a subsequent publication.</p><p>In contemporary physics, inflationary cosmology is a modification to the standard model (otherwise known as the ΛCDM or "hot big bang" model) of cosmology, invoked in order to explain the observed largescale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe, and hence to solve the so-called "horizon" and "flatness" problems that are endemic to ΛCDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>[71][72] <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Here, we sketch briefly how the Wolfram Model, when allowing for both local and global variation in dimensionality, is compatible with a model of cosmology which yields identical observational consequences to inflation, and hence also constitutes a valid solution to the horizon and flatness problems.</p><p>We begin by assuming that the initial condition for the universe consists of a spatial hypergraph with an abnormally high vertex connectivity, perhaps corresponding to a complete graph. As such, the universe starts off with some arbitrarily large number of spatial dimensions (which we can treat as being effectively infinite), but then the asymptotic dimensionality preserving property of the update rules causes the number of spatial dimensions to converge to some finite, fixed value, such as three. Another way to view such a universe, from the point of view of its causal structure, is that it starts with an arbitrary large value of the speed of light (since the causal graph is arbitrarily densely connected, yielding an abnormally high effective maximum rate of information propagation in the hypergraph), which then converges to a some much lower, fixed value. In this way, we can make an explicit mathematical connection with so-called "Variable Speed of Light" (or VSL) models of cosmology, as investigated by Petit, Moffat, Albrecht and Magueijo <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>[75] <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>[77] <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>[79], many of which are known to yield similar observational consequences to more conventional inflationary models.</p><p>An elementary mathematical model of VSL cosmology uses a scalar field, denoted χ, to describe the dynamical behavior of the effective speed of light:</p><formula xml:id="formula_148">c (t) = ĉχ (t) ,<label>(126)</label></formula><p>where ĉ is a constant with the dimensions of velocity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Concluding Remarks</head><p>The present article has demonstrated the Wolfram Model to be a novel, exciting and potentially highly fruitful discrete model for spacetime geometry, exhibiting discrete analogs of many (and possibly all) of the salient mathematical features of Lorentzian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds in limiting cases. There exist a variety of open problems arising from this work, ranging from the possibility of computing higher-order corrections to the discrete Einstein field equations, to determining the computability-theoretic and complexity-theoretic properties that distinguish inertial and non-inertial reference frames, to developing a theory of general relativity that holds in manifolds with variable spacetime dimensions. A few of these problems are discussed in greater depth in our accompanying publication on quantum mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which makes significant use of both the special relativistic and general relativistic formalisms that we develop in this paper (especially the relationship between confluence, causal invariance and Lorentz covariance, and the derivation of the discrete Einstein field equations), and we intend to investigate several more of these questions in the course of future publications. The present work, however, has at least revealed the Wolfram Model to be a plausible fundamental model for classical relativistic and gravitational physics, and we eagerly await the implications that this will entail.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: An example evolution of the above transformation rule, starting from an initial (multi)hypergraph consisting of a single vertex with two self loops.

(102) Therefore, we can conclude that the Wolfram Model is consistent with both zero and non-zero values of the cosmological constant. This suggests a generalization of the definition of the discrete energy-momentum tensor given above, as being instead a measure of the flux (i.e. intersection) of causal edges through a discrete hypersurface in the causal graph, with causal edges associated with the evolution of elementary particles (i.e. nonplanar tangles) corresponding to standard baryonic matter contributions, and causal edges associated with the evolution of the background space corresponding to vacuum energy contributions. In the usual way, pure energy and momentum may be extracted from T µν by considering fluxes through purely spacelike and purely timelike hypersurfaces, respectively.</figDesc></figure>

Definition 4 A "causal graph", denoted G causal , is a directed, acyclic graph in which every vertex corresponds to an application of an update rule (i.e. an "event"), and in which the edge A → B exists if and only if the update rule designated by event B was only applicable as a result of the outcome of the update rule designated by event A.</p>Pragmatically speaking, this implies that the causal relation A → B exists if and only if the input for event B has a non-trivial overlap with the output of event A. If the Wolfram Model is to be a plausible underlying formalism for fundamental physics, one must presumably assume that every edge of the causal graph corresponds to a spacetime interval on the order of (at most) the Planck scale, i.e. approximately 10 -35 metres, or 10 -43 seconds, although dimensional analysis of the model indicates a potentially much smaller spacetime scale</p></note></figure>
