<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in the manufacturing of electric vehicles is the process of identifying fault causes. Traditionally, the RCA is conducted manually, relying on process expert knowledge. Meanwhile, sensor networks collect significant amounts of data in the manufacturing process. Using this data for RCA makes it more efficient. However, purely datadriven methods like Causal Bayesian Networks have problems scaling to large-scale, real-world manufacturing processes due to the vast amount of potential cause-effect relationships (CER's). Furthermore, purely data-driven methods have the potential to leave out already known CER's or to learn spurious CER's. The paper contributes by proposing an interactive and intelligent RCA tool that combines expert knowledge of an electric vehicle manufacturing process and a data-driven machine learning method. It uses reasoning over a large-scale Knowledge Graph of the manufacturing process while learning a Causal Bayesian Network. In addition, an Interactive User Interface enables a process expert to give feedback to the root cause graph by adding and removing information to the Knowledge Graph. The interactive and intelligent RCA tool reduces the learning time of the Causal Bayesian Network while decreasing the number of spurious CER's. Thus, the interactive and intelligent RCA tool closes the feedback loop between expert and machine learning method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Machine learning is heavily used in driver assistant systems of electric vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The electric vehicles benefit from machine learning not only on the road, but also during the manufacturing process as the latter has become more intelligent and data-driven. The manufacturing process is monitored via sensor networks, resulting in significant amounts of data hour by hour. The data includes faults diagnosed by quality control process steps. However, detecting a fault in a complex manufacturing process does not necessarily uncover in which Process Steps the fault was induced. Finding the cause-effect relationships (CER's) leading to the diagnosed fault is called Root Cause Analysis (RCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Traditionally, RCA is a manual, labor-intense, and thus expensive process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, involving design of experiments to study manipulations and resulting effects. RCA requires high amounts of process expert knowledge. Such that only process experts can conduct a RCA in a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>Digital support tools promise to make RCA more efficient, data-driven, and less dependent on individual process knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, to reduce costs and improve the performance of the manufacturing process.</p><p>Previous work identified Causal Bayesian Networks as a machine learning technique to automate RCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> by learning CER's between Sensor Variables. The Causal Bayesian Networks constructs a root cause graph over the manufacturing process, showing potential root causes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, learning Causal Bayesian Networks for large manufacturing processes becomes prohibitively expensive as the search space for potential cause-effect relations explodes. This problem can be mitigated by including process expert knowledge in the learning process of the Causal Bayesian Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In addition, expert knowledge can improve the learned root cause graph by identifying spurious CER's.</p><p>The remaining challenges for scaling Causal Bayesian Networks to large-scale manufacturing processes are to model process expert knowledge in detail and to provide an accessible way for the process expert to interact with and improve the root cause graph. The paper investigates those challenges by combining a large-scale Knowledge Graph of the manufacturing process with a Causal Bayesian Network. The Knowledge Graph allows detailed modeling of large-scale manufacturing processes and enables the process expert to improve the root cause graph.</p><p>In this work, a support tool for interactive and intelligent RCA in the manufacturing process of electric vehicles is proposed. The RCA is conducted by finding CER's between Sensor Variables of the manufacturing process.</p><p>In detail, the paper contributes by:</p><p>• Detailed modelling of process expert knowledge in a large-scale Knowledge Graph for a real-world electric vehicle manufacturing process. • Automatically considering manufacturing knowledge from the Knowledge Graph to drastically prune the search space while learning the Causal Bayesian Network. • Allowing the process expert to interact with and improve the root cause graph by explaining the Causal Bayesian Network where and how to do better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>RCA in manufacturing is dominated by methods defined in the ISO/IEC 31010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, including versions of the Five Why's <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, or the Fault Tree Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The methods structure expert knowledge, such that a process expert can use it as a manual for RCA. However, the decision-support tools do not take advantage of today's sensor networks and data.</p><p>Thus, machine learning methods were introduced in RCA, enabling automated and intelligent decision-support tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In particular, Causal Bayesian Networks were identified as beneficial for RCA by learning CER's between measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>For large and complex manufacturing processes, the number of possible Causal Bayesian Network grows superexponentially and its derivation becomes challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Additionally, one is not only interested in the existence of CER's, but also in their strength to prioritize potential root causes. The derivation of the CER's is called structure learning, while the identification of the strengths is called parameter learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposes an FMEA-based approach, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposes an ontology of the manufacturing process to determine the structure of the Causal Bayesian Network. However, the ontology only considers classes of entities and does not allow pruning the search space for individual measurements. Furthermore, in complex manufacturing processes many CER's are unknown to the experts and both methods are unable to uncover them. On the contrary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> combines expert knowledge and data to derive the Causal Bayesian Network. This idea improves the quality of the root cause graph, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. While Sensor Variables can be continuous, most of the aforementioned approaches consider a discretization to decrease the complexity of learning the Causal Bayesian Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, this practice may lead to such a degree of information loss that the datadriven identification of CER's becomes infeasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Recent approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> for learning complex Causal Bayesian Networks based on Structural Equation Models (SEM's) were applied on manufacturing processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> and the benefits of the inclusion of expert knowledge were demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we present a large-scale modeling of domain expertise into a Knowledge Graph that leverages the sensor network topology for deriving the Causal Bayesian Network of a real-world manufacturing process of electric vehicles. Furthermore, we show how the Knowledge Graphs contributes to an interactive RCA and closes the feedback loop for the Causal Bayesian Network learning algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. SYSTEM OVERVIEW</head><p>The system for interactive and intelligent RCA consists of five components (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), where each is a microservice on its own. The Controller and the Data Layer enable the core components. The Knowledge Graph, Causal Bayesian Network, and Interactive User Interface are the core components of the interactive and intelligent root cause analysis tool.</p><p>The following describes the components' high-level functionalities and their interactions. Later on, the three core components are described in detail.</p><p>The heart of the system is a Controller that handles the communication between all other components. It receives requests and triggers processes.</p><p>The Data Layer accesses data from a vehicle manufacturing-sensor network. Next, the data is preprocessed according to the input format of the Causal Bayesian Network and stored in the Data Layer. The preprocessing shall be elaborated in Subsection IV-A.</p><p>Another primary source of data is the Knowledge Graph (cf. Subsection III-A). The Knowledge Graph holds formalized expert knowledge about the manufacturing process of electric vehicles, like the temporal-spatial relations of Stations, Process Steps, and Sensor Variables.</p><p>The Causal Bayesian Network takes the preprocessed sensor data from the Data Layer for learning CER's between the Sensor Variables (cf. Subsection III-B). The information from the Knowledge Graph is used while learning to reduce the search space drastically. The resulting Causal Bayesian Network shows, which Sensor Variables may induce faults in other Sensor Variables. Thus, we call the graph learned by the Causal Bayesian Network a root cause graph.</p><p>The root cause graph is visualized in an Interactive User Interface (cf. Subsection III-C). The visualization enables experts to explore root causes in the manufacturing process of electric vehicles. Additionally, it allows for feedback of the process expert on the root cause graph. For example, the process expert may add an edge between two Sensor Variables to the Knowledge Graph or defines a Sensor Variable as a Root Variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Knowledge Graph</head><p>A Knowledge Graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is a directed labeled graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and, therefore, optimal for storing highly relational data while preserving its semantics and allowing for deductive reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The Knowledge Graph of the RCA tool formalizes expert knowledge of the manufacturing process of electric vehicles. This allows the automatic, efficient, and large-scale mining of expert knowledge, which is then used while learning the Causal Bayesian Network.</p><p>The expert knowledge of the manufacturing process is modeled as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In addition, a Sensor Variable can be a member of one subclass, which are Root, Leaf, and Irrelevant Variable.</p><p>Formalizing expert knowledge of the manufacturing process in such a way allows automatic reasoning over the manufacturing process. The intelligent and interactive RCA tool employs reasoning from the two following dimensions.  Let us consider the Knowledge Graph from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The topology of the sensor network allows inferring that the Sensor Variables "Weight" and "Sorting Time" may causally impact the Sensor Variable "Heat Input", but not vice versa and not the Sensor Variables "Humidity", "Amount Adhesive", and "Pressure".</p><p>The example shows the reasoning on how a significant amount of possible CER's between Sensor Variables are excluded a priori and do not have to be considered while training the Causal Bayesian Network. This reduces the search space of the Causal Bayesian Network learning algorithm drastically, compared to a naive approach of learning the Causal Bayesian Network solely on tabular data (cf. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</p><p>b) Properties of Variable subclasses: Additionally, the Knowledge Graph incorporates expert knowledge over the Sensor Variables in the form of their subclass membership. This information is introduced to the Knowledge Graph by the feedback of a process expert and is vital to reduce the Causal Bayesian Network's learning algorithm's search space.</p><p>Root Variables cannot be impacted by any Sensor Variables. However, they may impact other Sensor Variables. For example, the Sensor Variable "Humidity" in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> cannot be affected by Sensor Variables, as the air humidity is external to the manufacturing process. However, "Humidity" may affect other Sensor Variables in the manufacturing process.</p><p>Leaf Variables are the inverse of Root Variables. They may be impacted by Sensor Variables, but cannot impact other Sensor Variables. The "Heat Input" Sensor Variable in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> is an example of a Leaf Variable, as it is the only Sensor Variable of the final Process Step.</p><p>Finally, there are Irrelevant Variables. Any manufacturing process measures a minor amount of Sensor Variables that do not impact any other Sensor Variables in the process. Irrelevant Variables are artifacts of unclear requirements, highly specific use cases, or legislation. The "Sorting Time" Sensor Variable in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> is an example, as the sorting time does not impact other Sensor Variables. Thus, they shall be excluded from the RCA.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> show the impact of reasoning over the temporal-spatial relations between Sensor Variables and their subclasses on the search space of the Causal Bayesian Network learning algorithm. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, every Sensor Variable's fault is potentially caused by any other Sensor Variable, as the sensor network's topology modeled in the Knowledge Graph is not considered. This amounts to a total of 30 possible CER's between the six Sensor Variables. However, considering the sensor network topology, the search space of the Causal Bayesian Network learning algorithm is reduced to seven potential CER's between the Sensor Variables (cf. Figure   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Causal Bayesian Networks</head><p>This section introduces important concepts of Causal Bayesian Networks, which represent CER's behind data sets, and how it incorporates the Knowledge Graph into its training. CER's are dependencies, where the manipulation of one Sensor Variable changes the value of the other even if all remaining Sensor Variables are fixed. Assume the true causal graph is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Then a change of "Pressure" influences "Heat Input" through the path "Pressure" → "Amount Adhesive" → "Heat Input". For example, a higher "Pressure" might lead to a higher "Amount Adhesive", which in turn results in a larger "Heat Input". Now imagine that after an increase of "Amount Adhesive" we manually change all Sensor Variables but "Heat Input" back to their original level. Then, the manipulation of "Pressure" does not impact "Heat Input" anymore, as it is only directly influenced by "Weight" and "Amount Adhesive", which are as before. Therefore, the influential path "Pressure" → "Amount Adhesive" → "Heat Input" is blocked. We understand these direct impacts as the CER's. They are pivotal for root-cause analysis, process control, and process understanding. CER's imply an order over the Sensor Variables, which we call the causal order. In our running example (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), one possible causal order of the Sensor Variables is ("Sorting Time", "Weight" "Humidity", "Pressure", "Amount Adhesive", "Heat Input"). This paper's scope is to derive the unknown causal graph. Instead of labor and cost-intensive design of experiments, we would like to leverage our sensor network along the manufacturing process to derive the causal graph in a datadriven manner. However, if we rely exclusively on data, this is challenging due to the following reasons:</p><p>1) Confounding: Even if we have identified a correlation, say between "Amount Adhesive" and "Heat Input", it might be, that there is a third Sensor Variable, say "Machine Operator", impacting both and there is no direct impact between the two. We call this third Sen-sor Variable a confounder. Besides pathological cases, confounders lead to extra spurious relationships. 2) Causal Order: Even if we can exclude confounding it remains still unclear, whether "Amount Adhesive" is the cause and "Heat Input" the effect or it is vice versa. 3) Complexity: The number of potential graphs grows super-exponentially. Beyond a small number of Sensor Variables, it is thus impossible to evaluate all of them. This is especially worrisome if there are many causeeffect pairs.</p><p>Expert Knowledge to the Rescue: In the following, we present how expert knowledge contributes to derive the causal graph. As Section III-A mentions, the number of potential causal graphs can be drastically reduced by the sensor network's topology and expert knowledge on the manufacturing process:</p><p>1) sensor network topology provides a partial ordering of the Sensor Variables and 2) expert knowledge helps to exclude certain relationships and thus avoids spurious relationships.</p><p>Additionally, even a partial ordering drastically reduces the number of potential graphs. The classification of Sensor Variables into roots and leafs reduces not only the number of potential edges but also the number of relevant orderings. For example, as "Weight" and "Humidity" are defined as Root Variables, the relevant orderings are those that assign them to any of the first two positions. This reduces the number of permutations by a factor of 30. The effect of Leaf Variables is analogous. In the following, we present how we leverage the background information for causal graph identification.</p><p>Causal Additive Models: The derivation of the CER's from observed data is of central interest in many domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. For this task, score-based methods relying on Structural Equation Models (SEM's) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> have recently become increasingly popular due to their ability to incorporate machine learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. The underlying assumption is that all Sensor Variables can be expressed as a function of inputs and a noise term, that captures unknown influences. In the example of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, "Heat Input" can be described by Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">HeatInput = f (Weight, AmountAdhesive, Noise) (1)</formula><p>We emphasize that this follows an intuitive understanding of a manufacturing process. Process Steps transform input material to an output, while they are impacted by machine settings and the environment. We assume that the data follows a Causal Additive Model, where Equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is replaced by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">HeatInput = f 1 (Humidity) + f 2 (AmountAdhesive) + Noise (2)</formula><p>The Noise is normally distributed and f 1 and f 2 are non-linear. Under mild assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> on f 1 and f 2 , one can derive the true causal graph from observed data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposes an approach, that identifies the graph using the following steps:</p><p>1) Find the causal ordering of the Sensor Variables 2) Identify the CER's.</p><p>Given N observations of p Sensor Variables by (x ℓ1 , . . . , x ℓp ) , 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ N . To derive the causal ordering in step <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, search for the permutation π on {1, . . . , p} such that Equation 3 is minimized and f π kj are learned by maximum likelihood estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(π) := p k=1 log    N ℓ=1   x ℓk - π(j)&lt;π(k) f π kj (x ℓj )   2    ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>If the Knowledge Graph provides a complete ordering, then we skip the first step, and the graph identification is found using regression techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Unfortunately, the ordering is usually partial, as Sensor Variables measured at the same station cannot be ordered. We employ the algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which proposes an efficient adaption in case of expert knowledge. It limits step <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> to finding the causal ordering of the Sensor Variables within the Process Steps while mining the rest of the ordering from the Knowledge Graph</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Interactive User Interface</head><p>The Interactive User Interface visualizes the learned Causal Bayesian Network (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Thereby, the Interactive User Interface enables no-code usage and adaption of the root cause graph by a process expert.</p><p>a) Root Cause Analysis: The workflow supported by the Interactive User Interface is as follows (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>):</p><p>The process expert searches for the Sensor Variable with the diagnosed fault. All possible root cause paths for the faulty Sensor Variable are displayed to the process expert. The process expert now sees the information on which other Sensor Variables the faulty Sensor Variable depends. That way, without further labor-intense analysis, the process expert can move to the physical manufacturing process and check all Process Steps related to the identified Sensor Variables. The process expert benefits from a highly directed root cause search in the physical manufacturing process. Thus, the interactive and intelligent root cause analysis tool minimizes and sometimes even prevents the downtime of the manufacturing process and maximizes the manufacturing process's output.</p><p>b) Expert Feedback: The RCA is supported by various means of interaction with the root cause graph (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</p><p>The process expert can choose the Product to be considered in the RCA. This results in accurate root cause graphs, as Sensor Variable measurements significantly depend on the Product measured. In addition, the process expert can select the RCA timeframe via the Interactive User Interface. Selecting a timeframe enables the process expert to look precisely at the period when the faults were detected. It thus customizes the RCA to the individual fault at hand. However, the root cause graph might include spurious CER's and needs to be corrected. In this case, the expert is able to explain the Causal Bayesian Network where and how to do better, via adding or removing information to the Knowledge Graph. The Causal Bayesian Network may learn a CER between two Sensor Variables, which has to be rejected based on the knowledge of the process expert. The process expert can select such an edge and check "Add to Blacklist", which adds an "hasNoImpact" relation between the two Sensor Variables to the Knowledge Graph (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> (1)). The expert feedback is considered at the next iterations of learning the Causal Bayesian Network, and thus is accounted for in the next RCA's.</p><p>In addition, spurious CER's might be the cause of incomplete information over subclass membership of Sensor Variables in the Knowledge Graph. Thus, the process expert can add and remove Root, Leaf, and Irrelevant Variable subclass membership from Sensor Variables (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> (2)). This feedback is also considered in the next iteration of the Causal Bayesian Network. Assuming that the expert feedback is correct, the root cause graph converges each iteration closer to the true root cause graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EVALUATION</head><p>The evaluation is conducted on a real-world electric vehicle manufacturing process. One Line is taken as an example to show the RCA with the interactive and intelligent tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data</head><p>The data is two-folded. There is the Knowledge Graph and the Data Layer as a source of data.</p><p>The Knowledge Graph is implemented in Neo4J <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This allows querying all knowledge via the Cypher API. Cypher is a deductive reasoning query language <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The real-world Knowledge Graph holds a total of 100,015 nodes and 417,944 relationships. This amount of expert knowledge constitutes a large-scale knowledge graph. For the Line of this evaluation, there are 53 Stations with 96 Process Steps and 1683 Sensor Variables and a total of 2143 relations modeled.</p><p>To learn the Causal Bayesian Network we prepare the data by assigning the Sensor Variables to individual output products. Then, we preprocess the data by removing columns with only one value. Further, we remove one part of a column pair, if they have a correlation above 0.95 to avoid collinearity. Afterwards, we remove columns and rows, where more than 50% of the values are missing. As the rate of missing values  is low, we simply impute the column's mean for missing values. The presented approach is generic and can be applied dynamically to different products and time windows. For this section, we consider data of one day and for one specific product type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experiments</head><p>The contribution of the paper is to give a real-world example of how to interactively improve the performance of Causal Bayesian Networks for RCA with large-scale modelled expert knowledge in the form of a Knowledge Graph. The contribution is shown by three experiments.</p><p>1) Decrease in learning time of the Causal Bayesian Network by including the Knowledge Graph: As argued above, one major motivation for including expert knowledge is a decrease in the learning time of the Causal Bayesian Network algorithm. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the average decrease in learning time with an increase in expert knowledge. The experiment was conducted five times. For each run-through, randomly 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of data from the Knowledge Graph were selected for training the Causal Bayesian Network. A decline by 79.0% in training time can be observed, with an increase in data from the Knowledge Graph. Thus, expert knowledge optimizes and enables the training of Causal Bayesian Network in large-scale manufacturing processes.</p><p>2) Decline of spurious CER's in the Causal Bayesian Network by including the Knowledge Graph: As argued above, Causal Bayesian Networks for manufacturing processes tend to include spurious CER's. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> shows the average decline in spurious CER's with an increase in expert knowledge. The experiment was conducted as described in IV-B1. A steep decline in the amount of learned CER's is observable. The result indicates that data from the Knowledge Graph prunes 60.6% of spurious CER's. This leads to a more accurate root cause graph and thus increases the performance of the root cause analysis tool. The following experiment shall underline the latter claim.</p><p>3) Expert feedback improves the Causal Bayesian Network:</p><p>To evaluate the usefulness of the interactive component, we extend the evaluation proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A learned Causal Bayesian Network is compared to a partially known root cause graph, using an adapted Structural Hamming Distance (aSHD), which describes the deviation of the learned Causal Bayesian Network from the partially known root cause graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A lower number indicates a better result. The learning algorithm is applied on 100 random samples of eight Sensor Variables, using the temporal-spatial ordering. For each learned Causal Bayesian Network, the aSHD is calculated. The mean and standard deviation of the aSHD are 0.47 and 0.74, respectively. If an expert now adds one hasNoImpact relation to the Knowledge Graph, the mean and standard deviation of the aSHD go down to 0.44 and 0.70. This corresponds to an improvement of the aSHD by almost 6% and the learning algorithm is stabilized, as the standard deviation is lower. The results illustrate the benefits of including expert knowledge and exemplify one iteration step of the interactive and intelligent root cause analysis tool.</p></div>

It is described how the reasoning is used to prune the search space of a Causal Bayesian Network learning algorithm. In addition, this work shows how to include expert feedback in the learning of the Causal Bayesian Network via the Interactive User Interface and the Knowledge Graph to identify and exclude spurious CER's. The evaluation of the interactive and intelligent root cause analysis tool on a realworld manufacturing process of electric vehicles proves the tool's feasibility.</p><p>Machine learning makes RCA more efficient. However, it will only succeed if we rely on data and expert knowledge. Let us put the human back in the loop. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was co-funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy, funding line "Digitization" of the BayVFP, project KIProQua, and the BMW Group. In particular, we thank Joscha Eirich for enabling this research and for his feedback on the intelligent and interactive root cause analysis tool.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

The Knowledge Graph models the manufacturing process of electric vehicles as a sequence of Lines. A Line has various Stations. The Stations are also modeled as a sequence. Each Station implements multiple Process Steps. Again, the Knowledge Graph models the sequence in which Process Steps are executed. Each Process Step measures Sensor Variables. The Knowledge Graph models explicitly a "hasNoImpact" relation between Sensor Variables that are known to have no causal effect on each other.In addition, a Sensor Variable can be a member of one subclass, which are Root, Leaf, and Irrelevant Variable.Formalizing expert knowledge of the manufacturing process in such a way allows automatic reasoning over the manufacturing process. The intelligent and interactive RCA tool employs reasoning from the two following dimensions.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,98.37,171.86,152.25,109.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
