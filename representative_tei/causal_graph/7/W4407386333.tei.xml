<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mental-illness stigma is a persistent social problem, hampering both treatment-seeking and recovery. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to understand it more clearly, but analyzing the relevant data is highly labor-intensive. Therefore, we designed a chatbot to engage participants in conversations; coded those conversations qualitatively with AI assistance; and, based on those coding results, built causal knowledge graphs to decode stigma. The results we obtained from 1,002 participants demonstrate that conversation with our chatbot can elicit rich information about people's attitudes toward depression, while our AI-assisted coding was strongly consistent with human-expert coding. Our novel approach combining large language models (LLMs) and causal knowledge graphs uncovered patterns in individual responses and illustrated the interrelationships of psychological constructs in the dataset as a whole. The paper also discusses these findings' implications for HCI researchers in developing digital interventions, decomposing human psychological constructs, and fostering inclusive attitudes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Mental illnesses are pervasive, with depression alone touching the lives of approximately 280 million people worldwide <ref type="bibr">[120]</ref>. Nevertheless, due to mental-illness stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, many people with psychiatric disorders face social rejection, employment and housing discrimination, negative self-perceptions, and reluctance to seek help <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">126]</ref>; and this stigma remains persistent despite efforts to eradicate it by fostering understanding and acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The intricate nature of stigma, with its multifaceted manifestations and deep-rooted societal influences, makes it challenging to measure and eliminate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Existing methods for dissecting mental-illness stigma have various limitations. Self-report questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> provide relatively little detail, particularly about the hidden underpinnings of the respondents' emotions and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, and are prone to socialdesirability bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Social-media analysis has also been widely used to assess stigmatizing effects and cognitive distortions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>, leveraging the large volume of diverse language samples available online. However, discourse on stigma-related topics in such posts tends to be brief and shallow <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and this type of analysis suffers from population bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>A promising solution is the collection and analysis of in-depth interview data, which contains rich nuances of how mental health is discussed, perceived, and construed <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. Interviews, a form of conversational interaction, serve as space and medium for unfolding perspectives, facilitating social-knowledge exchanges, and reproducing social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. Such conversational contexts, along with interviewing techniques like probing questions and reflective listening <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, allow interviewers to identify recurring patterns such as the use of derogatory terms, casual jokes, or dismissive comments about mental illness that reveal stigma, whether intentional and/or unintentional <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. However, gathering and dissecting interview data in quantities large enough to attain such insights has generally been infeasible due to the enormous amounts of time and effort required <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, as well as the sensitive nature of mental illness-related discussions.</p><p>The burgeoning field of AI could help to reduce those burdens. AI-powered chatbots have already been used to simulate human interviewers to gather qualitative data on sensitive topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">108]</ref>, which can reduce social-desirability bias and foster self-disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>; and some computational techniques, such as machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and word embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, have been applied to automate stigma detection in large textual datasets. These advancements have facilitated the development of fruitful AI methods that excel at rapidly and accurately coding qualitative data like interviews for large-scale analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The advent of LLMs could progress this capability by enabling real-time identification of language subtleties, emotional tones, and behavioral indicators that may not be immediately apparent to human coders <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. However, AI/LLMs rely on syntactic and semantic cues, and their grounding in psychological theories/models ranges from simplistic to nonexistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This would likely lead them to focus on end-state classification rather than on how, when, or why discriminatory behavior develops.</p><p>These limitations of AI/LLM-assisted qualitative-data analysis can be partly addressed by incorporating it with causal knowledge graphs (CKGs), which may be more capable of unraveling the mechanisms, processes, and triggers of stigmatizing behavioral intention. CKGs model causation via well-structured representations of entity-relationship-entity triples <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. We consider that, in alignment with appropriate theoretical frameworks, CKGs could enable the mapping of stigma mechanisms onto established factorpathway models and illustrate the interrelationships among various stigma-related constructs. Synergizing LLM capabilities with CKGs would aggregate the inductive strengths of LLMs, i.e., their ability to discover latent relationships, with the deductive power of CKGs: in this case, psychological-hypothesis generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we examine how AI/LLM-assisted methods and CKGs can be integrated to both collect and analyze data related to mental-illness stigma, with a particular focus on the stigma attached to depression due to its global prevalence. Specifically, we ask the following research questions:</p><p>RQ1. To what extent can AI-assisted qualitative-data collection and analysis methods effectively capture depression stigma? RQ2. How well can the integration of CKG and LLM reveal the constructs that drive depression stigma and their interrelationships?</p><p>Accordingly, the present study's methodology began with using an AI chatbot as an interviewer to collect qualitative data about perceptions of depression from 1,002 participants. We then applied AI-assisted qualitative coding to identify stigma attributions, guided by a codebook developed through human coding. To validate this workflow, we compared our AI-assisted coding with human-generated codes and existing computational methods. We then semi-automatically constructed a CKG that could portray the interplay of stigma, dissect psychological constructs across conversations, discern similarities and differences in the participants' logic chains, and intertwine these elements to build a conceptual model. Our integration of LLM and CKG techniques involved the former suggesting new relationships and the latter providing a structured framework for deducing claims and hypotheses. This dual method uncovered constructs like personalities and past experiences that are supported by existing theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">119]</ref>, along with new causal relationships such as the impact of personalities on emotional responses and situations on anticipated discriminatory behaviors.</p><p>Our work makes several contributions to the HCI community. First, it introduces an AI-assisted data collection and analysis pipeline that leverages AI to systematically elicit and analyze latent psychological constructs, such as depression stigma. This method offers a non-labor-intensive yet nuanced approach to capturing large volumes of interview data and understanding and coding attributions of depression stigma. Second, its integration of CKGs with LLMs facilitates interpretation of the causal networks between various psychological constructs, such as cognition, emotions, and behavioral intentions related to mental health. This contributed to the development of a conceptual model that illuminates the predictors and processes of stigma formation. And third, this study's findings can inform the design of tailored, theoretically grounded micro-interventions to combat depression stigma by enabling real-time stigma identification and the creation of CKGs specific to individuals. This personalized approach may address the limitations of one-size-fits-all interventions, enhancing effectiveness while reducing potential unintended consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 AI Applications in Mental Health</head><p>AI has been increasingly integrated into digital mental-health care delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>, offering diverse applications spanning psychotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, psychoeducation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, and social companionship <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Modern AI systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in psychiatric care through their ability to engage in naturalistic, human-like therapeutic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Functioning as both clinical tools and digital companions, these AI systems offer multiple benefits, including empathic communication, non-judgmental responses, regular check-ins, and tailored feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p><p>However, despite the promising potential of AI to promote mental well-being through improved accessibility and diverse support mechanisms, social stigma remains a primary barrier that may prevent people from seeking help through these digital systems, just as it has historically deterred people from accessing traditional mental health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. This persistent challenge of stigma therefore demands careful attention as we continue to develop and design AI-based mental-health interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Mental-illness Stigma</head><p>Social stigma, as originally defined by Goffman, includes regarding mental illness as divergent from what society considers normal and correct, and mentally ill individuals as tainted and devalued <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. It stems from stereotypes and prejudices <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that frequently manifest as unconscious bias, i.e., negative attitudes or cognition that can sway people's decisions without their awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Social stigmatization of people with mental illness is very prevalent worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The pervasiveness of public stigma impedes helpseeking, treatment-seeking, and recovery while also exacerbating historical injustices <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> and creating obstacles to employment, housing, and social connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Consequently, only about 50% of people with depression, for example, seek treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, and many discontinue it to avoid being labeled psychiatrically <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Understanding and reducing mental-illness stigma is therefore crucial to social welfare and the promotion of inclusive attitudes.</p><p>The attribution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is a theoretical framework that has guided many explorations of the factors contributing to mentalillness stigma. It includes three dimensions -personal responsibility, emotional responses, and behavioral responses -and holds that individuals' perceptions of the extent to which a person with a mental illness is responsible for their condition can lead to stigmatizing emotional responses, such as anger, fear, and lack of pity. Such responses may then elicit discriminatory behaviors including coercive segregation, social distance, and the withdrawal of help. The attribution model serves as a solid foundation for stigma measurements and forms the theoretical basis for our study's deconstruction of stigma.</p><p>Virtual reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, videogames <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and social-media campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> have all shown promise for reducing mental-illness stigma by raising awareness and/or facilitating positive social contact. Chatbots have been effective at delivering such interventions, in part because they offer anonymity and encourage self-disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. However, many existing anti-stigma approaches adopt a one-size-fits-all strategy that is likely to ignore how stigma manifests differently across social contexts, potentially limiting their efficacy or even causing them to backfire <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Measuring and Deciphering Mental-illness Stigma</head><p>To develop any successful anti-stigma initiative, one must identify the factors and mechanisms that create and sustain the targeted stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. This section reviews three approaches to deciphering mental-illness stigma: traditional quantitative methods, computational techniques, and traditional qualitative analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Traditional</head><p>Quantitative Methods. Quantitative-scale protocols have been widely used to assess various components of mentalillness stigma, including behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, stereotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, cognitive separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>, emotional reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>, and status loss and discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. One notable instrument is the Attributional Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a causality tool that helps to unravel the genesis and perpetuation of stigma by assessing the key constructs defined in Corrigan et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> social-cognitive models. These tools have greatly facilitated the understanding of mental-illness stigma. Despite the widespread use of standardized self-report surveys to measure various constituents of mental-illness stigma, such instruments might under-represent the complex lived experience of stigmatizing and being stigmatized, the mechanisms of stigma's progression, or other societal aspects of these processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Moreover, this measurement approach is susceptible to social-desirability bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. That is, anti-stigma campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and other public-education efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> have emphasized the importance of not rejecting individuals simply because they have sought mental-health treatment. As a result, even if they privately hold stigmatizing attitudes, people are unlikely to express them openly, because they want to appear enlightened and caring <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. This dissimulation can lead scholars to underestimate true stigma levels and/or to misidentify genuine predictors of stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Thus, researchers should employ multiple approaches to decoding stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, develop measures that mitigate potential confounders, and explore modes of interpretation that better capture the intricacies of stigma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Computational</head><p>Techniques. Social-media platforms like Twitter and Weibo include masses of largely unfiltered qualitative data relevant to mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>. Leveraging these resources, some researchers have employed various computational techniques to analyze mental-illness stigma, studying conditions such as depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. Specifically, Fang &amp; Zhu used linguistic-analysis tools such as LIWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, while Mittal et al. developed frameworks that assess stigmatizing discourse in social media and news content by creating custom dictionaries and calculating word-embedding similarities <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.</p><p>Machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) solutions have also contributed to this field, by enabling real-time, automated mental-illness stigma detection and classification within large socialmedia datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>. These approaches range from binary 'present/ absent' classification of such stigma using algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> to more sophisticated models that use 𝑛-grams to differentiate among types of stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> or types of stigma-related language, e.g., metaphors, personal stories, ridicule, and jokes <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>.</p><p>ML and DL methods can efficiently and rapidly classify large volumes of social-media content pertinent to stigma. However, socialmedia posts provide relatively brief snippets of stigma-related discussions, and their decontextualized aggregation into datasets may fail to capture the full panorama of stigma-related interactions and their evolving dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Additionally, social-media data suffer from population biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref> that vary across platforms, potentially skewing interpretation. More importantly, these approaches mainly focus on classifying and/or quantifying words and phrases, and thus are likely to oversimplify the psychological underpinnings of stigmatizing behavior while largely ignoring its processes and triggers. Given these drawbacks, there is a pressing need for a more process-oriented analysis of stigma toward people suffering from mental illnesses in more context-rich settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Traditional</head><p>Qualitative Analysis. Human narratives are rife with psychological constructs, perceptions, and reasoning about societal topics, and act as catalysts for deep reflection and genuine free exchange of ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Interview data contain valuable information about how social problems are perpetuated, unfolded, or negotiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, reflecting the endogenous organization of social activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Such conversations naturally create a space and medium for inclusion, connection, and self-disclosure, allowing interviewers to uncover the underlying beliefs, attitudes, and experiences that shape people's perspectives and may lead to evolving consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, interviews can capture subjective experience/understanding of their focal phenomenon and the complex social systems that give rise to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. Like participant observation, interviewing can thus provide insiders' views of stigma's dynamics and impacts that rating scales or analysis of social-media data could overlook. For instance, Lyons and Ziviani <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> effectively used interviews and participant observation to track changes in stereotypical beliefs and preconceptions about the mentally ill. Liggins and Hatcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> likewise applied interviews to reveal how people express fear and hopelessness toward mental illness, and showcased the depth of the insights that qualitative analysis makes possible.</p><p>Although data from interviews can facilitate a deep understanding of social phenomena, they also pose major challenges, as collecting, coding, categorizing, and interpreting them requires substantial time, effort, and expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> as well as strong theoretical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. AI's eloquence in processing natural language makes it adept at collecting interview data <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, and its perceptiveness may enable it to streamline the analysis process while preserving the fertility of insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">AI-assisted Qualitative-data Collection and Analysis</head><p>Chatbots <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> offer a promising approach to interview-data collection for exploratory research. They can provide a middle ground between questionnaires and traditional in-person interviews, offering a more engaging experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> than the former while being more scalable than the latter. In particular, AI-powered chatbots are flexible, fast, and adaptable tools that can gather rich qualitative insights into complex social and psychological phenomena by combining gregarious interactivity with wide reach <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[122]</ref>. Moreover, AI can create materials tailored to fostering chatbot users' self-disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. While these data-collection methods provide rich qualitative information, deciphering and interpreting this wealth of data is equally crucial to unlocking its full potential. AI technologies are also revolutionizing qualitative-coding processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>, mitigating manual methods' time and resource constraints. In deductive coding, AI has applied predefined codebooks to large datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">121]</ref>, and achieved fair to substantial agreement with humanexpert coders <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>. In inductive coding, meanwhile, AI can help researchers initialize codes, uncover themes, and synthesize essences from raw data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Synergy between Large Language Models and Causal Knowledge Graphs</head><p>Importantly, however, the complex interplay of contexts, relational dynamics, and reasoning chains within qualitative data -which is particularly crucial to understand when examining intricate societal phenomena -may extend beyond what any single descriptive label can convey. This points to the need for additional, integrative approaches that are both analytical and explanatory. CKGs represent a powerful fusion of structured-information representation and intelligent reasoning, and can capture both overt and covert relationships between entities in a domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Indeed, they excel at integrating information from diverse sources, uncovering hidden patterns in it, and facilitating efficient navigation of complex knowledge landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">115]</ref>. Complementing CKGs, LLMs can access and articulate domain knowledge previously confined to human experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and excel at lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis and conceptual understanding.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY</head><p>To address the limitations of existing methods, including the lack of depth captured by questionnaire instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>, the decontextualized nature of social-media posts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and the burden of manual coding of interview transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, we propose a novel approach to automatically unraveling depression stigma -a common and representative form of mental-illness stigma -by integrating chatbot interviews (Section 3.1.1), AI-assisted qualitative coding (Section 3.1.3), and CKG construction (Section 3.2) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">AI-assisted Data Collection and Analysis Pipeline</head><p>Our three-step workflow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) combined data collection using AI-assisted interviews, human coding to develop a codebook and expert codes, and AI-assisted coding to automate the analysis to identify attributions of depression stigma. Each of these three phases is described in turn below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Data Collection.</head><p>Procedure. Data collection centered on the participants' respective 20-minute interviews with an AI-powered chatbot, for which they were compensated US$6.30. After obtaining their informed consent, we warned the participants that the upcoming interview scenario related to depression, and reiterated that they had the option to withdraw if this made them uncomfortable. Next, they provided their demographic information before proceeding to the main phase of the study, an interview with a chatbot we named Nova. Its interface can be seen in the Supplementary Materials.</p><p>Each chatbot interview started with a rapport-building smalltalk session, followed by Nova's delivery of a depression-related vignette, during which it intermittently asked the participant for brief responses. After the vignette, Nova posed open-ended questions prompting participants to share their opinions and related experiences. These core questions were split into two parts by a second brief session of small talk, aimed at re-engaging the participants with lighthearted discussion and relieving their potential emotional burdens.</p><p>After the interaction with Nova ended, all participants were debriefed about common types of stigma and the study's objectives. All materials that emanated from the chatbot were refined by a mental-health specialist (a co-author) and an external consulting psychiatrist.</p><p>Participants. We amassed participants through two online research platforms, Prolific and Qualtrics. Our inclusion criteria were that they 1) were at least 21 years old, 2) spoke English as their first language, 3) were willing to read material related to mental illness, and 4) had no immediate or urgent mental-health concerns. The last criterion is incorporated because of the potential risk that vignettes about depression could cause distress and/or trauma to participants grappling with such issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. During recruitment, we clearly outlined our research's scope and duration, and the participants' right to withdraw from it at any time. We used IP addresses to filter out potential duplicate participants.</p><p>We recruited 1,002 participants from Western countries, mostly the United States and the United Kingdom, with an average age of 46.4 (𝑆𝐷 = 16.45). They were 53.9% male, 45.9% female, and 0.2% other genders. Ethnically, 69.4% were white, 21.0% black, 4.7% Asian, and 6.0% other ethnicities. None of the participants reported having an ongoing mental illness, but 52.5% said they had close friends or family members with mental-health issues.</p><p>Vignettes. Vignettes, concise fictional narratives, are valuable research tools for exploring attitudes toward mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These stories, grounded in research and real experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>, allow research participants to respond to concrete scenarios through various feedback methods, and thus to provide researchers with insights into their perspectives. We created a vignette focused on "Avery, " a person of unspecified age and gender who was experiencing depressive symptoms. These symptoms were as set forth in the DSM-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, except that the more extreme ones such as self-harm and suicide were avoided, and no technical or medical jargon was used. The vignette, refined with expert input from our mental-health specialist and consulting psychiatrist, illustrated how such symptoms negatively impacted various aspects of Avery's life, including study, work, relationships, and interactions with others.</p><p>Specifically, all participants read the following vignette:</p><p>Avery is employed by a company, and in their spare time, they are dedicated to lifelong learning, doing extensive reading and writing. However, Avery has been diagnosed with depression recently. It has become challenging for them to concentrate, resulting in a decline in work performance and learning outcomes. Interests that once brought them joy have waned. Avery has distanced themself from friends, becoming easily irritated in social interactions with colleagues and feeling judged by others. Avery lives with family and cannot do much, especially household chores. Social media intensifies their feelings of loneliness and anger, leading to frustration about the source of the anger.</p><p>Interview Questions. To elicit the participants' opinions, we designed multiple questions adapted from Corrigan et al. 's attribution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the Attribution Questionnaire-27 (AQ-27) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which Nova posed as soon as they had finished reading the vignette. The AQ-27, developed from the attribution model, operationalized theoretical constructs into nine measurable items (i.e., blame, fear, pity, anger, helping, avoidance, coercion, segregation, and dangerousness), each assessed through three standardized survey questions. Following Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, we combined the coercion-segregation and fear-dangerousness pairs to create a more concise interview flow and adapted the survey questions into seven chatbot questions corresponding to the attributions of responsibility (i.e., blame), fear, pity, anger, helping, social distance (i.e., avoidance), and coercive segregation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We randomized the order of the questions to avoid priming effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> and embedded each question within a vivid, relatable scenario to mitigate social-desirability bias and foster more honest responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. All question selections and adaptations were validated by the mental-health specialist and consulting psychiatrist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AI-assisted Data-collection Strategies.</head><p>To facilitate self-disclosure, we employed three techniques. The first is that we formulated one to two follow-up questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> for each interview question to probe for underlying reasons, anticipated outcomes, or specific triggering scenarios. Specifically, when dealing with emotional responses (i.e., anger, fear, and pity) and responsibility attributions, Nova prompted the user to give reasons for their response if it fell below a minimumlength threshold. For behavior-related responses (i.e., coercive segregation, social distance, and helping), it asked for reasons if the response was non-stigmatizing, and for potential results if it was stigmatizing. For example, if a participant endorsed coercive segregation, Nova might ask, "What do you think would happen if Avery was not involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital?"</p><p>The second technique was active listening <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[123]</ref>: i.e., Nova restated and validated the user's viewpoint and expressed understanding of it. The third and final technique was neutral self-disclosure, in which Nova shared both positive and negative perspectives to elicit participants' disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> without shifting their attitudes (as further illustrated in the Supplementary Materials).</p><p>System Implementation. To create our AI-powered chatbot, we used the UChat platform and adopted a hybrid approach that combined pre-written scripts with AI-generated text. The smalltalk questions, vignette delivery, questions based on the attribution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and chatbot's neutral self-disclosure for each question were all pre-scripted and hard-coded. All other conversational elements, including follow-up questions and active responses to participants, were generated by the AI. We used GPT-4-1106-preview <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for generating the chatbot's text, with a maximum token limit of 100 and a temperature setting of 0.2. The chatbot interface was integrated into Qualtrics programming, and we ensured that the concurrency rate stayed below 50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Human Coding.</head><p>While AI shows promise in qualitative coding, it is crucial to have humans validate its reliability, as relying solely on AI may lead to biases and overprediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Thus, we conducted human deductive coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> to establish expert codes for AI-assisted coding, create a training dataset, and develop a codebook that could guide the research team when giving AI instructions. We formed a coding team of two members as a triangulation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>: one author with a computer-science background and a hired graduate student with social-science expertise. In line with our interview questions and the attribution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the coding scheme comprised seven stigma attributions (i.e., responsibility, anger, pity, fear, helping, coercive segregation, and social distance) and one code for non-stigmatization. The two coders coded messages from 600 randomly selected participants (a total of 4,200 messages) under the guidance of the main researcher and the mental-health specialist, using Cohen's 𝜅 as a measure of inter-rater reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>.</p><p>We developed a preliminary codebook and iteratively revised it through several rounds of coding and discussion. The two coders independently coded messages with frequent agreement checks. Starting with shorter intervals, they first coded 10 participants (𝜅 = 0.55), then another 10 (𝜅 = 0.53), followed by four sets of 20 participants each (𝜅 = 0.66, 0.79, 0.76, and 0.72). As consistency improved, they extended the intervals to two sets of 50 participants </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fear</head><p>(𝜅 = 0.74, 0.66), 100 participants (𝜅 = 0.69), and two sets of 150 participants (𝜅 = 0.69, 0.66). At each checkpoint, the two coders engaged in open discussions with the main researcher and the mental-health specialist about their coding decisions until consensus about the coding rules/specifications was reached. We achieved Cohen's 𝜅 of 0.71 across all 4,200 messages, reaching a satisfactory level <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>; and to further validate the coding quality, we randomly sampled and re-coded 50 messages from the first 700 coded messages, 40 from the next 1,400, and 10 from the last 2,100, which yielded a 𝜅 of 0.69.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">AI-assisted Coding.</head><p>To automatically assign labels indicating the presence of specific stigma attributions in each participant's messages, we employed GPT-4-Turbo. The prompt-based method we used to transform our human-developed codebook into a set of instructions for the LLM's qualitative coding, as well as the settings and metrics for the validation tests of this coding, are described below.</p><p>Prompt Curation. To be effective, our instructions to LLMs had to contain several key elements. For context, these included the vignette, chatbot questions, and participant messages. We also required the LLM to select the most appropriate code from a set of predefined options based on the constraints it was given, which comprised information about all codes, including their definitions, keywords, coding rules/specifications derived from our humandeveloped codebook, and selected examples.</p><p>We then determined the structure of the prompts based on the results of our pilot tests and prior guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">125]</ref>. We used concise language starting with action verbs and employed a multiple-choice format, transforming the coding task into a singlechoice question with a set of lettered answer options. Constraints were provided before the context to promote instruction-following, and the output format was regulated. We also asked the LLM to provide explanations for its coding decisions and framed our questions as what-is-your-prediction instead of can-you-predict <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Additionally, we utilized role-playing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, casting the LLM as a competent coder for depression stigma. To ensure reproducibility, we set the temperature to zero and generated five outputs for each message, using a majority-voting mechanism to determine the final code. The full prompt text is available in the Supplementary Materials.</p><p>Validation Settings. To validate the AI-assisted coding process, we first assessed AI-human agreement across 4,200 messages with existing human codes. We then randomly selected 25 messages per code (a total of 200 messages) from the 2,814 AI-coded messages that had not previously been human-coded and proceeded to code them, allowing us to assess AI-human agreement on previously unseen data.</p><p>We also established baselines by fine-tuning two computational models commonly used in social-media analysis: RoBERTa-base <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> and BERTweet-base <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. The 4,200 human-coded messagecode pairs (𝑚, 𝑐) were shuffled and split into 80% training and 20% test sets using stratified sampling to ensure the code distribution in both sets matched that of the complete dataset. We compared the agreement (Cohen's 𝜅) between human coding and each approach (AI-assisted coding and both baseline models) on the test set. For baseline models, we identified the optimal configuration through hyperparameter tuning: a training regime of 3 epochs (iterations) with batch sizes of 12 and 5 for RoBERTa-base and BERTweet-base respectively, along with optimized settings for learning rate, AdamW optimizer, and early-stopping criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Causal Knowledge Graph Construction</head><p>We constructed a CKG using messages collected from all 1,002 participants through our chatbot interviews, along with the results of AI-assisted coding (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). By organizing this rich interview data into a graph structure, we aimed to illustrate the mechanisms and causalities underlying stigmatizing behavioral intentions at the macro level. The relevant workflow consisted of four parts -triple extraction, ontologization, entity resolution, and conceptual-model construction -each of which is explained in detail below.</p><p>For clarity, we distinguish between three key terms in our paper: entities (individual nodes in the CKG representing specific text segments), constructs (theoretical categories to which entities are mapped), and themes (recurring patterns identified within each construct).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Triple Extraction.</head><p>To extract causal relationships, we conducted prompt-based fine-tuning using GPT-3.5-Turbo <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Specifically, for each message, we pre-specified a triple connecting stigmatization status (stigma or no stigma) to the corresponding codes obtained from human/AI coding. For example, a message classified as lacking pity would yield the triple "(stigma, because, no pity)". Separately, we fine-tuned the model to extract further causal relationships, such as the reasons behind the lack of pity.</p><p>To create annotated data, we began by manually extracting triples from 70 messages -comprising five stigmatizing and five non-stigmatizing responses to each of the seven attribution questions. We then fine-tuned the model and used it to generate triples for another 70 (random, unseen) messages. Two of the authors reviewed, curated, and corrected the model's predictions, and the corrected triples were used to refine the model further. By repeating this process for six iterations, with accuracy improving from 0.47 to 0.66, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.93 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , we covered about 5% of the dataset. During curation, we categorized model errors into five types: cause-effect reversal, logical inconsistencies, wording inaccuracies (incomplete text in entities), redundancies, and omissions. We also steered the model to consider longer causal chains.</p><p>After curating about 5% of the messages, we evaluated the model's performance without further fine-tuning by having it extract triples from 70 (new, unseen) messages and then manually assessing these extractions, achieving an accuracy of 0.93. The final model was then used to process all 7,014 messages based on its knowledge of the 420 curated messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Ontologization.</head><p>In knowledge engineering, an ontologization step is crucial to mapping extracted entities into theoretical constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>Conceptualization. We began the ontologization with conceptualization, adopting a combination of deductive and inductive coding approaches. Two authors first independently examined 50 entities, each extracted from a different message to maximize data coverage. We established an initial coding scheme based on Corrigan et al. 's attribution theory, comprising four theory-driven constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>: signaling event, cognitive mediator, affective response, and behavioral reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For each entity, two authors analyzed both the entity itself and the participant's full message as context. When encountering entities that did not fit within these predefined theoretical constructs, the two authors held regular meetings to conceptualize and develop new constructs, discussing their role in driving stigma. These newly identified constructs were then incorporated into the coding scheme.</p><p>This iterative process proceeded with 50 new entities each time until no new constructs emerged, which occurred after a total of 200 entities had been examined, achieving a Cohen's 𝜅 of 0.78, indicating an acceptable level of agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Two authors then consulted with the mental-health specialist to align the construct definition with theories (if any), refining terms such as "intention" to "motivation" to reflect motivational orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, and "nature" to "personality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. We present the full set of constructs in the next section, distinguishing between theory-driven and data-driven constructs.</p><p>LLM-assisted Construct Assignment. We then assigned these constructs to all extracted entities via prompt learning with Claude -3-Opus<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> . More specifically, we created LLM instructions that included all identified constructs and their definitions. Each construct was illustrated with examples, such as "easygoing" for the construct "personality". The LLM was instructed to output both the assigned construct and a concise justification (&lt; 20 words). We evaluated human-LLM agreement on our human-coded 200 entities and obtained a Cohen's 𝜅 of 0.77.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Entity Resolution.</head><p>To handle variations in phrasing and consolidate semantically similar entities, we performed entity resolution.</p><p>Identifying Semantically Similar Entities. The first step was to identify a set of semantically similar entities for each entity in our dataset. To calculate semantic similarity, we represented each entity as a vector using word embeddings. We used multiple embedding methods <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> to broaden the semantic coverage and potentially reduce biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> that may be present in any single embedding method. For each entity, we used each embedding method to find the 10 other entities whose semantic meanings were most similar according to their vector representations <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . We then combined all the similar entities found by different embedding methods into a single candidate set per entity.</p><p>LLM-assisted Entity Matching. In the second step, we evaluated which entities within these semantically similar sets should be merged. For each entity, we filtered its set of semantically similar entities by retaining only those mapped to the same theoretical construct. For instance, even if two entities were semantically similar, they would not be considered for merging if one was conceptualized as a cognitive judgment and the other as a signaling event. After filtering, each entity had an average of 6.74 potential matches (𝑆𝐷 = 33.08). We prompted Claude-3-Opus to determine whether each remaining entity pair should be merged <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. To assess the performance, we randomly selected 50 pairs that the LLM had deemed mergeable for evaluation by the main researcher. This yielded a Cohen's 𝜅 of 0.90 between LLM and human decisions on whether to merge entities, which indicates almost-perfect agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Conceptual-model Construction.</head><p>As a final analytic step after building CKG, our aims were to uncover themes within each construct and to map interrelationships between constructs.</p><p>Identifying Themes within Constructs. To achieve this, we first applied BERTopic <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, an advanced topic-modeling technique that leverages BERT-based deep-learning models, to each construct separately. This technique generated between 60-100 topics per construct, with the optimal number determined by coherence scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>  5 .</p><p>We then interpreted the topic-modeling results using an opencoding approach. After closely reading and familiarizing themselves with the topics generated by BERTopic, two authors independently identified a first-level code for each topic from 1) its top 10 keywords and 2) 30 of its representative messages selected at random <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Next, through collective discussion with the mental-health specialist, disagreement resolution, and iterative refinement, these 5 The technical implementation involved BERT for text embedding, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN for clustering, and TF-IDF for topic extraction. first-level codes were aggregated into overarching themes that captured the key patterns within each construct <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> .</p><p>Distilling Key Interrelationships between Constructs. To further illustrate key interrelationships between constructs, we developed rules and path-selection algorithms using a heuristic approach based on our qualitative data. We considered each relationship as a directed edge between constructs. The weight of each edge was determined by its frequency -specifically, how many participant messages contained that particular relationship. We first calculated a threshold for each construct by averaging the weights of all its outgoing edges (total weight sum divided by edge count). Next, we retained only those edges whose weights exceeded their respective construct's threshold, thus distilling the most critical relationships in our massive graph dataset.</p></div>

I might also take on responsibility for booking things if I were worried they would not get that kind of task done.</p><p>The frequent use of "I " alongside personal projections (e.g., "I might be concerned", "I might also take on responsibility") underscores the authenticity of the responses and the participants' deep engagement with the topic.</p><p>The dimensional plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> reveals words' frequencies and semantic similarities, as well as attribution-specific language patterns: e.g., "frustrating, " "embarrassment, " and "upset" clustered near the anger attribution, and "separate" and "psychiatrist" associated with coercive segregation. This clustering of semantically related terms around specific stigma attributions shows clear topical alignment, suggesting their relevance.</p><p>Finally, clarity was assessed by human coding of 4,200 messages from the randomly selected 600 participants. Only 1.12% (𝑛 = 47) were discarded for being incomplete, illegible, off-topic, or excessively brief (&lt;5 words).</p><p>Participant-experience Evaluation. The 1,002 participants' average response to a five-point Likert-scaled question about their satisfaction with the chatbot interview was 4.37 (𝑆𝐷 = 0.87), indicating highly positive sentiment toward that experience. Among the nearly half of participants who volunteered comments at the end of the chatbot survey (𝑛 = 452), many described it as enjoyable and/or one of their best survey experiences. Participants also often highlighted the thought-provoking nature of the experience. For instance, P607 noted:</p><p>Interacting with the chatbot made me stop and consider my answers, rather than just agree/disagree. It made me examine my actual reactions to a situation when the simple categories did not accurately reflect my concern over what I consider gray areas. Consistency between AI-assisted Coding and Human Coding. Of the 4,153 human-coded messages, 46.01% (𝑛 = 1, 911) included stigmatization. Among the stigmatizing codes, the most prevalent was responsibility, accounting for 9.51% (𝑛 = 395). Social distance was a close second at 9.13% (𝑛 = 379), while fear made up 8.84% (𝑛 = 367). Anger and coercive segregation constituted 7.18% (𝑛 = 298) and 6.55% (𝑛 = 272) of the codes, respectively. The leastfrequent stigmatizing codes were helping, at 3.80% (𝑛 = 158), and pity, at 1.01% (𝑛 = 42).</p><p>We calculated Cohen's 𝜅 to gauge the agreement between human and AI-assisted coding. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, we found that it varied across stigma attributions, with social distance showing the highest agreement (𝜅 = 0.76), followed by fear (𝜅 = 0.71). Responsibility and helping showed similar levels of agreement (𝜅 = 0.69), while anger (𝜅 = 0.65), coercive segregation (𝜅 = 0.54), and pity (𝜅 = 0.46) showed comparatively lower coding consistency. The overall 𝜅 across all 4,153 human-coded messages was 0.69, indicating a satisfactory level of agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> between our AI-assisted and human coding. Further, our validation on the 200 previously humanuncoded messages achieved Cohen's 𝜅 = 0.87, suggesting that our AI-coding approach was not only reliable across the entire dataset but could also be useful for real-time stigma identification given its consistency with human coding.</p><p>Comparison against Existing Computational Methods. We compared the agreement between human coding, on the one hand, and on the other, 1) our method and 2) the fine-tuned RoBERTa-base <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> and BERTweet-base <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>, on the RoBERTa-base and BERTweet -base test set of 829 messages (446 human-coded as non-stigmatizing, 79 as responsibility, 76 as social distance, 73 as fear, 60 as anger, 54 as coercive segregation, 32 as helping, and 9 as pity). Our AI-assisted coding yielded higher agreement with human coding (𝜅 = 0.78) compared to both RoBERTa-base (𝜅 = 0.68) and BERTweet-base (𝜅 = 0.62).</p><p>A Cochran's Q test revealed significant differences between the models (𝜒 2 (2) = 60.24, 𝑝 &lt; .001) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). Post-hoc analysis using pairwise McNemar tests with Bonferroni correction confirmed significant differences in agreement with human coding between our approach and both RoBERTa-base (𝜒 2 (1) = 41.00, 𝑝 &lt; .001) and BERTweet-base (𝜒 2 (1) = 36.00, 𝑝 &lt; .001). Between the baseline models, RoBERTa-base showed higher consistency with human coding than BERTweet-base (𝜒 2 (1) = 38.00, 𝑝 = .003). Detailed significance tests for each code can be found in the Supplementary Materials. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Causal Knowledge Graph Construction.</head><p>Our CKG, comprising 13,434 unique entities (reduced from 24,201 entities through entity resolution) interlinked by 18,875 relationships, provides a rich interrelational network of stigma constructs and causalities.</p><p>Constructs Assigned to Entities. Besides two predefined entities ("stigma" and "no stigma"), all entities in our dataset were mapped into 11 theoretical constructs.</p><p>Specifically, four of these constructs were theory-driven, derived deductively from Corrigan et al. 's attribution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>: signaling event, cognitive judgment, emotional response, and behavioral intention. Signaling event (𝑛 = 1,365) represented symptomatic behaviors and emotional characteristics of the person with depression depicted in the vignette (e.g., "Avery feeling judged by others", P166), whereas cognitive judgment (𝑛 = 1,505) captured participants' cognitive evaluation and/or appraisal of that person ("they are not dangerous", P360). Emotional response (𝑛 = 1,017) denoted affective reactions, feelings, and sentiments experienced by participants in response to the vignette ("feel embarrassed by Avery", P357). Behavioral intention (𝑛 = 1,607) indicated participants' anticipated behavioral responses or action tendencies toward the person in the vignette and/or people with depression in general ("ask them to leave", P370).</p><p>The remaining seven constructs emerged inductively through the data-driven conceptualization of participant messages: belief, past experience, personality, situation, potential outcome, motivation, and suggestion. Belief <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> (𝑛 = 2,534) portrayed general knowledge, literacy, attitudes, or deep-seated views about mental health or human elements that participants possess ("brain is such a complex thing", P380). Past experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (𝑛 = 782) described participants' prior self-experiences, exposures, and interactions ("previously had a colleague who had narcissistic tendencies", P226). Personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> (𝑛 = 687) depicted participants' self-reported nature, individual traits, or dispositional characteristics ("I am easy-going", P657). Situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> (𝑛 = 575) delineated participants' immediate extrinsic environmental context ("I am out at work most of the time", P346). Potential outcome (𝑛 = 1,632) involved participants' anticipation of consequences or prognoses for the figure in the vignette ("Avery will go downhill", P325). Motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> (𝑛 = 722) encapsulated participants' drives and what they were striving to achieve or avoid ("want a tenant who was more reliable", P339); and suggestion (𝑛 = 1,006), their proposed interventions or other recommendations for the figure in the vignette ("suggest meeting with a professional counselor", P524). CKG Quality Assessment. Beyond the subjective evaluations of LLM-human agreement in triple extraction (accuracy = 0.93), ontologization (Cohen's 𝜅 = 0.77), and entity resolution (Cohen's 𝜅 = 0.90) reported in Section 3.2, we further assessed our CKG's quality using objective metrics adapted from knowledge-graph-evaluation frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>  <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> .</p><p>Coverage, which refers to completeness and representativeness, was first evaluated, showing that our CKG captured much of the participants' reasoning and mental processes. For entity coverage, the text segments we extracted as entities accounted for 61.04% of all words in the original messages. Regarding relationship coverage, we captured an average of 3.94 causal relationships per message (𝑆𝐷 = 1.52) and 26.34 causations per participant (𝑆𝐷 = 6.27). For construct coverage, each message was associated with an average of 2.83 constructs defined above (𝑆𝐷 = 0.75), while individual participants expressed thoughts related to 7.94 constructs on average (𝑆𝐷 = 1.32). In addition, as discussed in Section 4.2.3, our CKG covered and made sense of several established theories of mental-illness stigma.</p><p>To evaluate coherence, we examined our CKG through the lens of consistency -whether the CKG is free of contradictions and consistent with the domain it represents -and validity. The analysis of cyclic relationships (as part of validity) revealed only eight cycles in total, traversing a small proportion (1.34%) of all entities. We speculated that most of the identified cycles represent reasonable reciprocal causation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> between constructs. Connectivity analysis (as part of internal consistency) demonstrated the CKG's strong integration: a single large connected component comprised 98.59% of the entities, while the remaining 83 small disconnected components collectively comprised only 189 entities. Further, the causal relationships in our CKG had a mean length of 2.07 steps<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> (𝑆𝐷 = 0.58), demonstrating the CKG's capacity to capture both direct causations and more complex indirect pathways that suggest potential mediating or moderating relationships between constructs.</p><p>Finally, we illustrated the potential practical utility of insights derived from our CKG by applying them to decipher individual stigmatizing attitudes, develop conceptual models, and generate hypotheses, which are presented in the next two sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Case</head><p>Studies: Participant-specific Subgraphs. We deconstructed the stigmatizing attitudes of one participant, P307, who invariably exhibited such views, illustrating the feasibility of deconstructing stigma-related patterns in real time. A parallel example in which we disentangled non-stigmatizing attitudes can be found in the Supplementary Materials.</p><p>The subgraph for P307 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>) reveals a network of negative beliefs and behaviors, including a causal chain from "choose a pessimistic response to life" to "pessimistic belief is validated by what they experience" and finally to "it is a cycle". This chain of reasoning suggests that the participant attributed the vignette character's mental-health issues to a self-perpetuating cycle of negative choices and experiences, placing responsibility on the individual.</p><p>The subgraph also depicts the participant's ambivalent feelings about helping: annoyance with the vignette's protagonist led to a reluctance to help them. Interestingly, however, there was also a path from "willing to humble myself" to "co-exist", which resulted in a behavioral intention to help. This corresponded to P307's quote, "nobody is perfect. In as much as I can be annoyed by them I am willing to humble myself enough to co-exist." Thus, while P307 is ostensibly expressing an offer of support, the causal analysis reveals a veiled microaggression.</p><p>P307 also took a somewhat paradoxical stance on coercive segregation, as evidenced by the co-occurrence of two beliefs that appear to be contradictory: "believe in solitude" and "isolation could exacerbate the depression". This was derived from the participant's statement, "I do believe in solitude but not in isolation. Avery needs solitude to introspect; however, isolation could exacerbate their depression. " So, while P307 attempted to differentiate between solitude and isolation, their reasoning still placed the onus on Avery to engage in introspection, and implied Avery's need for a space away from other people in which to do this. This causal co-action subtly reinforced the idea of hospitalization or segregation, even as the participant tried to soften it by acknowledging its potential negative outcomes. This reveals how stigmatizing attitudes can be rooted in seemingly benign intentions; and the graph highlights how stigmatizing beliefs can cascade, reinforce one another, and finally lead to discriminatory actions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Conceptual-model Construction.</head><p>After the CKG was constructed, we established rules and restructuring principles in consultation with the mental-health specialist to better theorize our 11 constructs. These stipulated that: 1) only relationships observed in at least one participant message could be included in the conceptual model; 2) potential outcome, cognitive judgment, and belief were consolidated due to their shared focus on cognitive interpretations of mental health and depression, albeit at different levels of specificity;</p><p>3) motivation and personality were combined on the grounds that they all reflect relatively dispositional, enduring, and innate traits; 4) suggestion was excluded as it primarily represented an outcome rather than a predictor of stigmatizing behavioral intentions; and 5) signaling event, past experience, personality, and situation could not be led to by other constructs, due to their innate or fixed nature, and that behavioral intention could not lead to other constructs, as our focus was on its formation. Finally, in line with attribution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we reorganized the constructs into four layers: stimuli, cognitive mediator, emotional response, and behavioral intention. Accordingly, we identified themes across 11 constructs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) that shape attitudes toward depression, which informed the development of the conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>) illustrating key causal relationships (see the Supplementary Materials for full results). Below, we discussed how this conceptual model aligned with and went beyond existing theories.</p><p>Substantiating Existing Theories. The four theory-driven constructs in our conceptual model -signaling event, cognitive judgment, emotional response, and behavioral intention -corresponded directly to those in attribution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The specific themes we identified within each construct also mirrored the theory's core findings: our cognitive-judgment themes captured assessments of personal responsibility, controllability, unpredictability, and dangerousness; emotional responses ranged from sympathy to caution and irritation; and behavioral intentions included both supportive engagement and avoidance or compartmentalization.</p><p>Our conceptual model confirmed four key pathways consistent with attribution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>: signaling events leading to both cognitive judgments (extracted from 849 participants) and emotional responses (526 participants), as well as the progression from cognitive judgments to emotional responses (514 participants) and ultimately to discriminatory behavioral intentions (65 participants). The dominance of these paths, particularly the first three, demonstrates that attribution theory's core proposition -that observable symptoms or behaviors of people with mental illness frequently trigger immediate appraisals and emotional responses, which can ultimately lead to discriminatory actions -remains crucial in explaining stigma processes.</p><p>Looking beyond attribution theory, several other stigma-related theoretical frameworks help make sense of our data-driven constructs and themes. The themes under the belief construct regarding the universality of personal struggles and the potential for anyone to experience depression align with theoretical work on destigmatization that emphasizes continuum rather than categorical beliefs about mental illness, with the former blurring the boundaries between "normal" people and those with psychiatric problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. Our themes of mental-health awareness (as evidenced by narratives equating mental health with physical health in importance) and the complexity of human nature reflect research exploring how etiological, biological, and psycho-environmental beliefs shape stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">116]</ref>.</p><p>Our personality-related constructs and themes, which captured participants' self-descriptions ranging from loyal, gregarious, and people-oriented to reserved, hardheaded, and resolute, align with research showing how openness to experience and agreeableness correlate with reduced discriminatory desires <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. In the same vein, our motivational themes, spanning from self-interest and egoism to prosocial tendencies and benevolence, correspond with theoretical work associating social dominance orientation and the desire to maintain security and social cohesion to mental-illness stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p><p>The situational themes we identified, including physical attributes and time availability, speak to theories that emphasize how environmental and demographic factors influence stigmatizing attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>; similarly, our findings about personal exposure and experiential knowledge resonate with studies showing how psychosis-like past experiences are associated with public stigma in both community and clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. All these alignments substantiate the theoretical validity and value of our CKG-derived findings.</p><p>Novel Pathways beyond Existing Theories. Uniquely, several pathways unknown to existing theories were also revealed (four dashed lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). We found that the extrinsic construct situation directly influenced behavioral intentions, with environmental contexts like time availability modulating pre-existing attitudes and shaping immediate reactions -less-busy participants, for instance, expressed greater willingness to engage with people suffering from depression. This interaction between situational factors and behavioral responses could be partly made sense of through socialcognitive theory (SCT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, which posited that general human behavior emerges from the interplay of individual characteristics, cognitive factors, and prevailing contexts. While SCT had once been applied to self-stigma research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, our findings explored its potential for understanding public stigma, revealing how SCT's situational factors and attribution theory's emotional responses can jointly shape behavioral intentions. This intersection suggests new theoretical possibilities for exploring how SCT and attribution theory intertwine in deconstructing public depression stigma.</p><p>On the other hand, while prior work had validated intrinsic factors like personality's direct influence on behavioral intentions such as social-distance desires <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>, our data suggested that personality traits may also shape such desires by modulating emotional responses (96 participants). For example, we found that selfprioritizing traits were often associated with negative emotions like anxiety or frustration, which could subsequently trigger avoidance tendencies. This pathway reflected how ingrained dispositional factors served as enduring emotional tendencies, predisposing individuals to experience and express certain emotions more readily when confronted with mental illness-related situations.</p><p>And lastly, our data highlighted that past experiences informed both cognitive judgments (136 participants) and emotional responses (74 participants), as individuals drew on their personal history to interpret new situations, often generalizing past interactions with people with depression to guide their current perceptions and feelings. Although previous research had suggested that personal experiences might influence self-protective behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>, our conceptual model generated potential hypotheses that past experiences could also likely shape such stigmatizing responses (e.g., avoidance) by simultaneously affecting cognitive appraisals (e.g., dangerousness) and emotional reactions (e.g., fear).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Summary of Results</head><p>In sum, our key findings were:</p><p>• Our AI-assisted data-collection method effectively captured stigma-related discourses, with participants reporting high satisfaction (𝑀 = 4.37/5, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.87), engaging in selfdisclosure, and providing data with high specificity, relevance, and clarity. • Our AI-assisted coding approach showed high consistency with human-expert coding (Cohen's 𝜅 = 0.69 overall), and significantly outperformed two existing computational-analysis approaches (𝑝 &lt; .001). • Our CKG, with 13,434 entities and 18,875 relationships, revealed 11 depression stigma-related constructs and their interrelationships among participants. Based on the CKG, our conceptual model identified themes and pathways that were consistent with existing theories and those that went beyond them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">AI-assisted Pipeline for Automatic Psychological-construct Decomposition</head><p>Recent HCI studies have highlighted the potential for chatbots to gather fertile data on relatively sensitive topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Our findings support this: we collected over 7,000 messages of approximately 40 words from 1,002 participants discussing mental health through short chatbot interactions averaging less than 20 minutes each. Likewise, the high consistency we observed between our AI-assisted and human coding resonates with the results of prior studies in which LLM was used to streamline the manual coding of social phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">121]</ref>. Our study enriches this body of research by developing a unified AI-assisted pipeline that integrates chatbot-based data collection with AI-assisted coding. Interestingly, consistency between AI-assisted and human coding varied across stigma attributions, with Cohen's 𝜅 ranging from as low as 0.46 to as high as 0.76. When looking into these human-AI coding divergences, we found that they probably revealed unique analytical perspectives and facilitated a deeper understanding of the socio-psychological constructs being coded. For example, when dissecting pity, the AI identified P437's statement "I feel emotional and compassionate toward her" as stigmatizing, reasoning that it could reveal underlying condescension. Although it lowered coding consistency, this insight challenged the received wisdom, which we initially endorsed, that pity is purely positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Such variations may also direct our attention to the underlying differences between human coding -which evolves through collaborative codebook creation, discussions, and oral guidance beyond written rules -and AI coding, which relies on human-written instructions and vast training-data corpora only. These observations inform future research and highlight the need to systematically examine human-AI coding mismatches, particularly in light of emerging studies of LLMs as potential replacements for human coders <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>.</p><p>This pipeline was able to both elicit and capture the participants' biased preconceptions and stigmatizing attitudes, even those they might be unconscious of. We observed entrenched stigma such as condescension ("I can open their eyes and they just need someone to guide them", P622), differential treatment ("I will learn what triggers them and walk on eggshells around them", P687), and trivialization through the dismissal of mental illness as merely a mood issue or overthinking ("Their problem can be easily overcome", P792). Uncovering these inadvertent attitudes is vital, given that people who harbor such views may unwittingly act as vectors for the spread and normalization of harmful social stigma. We therefore encourage future research to apply our proposed pipeline to nuanced conceptualizations of such microaggressions, microassaults, and microinsults, paving the way for tailored technology-enabled interventions.</p><p>In addition, our approach builds upon studies emphasizing language's role in perpetuating stigmatization of and prejudice against marginalized groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref>, with a particular focus on the value of chatbot-interview data in understanding psychological constructs such as mental-illness stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>, and as a basis to facilitate deep reflection and personal disclosure. It offers new analytical opportunities that complement digital social-media data collection: i.e., less prone to data genericization, difficulty in maintaining context at scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, proxy-population mismatch, the misidentification of bots as humans, and control of public access to data by proprietary algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. The contextual richness of our data positions our method as a powerful tool that can be expected to be used by scholars in the future to explore psycholinguistic differences between human-chatbot conversations and social media content when investigating psychological constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Partnership between LLMs and Causal Knowledge Graphs for Illustrating Psychological Models</head><p>Our large-scale CKG, featuring more than 13,000 entities and 18,000 relationships, provides a valuable database for exploring psychological mechanisms. It allowed us to unpack psychological constructs and build conceptual models that both substantiated core propositions of attribution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and other stigma-related frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref>, and also went beyond them by generating novel hypotheses such as the dual impact of past experiences on both cognitive and emotional responses. By allowing psychological constructs to emerge from attained data while being guided by social theories, our approach serves as a bridge between theory-driven methodologies and emerging data-centric paradigms in HCI and psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, revealing mechanisms that may sideline people suffering from mental illness. Here, however, it should be noted that two points clarify our study's focus. First, this paper is not to establish robust socialscience models; rather, it is to demonstrate our method's potential to extend existing theories and build new ones by rapidly generating multiple hypotheses and uncovering latent pathways. Second, we do not work with causal graphs between pairs of variables from quantitative data, as is common in previous LLM-assisted causal reasoning studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>; instead, we explore the construction of causal knowledge graphs from qualitative data, which harbor contextual insights from rich, narrative information. There are several directions for future work: explore methods to validate causal pathways that LLMs/CKGs unveil from qualitative data; systematically disentangle the concordances and discordances between the conceptual models of stigmatizing and non-stigmatizing responses; and refine our conceptual models by adding factors such as age and gender.</p><p>Additionally, our work chimes with recent studies on the synergistic potential of partnering LLMs and CKGs in social-psychological inquiry <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">114,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">115]</ref>. We have advanced this body of research by integrating node-level analysis with the extraction of overarching psychological constructs. Specifically, we integrated fine-grained LLM semantic analysis and the global perspective on causality provided by CKGs and their conceptual models, mirroring the holistic vs. analytic cognition dichotomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. Building upon this integration, the resulting large-scale CKG could provide an infrastructure for link prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, serving as a springboard for generating novel abductive hypotheses through the discovery of non-obvious or indirect causalities within the intertwined graph structure. Such methods presumably move beyond descriptive analyses like word counting and assigning brief labels to language <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to provide explanatory insights that tease apart the antecedents, facets, and consequences of psychological constructs. Fruitful avenues for future research include exploring effective retrieval methods for these CKGs; investigating their practical application by social scientists; and examining more complex relationships such as intensifying factors, protective factors, mediation processes, buffering effects, and enhancing effects in broader hyper-relational knowledge-graph contexts.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, gamebased <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) for reducing depression stigma and changing psychological constructs -an important line of HCI research -but also enable personalization, which researchers have identified as a critical need in this domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Design Implications</head><p>Our AI-assisted coding and LLM-CKG approach enable realtime identification of stigma attributions and attributing processes. This real-time detection allows designers to determine which specific micro-intervention events -highly focused, in-the-moment elements designed to promote emotional, cognitive, or behavioral change <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> -are most appropriate. For example, when detecting responsibility-related beliefs, practitioners might consider deploying targeted didactic materials that teach about the biological and environmental factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> of mental illness in the present moment. Similarly, when misconceptions about dangerousness arise, the digital system could suggest reframing exercises that tunnel the individual's focus toward alternative perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> to counteract premature negative appraisals.</p><p>In addition, our CKG shows the potential to inform therapeutic narratives and intervention delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> through its centralized knowledge structure that captures both theoretical understanding and user-specific context. Beyond conceptual models, the built CKG enables the creation of graphs of individuals' unique psychological profiles. Intervention designers could leverage these personalized graphs to customize therapeutic-session dialogues using a retrievalaugmented generation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that involves querying the CKG for relevant past experiences, belief patterns, and causal attributions.</p><p>This automated, individualized approach would allow practitioners to move beyond one-size-fits-all anti-stigma strategies that risk backfire effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> to broader context-sensitive micro-interventions aimed at dispelling myths, correcting misconceptions, and reinforcing positive beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>.</p><p>Cultural Sensitivity of AI-assisted Psychometric Analysis. Our study suggests implications for cultural-sensitive psychometric design. Because psychological constructs are deeply influenced by socio-cultural factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, the interrelationships captured in our CKG are inherently tied to our participants' cultural backgrounds. To adapt our approach to different cultural contexts, the interview protocol and AI-assisted analysis pipeline can be extended to support multilingual processing for multinational and multicultural populations; the CKG-construction methodology could be refined to capture local dialects, colloquial idioms, and vernacular that carry unique psycholinguistic nuances.</p><p>CKGs have the potential to elucidate the evolution of psychological constructs across diverse socio-cultural groups, thus enabling cross-cultural analysis of psychological mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. By applying knowledge-graph alignment techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref> to CKGs from different demographic groups (e.g., Western vs. Eastern societies, different age cohorts), researchers could discern similarities and differences in their conceptual models, revealing culture-specific patterns. Examining how our approach to deconstructing psychological constructs translates across different cultural contexts would help validate its global applicability, validity, and generalizability.</p><p>Facilitating Psychological-dataset Creation. Finally, our pioneering combination of chatbots for data collection and high-quality AI-assisted coding is scalable; addresses recent calls for developing datasets that adhere to stringent standards for expert evaluation and impact assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>; and could underpin novel approaches to creating structured, well-coded, varied datasets in psychology and related fields. This, in turn, could lay a foundation for more influential theoretical contributions in HCI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Several methodological limitations warrant discussion. First, because our approach focused on message-level stigma analysis, we could have overlooked dynamics that emerged and evolved in complex ways over the course of the entire interview <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. A valuable next step would be to explore how attitudes evolve through interviews, how different chatbot-design strategies affect participant disclosure, and how the interplay between chatbot responses and participant statements shapes the expression of stigmatizing attitudes over time. Such temporal analysis of conversation trajectories could reveal important patterns in how participants refine their views through interaction.</p><p>Second, there are potentially important differences in the dynamics of human-human and human-chatbot conversations. Factors such as non-verbal cues and the ability to pick up on tone subtleties are likely to be limited in chatbot interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Future comparative analyses of these two broad types of interaction could enhance the ecological validity of our findings and reveal differences in the disclosure and expression of beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions.</p><p>Certain limitations of the present case study should also be acknowledged. First, our participant pool was primarily from Western countries, which may have affected our ability to capture the full spectrum of culture-specific stigma-related nuances. Future research should prioritize obtaining culturally diverse samples to examine how our approach performs in different socio-cultural contexts. Second, given that our human-derived codes are themselves not infallible, more attention and analysis are needed when comparing them with AI-assisted coding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>This study has introduced a novel approach to computationally deconstructing mental-illness stigma, in which data collection via human-chatbot conversations was synergized with AI-assisted coding. Holistic modeling of the focal stigma through a combination of CKGs and LLMs represents a potential new paradigm, and has revealed interrelationships among the factors behind stigmatizing statements that expand on existing theoretical work. These results not only deepen our insights into depression stigma, but also have broader methodological and design implications for HCI and psychological research, especially technology-enabled intervention design. We call for more research to explore our proposed approach's potential to identify additional patterns and interconnections among psychological factors in real time; to examine sociocultural variation in stigma formation; and to develop targeted anti-stigma campaigns based on the causal pathways it uncovers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Methodology overview.
