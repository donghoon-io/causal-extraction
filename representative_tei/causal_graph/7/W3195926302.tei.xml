<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While biomanufacturing plays a significant role in supporting the economy and ensuring public health, it faces critical challenges, including complexity, high variability, lengthy lead time, and very limited process data, especially for personalized new cell and gene biotherapeutics. Driven by these challenges, we propose an interpretable semantic bioprocess probabilistic knowledge graph and develop a game theory based risk and sensitivity analyses for production process to facilitate quality-by-design and stability control. Specifically, by exploring the causal relationships and interactions of critical process parameters and quality attributes (CPPs/CQAs), we create a Bayesian network based probabilistic knowledge graph characterizing the complex causal interdependencies of all factors. Then, we introduce a Shapley value based sensitivity analysis, which can correctly quantify the variation contribution from each input factor on the outputs (i.e., productivity, product quality). Since the bioprocess model coefficients are learned from limited process observations, we derive the Bayesian posterior distribution to quantify model uncertainty and further develop the Shapley value based sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of estimation uncertainty from each set of model co-spectrocopy, and multiwavelength fluorescence, various multivariate data analysis approaches have been used for bioprocess PATs, including principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ayech et al., 2012)</ref>, partial least squares (PLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(De Lira et al., 2010)</ref>, clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Prinsloo et al., 2008)</ref>, multilinear regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wechselberger et al., 2012)</ref>, artificial neural network (ANN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Li and Venkatasubramanian, 2018)</ref>, genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sokolov et al., 2018)</ref>, elastic net <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Severson et al., 2015)</ref>, support vector machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Li and Yuan, 2006)</ref>, and root cause analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Borchert et al., 2019)</ref>; see an overview in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rathore et al. (2010)</ref>. However, existing PAT approaches are usually based on generalized multivariate "black-box" approaches quantifying the input-output relationship without incorporating the bioprocess mechanism information.</p><p>On the other hand, OR/OM methodology development for biomanufacturing analysis and decision making is still in its infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kaminsky and Wang, 2015)</ref>. Mixed integer linear programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lakhdar et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leachman et al., 2014)</ref>, dynamic lot size model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fleischhacker and Zhao, 2011)</ref>, and queueing network and simulation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lim et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kulkarni, 2015)</ref> have been developed to study resource planning, scheduling and material consumption in biomanufacturing. Those approaches focus on developing general methodologies without fully exploring the bio-technology domain knowledge (e.g., causal relationship, structural information of the bioprocess). Some recent works, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Martagan et al. (2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Martagan et al. ( , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Martagan et al. ( , 2018))</ref>, account for physical-chemical characteristics and biology-induced randomness in either fermentation or chromatography stage, and develop Markov decision models to optimize the corresponding operational policies.</p><p>For complex systems, Bayesian network (BN) can be used to combine the expert knowledge with data and facilitate data integration and process analysis in various applications. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wang et al. (2018)</ref> proposed a BN based knowledge management system for additive manufacturing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Troyanskaya et al. (2003)</ref> introduced a BN that combines evidence from gene co-expression and experimental data to predict whether two genes are functionally related. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moullec et al. (2013)</ref> provided a BN approach for system architecture generation and evaluation, and Telenko and Seepersad ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) applied probabilistic graphical model to study how the usage context factors, including human factors, situational factors, and product design factors, impact on the energy consumption of the lightweight vehicle to guide usage scenarios and vehicle designs. Furthermore, Bayesian posterior and belief propagation based risk assessment has been studied in information system security <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Feng et al., 2014)</ref>, water mains failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kabir et al., 2015)</ref>, and supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ojha et al., 2018)</ref>. Motivated by these studies, we propose a Bayesian network for modeling the complex interdependence of production process parameters and bio-drug properties, which can fully utilize the structural knowledge and causal relationship, and integrate the data from end-to-end bioprocess.</p><p>Finally, we briefly discuss the related literature on sensitivity analysis; see the review <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Borgonovo and Plischke, 2016)</ref>. The existing sensitivity analysis studies associated with Bayesian network tend to systematically vary one of network's parameter at a time while fixing the other parameters and then obtain analytic expressions for the sensitivity functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Van der Gaag et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Castillo et al., 1997)</ref>. In our case, we are interested in stochastic uncertainty contributed by each factor, which is closely related to global probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Existing literature on global sensitivity analysis can be divided into several categories, including: (1) regression based methods, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Helton (1993)</ref>, which use the standardized regression coefficients as sensitivity measure; (2) variance based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wagner, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sobol, 1993)</ref> which assess the contribution of each random input based on expected reduction in model output variance; (3) functional ANOVA decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rabitz and Aliş, 1999)</ref> which provides variance decomposition under independence through high dimensional model representation theory; (4) density-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhai et al., 2014)</ref> that directly quantify the output density without reference to a particular moment. Since the commonly used variance-based sensitivity measures (i.e., first-order effects and total effects) fail to adequately account for probabilistic dependence of inputs and process structural interactions or interdependencies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Owen (2014)</ref> introduced a new sensitivity measure based on the game theory, called the Shapley Value (SV). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Song et al. (2016)</ref> further analyzed this measure and proposed a Monte Carlo algorithm for the estimation of Shapley values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lundberg and Lee (2017)</ref> pro-posed Shapley value based unified framework for interpreting predictions. Inspired by these studies, building on the proposed BN-based bioprocess knowledge graph characterizing the process causal interdependencies, we introduce SV-based probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess the contribution or criticality of each random input (e.g., CPP and CQA ) on the output variance, while accounting for the impact of model estimation uncertainty associated with each set of model coefficients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">| PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND PROPOSED FRAMEWORK</head><p>We create a probabilistic graph model characterizing the risk-and science-based understanding of causal interdependencies between bioprocess CPPs/CQAs, and then propose risk and sensitivity analyses for integrated biomanufacturing process, accounting for model uncertainty. This study can: (1) provide a reliable guidance on process specification, CPPs/CQAs monitoring, and most informative data collection; (2) facilitate production stability control and quality-by-design (QbD); and (3) accelerate real-time release, speed up the time to market, and reduce the drug shortage.</p><p>An illustration of biomanufacturing process is provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> with a fish bone representation of bioprocess input factors introduced in each unit operation impacting on the outputs. The biomanufacturing process typically has several main unit operations, including: (1) media preparation, (2) inoculum fermentation, (3) main fermentation, (4) centrifugation(s), (5) chromatography/purification, (6) filtration, (7) fill and finish, and (8) quality control. Steps (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">3</ref>) belong to upstream cell culture, Steps (4)-( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) belong to downstream target protein purification, and Steps ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">7</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">8</ref>) are for finished drug filling/formulation and final product quality control testing.</p><p>The interactions of many factors impact the variability of outputs (e.g., drug quality, productivity). They can be divided into CPPs and CQAs in general; see the definitions of CPPs/CQAs in ICH Q8(R2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guideline et al. (2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CPP:</head><p>At each process unit operation, CPPs are defined as critical process parameters whose variability impacts on product CQAs, and therefore should be monitored and controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality.</p><p>CQA: A physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality.</p><p>Since the raw material attributes are outputs of release materials, they should be considered along with CPPs as impacting process variability. We represent the system output (e.g., product CQAs, productivity) with a random variable, denoted by Y , which depends on CPPs/CQAs inputs, denoted by X, and other uncontrolled/uncontrollable input variables (e.g., contamination), modeled by residuals e. We represent the impact of complex interactions of input factors (X, e) throughout the production process on the response by Y = g (X, e |θ θ θ), where the unknown function g (X, e|θ θ θ), specified by model coefficients θ θ θ, models the complex interactions of integrated bioprocess and characterizes the impact of random inputs (X, e) on the output Y . For notation simplification, we consider the unit-variate response/output in the paper, and the proposed framework can be naturally extended to a vector of responses.</p><p>To provide the risk-and science-based production process understanding and guide the reliable process development, we need to correctly quantify all sources of uncertainties. There are two types of uncertainty: (1) bioprocess inherent stochastic uncertainty from CPPs/CQAs and other uncontrolled variables (i.e., randomness of X and e), which can be reduced by the identification of missed CPPs and tighter specification of selected CPPs; and (2) model uncertainty (MU) (i.e., the estimation uncertainty of bioprocess model coefficients θ θ θ), which can be reduced by collecting F I G U R E 1 An illustration of general biomanufacturing process and fish-bone representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Walsh, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>"most informative" process observations. Correctly quantifying all sources of uncertainty can facilitate learning, guide risk elimination/control, and improve robust, automatic, and reliable bioprocess decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Review of Game Theory based Sensitivity Measure -Shapley Value</head><p>In game theory, the Shapley value (SV) was originally introduced to evaluate the contribution of a player in a cooperative game <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Shapley (1953)</ref>. A cooperative game is defined as a set of players K = {1, 2, . . . , K }, with a function c ( •) that maps a subset of players to its corresponding payoff, c : 2 K → with c (∅) = 0, where 2 K denotes the power set of K (i.e., the set of all subsets of K). Thus, c ( J) characterizes the total gain that the players in subset J ⊂ K can obtain by cooperation. The SV of player k ∈ K with respect to c ( •) is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Sh k = J⊂K/{k } (K -| J | -1)! | J |! K ! [c ( J ∪ {k }) -c ( J) ] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where K = | K | is the total number of players and | J | is the size of subset J from K/{k }. This SV can be interpreted as the average incremental payoff by including player k over all possible cooperation group formations, i.e., J ⊂ K/{k }, and Sh k can be used to measure the contribution of the player k . This assessment approach satisfies the "efficiency property" that the sum of the SVs of all players equals the gain of the grand coalition, i.e., c ( K) = K k =1 Sh k . The Shapley value was recently introduced for global sensitivity analysis to measure the variance of output contributed by each random input <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Owen, 2014)</ref>. Denote the set of inputs as U K = {U 1 , U 2 , . . . , U K }, and model the output V = η (U K ) as a function η ( •) of the inputs, accounting for their interactions. Two most commonly used variance-based sensitivity measures are: (1) the first-order effect O k ≡ Var(V ) -E[Var(V |U k ) ] that considers the variance reduction when we fix U k ; and (2) the total effect T k ≡ E[Var(V |U -k ) ] that considers the expected remaining variance when all other factors, denoted by U -k , are fixed. However, both measures fail to appropriately quantify the sensitivity or variance contribution when there exist probabilistic interdependence among inputs and process structural interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Song et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Built on the SV from game theory, given a cooperative game with inputs U K as the players and the payoff as the incremental variance in output V induced by any index subset J ⊂ K, one can define the payoff function as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c ( J) = Var(V ) -E[Var[V |U U U J ] ] or c ( J) = E[Var[V |U U U -J ] ].</formula><p>(2) Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Owen (2014)</ref> introduced a new SV-based sensitivity measure, with Sh U k ,V computed by Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and (2).</p><p>In this paper, we use c <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), which can simplify the computation of the contribution from any random input U k on the output variance Var(V ), Sh U k ,V = Sh k . The SV-based sensitivity analysis overcomes the limitations of first-order effect and total effect measures by accounting for the interdependence of inputs and process interactions. The variance of output V can be decomposed into the contribution from each random input U k and we can define the criticality as the proportion of Var(V ) contributed from U k , denoted by p U k ,V ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( J) = E[Var[V |U U U -J ] ] in Equation (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">Var(V ) = K k =1 Sh U k ,V and p U k ,V = Sh U k ,V Var(V ) .</formula><p>The main benefits of SV over first-order and total effect sensitivity measures include: (1) the uncertainty contributions sum up to total variance of output; and (2) SV can automatically account for probabilistic dependence and structural interactions occurring in the complex production process. The "correct" process model coefficients, denoted by θ θ θ c , characterizing the bioprocess underlying probabilistic interdependence, is unknown and estimated by using the real-world process data, denoted by X. Given limited historical process data, the model risk or estimation uncertainty can have a large impact on the bioprocess risk and sensitivity analyses. Since the estimation uncertainty of model coefficients at different parts of bioprocess can be different and interdependent, the model uncertainty (MU) is quantified with the joint posterior distribution p (θ θ θ | X).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Summary of Proposed Interpretable Bioprocess Model, Risk and Sensitivity Analyses for Integrated Bioprocess Stability Control</head><p>We further develop the SV-based sensitivity analysis to study the impact of model uncertainty from each part of process in Section 6, which can guide the "most informative" data collection to reduce the impact from model risk and efficiently improve the accuracy of bioprocess risk analysis and critiality assessment, especially for those factors contributing the most to the output variance. For any random input W k , the Shapley value Sh W k ,Y is estimated with error, which can be contributed by the model coefficients located along the paths propagating the uncertainty of W k to the output Y , denoted by θ θ θ (W k ,Y ). We introduce the BN-SV-MU sensitivity analysis to provide the comprehensive study over the impact of model uncertainty,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Var * [Sh W k ,Y | X ] = θ ∈θ θ θ (W k ,Y ) Sh * θ Sh W k ,Y θ θ θ (W k ,Y ) X = θ ∈θ θ θ (W k ,Y ) Sh * θ Sh W k ,Y X ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the subscript " * " represents any measure calculated based on the posterior p (θ θ θ | X) and Sh * θ [ • | X ] measures the contribution from coefficient estimation uncertainty of θ ∈ θ θ θ (W k ,Y ). In the proposed interpretable bioprocess model, θ can be interpreted as certain mechanistic coefficients (e.g., cell growth rate in the cell culture). Thus, the decomposition in (3) provides the detailed information on how the model uncertainty of each part of integrated production process influences the estimation uncertainty of Sh W k ,Y .</p><p>To illustrate the key ideas of the proposed bioprocess risk and sensitivity analyses, we use a simplified monoclonal antibody (mAbs) drug substance production example, including main fermentation, centrifuge, chromatograph, and filtration; see the interactions in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We consider the dominant CPPs/CQAs in each step, while the impacts of remaining factors are included in e. We are interested in the variance contribution (or criticality) from each CPP to drug substance protein content Y = X 20 , and also account for the impact of model uncertainty on criticality assessment.</p><p>F I G U R E 3 An example illustration visualization of the integrated bioprocess sensitivity framework for criticality assessment and model uncertainty.</p><p>The results of risk and sensitivity analyses can be visualized along the graph model for this bioprocess example; see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The process knowledge graph model is specified by coefficients, θ θ θ = (µ µ µ,v v v 2 , β β β ), where µ µ µ and v v v 2 are the mean and variance vectors of all factors (listed in the table), and β β β quantifies the effects from parents' nodes on each child node. The darkness of nodes indicates the criticality level of process factors, which can guide the better bioprocess specification. The results show that X 4 contributes to 55% variance of X 20 . In addition, the darkness of directed edges and circle boundaries indicates the distribution of model uncertainty in the process. For instance, the variance of dissolved oxygen in bioreactor, v 2 4 , has dominant model uncertainty impact on the estimation uncertainty of criticality p X 4 ,Y , which suggests additional data should be collected to improve the estimation of v 2 4 . We will revisit this example and use it to study the performance of proposed framework in Section 7.1. bioprocess probabistic knowledge graph, which can characterize the complex CPPs/CQAs causal interdependencies and support flexible modular biomanfuacturing development.</p><p>By exploring the causal relationships and interactions, we consider bioprocess ontology-based data integration, which can connect all distributed and heterogeneous data collected from bioprocess; see more description in Online Appendix A. This relational graph can enable the connectivity of end-to-end process. Nodes represent factors (i.e., CPPs/CQAs, media feed, bioreactor operating conditions, other uncontrolled factors) impacting the process outputs, and the directed edges model the causal relationships. Within each module, which can be each phase of cell culture process (such as cell growth and production phases) or each unit operation, we can model complex interactions, e.g., biological/physical/chemical interactions. In the relational graph, the shaded nodes represent the variables with real-world observations, including the testing and sensor monitoring data of CPPs/CQAs for raw materials, operation conditions, and intermediate/final drug products. The unshaded nodes represent variables without observations and residuals, including quality status of intermediate and final drug products, and other uncontrollable factors (e.g., contamination) introduced during the process unit operations. Since bio-products have very complex structures, we cannot observe the underlying complete quality status and the monitoring of CQAs can carry partial information. Building on the bioprocess relational graph, we develop a BN based probabilistic graphical model composing of random CPPs/CQAs/residuals factors and their conditional dependencies via directed edges. It can characterize the probabilistic causal interdependencies among all factors of integrated bioprocess.</p><p>To make it easy to follow, we first provide a simple illustration example of cell culture process, including two phases, to present the key ideas of modular bioprocess modeling, and then develop the complete probabilistic knowledge graph model for general integrated bioprocess. Specifically, we use a simple bioreactor fermentation example with two phases (i.e., cell growth and production phases; see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) to illustrate the probabilistic graphical model development.</p><p>It is based on the causal relationships and interactions between CPPs and CQAs. Each node represents a CPP/CQA with a random variable X modeling its variability. Each directed edge represents the causal impact of parent node X i on child node X j . The pattern-fill nodes (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ) represent the CPPs. The solid fill nodes (X 6 , X 7 ) represent the monitored CQAs of intermediate materials and drug products. The nodes X 4 and X 5 represent the underlying status of working cells after cell growth phase and the protein/impurity structure after cell production phase. The CQAs X 6 and X 7 represent the partial information of quality variables X 4 and X 5 . Except the CPPs X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , the impacts from other uncontrolled factors introduced during two phases of cell culture are modeled through e 4 and e 5 .</p><p>F I G U R E 4 Left: knowledge relational graph; Right: simplified knowledge graph.</p><p>Since it is hard to uniquely specify the underlying cells/proteins with very complex structures, X 4 and X 5 are hidden, which can lead to an identification issue. Typically, the non-identifiable BN with hidden nodes is transformed to the equivalent BN by structural simplification to avoid analytical issues (see Chapter 19 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Koller and Friedman (2009)</ref>). Thus, we simplify and transform the relational graphical model to a graph without hidden nodes, depicted in the right panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The new residual e 6 in updated graph accounts for both original residual e 4 and also the uncertainty of underlying cell health status, X 4 , impacting on CQA X 6 , similar for new residual e 7 . According to the right plot in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the sources of bioprocess stochastic uncertainty impacting on the variability of X 7 include CPPs, (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ), and other factors with the impact represented by residuals (e 6 , e 7 ). Thus, we have CPPs X 1 , X 2 as inputs and CQA X 6 as output for the first cell growth phase, and have CQA X 6 and CPP X 3 as inputs and X 7 as output for the second protein production phase. To study the impact of each CPP on the CQA of interest (i.e., X 6 and X 7 ), we can decompose the variance of X 6 and X 7 into the contributions from X 1 , X 2 and X 3 , and remaining parts coming from e 6 and e 7 ; see the process risk and sensitivity analyses in Section 5. In this way, we can identify the main sources of uncertainty and quantify their impacts, which can guide the CPPs/CQAs specifications and the quality control to improve the product quality stability. Now we describe the BN-based bioprocess model for general situations. Suppose that the integrated bioprocess can be represented by a probabilistic graphical model with m + 1 nodes: m process factors (denoted by X) and a single response, denoted by Y , such as the impurity concentration or protein content.

The modular bioprocess probabilistic knowledge graph can be modeled by marginal and conditional distributions of each node as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X k ∼ N (µ k , v 2 k ) for CPP X k with k = 1, 2, . . . , m p ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">X k = f (P a (X k ); θ θ θ k ) + e k for CQA X k with k = m p + 1, . . . , m + 1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where N (u, v 2 ) denotes the normal distribution with mean u and variance v 2 , and P a (X k ) denotes the parent nodes of X k .

It also makes the process risk and sensitivity analyses tractable.</p><p>The proposed probabilistic knowledge graph is a hybrid model of integrated bioprocess, which can leverage the existing mechanisms and learn from real-world process data. Basically, the prior of the function f ( •) in a generalized regression model ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">5</ref>) can be specified based on the existing knowledge on underlying bioprocess mechanisms (e.g., biophysicochemical kinetics) within each module of bioprocess; see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kyriakopoulos et al.

We first consider the cell exponential growth mechanism for the fermentation step, x = x 0 e µt , where x 0 and x denote the starting and ending cell densities, and µ is the unknown growth rate. This is a commonly used mechanism model in biomanufacturing industry; see more information in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doran (2013)</ref>. Suppose that there is a fixed cell culture duration t . By doing the log transformation and setting X k = log(x 0 ), X k +1 = log(x ) and β 0 = µt , we can take the exponential growth mechanism as prior and get the hybrid probabilistic model for the exponential growth phase in fermentation or cell culture process,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">X k +1 = β 0 +X k +e k ,</formula><p>where e k represents the residual term characterizing the integrated effect from many other factors and it follows a</p><p>Gaussian distribution by following CLT. Notice that it is a special case of BN-based process model ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>). The similar idea can be applied to the situations where we have PDE/ODE-based bioprocess kinetics mechanism models,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d d t x (t ) = f (x (t ); θ t ) ≈ x (t k +1 ) -x (t k ) t k +1 -t k = f (x (t k ); θ t k ),</formula><p>where x (t ) can represent the concentrations of protein and metabolite waste at time t and θ t can denote the nonstationary growth rate. We can take the existing mechanism model as the prior knowledge of production process. By applying the finite difference on the gradient dx (t )/d t and first-order Taylor approximation on function f ( •), we can construct a probabilistic hybrid model matching with the formula in Equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), which can leverage the information from existing PDE/ODE-based bioprocess kinetics mechanism models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">| EMPIRICAL STUDY</head><p>To assess the performance of proposed risk and sensitivity analyses, we first consider an integrated biomanufacturing process with simulated data in Section 7.1. Then, we study the performance by utilizing the real-world process data collected from a cell culture process with multiple stages in Section 7.2. Even though there are many factors impacting on the biomanufacturing outputs, the amount of real-world bioprocess observations is often very limited. Therefore, it is important to explore the causal relationships of the biopharmaceutical production process, which can reduce the model uncertainty, increase the interpretability for process sensitivity analysis, and guide the decision making to improve the production stability.</p></div>

This multiple-phase cell culture process includes seed culture, cell growth and production processes. In the seed culture, the thawed seed vial solution of Y. lipolytica strain is transferred to a shake flask containing seed culture medium, and then grown at 30°C</p><p>and 280 rpm until cell concentration reaches around 2-5 in OD600 (optical density measured at a wavelength of 600 nm), which usually takes 18-24h (hours). In the Fed-Batch Fermentation, the seed culture (50 mL) is first transferred to the bioreactor, which contains the initial fermentation medium (600 mL) and initial substrate (here we use 35g/L soybean oil). The feeding starts when the substrate concentration decreases below 20g/L, while the rate is adjusted to maintain the concentration of substrate about 20 g/L. During the fermentation, the dissolved oxygen level, denoted by pO 2 , is set around 30% of air saturation by cascade controls of agitation speed between 500 and 1,400 rpm, and the aeration rate is fixed at 0.3 L/min. The pH is controlled at 6.0 during 0-12h, then increased to 7.0 in 6 hours, and maintained at 7.0 in the remainder of run by feeding KOH (i.e., feed of base). The temperature is maintained at 30°C</p><p>for the entire run. At several middle points of each run, the bioreactor state is estimated by using pH/pO 2 probes and off-line sample measurement for residual substrate, which can guide the adjustment of operation decisions (i.e., feed rate).</p><p>In this real case study, we focus on the critical CPPs during the fed-batch fermentation, including cell concentration after seed culture process, feed rate, dissolved oxygen (pO 2 ), and residual oil. We consider main CQAs related to cell (i.e., total cell biomass) and productivity (i.e., total CA production). Experiments are conducted in Dr. Dongming Xie's Lab to generate process data generate the data X with R = 8 batches during 140 hours; see the data in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. We want to study how the CPPs at different time contribute to the variation of intermediate and final CQAs outputs, while evaluating the impact from model uncertainty.</p><p>Based on the interactions of CPPs/CQAs, we develop the BN-based bioprocess probabilistic model with 62 nodes; see the illustration in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. We first estimate the expected criticality E[p W k ,X i ] by using B posterior samples of model <ref type="figure">B</ref>, with B = 1000. We record the results in terms of percentage (%) in Tables <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">6</ref> for cell biomass and CA production respectively with each row and column corresponding to random input W k and output X i . In addition, the overall impact of model uncertainty on the CPPs/CQAs criticality assessment can be quantified by the posterior standard deviation (SD), which can be estimated by, SD</p><formula xml:id="formula_84">coefficients, E[p W k ,X i ] = 1 B B b=1 p W k ,X i ( θ θ θ (b ) ) × 100% with θ θ θ (b ) ∼ p (θ θ θ | X) for b = 1, . . . ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_85">[p W k ,X i ] = 1 (B -1) B b=1 p W k ,X i θ θ θ (b ) -pW k ,X i 2 × 100%, where pW k ,X i = 1 B B b=1 p W k ,X i ( θ θ θ (b ) ).</formula><p>The results of SD are recorded in the bracket in Tables <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">6</ref>. Due to the space limit, we only provide the dominant (high criticality level) part of time points. We also study the subplots and assess the impact from intermediate CQAs (biomass and CA amount) as inputs on the following output variation in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>.</p><p>F I G U R E 6 Data of citric acid fed-batch fermentation case study.  The results in Tables <ref type="table">5</ref> and<ref type="table">6</ref> show that the variations of residual oil and feed rate in the cell growth phase (about from time t = 23h to 28h) have dominant impact on both intermediate and final cell biomass and CA productivity. As fermentation time further increases, the criticality level of input factors W k on the output X i , CA production, tends to decrease. It matches well with the data in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the cell growth and production both become slower and more stable.</p><p>This observation suggests that controlling the CPPs (i.e., feed rate and residual oil) to ensure the good cell growth stage is more important in order to improve the process stability. For the cell total biomass output in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, since the residual oil generates the scattering particles impacting on OD600 and cell biomass measurement accuracy, this effect becomes larger as the residual oil increases, which explains the high contribution of residual oil at the end of process (i.e., rOil_102) to the final cell biomass measurement variation.</p><p>By studying the subplots, we study the impact of middle step CQAs (i.e., cell biomass and CA amount in the cell growth and production phases) on the final output variation. We record the results in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. As the fermentation time t increases, the explained variations of final biomass and CA by current values increase. They reach to around 70% for biomass and 90% for CA at time t = 95h. This observation is consistent with the data in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and the growth of biomass/CA is relative slow in the periods after it. However, compared with CA, biomass has relatively larger prediction variation even in the later stages of production, which can be explained by the measurement errors of Cell OD induced by large amount of residual oil. In terms of biomass impacting on final CA (or CA impacting on biomass), the most critical part is biomass at time t = 34h (or CA amount at t = 47.5h). Since cell growth needs nitrogen, the production phase usually starts when nitrogen concentration becomes small. During those periods (around 30h to 50h), nitrogen from the initial medium is consumed and both intracellular lipid (which becomes part of biomass) accumulation and extracellular CA production are induced by nitrogen limitation. It can be also observed in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, where the sudden increase of CA total slopes happens around 30h to 50h, whose variations have critical contribution to final CA output uncertainty.</p><p>We also conduct the sensitivity analysis studying the impact of model uncertainty on the CPPs/CQAs criticality assessment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">| CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Driven by the critical challenges in biomanufacturing, we create an integrated bioprocess knowledge graph and propose interpretable risk and sensitivity analyses, which can provide the production process risk-and science-based understanding, guide the CPPs/CQAs specifications and production stability control, and facilitate the process development. Since hundreds of factors can impact on the product quality and productivity, and also the amount of process observations is often very limited, we explore the process interactions and causal relationships, and then develop a Bayesian network (BN) based probabilistic knowledge graph characterizing the causal interdependencies of production process CPPs/CQAs. Building on the knowledge graph, we propose the BN-SV based sensitivity analysis to assess the criticality of each random input factor on the variance of intermediate/final product quality attributes by using the Shapley value (SV), which can correctly account for input interdependencies and process structural interactions.</p><p>We further introduce the BN-SV-MU sensitivity analysis, which can provide the comprehensive understanding on how the estimation uncertainty of each part of process model coefficients impacts on the production risk analysis and CPPs/CQAs criticality assessment. It can guide bioprocess sensor monitoring and "most informative" data collection to facilitate bioprocess learning and model uncertainty reduction. Both simulation and real case studies are used to demonstrate the promising performance of proposed bioprocess risk and sensitivity analyses.</p></div>

Nodes represent factors (i.e., CPPs/CQAs, media feed, bioreactor operating conditions, other uncontrolled factors) impacting the process outputs, and the directed edges model the causal relationships. Each dashed block could represent a module, which can be each phase or each unit operation. In this relational graph, the shaded nodes represent the variables with real-world observations, including the testing and sensor monitoring data of CPPs/CQAs for raw materials, operation conditions, and intermediate/final drug products. The unshaded and dashed nodes represent variables without observations and residuals, including the complete quality status of intermediate and final drug products, and other uncontrollable factors (e.g., contamination) introduced during the process unit operations.</figDesc><graphic coords="33,40.54,244.69,403.66,196.71" type="bitmap" /></figure>

In Section D.1, we first provide the derivation for conditional posterior distribution with complete production process data described in Section 6.1. Considering the situations where we could have some additional incomplete batch data (e.g., batches in the middle of production or thrown away at certain production step based on the quality control strategy), we further extend the Bayesian learning approach to cases with mixing data in Section D.2.
