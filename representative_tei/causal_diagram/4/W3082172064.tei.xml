<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIST OF TABLES</head><p>where students were asked to interpret each part of a diagram about the ETC process.</p><p>Considering only the effect of treatments on score gain, regular and challenge groups reached higher scores in the posttest in comparison to the pretest after playing Electron Chute in both section of the test. However, the effect of treatments between the classes for each treatment was inconclusive. In the essay, the score gain was higher in the challenge than the regular class, but there was not a significant difference between both classes in the multiple-choice section. In regard to the learning outcomes, the initial model provided by the ETC video was mostly effective on addressing the misconception related to the oxygen production, which derives from the photolysis -or splitting-of the water molecules. Playing Electron Chute was effective on addressing most of the misconceptions targeted in the instruction design used for study. Most of these misconceptions were related to ATP and NADPH production and the cell structures where the ETC process takes place. At the end of the video+game learning treatment, a survey was used to collect data about students' experiences while playing the game. The majority of students agreed that playing the game increased their ability to explain how plants use light energy, but only about a third of them felt they could explain how ETC worked. Enjoyment and need for more explanations were different between students who attended the regular and challenge classes. The majority of the students who attended a regular class indicated they liked the ETC video and playing Electron Chute, percentage of agreement that was significantly higher than students who attended the challenge class.</p><p>As a result, more students in the regular class indicated an interest in learning other science concepts like ETC. Students who attended the regular class reported that clear rules about how to play the game were helpful for learning. Further, the challenge group indicated the video and the Electron Chute game could include more explanations. These results suggest the video and game learning experience has the potential for engaging students' interest in science when they participated in a regular class. This study also demonstrates a principled approach for designing a video and game to illustrate important methods for creating content knowledge that supports students' ability to make sense of how complex systems work. Through more refinements of the game, the learning experiences could be a viable learning experience that accommodates the needs of a diverse population of students who might prefer different learning methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background of the Problem</head><p>The present work develops and explores an instructional approach for promoting middle school students' learning of an energy transformation process in a biological system in photosynthesis. The energy transformation process is known as electron transport chain (ETC) and refers to a chain of reactions involving a flow of electrons that in plants is activated by sunlight energy. One of the learning outcomes for eighth grades in life sciences is photosynthesis <ref type="bibr">(National Research Council, 2012)</ref>. The learning experiences in middle school science lessons about photosynthesis teach basic facts of plant structure and the role of plants in taking in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the environment and releasing oxygen (O 2 ) to it for human consumption -Indiana Academic Standards-Biology Standard 2 (Indiana Department of <ref type="bibr">Education, 2016)</ref>. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for the life sciences-LS1.C: organization for matter and energy flow of organisms-indicates as a discipline core idea the learning of how organisms obtain and use the matter and energy they need to live and grow <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(NGSS, 2013)</ref>. Specifically, for middle school students, the LS1.C states that plants use the energy from sunlight, water and CO 2 to synthesize carbohydrates, and releases O 2 through photosynthesis <ref type="bibr">(NGSS, n.d.)</ref>. However, few lessons provide a more comprehensive model of how plant organisms transform sunlight (electromagnetic) energy into chemical energy for their own survival. The ETC process in photosynthesis is important for plants because it is the mechanism used by plants to transform the electromagnetic energy from the sun into the chemical energy plants needs to form plant matter, build cell structures, and it maintains plants' activities to survive <ref type="bibr">(Lawlor &amp; Cornic, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Middle school students need to develop a more comprehensive model of how the energy transformation process in plant photosynthesis works and clarify their misconceptions about photosynthesis. The challenge is identifying learning experiences that make abstract processes that occur at the cellular level like ETC in photosynthesis accessible to young learners. The premise is that by making it more accessible, more students will engage in the activity and increase their ability to explain the phenomenon and their interest in pursuing other scientific endeavors <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Honey &amp; Hilton, 2011)</ref>. Many middle school students are finalizing their decision to pursue a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) career before they enter high school <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Honey, Pearson, Schweingruber, 2014)</ref>. Therefore, often middle school is the last chance to influence students to consider tracking themselves into STEM pathways. For that reason, instructional methods that can increase students' abilities and interest in science must occur at the middle school level if there is any chance of increasing the number of students pursuing it <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Honey, Pearson, Schweingruber, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>One conjecture for using serious games in formal educational is that the informal activity of game play is engaging to more learners because it is fun <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Elias, Garfield, Gutschera &amp; Whitley, 2012)</ref> and less school-like <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gee, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, this kind of informal learning experience can be a satisfying inroad to complex ideas for students who may need a different approach for learning.</p><p>The present research uses visual representations to foster learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gordin &amp; Pea, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2002)</ref> because they provide a knowledge structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref>, help learners assimilate considerable amount of information in a short period of time and support students to create their own model or schema <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kraidy, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The visual representations were part of a video and a serious game about the ETC process created by the researcher.</p><p>The ETC video was used to familiarize students with the transition from macro (environment, plant, leaves) to micro (cells, chloroplast, thylakoid membrane, electrons) levels in photosynthesis. The ETC video started with the absorption of sunlight by a plant's leaf, continue with the absorption of sunlight by the chloroplast structures known as thylakoids, and ended with the production of two molecules -Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Nicotinamide Adenine Phosphate (NADPH)-because of the flow of electrons activated by sunlight. The ETC video showed step by step the process of the flow of electrons through the thylakoid membrane and it was the basic representation for the development of the game. More information about the design of the ETC video is provided in Chapter 2.</p><p>Serious games are educational games designed to engage students in learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aldrich, 2009)</ref>. Serious games provide one method for achieving formal learning outcomes through more informal learning experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gee, 2003)</ref>. They provide a constructivist learning environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hainey, Connolly, Stansfield &amp; Boyle, 2011)</ref> and engage students in the learning process <ref type="bibr">(Annetta, 2010)</ref>. Serious games support science understanding by allowing learners to visualize a phenomenon in the classroom and mentally create a link between the representation and the unseen process <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Honey &amp; Hilton, 2011)</ref>. The serious game developed for this study was a board game consisting of a visual representation at the molecular level of the ETC process with particular features that helped students acquire vocabulary about the energy transformation process. The game actions were analogous to the movement and reactions associated with the flow of electrons in the ETC process that transforms sunlight energy into chemical energy (ATP).</p><p>The game actions were developed to support students' ability to interpret and explain the ETC process. The board game was called Electron Chute.</p><p>The premise for using a video and serious game as learning experiences comes from knowing how students learn to support their future inquiry <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bransford, Brown, Cocking, Donovan, &amp; Pellegrino, 2000)</ref>. The learning activities of the ETC video and the Electron Chute game use a constructivist theory of knowing and the how people learn framework for supporting their design <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Schwartz, Brophy, Lin &amp; Bransford, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bransford et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Under the constructivist theory of knowing, people learn by assimilating new information into their current knowledge structure <ref type="bibr">(Savery &amp; Duffy, 1995)</ref>. The structure of knowledge in people's mind is defined as schema (pl. schemata), it represents generic knowledge and it is the basis of schema theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1978)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson (1978)</ref>, "a schema is conceived to contain a slot or placeholder for each component" (p.</p><p>4) of a representation. Schema theory as a theoretical perspective of how people process information explains that individuals learn by constructing mental models or representations of their surrounding world in their minds <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Johnson-Laird, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wilson &amp; Rutherford, 1989)</ref>. These models can become devices a learner can use to organize information in ways that increase their chance for retrieval, or they can be used to build new schema and generate new knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cowley, Charles, Black &amp; Hickey, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In the present work, the initial mental model, or schema of ETC, to explain how a complex phenomenon like ETC works was provided by the ETC video <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2002)</ref>. The ETC video narrative and visuals provided participants with a model for describing the transformation of sunlight energy to chemical energy by starting with what students know, a plant in nature. Then during the play of Electron Chute the learners revisit this model with each players' turn reenacting the ETC process. The conversation between players to review the possible moves leverages social construction of knowledge by multiple players to learn the vocabulary and subtleties of the processes.</p><p>The design of Electron Chute aimed to support learning with a game and leveraged constructivist theories of knowing with specific reference to <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> the visual representation of the ETC <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gordin &amp; Pea, 1995)</ref> to provide a schema <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Derry, 1996)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> the refinement of vocabulary through labels on game board <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baker, 1995)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> and causal relationships reinforced by the repetitive movement of the twoelectron cards the players master when playing the game. The blending of learning mechanisms into a game experience using the epistemic game framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref> to organize the visual layout of the game into usual model of the biological system and the rules of the game as illustrations of dynamic actions in the system. The representation of the ETC video and the Electron Chute game was critical to making it accessible to the target learners and scientifically accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Treagust, Chittleborough &amp; Mamiala, 2002)</ref>. Therefore, the design of the ETC video and Electron Chute depended on defining the ETC model and the processes that governed its behavior on formal models used by scientists to explain the phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lehninger, Nelson &amp; Cox, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Under the how people learn framework, the combination of viewing the ETC video and iterative reenactment of the process through the play of Electron Chute created a well-balanced learning environment that posited four attributes: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> knowledge about the phenomenon relative to the standard; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> center on learners' need to engage in activity; <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> continual assessment of what the learners know which is obtained through game play within a community of their peers; (4) build a sense of community that helps one another solve problems by building on each other's knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Bransford et al., 2000, p. 23-25)</ref>.</p><p>The researcher' claim is that the general model about photosynthesis presented to students is incomplete. This is because it does not explain photosynthesis as a biological process that involves the machinery to transform electromagnetic energy from the universe (sunlight energy) to chemical energy (ATP) connected to a flow of electrons.</p><p>This energy is used and stored by plants inside each one of their cells for their survival <ref type="bibr">(Lawlor &amp; Cornic, 2002)</ref>. In the academic standards, photosynthesis is a simple description of a plant as a system that takes in sunlight, water and CO 2 , and converts them in carbohydrates and O 2 <ref type="bibr">(Indiana Department of Education, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">NGSS, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, it is expectable that students hold misconceptions about the energy transformation process of photosynthesis. The ETC video and Electron Chute are models of how the ETC process works and were developed to support students' learning by teaching new vocabulary of ETC, engaging learners in peer discussion using a game format and addressing common misconceptions. These might help learners to be conscious of their own misconceptions and clarify misconceptions about the energy transformation of photosynthesis.</p><p>It was not part of this research to do a qualitative study to find the misconceptions participants' hold about the ETC process of photosynthesis. Rather, the present study used information in regard to misconceptions of the phenomenon found in the literature to design a ETC video and game that could address them and support students' learning of ETC process from a biological point of view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Statement of the Problem</head><p>Limited research has been done in how to enhance students' knowledge of energy transformation in biological settings connected to the flow of electrons. The knowledge associated with this biological phenomenon is filled with difficult vocabulary for middle school to pronounce and remember. In addition, students have difficulties visualizing and understanding how the transformation of sunlight energy into ATP and carbohydrates occurs. This study involves an abstract representation of an invisible process used to illustrate the excitation and movement of electrons involved in chemical reactions. These kinds of representational models may be new to many students and difficult for them to interpret. Therefore, it is posited that young learners need a model of the ETC process that provides an explanatory level of the phenomenon in terms they can comprehend and provides a useful representation for more sophisticated models they will use in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Significance of the Study</head><p>Photosynthesis is a key plant process taught in life sciences that is introduced to elementary students and is revisited across the curriculum at the middle and high school levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Quinn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">NGSS n.d.)</ref>. Middle school science instruction of photosynthesis typically concludes with students' ability to repeat the definition of photosynthesis that explains why leaves are green and how plants provide oxygen. In middle school, students are expected to learn about photosynthesis as an energy transformation process; however, the standards do not mention the ETC process-Indiana Academic Standards-Biology (Indiana Department of Education, 2016) and the NGSS standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(NGSS, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Students may often have an incomplete model of how photosynthesis works and insufficient knowledge that leads to misconceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Deshmukh, 2015)</ref>. Considering that ETC is the energy transformation process of photosynthesis, learners need coherent models that supports their comprehension of ETC. Specifically, where the ETC process takes place in the plant, the causal chain of events initiated by sunlight energy and the connection between the transformation of the energy from the sun to chemical energy (ATP) with a flow of electrons inside the plant cells.</p><p>In the present study the researcher developed a video and a game about ETC.</p><p>They were designed to help students relate the transformation of sunlight (electromagnetic) energy into chemical energy (ATP) to a flow of electrons and address the misconceptions students hold regarding the ETC process in photosynthesis. The novelty of Electron Chute is in that it explicitly shows that the energy transformation process requires a flow of electrons to occur, sequence that is mimicked by engaging students in physical moves of electrons cards. In Electron Chute, the outputs of the ETC process (ATP and NADPH) react with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to synthesize carbohydrates, the final product of photosynthesis plants use for their own survival <ref type="bibr">(Lawlor &amp; Cornic, 2002)</ref>. Broadly, Electron Chute addressed students' need to visualize the transformation of sunlight energy into ATP, and finally in carbohydrates, that occurs in photosynthesis.</p><p>The ETC video and the Electron Chute game were developed to help students understand the energy transformation process and clarify the misconceptions they hold about photosynthesis: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> Plants exist to give resources to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Schwartz &amp; Brown, 2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> The main product of photosynthesis is oxygen <ref type="bibr">(Svandova, 2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> Photosynthesis is a gas exchange process which uses oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Marmaroti &amp; Galanopoulou , 2006)</ref>; ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) Photosynthesis takes place in chlorophyll <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Deshmukh, 2015)</ref>;</p><p>(5) Chlorophyll is produced and consumed during photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Marmaroti &amp; Galanopoulou, 2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> Photosynthesis is when plants take the light from the sun and create oxygen to support plants' growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Schwartz &amp; Brown, 2013</ref>); <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref> The ATP production is the end point of photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Parker et al, 2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> Plants transform carbon dioxide into oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Flores, Tovar &amp; Gallegos, 2003)</ref>. Detailed information about misconceptions is presented in Chapter 2 in association with the learning outcomes of the video and game learning experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Purpose of the Study</head><p>The purpose of this study is to support students' learning of the energy transformation process in photosynthesis and help them to clarify misconceptions about this process. Specifically, the instructional approach developed in this work aims to contribute to students' understanding of the transformation of sunlight -electromagneticenergy into high energy compounds -ATP and NADPH-inside a plant cell structure.</p><p>In this study, the researcher argues that a video and a game's visual representation of the ETC process would help students gain knowledge to explain the transformation of sunlight energy into ATP and NADPH. This transformation involves the activation of a flow of electrons through a biological membrane-the thylakoid membrane-subunit of the chloroplast. Students could use that knowledge to explain how the ETC process works, look for similarities with other processes inside the cell and infer how energy transformation occurs in other organisms.</p><p>Laterally, this study explores evidences that the video and game learning experiences have a positive impact on students from different academic readiness. A questionnaire survey instrument was used to collect students' feedback about learning ETC using a video and game with the intention of improving these learning experiences for future learners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Research Question</head><p>To investigate this conjecture, a research question was defined to frame the inquiry of the study:</p><p> What are the specific learning outcomes achieved by middle school students after learning about the energy transformation process in photosynthesis, process known as electron transport chain (ETC), through video and serious game learning experiences?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Assumptions</head><p>The researcher assumed that students had limited knowledge regarding the electron transport chain (ETC) process in photosynthesis before starting the learning experiences-watching the ETC video and playing the Electron Chute game. Because the understanding of ETC required that students were familiar with the vocabulary related to photosynthesis, students participated in a series of classroom activities about photosynthesis during previous weeks. Detailed information about these classroom activities were included in Chapter 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7">Limitations of the Study</head><p>The researcher identified the following limitations that might have impacted the findings research question: (1) Absence of a pilot study to anticipate design errors and implementation issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blessing &amp; Chakrabarti, 2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> Treatments were constituted by intact classes which reduced random sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Trochim &amp; Donnelly, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7.1">Absence of a Pilot Study</head><p>A pilot study is a procedure that allow researchers to follow preliminary analyses of the research and identify problems that could affect the validity of the results before undertaking a fully developed experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blessing &amp; Chakrabarti, 2009)</ref>. In the present study, a pilot would have allowed the researcher to evaluate the instrument (knowledge test) and gain information about the game procedures such as, time students spent playing Electron Chute, clarity of the instructions/rules and the optimal number of players that would have allowed every student the sufficient time to complete the game play.</p><p>The choice to not include a pilot study with participants of the target age group was made by the researcher during the process of planning the research because of the limited time participants were available to participate in this study. The absence of pilot was not necessarily detrimental to the quality of this study because the design of the research and the data analysis were done as planned by the researcher. The content validity of the knowledge test was checked by an expert in the field. The reliability of the rubric was calculated by a statistical program following the recommendations of a statistical consultant.</p><p>Additionally, participants' feedback was requested at the end of the study to gain insights about their experiences with the video and the game as well as use this information to improve learners' experiences for future studies. For a future research, before undertaking the planned research, a pilot study to try out methods and procedures could be performed in a second school from the same school corporation. The school should have a similar population of students in regard to gender, ethnicity, and abilities to obtain results that are valid to use for modifications of the research study. All researchers in the study should be part of the pilot study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blessing &amp; Chakrabarti, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7.2">Treatments Constituted by Intact Classes</head><p>As in many studies in education, the randomization of participants in each classroom cannot be assured, because the classes are formed by the schools for their own purposes. The way to face this limitation was to approach the study using a quasiexperimental design <ref type="bibr">(Robson, 2002)</ref>. In the present work, the quasi-experimental design used was the non-equivalent group design (NEGD) which consisted of a pretest-posttest experiment in two comparable classes at school. These comparable classes constituted both treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Trochim &amp; Donnelly, 2001)</ref>. The comparison was done between two different treatments consisted of a similar population of students including gender, ethnicity, and abilities according to the school corporation. For a future study, the research design could have an additional treatment and measure the level of knowledge of the experimental treatment after watching the ETC video to measure the gain of knowledge attributed to the video.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8">Definition of Terms</head><p>In the context of this thesis, the following definition of terms will be used:</p><p>ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate. It is a small metabolic molecule and one of the outputs of the electron transport chain process. ATP serves as "the major carrier of chemical energy in all cells." ATP is also one of the inputs of the second phase of photosynthesis, known as the Calvin Cycle, to produce carbohydrates <ref type="bibr">(Lehninger, Nelson &amp; Cox, 2005, p. 122)</ref>.</p><p>CO 2 : Carbon dioxide. It is a gaseous input of photosynthesis. During the second stage of photosynthesis, known as Calvin Cycle, carbon dioxide reacts with ATP and NADPH to produce carbohydrates, the final product of photosynthesis the plant uses for storage, maintenance and growth <ref type="bibr">(Lawlor &amp; Cornic, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>ETC: Electron transport chain. The electron transport chain process is a biological process that occur inside cellular structures known as chloroplasts in plants and mitochondria in both plants and animals. ETC consists of a series of reactions involving a flow of electrons through protein complexes inserted in a biological membrane and a movement of protons (H+) across the membrane to synthesize energy (ATP) useful for survival. In bacteria, the ETC process occurs in their cell membrane. In plants' and animals' mitochondria, ETC is part of cellular respiration. In plants' chloroplasts, ETC is the first stage of photosynthesis and occurs in a chloroplast inner membrane known as the thylakoid membrane.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>This chapter provides an overview of the theoretical foundations of this study focused on why students hold misconceptions. Specifically, the scope of this research was to clarify the misconceptions students hold regarding the energy transformation process in photosynthesis and promote students' learning of it. The researcher frames this study under the philosophy of biology to give clarifying explanations why students hold misconceptions from a biological point of view regarding the electron transport chain process in photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kampourakis, 2013)</ref>. The researcher argues that learners may have an incomplete model of how the ETC process works and limited knowledge of ETC that might conduce them to misconceptions. Then, the researcher presents the theoretical foundation of this study focused on what to do to help students in their learning process of ETC. This was based on the premise supported by the schema theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1978)</ref> that students learn by constructing mental models or representations of their surrounding world in their minds <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Johnson-Laird, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wilson &amp; Rutherford, 1989)</ref> and the concept that people learned in a well-balanced learning environment. Therefore, the researcher framed the design of the learning experiences, the ETC video and the Electron Chute game, under a constructivist theory of knowing called schema theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1978)</ref> and the how people learn framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bransford et al., 2000)</ref> to guide the instructional design. Specifically, the design of the ETC video and the Electron Chute game was founded in the concepts of learning through visual representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gordin &amp; Pea, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2002)</ref>; the cognitive theory of multimedia learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mayer, 1997)</ref> and epistemic game framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref>. Later in the chapter, a description and illustration of the ETC process in photosynthesis is presented, followed by the identification of the students' misconceptions about photosynthesis, and the learning outcomes and design of the learning experiences based on the standards. This information was the foundation for the design of the instrument (knowledge test) used to measure the students' knowledge of the ETC process in photosynthesis. The following conceptual map shows the frameworks of the study (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). </p></div>

The philosophy of biology as an independent field emerged during the 1960s and 1970s and since that time has had relevant implications for all disciplines related to biology including biology education <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kampourakis, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>There are two concepts embraced by the philosophy of biology that are relevant to this study. These are teleology and metacognition. The researcher argues that both concepts are in dispute in people's mind, which could be an explanation why students hold misconceptions about energy processes. Teleology is related to important conceptual obstacles because it indicates that a characteristic exists for a purpose, and that way of thinking could foster misconceptions, which could interfere with the students' ability to learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lennox &amp; Kampourakis, 2013)</ref>. For example, "plants exist to give resources to humans" <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Schwartz &amp; Brown, 2013</ref>) is a misconception students' hold that could be related to the idea that plants have a purpose, which is to provide human with resources. This way of thinking could lead to a plausible explanation for other misconceptions such as "the main product of photosynthesis is oxygen" <ref type="bibr">(Svandova, 2014)</ref>. The sentence suggests that the purpose of photosynthesis is producing oxygen which is not accurate from a biological point of view which investigations have discovered that oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis <ref type="bibr">(Lawlor &amp; Cornic, 2002)</ref> and comes from the photolysis of water molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Joliot et al., 1969)</ref>.</p><p>Misconceptions are connected to flaw or incomplete mental models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chi, 2008)</ref> and, therefore, interfere with the way students think and their ability to make sense of how complex phenomena work <ref type="bibr">(Vosniadou, 2009)</ref>. Metacognition is the ability of learners to control their learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Tulving &amp; Madigan, 1970)</ref>. Metacognition accounts for the decisions learners make contingent on their own knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fleming, Dolan &amp; Frith, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Metacognition is the knowledge of each one's own mental process and control one's own behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Davidson, Deuser &amp; Sternberg, 1994)</ref>. Learners need to recognize they hold a misconception before they can address it, therefore, learning experiences that help them to be aware of their own misconceptions could guide students to make their own conceptual change needed for learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Galli, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, the researcher argues that the ETC video and Electron Chute are instructional treatments that support students in their metacognitive processes. This research suggests that the video and the game learning experience in a well-balanced classroom environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bransford et al., 2000)</ref> engages learners in peer discussions that could lead to explanations of the ETC phenomenon, help them make sense of how a complex biochemical process works and realize their own misconceptions about it.</p><p>Students hold misconceptions regarding energy transformation mostly because of the differences between the vocabulary they learn in their daily lives to explain this phenomenon and the scientific knowledge students' learn at school <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Neumann, Boone &amp; Fischer, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Solomon, 1983)</ref>. The knowledge associated with the energy transformation process in photosynthesis requires difficult vocabulary for middle school to learn. The design of Electron Chute took into account the refinement of vocabulary through labels on game board <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baker, 1995)</ref> to help students learn about ETC by enhancing their knowledge of the ETC process in a less school-like context <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gee, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Most of the biological phenomena including energy transformation processes are neither visible nor connected to the students' daily lives. Therefore, the processes involved in energy transformation are more difficult for student to comprehend <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barak, Gorodetsky, &amp; Chipman, 1997)</ref>. Students are familiar with the energy conservation principle which states that energy is neither created nor destroyed but transformed; however, they have difficulties in applying this principle to biological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chabalengula, Sanders, &amp; Mumba, 2012)</ref>. This is also related to the difficulties students have about how the non-living world and the living world are related <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lin &amp; Hu, 2003)</ref>. This is associated with the students' conceptions that the energy principles in living matter are different from the principles in non-living matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barak, Gorodetsky, &amp; Chipman, 1997)</ref>. The ETC video and the Electron Chute game contextualize the learning of the energy transformation process in the biological membrane of a living organism-a plant. Visual representations were part of them and, therefore, the process of learning through representations is presented in the following section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photosynthesis</head><p>In photosynthesis, the ETC process is the energy transformation from sunlight energy into ATP and involves a flow of electrons through different protein complexes in a chloroplast inner membrane known as the thylakoid membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lehninger et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The novelty of the devices-video and game-developed in this study is that they connect the energy transformation process to the flow of electrons that occurs in nature, sequence that is mimicked by engaging students in physical moves of electrons cards during the game play. The term "flow of electrons" is related to changes on the electrons configuration from a ground state to an excited state when the atom absorbs radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chaichian, Perez &amp; Tureanu, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In the ETC process, when light energy is captured by the chlorophyll molecules in Photosystem II (PSII), per each photon of light the atom absorbs one electron is excited to a higher level of energy or a higher orbital far from the nucleus of the atom <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Eaton-Rye, Tripathy &amp; Sharkey, 2011)</ref>. This is an unstable state for any atom, therefore, electrons release that energy to another electron in a ground state and return to the lowest orbital in the atom. The same event of change of electrons configuration from excited/ground state occurs through atoms until the electrons are received by a final acceptor that needs them to stabilize its atomic configuration <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chaichian, Perez &amp; Tureanu, 2014)</ref>. In the ETC process, the final acceptor is a positive charged molecule, NADP+ which needs electrons -negative charged particles-to stabilize its configuration.</p><p>Then, NADP+ is reduced to NADPH. In this process of reduction, a proton (hydrogen ion, H+) forms a bond to the cationic or positive charged form of phosphate of NADP+ using the two electrons excited by the absorption of light energy in the form of photons <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lehninger et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The ETC process occurs in the thylakoid membrane. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref> illustrates the magnification of the thylakoid membrane to highlight the components involved in the ETC process. The flow of electrons occurs through five protein complexes in this order:</p><p>(1) Photosystem II (PSII); ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>  When sunlight energy is captured by chlorophyll molecules in PSII, electrons from PSII are transported through proteins in the membrane which impulse the movement of protons (H+) from the chloroplast stroma (pH=8, basic) liquid area to the thylakoid lumen (pH=4, acid) liquid area. Once protons start accumulating in the lumen, they move back to the stroma through a protein complex called ATP synthase. As a consequence of this proton motive force ATP is produced in the stroma of chloroplast.</p><p>This happens because the chemical potential energy of the proton gradient is transferred to chemical potential energy in ATP <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Parker, Anderson, Heidemann, Merrill &amp; Merritt, 2012)</ref>. In this way, sunlight energy is transformed into chemical energy in the form of ATP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blankenship, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lehninger et al., 2005)</ref>. When chlorophyll molecules from the Photosystem II of the thylakoid membrane capture the sunlight energy and lose their electrons, water splits in hydrogen and oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Joliot et al., 1969)</ref>. Smaller part of hydrogen called electrons participate in the ETC process and hence water acts as the electron donor for the movement of electrons during ETC. This process is known as photolysis of water and occurs in the thylakoid lumen, which is the liquid area inside the thylakoid <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ananyev &amp; Dismukes, 2005)</ref>. Gaseous oxygen (O 2 ) is produced from the water splitting and released to the environment (air) through pores or small openings found in the leaves known as stomata (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>).  Finally, in the stroma or liquid area of the chloroplast, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), ATP and NADPH participate the other major sub-process of photosynthesis known as the Calvin Cycle to produce carbohydrates, a potential chemical energy used by plants for their survival. The Calvin Cycle is also known as the Calvin-Benson- <ref type="bibr">Bassham (CBB)</ref> cycle in honor to the discoverer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bassham, Benson &amp; Calvin, 1950)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary</head><p>Chapter </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 3. METHODS</head><p>In the present research, the author claims the photosynthesis model presented to students in the standards is incomplete. In the standards, photosynthesis is defined as an energy transformation process, but it is presented as a descriptive process of inputs and outputs -Indiana Academic Standards (Indiana Department of Education, 2016) and NGSS standards (NGSS, 2013)-without reference to the electron transport chain (ETC)</p><p>process. The author' conjecture is that students may have an incomplete model of the energy transformation process in photosynthesis and limited knowledge that could be the reasons of the misconceptions described in the literature. The researcher argues that learners need models that support their comprehension of ETC. The ETC process in photosynthesis consists of a series of reactions involving a flow of electrons excited by sunlight energy that transforms the electromagnetic energy from the sun into ATP inside the plant cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lehninger et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Blankenship, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In (Appendix F).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Purpose of the Study</head><p>The purpose of this study is to support students' learning of the energy transformation process in photosynthesis and help them to clarify misconceptions about this process. Specifically, the instructional approach developed in this work aims to contribute to students' understanding of the transformation of sunlight, electromagnetic energy, into high energy compounds -ATP and NADPH-inside a plant cell structure.</p><p>In this study, the researcher argues that a video and a game's visual representation of the ETC process would help students gain knowledge of the transformation of sunlight energy into ATP and NADPH. This transformation involves the activation of a flow of electrons through a biological membrane, the thylakoid membrane, subunit of the chloroplast. Students could use that knowledge to explain how the ETC process works, look for similarities with other processes inside the cell and infer how energy transformation occurs in other organisms.</p><p>Laterally, this study explores evidences that the video and game learning experiences have a positive impact on students from different academic readiness.</p><p>through a questionnaire survey, this research collects students' feedback about learning ETC using a video and game with the intention of improving these learning experiences for future learners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Research Question</head><p>To investigate this conjecture, a research question was defined to frame the inquiry of the study:</p><p> What are the specific learning outcomes achieved by middle school students after learning about the energy transformation process in photosynthesis, process known as electron transport chain (ETC), through video and serious game learning experiences?</p><p>To answer the research question that guided this study, the researcher used a nonequivalent quasi-experimental group design (NEGD) <ref type="bibr">(Robson, 2002)</ref> because randomization of participants cannot be assured in a school setting. The methods consisted of a pretest-posttest evaluation of two similar groups at school based on the score of the standardized assessments used by the school district (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">2</ref>). These similar groups constituted the treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Trochim &amp; Donnelly, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The instrument (Appendix B) consisted of multiple-choice and essay sections in a pretest-posttest design. The multiple-choice section (12 items) was a set of questions to determine students' ability to <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> recall and recognize vocabulary of the main concepts of photosynthesis and the ETC process; (2) recall how the process of ETC occurs in a way that makes sense to the representation they were exposed to during the ETC video and the Electron Chute game. The essay score gain provided general information about students' ability to interpret a representation of ETC. A scoring rubric was developed to evaluate students' responses (Appendix B).</p><p>An exit survey (Appendix C) was developed and used to collect students' feedback of learning about ETC by watching the video followed by playing Electron</p><p>Chute. The survey collected data about (1) students' experiences while playing the game;</p><p>(2) specific characteristics of the video and the game students found helpful and difficult for learning about ETC.</p><p>The quantitative analysis was performed to calculate the significance from pretest to posttest <ref type="bibr">(Devore, 2015)</ref> in both sections of the instrument-multiple-choice and essay separately. The analysis consisted of (1) a comparison between the percentage of correct answers achieved by the treatments as well as the challenge and regular classes-or academic readiness-using a Z-Test ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) a comparison between score gain achieved by the video only and video+game treatments as well as the challenge and regular classes using an univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA); (3) a quantitative analysis of a survey about students' feedback after the learning experiences using Z-Test and Chi-Square Test; (4) a qualitative analysis of a survey using coding and organizing the information in a frequency table. SPSS software was used to perform the analysis and to create the histogram of the scores distribution and score gain for the treatments and the challenge and regular classes.</p><p>A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the survey was performed to identify any unforeseen issues the students had about the learning experiences or opportunities for refinements of the game. The quantitative analysis was performed to compare the effect of treatments and academic readiness-challenge and regular classes-on students'</p><p>agreement. The analysis provided information about how well students' experiences watching the video and playing Electron Chute met the learning outcomes of the video and game. The qualitative analysis included the coding of the open-ended section of the survey. Categories were presented in frequency tables. The survey was developed by the researcher and administrated at the end of the video and game learning experiences to all students during the same day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Participants</head><p>A middle school science teacher in an urban public school with whom the researcher had an established relationship agreed to participate in the proposed research and learning activities as part of her standard curriculum. Participants included 120 eighth grade students, 62 girls and 58 boys, distributed across six classes. Seventy percent of the students at the school received either free or reduced lunch <ref type="bibr">(Graphiq, n.d.)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, 115 students completed all the activities of this study. At the end of the class activities, all 120 students took the survey. The school divided their students in regular and challenge classes. A regular class (N=66) included students who attend a mainstream class according to the school corporation. A challenge class (N=49) included students who were more prepared than students who attended a regular class according to the school administration. These students have the opportunity to be challenged with content knowledge that possesses a higher level of difficulty and requires higher level of thinking skills according to the school corporation where this study was conducted. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">2</ref> summarizes the basic break down of the students by class period through the day. This information was provided by the class teacher. Each treatments included two regular classes and one challenge class. The video+game treatment (58 students) were students in class periods 3, 5 and 6. The video only treatment (57 students) were students in period 1, 7 and 8. The assignment of sections was done by the description provided by the teacher. This reduced the multiple group threat to internal validity for selection bias which is the degree to which the treatments were comparable before the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Trochim &amp; Donnelly, 2001)</ref>. In that way, the outcomes were attributed to the treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Instructional Intervention</head><p>Researchers assumed that students had limited prior knowledge regarding photosynthesis and the electron transport chain (ETC) process. Therefore, all students participated in a six-week curriculum unit on photosynthesis. During the first four weeks, students participated in learning activities associated with learning general knowledge about photosynthesis. This general knowledge focused on inputs and outputs of photosynthesis. This general knowledge was required to understand the ETC process at the cell level. The vocabulary referred to the reactants (light, carbon dioxide and water), plant part (leaves), molecules (chlorophyll) involve in photosynthesis, and its products (carbohydrates and oxygen).</p><p>teacher recommended simplifying the items for the final instrument used in this study.</p><p>The information provided by the diagnostic test was used by the researcher to develop the lessons of photosynthesis (Appendix D and E) prior the video and game learning experiences. Two treatment conditions were used to evaluate the learning outcomes using video only versus video plus the ETC serious game. The video+game treatment began their learning experience with a short introduction outlining the plan for the day. The students watched the video as a class and the researcher asked the students if they had any questions about the video. Next, the researcher explained the rules of the Electron Chute game, answered questions and then divided the class into groups of three or four students. Students met at one of seven stations around the classroom that were prearranged with the game materials and a copy of the rules. In each one of the three class periods of the experimental treatment <ref type="bibr">(3, 5 &amp; 6)</ref>, there were three to five trained adults including the teacher and the researcher. They answered questions students had while playing the game. These adults were previously trained by the researcher about how to play the game. The playing time was 20-25 minutes. Three randomly selected station per class were recorded using a camera to study students' conversations and interaction while playing the game.</p><p>The video only group began their experience similarly with a description of the plan for the day and then watched the ETC video and were given the chance to ask questions. The difference was that they played the Fruit and Vegetable Bingo game by Lucy Hammett Games which is not related to the photosynthesis game.</p><p>The following day each group completed a posttest measuring their ability to recall facts about ETC in photosynthesis by answer multiple-choice questions and explain the process of ETC through essay questions targeting the interpretation of the representation in the ETC video and the Electron Chute game. After the posttest the video only group had the opportunity to play the ETC game, but did not view the video a second time. On the last day students in both treatments completed the exit survey used in this study which is described later. The following sections provide a more detailed account of the two treatment conditions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Before the test (3 minutes).</head><p>The researcher asked students to review the pretest and after that, students received information about the organization of the test: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> The first four questions of the multiple-choice section were related to concepts they learned during the previous lessons of photosynthesis. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, weeks 2 to 4. The following eight questions of the multiple-choice and the essay section were related to the ETC content material the researcher designed into the ETC video and the Electron Chute game. The reason of this 3-minutes intervention was to reduce the level of students' anxiety of not knowing some of the concepts contained in the test. Students were encouraged by the teacher to give their best guess even if they were not sure about the answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-test (15-20 minutes).</head><p>Students were informed they could ask the researcher any questions related to format during the test. For example, format questions in the essay section, such as, if the numbers 1 to 11 in the sheet were related to the numbers 1 to 11 in the representation. Also, if they should read the ETC representation from left to right or right to left.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>After the test (5 minutes).</head><p>Students were informed about what the research design of a ETC project was and why the different classes were not playing Electron Chute at the same time. Students were informed that the pretest-posttest design could be applied to any field they were planning to pursue in their future, such as technology, education, medicine, literature, science, arts and communication. After that, there was a short discussion (3 minutes) about electrons to identify if they were familiar with what electrons were. Some students were familiar with electrons, others seemed to remember little from their previous classes. Students had studied molecules, atoms and electrons earlier as part of the teacher's curriculum. Then, the researcher showed them a short video (<ref type="url" target="https://youtu.be/IOXxFaHbIXg">https://youtu.be/IOXxFaHbIXg</ref>) about electrons in an atom. After that, there was a class discussion about what electrons were to help them remember about electrons. The researcher selected this video to show students the concept of electrons move/flow, because that idea was fundamental to understand the ETC video and the dynamic of the Electron Chute game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.2">Treatment Day</head><p>ETC video (5:30 minutes). As discussed in Chapter 2, the design of the ETC video emphasized the context of the ETC process in the plant, because students needed the complexity of the process informed by a well-structured transition from macro to micro representations of photosynthesis and the ETC process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>After the ETC video (3 minutes).</head><p>The researcher and students discussed how the content of the ETC video was related to the representation on the test. Most of them could make some conclusions about the ETC process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Before</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electron Chute game (20-25 minutes).</head><p>As discussed in Chapter 2, the game actions were analogous to the movement and reactions associated with the flow of electrons in the ETC process that transforms sunlight energy into chemical energy (ATP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Data Collection Methods</head><p>The researcher provided the teacher with copies of the pretest and posttest with an assigned number printed on them, and the teacher assigned those numbers to specific students. The researcher did not have access to the key containing matched student names and numbers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Instrument (Knowledge test)</head><p>The instrument (Appendix B) consisted of a two major sections, a multiple choice section and an essay section. The 12 multiple-choice questions measured (1) students' ability to recall and recognize vocabulary of the main concepts of photosynthesis and the electron transport chain (ETC) process; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> and their ability to recall how the process of ETC occurs in a way that makes sense to the representation they were exposed to during the video and the game (12 points total). The items were developed based on the learning outcomes of the learning experiences which were supported by the standards -Indiana Academic Standards (Indiana Department of Education, 2016) and the NGSS standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(NGSS, 2013)</ref>. The revised version of Bloom's Taxonomy was used to create the items <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson, Krathwohl, &amp; Bloom, 2001)</ref>. Most of the items in the multiple-choice section measured students' ability to recall or remember vocabulary and major parts of the ETC process. Exceptions are (1) item 9 that measured students' ability to understand the ETC process (understanding level); (2) items 2 and 3 that determined students' ability to demonstrate facts through experimentation (applying level).</p><p>The knowledge test also included an essay section to determine students' ability to interpret a representation of ETC and generate a narrative with the representation using the correct language and organized the sequence of events involved in the ETC process (11 points total).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1.1">Instrument Validity</head><p>The content validity of the instrument was confirmed by an expert in biosciences as recommended by <ref type="bibr">Robson (2002)</ref>. The content validity was also confirmed by the research team and the science teacher. The rubric of the essay section is included in Appendix B and its inter-rater reliability was calculated and explained later in this chapter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1.2">Analysis of the items of the instrument-difficult and discrimination indices</head><p>The item evaluation was done after students had the learning experienceswatching the video or watching the video and playing the game. This was the evaluation of the items in the posttest. The frequency distribution of the scores for the test takers The decision to retain an item with or without modifications or eliminating the item depends on the information provided by the discrimination item (D) about how well the keyed response, correct option, and distractors are functioning (Popham, 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Exit Survey</head><p>The students were asked to complete a short survey after watching the ETC video and playing the Electron Chute game. The survey consisted of 13 items (Appendix C) targeting students' reactions to the video and game's impact on their learning and interest in the science involving ETC. There was a difference in the number of participants who took the pretest and posttest (N=115) and the number of participants who completed the survey (N=120) because it was administrated a day after the posttest (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">4</ref>). Also, few students took the survey in a different period. Besides, the anonymity of the participants taking the survey made it impossible to match the tests with the surveys and identify who were boys or girls. The initial question targeted their prior learning experiences with the ETC process. Various learning outcomes associated with the research question were measured with nine statements. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref> lists the statements aligned with the target outcome of the learning experience. Students ranked these statements based on their experience using a four point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.  The survey analysis was performed for both treatments to see if this delay would significantly impact their overall learning experience with the video plus game. The video+game group experienced the ETC video and played Electron Chute on the same day. However, the video only group experienced a one-day delay between watching the ETC video and playing the Electron Chute game. The delay provided the video only group the opportunity to complete the posttest that measured their learning gains from just the ETC video experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Data Analysis</head><p>The data analysis in this study was done following the recommendations of the Purdue University Statistical Consulting Service. SPSS was used to analyze the pre/post results and survey results. SPSS was also used to generate histograms of the score distribution for the multiple-choice and the essay sections of the pretest and posttest and the inter-rater reliability of the rubric developed to evaluate the essay section of the instrument.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1.1">Differences in Achievement of Learning Outcomes between Treatments for the Multiple-Choice -Two Independent Variables</head><p>An analysis known as inference concerning a difference between population proportions was conducted for each treatment to identify potential difference between them. These two treatments were the two independent variables of the analysis and were referred to as x (video only) and y (video+game). The follow provides details of the analysis methods used to make these comparisons.</p><p>Using statistical analysis researchers studied if the differences between the changes in percentage of correct answers per question on the pretest and posttest for the treatments were likely due to chance or had statistical significance. A comparison of two population proportions was conducted to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the change in percentage of correct answers in the pretest and the posttest for the video only (x) and the video+game (y) treatments. The analysis was done per each question. The hypothesis test is indicated below:</p><p>Null hypothesis: Ho: p 2 -p 1 = 0 (where p 1 is the proportion from a video only population and p 2 from the video+game population)</p><p>Alternative hypothesis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ha: p 2 -p 1 &gt; 0 (z ≥ z α one-tailed distribution)</formula><p>If there is no difference between the proportion of the video only and video+game populations, then the difference of p 2 -p 1 is expected to be zero.</p><p>Assuming a random sample was selected independently from population 1 (n 1 )</p><p>and independently from population 2 (n 2 ), then the variables x -difference between the percentage of correct answers in the pretest and the posttest for the video only treatment per question-and y -difference between the percentage of correct answers in the pretest and the posttest for the video+game treatment per question-are also independent. Then (x/n 1 -y/n 2 ) is the natural estimator for (p 2 -p 1 ). Defining x/n 1 p 1 and y/n 2 as p 2 , the estimator for (p 2 -p 1 can be expressed as p 2 -p 1 ) <ref type="bibr">(Devore, 2015)</ref>. In this study, n 1 is the sample size of the video only group and n 2 is the sample size of the video+game group.</p><p>A Z-test was used to test the difference between population proportions who possesses a characteristic of interest.

Likewise, p 2 is the proportion difference of correct answers between the posttest and pretest for the experimental p 2 =posttestpretest) , and n 2 is the sample size of the experimental group (n 2 =58 students). In addition, p is the proportion of all the individual with the characteristic of interest in both samples, video only and video+game together; p = (x+ y)/(n1+n2). In this case, the sample size of the video only (n 1 =57) and video+game (n 2 =58) treatments are almost the same and p can be calculated as the average value between p 1 and p 2 . The analysis was done per each question.</p></div>

The objective of the essay was to determine students' ability to interpret a representation of ETC and create a narrative of the representation using the correct language and sequence of events involved in the ETC process. To determine the students' ability to interpret the ETC representation of the ETC process, a scoring rubric was developed based on the content of the learning outcomes indicated below.</p><p>L.O.7: Recall Chlorophyll molecules in Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) capture sunlight energy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Purpose of the Study</head><p>The purpose of this study is to support students' learning of the energy transformation process in photosynthesis and help them to clarify misconceptions about this process. Specifically, the instructional approach developed in this work aims to contribute to students' understanding of the transformation of sunlight, electromagnetic energy, into high energy compounds, ATP and NADPH, inside a plant cell structure. n this study, the researcher argues that a video and a game's visual representation of the ETC process would help students to gain knowledge of the transformation of sunlight energy into ATP and NADPH. This transformation involves the activation of a flow of electrons through a biological membrane, the thylakoid membrane, subunit of the chloroplast. Students could use that knowledge to explain how the ETC process works, look for similarities with other processes inside the cell and infer how energy transformation occurs in other organisms.</p><p>Laterally, this study explores evidences that the video and game learning experiences have a positive impact on students from different academic readiness. through a questionnaire survey, this research collects students' feedback about learning ETC using a video and game with the intention of improving these learning experiences for future learners.</p></div>

The knowledge test was divided in two section (1) multiple-choice; (2) essay. In both sections of the test, the information was organized in a way that facilitated the interpretation of the data to answer the research question. The same organization was followed in the method section. This organization allows the reader to check the procedures associated with the results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Multiple-Choice Section</head><p>The questions in the multiple-choice section aimed to determine if students could achieve the learning outcomes described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> by either watching the ETC video only or by playing Electron Chute after watching the video. These learning outcomes were developed based on the students' misconceptions of photosynthesis presented in the literature review. The learning outcomes addressed the misconceptions students hold about the energy transformation process in photosynthesis known as ETC. The difference in percentage of correct answers after the treatments was determined through a comparison of two population proportions. A Z-test was used to evaluate if the difference between the percentage of correct answers in the pretest and the posttest for both treatments was statistically significant. Also, a comparison of score gain between the treatments was performed. The effect of treatments between the regular and challenge class was reported. Calculations were done executing a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Devore, 2015).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.2">Differences in Achievement of Learning Outcomes between Treatments for the Multiple-Choice</head><p>Each question of the multiple-choice section of the test was analyzed for significance. For that purpose, a comparison of two population proportion for two independent variables was conducted per each question. The independent variables were the two treatments-video only and video+game treatments. The analysis was conducted to determine if the difference between the proportion of correct answers in the pretest and the posttest for both treatments was statistically significant. Results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref> and included both the learning outcomes and the misconceptions related to the outcomes. At a significance level α of 0.05, the difference observed between the treatments was statistically significant when Z&gt;1.645.

In each treatment, the difference between the proportion of correct answers per item shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref> was calculated subtracting the proportion of students who got the item correct in the pretest from the posttest. Each item measured one learning outcome and each learning outcome was constructed based on a misconception. The item analysis in the previous section indicated that item6 was not functioning well.

More students reached higher scores in the posttest in comparison to the pretest. A third (30%) of the students scored 0 points in the pretest in comparison to the 15% in the posttest. This is a positive result because it indicates that after the treatments half of the participants could explain some of the ideas related to the ETC process in the essay. Later in the chapter, data indicates that those students who scored 0 point were part of the video only treatment. No student in the video+game treatment scored 0 points.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_25">10</ref> shows a comparison of the two population proportions conducted to find if the difference between the overall essay score in the pretest and the posttest for the treatments was statistically significant.  At a significance level α of 0.05, the pretest-posttest difference observed between the treatments was statistically significant (Z&gt;1.645) in regard to the average overall score gain. Students who played the game after watching the video incremented their score in 2.5 points in comparison to the less than a point from those students who only watched the video. In other words, playing Electron Chute had a slight but significant positive effect on students' scores gain. This result is consistent with what was reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">11</ref>. The following section shows a detailed analysis of the 11 sentences of the rubric. This analysis provided insightful information about the part of the ETC process that students could explain and those that were more challenging to the students.   The effect is higher when students played the game after watching the video. However, the video only had a positive impact on students' ability to recall the movement of electrons from PSII to H+ pump.LO8-2a&amp;2b. The effect is higher when students played the game after watching the video. However, the video only had a positive impact on students' ability to recall ATP production. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref> The effect is higher when students played the game after watching the video.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning outcome 1: Identify the basic vocabulary of photosynthesis.</head><p>Learning outcome 1 (L.O.1) required from students to recall the inputs (light, carbon dioxide and water) and outputs (carbohydrates and oxygen) of photosynthesis, and the plant part (leaves) where photosynthesis occurs. Learning outcome 1 involved items 1 to 3 of the instrument. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. According to the item analysis in the previous section, items 1 to 3 functioned well because they differentiated between students who performed well from those who performed poorly in the test. Item 3 was created based on the following misconception: The main product of photosynthesis is oxygen <ref type="bibr">(Svandova, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Item 1, in the pretest, 81% of students in the whole class answered it correctly.</p><p>This indicated that the lessons (Appendix D &amp; E) of photosynthesis before the treatments helped students remember that leaves were the part of the plant where photosynthesis takes place. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. That idea seemed to be reinforced by playing Electron Chute after watching the ETC video (video+game treatment). See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref>.</p><p>Item 2, in the pretest, 56% of students in the whole class answered this item correctly. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. This result suggested that the lessons taught before the treatments helped half of the class remember that water, carbon dioxide and sunlight were the reactants or inputs of photosynthesis. Data from the posttest suggested that the video only treatment did not have an additional effect on reinforcing the reactants of photosynthesis in the whole class. Playing Electron Chute after watching the video -video+game treatment-seemed to reinforce the idea that water, carbon dioxide and sunlight were the reactants of photosynthesis. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref>.</p><p>Item 3, in the pretest, 57% of students in the whole class answered this item correctly. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. This result suggested that the lessons taught before the treatments helped half of the class remember that carbohydrates and oxygen (O 2 ) were the products or outputs of photosynthesis. Data from the posttest suggested that the treatments did not have any additional effect on score gain and, therefore, on reinforcing the products of photosynthesis in the whole class. The ETC video and the Electron Chute game reinforced the concept of oxygen (O 2 ) production during the ETC process in photosynthesis (time lapse in the video between 0:42-0:57 seconds). The data suggested that for some reason students were not able to relate the production of O 2 from the photolysis-or splitting-of water (H 2 O) molecules in ETC to the O 2 production of the whole photosynthesis process.</p><p>The present work did not include a pretest for the lessons about photosynthesis that were taught to the students before the treatments. Therefore, for items 1 to 3, the overall score students got in posttest in the whole class might not only be associated to the lessons (Appendix D &amp; E) before the treatments, but also to their previous knowledge.</p><p>The evidence the researcher had to suggest a positive effect of the lessons on students' achievement is that most of the students in the whole class and in both treatments reported they learned a lot more about photosynthesis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_54">29</ref>) during the lessons previous the treatments. The objective of the lessons was to provide students the vocabulary and general content knowledge of photosynthesis, inputs and outputs, to be able to explain the ETC process. ETC is the first phase of photosynthesis and it was the focus of this research. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_34">13</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment. Learning outcome 4: Recall that photosynthesis occurs inside the chloroplast.</p><p>Learning outcome 4 (L.O.4) required from students to recall that the chloroplast was the cellular organelle where photosynthesis occurs. Learning outcome 4 corresponded to item 4 of the instrument. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. According to the item analysis in the previous section, item 4 functioned well. Learning outcome 4 was developed based on the following misconception about the cell location of photosynthesis: Photosynthesis takes place in chlorophyll <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Deshmukh, 2015)</ref>. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">14</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment. In the pretest, 77% of students in the whole class answered this item correctly.</p><p>See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. Before starting the lessons, students took a diagnostic test (see section 3.4</p><p>and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">3</ref>) that was not part of this study. In that test, students were asked about the name of the plant cell structure where photosynthesis occur. In the diagnostic test, 53% of students in the whole class, 58% video only and 49% video+game, recalled from their previous classes that the chloroplast was the organelle of photosynthesis. The question was slightly different from the final question in the instrument: What are the plant cell structures (organelles) where photosynthesis occur?</p><p>This additional information suggested that the lessons taught before the treatments helped an additional number of students in both treatments to reinforce the idea that chloroplast was the cell structure where photosynthesis occurs. In the posttest, 70% of students in the whole class recalled that the chloroplast was the organelle of photosynthesis. Additional score gain was not provided by the treatments. A possible reason could be that the video and the game strongly reinforced a subunit of the chloroplast, known as thylakoid. Specifically, the video and the game reinforced the thylakoid membrane as the physical structure inside the chloroplast where the ETC process in photosynthesis takes place. See L.O.5 and item 5 below.</p><p>Learning outcome 5: Recall that ETC in photosynthesis occurs inside the chloroplast in a structure known as the thylakoid membrane. Learning outcome 5 (L.O.5) required from students to recall that the ETC process occurs in the thylakoid, specifically in the membrane that surrounds the structure. Learning outcome 5 corresponded to item 5 of the instrument. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. According to the item analysis in the previous section, item 5 functioned well. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_36">15</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment. The score gain between pretest and posttest in the video only and video+game treatments indicated that watching the ETC video had a positive effect on students' achievement of L.O.5. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. The effect of the game could not be separately inferred from the data, because the score gain after treatments increased by an amount that was not significantly different between treatments. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref>. Learning outcome 5</p><p>was developed based on the following misconception about the cell location of photosynthesis: Photosynthesis takes place in chlorophyll <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Deshmukh, 2015)</ref>. Findings suggested that both treatments addressed to some extent this misconception.</p><p>Before starting the lessons, students took a diagnostic test (see section 3.4 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">3</ref>) that was not part of this study. In that test, students were asked about the name of the structure inside the chloroplast where the electron transport chain (ETC) process occurred. In the diagnostic test, 10% of students in the whole class,11% video only and 9% video+game, were familiar with the thylakoid. This percentage (10%) was not significantly different from the pretest (16%), but it was significantly different from the posttest (45%) suggesting a positive effect on students' achievement of L.O.5 after treatments. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. The concept of thylakoid membrane was not introduced to the students before the treatments. This additional information supported the results obtained after the treatments. Data suggested that both treatments helped students learn a new structure -the thylakoid membrane-and remember that the ETC process in photosynthesis takes place there.</p><p>The focus of the content for the question in the diagnostic test and in the pretest was the same. The diagnostic question was: What is the name of the membrane-bound compartment where the light-dependant reaction of photosynthesis occur? The lightdependent reaction refers to the electron transport chain process which requires light energy to occur. The question in the diagnostic test provided more information to help students relate the curricular concept of "light-dependent reaction" to the new concept of "electron transport chain (ETC)."</p><p>The assumption was that the students had learned about the curricular concept of "light-dependent reaction" previously but not under the name of ETC. The question aimed to determine if students were familiar with the inner chloroplast structure known as thylakoid membrane. Also, to determine if they related the thylakoid membrane as the place where ETC or "light-dependent reaction" occurred in photosynthesis.</p><p>Learning outcome 6: Identify the stroma as the fluid inside chloroplast where glucose is produced. Learning outcome 6 (L.O. 6) demanded from students to remember that glucose was produced in the fluid space inside the chloroplast known as stroma. The stroma is the solution that surrounds the thylakoid and the thylakoid membrane inside the chloroplast. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Learning outcome 6 was measured with item 6 of the instrument.</p><p>According to the item analysis in the previous section, item 6 did not function well and might have failed to measure L.O.6. Item 6 did not differentiate well (Dc* = +0.07) between students who performed well from those who performed poorly in the test. Therefore, the information provided by item 6 might not be accurate. The positive discrimination index of distractor "d"(Dd = +0.17) suggested that after the treatments more students in the high score group than the low score group were more familiar with the thylakoid lumen than the stroma. The thylakoid lumen is the fluid inside the thylakoid. The stroma is the fluid inside the chloroplast that surrounded the thylakoid.</p><p>Before starting the lessons, students took a diagnostic test (see section 3.4 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">3</ref>) that was not part of this study. In that test, students were asked about the name of the compartment where the synthesis of carbohydrates occurred. In the diagnostic test, 28% of students in the whole class,27% video only and 29% video+game, identified the stroma as the space where carbohydrates were produced. This percentage (28%) was neither significantly different from the pretest (23%) nor the posttest (28%). See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>.</p><p>The concept of stroma was not introduced to the students before the treatments.</p><p>An analysis for foil "d" indicated that after the treatments 35% of students in the whole class chose the lumen as the fluid where glucose was produced. Almost half (46%)</p><p>were part of the video only treatment and less than a quarter (24%) were participants of the video+game treatment. The lumen was a clearly defined structure in the ETC board and it was where the movement of protons (H+) occurred. Differently, the stroma was not clearly defined on the board. That reason might have helped students best recall the word "lumen" than "stroma." See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_37">16</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment.   In the pretest, 50% of students in the whole class answered this item correctly.</p><p>See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. The treatments did not have any significant effect on increasing this percentage. There was not a statistically significant difference between the proportion of students who answered the question correctly in the pretest and the posttest in the whole class (Z=-1.19; p&gt;0.05) and in the treatments. According to the item analysis, playing the game after watching the video did not provide any additional support to help students achieve L.O.7. However, the analysis of the essay gave insightful information. Students' interpretation of the essay for Learning outcome 7 (See L.O.7-Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref>) showed that after treatments almost three quarters (67%) of students in the whole class could explain that ETC started when sunlight energy was captured. However, only a third (37%) of the whole class identified chlorophyll as the molecule that captures the light energy from the sun. For both statements, playing Electron Chute after watching the video -video+game treatment-had a statistically significant effect on students' ability to explain the events that trigger ETC. See Three quarters (74%) of the group of students who played the game were able to correctly interpret the ETC model provided in the test. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref>. They were able to identify the absorption of sunlight energy as the phenomenon that started ETC. However, only 43% of these students were able to name chlorophyll as the molecules responsible of absorbing the energy to activate ETC. Most of the remaining students left the space in blank.</p><p>In the item analysis, one reason why more than 30 % of students selected foil "a" instead of foil "b" could be related to the narrative of the video associated to the image that shows the starting point of ETC. The narrative said "Let's see how the electron transport chain works" instead of "Let's see how the electron transport chain starts." See the video narrative and link to the video in Appendix A (time lapse in the video between 2:55-2:59 minutes).</p><p>Another reason could be associated to the Electron Chute game. The game started when players have the three essential elements in position 1 on the board: light, chlorophyll and water. Once they have these elements, they earn a two-electrons card that they lay down on position 1 (PSII). In other words, on the board game it might be unclear which event occurred first: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> The activation of chlorophyll molecules by sunlight energy -the light excites two electrons from chlorophyll to start ETC; or <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> The photolysis -water splitting by light-of water molecules that produces two electrons.</p><p>These two electrons replace the two electrons lost by PSII to continue the ETC process.</p><p>Having these two events together on position 1 (PSII) on the board game might have been ineffective as an aid to help students comprehend that the photolysis of water is a consequence of the activation of chlorophyll molecules in PSII by sunlight energy.</p><p>Learning outcome 7 (L.O.7) was developed based on the following misconception focused on the role of chlorophyll molecules in photosynthesis: Chlorophyll is produced in photosynthesis <ref type="bibr">(Marmaroti &amp; Galanopoulou,2006)</ref> instead of being the molecules that capture the sunlight energy in ETC. Findings suggested that asking students to write a narrative about ETC after playing the game was more effective on addressing this misconception than selecting a foil from an item. Playing the game helped students remember the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and, therefore, the game can be helpful to address a common misconception described in the literature. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_40">18</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment. In the pretest, a quarter (26%) of students in the whole class and the treatments reported that a gradient of protons produced ATP. In the same test, almost half of students (46%) in the whole class and the treatments informed that electrons from the splits of water produced ATP. After the treatments, the numbers were reversed indicating that the treatments had a positive effect on students' ability to recall how ATP was produced. Learning outcome 8 was developed based on the following misconception about the ATP production: The ATP production is the end point of photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Parker et al., 2012)</ref> instead of being an output of ETC. ATP is produced by a movement of protons and it is used for the synthesis of carbohydrates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning</head><p>The essay gave students the chance to explain the sequential events involved in the ATP production. Students' interpretation of the ETC representation indicated that the treatments had a positive impact on their ability to explain how ATP was produced. First, more than half (55%) of students in the whole class were able to state the step following to the absorption of sunlight. This step was that "two electrons move" from position 1</p><p>(PSII) to the next molecule. See  The difference between treatments was large. Almost three quarters (69%) of the students who played Electron Chute after watching the video were able to identify the movement of two electrons from one step to the following step in ETC. Differently, less than half (40%) of the students who watched the video only were able to identify the same idea. After the treatments, few students were able to identify the "proton pump" as the protein activated by the movement of the two electrons lost by PSII. However, more than half (55%) of the students who played the game indicated that there was a "movement of protons to the lumen." See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref>-3a. Also, 41% of students who played the game noticed that the movement of protons (H+) to the lumen was done through a proton pump. See  Learning outcome 9 (L.O.9) was developed based on the following misconception about the definition of photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is when plants take the light from the sun and create oxygen to support plants' growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Schwartz &amp; Brown, 2013)</ref>. The effect of treatments on students' ability to achieve L.O.9 and address to some extent this misconception could not be inferred from the data provided by item 9. However, the data suggested that the treatments helped students relate the ETC process to a movement of protons (H+).  In the pretest, only 18% of students in the whole class answered this item correctly. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>. However, after the treatments almost a third (31%) of the whole class recalled that oxygen (O 2 ) comes from the split of water molecules. There was a statistically significant difference between the proportion of students who answered the question correctly in the pretest and the posttest in the whole class (Z=2.32; p&lt;0.05) and in the video only treatment (Z=3.046; p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Data suggested that the video helped a third (37%) of the class to remember that the splits of water produces oxygen. Differently, playing the Electron Chute game after watching the video seemed to have no evident effect in helping students achieve L.O.10.</p><p>See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref>. However, the analysis of the essay clearly showed that both treatments had a positive effect on students' ability to remember that oxygen was produced in ETC and released to the environment. Half (50%) of the students who watched the video and the majority (85%) of the students who played the game after watching the video wrote down that oxygen was produced and released to the air. See . Also, the essay analysis indicated that around a third of the students who played the game wrote down "water splitting" and "oxygen is produced" at that point. This result suggests students connected the idea of oxygen coming from water splitting. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref>-6b &amp;7.</p><p>In the item analysis, almost a third (29%) of the students who played the Electron Chute game after watching the video selected foil "c" as correct answer: "ETC transforms light energy from the sun into oxygen." An explanation could be similar to what happened for L.O.7. The game started when players had the three essential elements on position 1 on the board: light, chlorophyll and water.

Data suggested that the treatments helped students to some extent remediate the common misconception that plants transform carbon dioxide into oxygen. However, the data suggested a potential risk of the design of position 1 on the board in introducing a misconception, oxygen comes from sunlight energy. For those students who selected this option after playing the game was unclear what chemical reactions were occurring in PSII (position 1).

See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref>. Almost half (47%) of the students who played the game after watching the video were able to identify that sunlight was captured. Almost a third (29%) of those who played the game identified chlorophyll as the molecule that captured the light. See After the video+game treatment, the majority (69%) of the students wrote down that NADPH was produced at that point. Also, a third (32%) of the students who watched the video only were able to identify NADPH as a product. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref>-11a.

The ETC representation was effective on addressing some of the misconceptions students' hold regarding photosynthesis and the ETC process in photosynthesis.

In the pretest, the scores distribution for the treatments were similar to begin with (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_77">14a</ref>).

However, in the video only treatment many students obtained the lowest scores (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_77">14b</ref>). This result suggests that playing the game provided students with the vocabulary and ideas to write a narrative about the ETC process. This result supported the objectives of the video+game learning experience, that was developed to foster students' ability to remember vocabulary and explain a representation.</p><p>The scores of the video only increased in almost one point out of 11 points, from 1.52 to 2.45 points, and the scores from the video+game increased in around 2.5 points.</p><p>In average, students got one point (10% of improvement) more in the essay section than in the item section of the instrument. This result suggested that giving students the chance to explain the ETC representation helped them to learn a bit more about the process. The distribution for the overall average score gain between pretest and posttest for both treatments for the essay is presented in the next section. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_77">15</ref>. The same distribution for the items was presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_89">13</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_48">24</ref> indicated that the p-value (sig.) for the effect of treatments on score gain is 0 (p= 0.000). Therefore, Ho is rejected in favor of Ha which means that 2.52 points of average score gain of the video+game treatment is statistically different than the 0.93 points of average score gain in the video only. There is a significant difference for score gain between the treatments. This is a positive result for this study because it indicated that the game had a positive impact on score gain over just watching the video. The value of this score gain difference after treatment was tested in a contrast matrix using ANOVA. Results indicated that students who played the game improved their average score by 13% over just watching the video. Summary. For both sections of the test, the difference of score gain between pretest and posttest after treatments was statistically significant. This result indicated that playing the game helped students to recall vocabulary of ETC and mimic how the ETC distribution for the overall average score gain between pretest and posttest for both classes is presented in the next section. pretest and posttest for challenge (mean= 0.76; std= 1.97) and regular (mean= 0.47; std= 2.00) classes is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_77">17b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_77">17c</ref>. The difference of score gain between challenge and regular class without considering the treatment effect was not significant (p=0.294). See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_47">23</ref>.

Electron Chute impacted both classes in the same way when considering the information provided by the multiple-choice section. However, the score gain was higher in the regular class after playing the game when considering the information provided by the essay. Overall, students in both classes achieved higher scores after playing the game. Students who attended the challenge class achieved the highest score in the multiple-choice and essay sections of the test, in both pretest and posttest, and for both treatments.

Boys and girls paid attention to their instructor's questions and to their peers' game to understand the actions of the game and the ETC process. However, when looking for some clarifications, boys engaged in more questions to the instructor and to their peers than girls. Both showed interest for learning the game and used the vocabulary of ETC, but were the boys who showed more interest in winning the game. The ability to perform the game actions was similar between boys and girls in most of the moves involved in playing the game. (Grace-Challenge).</p><p>Reason: At the beginning of the game, the player did not know she could lay down cards on PSI. She did later. Reason: The player had two cards laid down on the board. Therefore, she thought that the total number of cards, including those on the board, were five cards. Colleen, Mark, Alyssa, Steve-Regular).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reason:</head><p>The players seemed to ignore the presence of the oxygen cards on the board. The team focused on making and moving electrons. Reason: They were doing several actions in their same turn when they forgot it.</p><p>Later, they remembered to do it. Students did not read instructions to get the rules, therefore, a short set of rules with the main steps might be more adequate for them. Rules are a characteristic attribute of the game and govern the actions of the game <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref>. See below the summary of the rules for this version of the Electron Chute game. 3. In the following turns, lay down the essential cards either on position 1 or position 4-PSI.</p><p>4. When moving a two-electrons card from positions 2 to 3, roll the die for ATP.</p><p>5. Moving a two-electrons card from positions 3 to 4 needs chlorophyll and light cards.</p><p>6.

Peers helped each other in the completion of the task. Mistakes were minimal and were corrected over the course of the game. Some of the "mistakes" do not affect the learning objectives of the game. This is connecting the concept of electrons movement to the transformation of sunlight energy into chemical energy, ATP, and NADPH. For example, moving the two-electrons card from position 2 to position 4 in the same turn when light and chlorophyll are laid down on PSI could be an interesting modification to the game. Also, changing mind and moving a card from PSII to PSI in the same turn could increase the speed of the game and keep players engaged on it.</p><p>The vocabulary used by students focused on particles and molecules. These are:</p><p>electrons, chlorophyll, water, light, oxygen, protons, ATP, NADPH, CO 2 , glucose.</p><p>Students did not mention more complex concepts such as PSII, PSI, mobile protein, ATP synthase, NADP Reductase, lumen, stroma, thylakoid membrane. Students used "these,""here," "there" to refer to them. Electrons was the most used word.</p></div>

The instructional approach consisted of an ETC video and a game known as Electron Chute. They are models of how ETC works and they focused on developing students' learning of ETC in a way that could support their ability to remember new vocabulary of ETC and explain the process at the molecular level. The learning outcomes of the instructional approach were developed based on the common misconceptions students hold about photosynthesis. These misconceptions were described in section 2.3.1.2 in Chapter 2.</p><p>The design of learning experiences provided by the video and the game were supported by the constructivist theory of knowing and the how people learn framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bransford et al., 2000)</ref>. Under the constructivist theory of knowing a visual representation of ETC was designed to provide a schema that supported students' ability to recall the parts of the ETC process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gordin &amp; Pea, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2002)</ref>. In the game format, the rules that governed the movements of cards were supported by the epistemic game framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref> and they represented the chemical reactions associated with the flow of electrons in ETC.

The video was used to show students the transition from macro (environment, plant, leaves) to micro (cells, chloroplast, thylakoid membrane, electrons) levels in photosynthesis. Inside the chloroplast, the video showed step by step the flow of electrons through the thylakoid membrane that constituted the ETC process. The premise for this design is that the visual representation supports players' acquisition of the schema of ETC in their working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sweller et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yung &amp; Pass, 2015)</ref> to remember vocabulary and elements of the ETC occurs. Analysis of the test items and the essay suggested that the initial model provided by the ETC video helped students to recall and identify vocabulary related to the production of ATP production (L.O.8), O 2 production (L.O.10), and NADPH production (L.O.11), see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">8</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_39">Table 12</ref>. Students also recalled that ETC occurs in a cell structure -the thylakoid membrane (L.O.5). Additionally, the essay showed that students were able to further explain that the movement of electrons from PSII to H+ pump (L.O.8) was related to the ATP production, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">12</ref>. These learning outcomes were also achieved by the video+game treatment, and therefore, the effect on misconceptions of the video only treatment will be discussed in conjunction with the video+game treatment later.</p><p>Results of this study also indicated that the visual representation of the ETC process in the video alone was not enough to help students remember several concepts.

The mix of a visual representation in Electron Chute, in addition to the epistemic form and the rules that govern the game actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref>, helped students revisit this ETC model with each players' turn reenacting the ETC process. The analysis of the items and the essay suggested that playing the game after watching the video -video+game treatment-support students' ability to reinforce the vocabulary learned by the video only treatment (L.O. <ref type="bibr">5, L.O.8, L.O. 10, L.O.11)</ref>. Students who played the game recalled that the outputs of ETC -which were the outputs of the game-were used to convert CO 2 into carbohydrates (L.O.12. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">9</ref>). The essay analysis suggested that students who played the game after watching the video were able to create a narrative of the ETC representation that could explain the process (L.O.7, L.O.8, L.O.10, L.O.11. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">12</ref>). Epistemic forms and game construct knowledge and they provide a basic structure to build new knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref>. After playing the game, students were able to explain -in their own words -different steps of the ETC process and, therefore, they were able to build new knowledge of ETC.</p><p>Students hold misconceptions about photosynthesis because it is a multidimensional process including concepts related to the biochemical, autotrophic feeding, ecological, energetic and physiological dimensions <ref type="bibr">(Russell, Netherwood, &amp; Robinson, 2004</ref>). In the physiological dimension, students identified the leaves as the place where photosynthesis occurs (Kose, 2008) but they could have difficulties visualizing the cell structures where ETC takes place. Learning outcome 5 (L.O.5) measured students' ability to recall that ETC in photosynthesis occurs in the thylakoid membrane, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref>. The thylakoid is a structure inside the chloroplast, which is surrounded by the stroma, the liquid inside the chloroplast. See the back of the board in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> for the location of these structures.</p><p>Learning outcome 5 aimed to address a misconception held by students in regard to the cell location of photosynthesis as a whole, including the ETC process:</p><p>Photosynthesis takes place in chlorophyll <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Deshmukh, 2015)</ref>. This misconception could also be related to the similarities between the words "chloroplast" and "chlorophyll." Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast. The first phase of photosynthesis, known as the ETC process, occurs in the thylakoid membrane that is inside the chloroplast.</p><p>Chlorophyll molecules are pigments physically located in the thylakoid membrane inside the chloroplast. See Chapter 2 for more details. After treatments, 45% of students in the whole class remembered that the thylakoid membrane was the structure were ETC took place. Results suggested a positive effect of both treatments on students' achievement of L.O.5 and on addressing this misconception. Learning outcome 7 (L.O.7) measured students' ability to recall that the ETC process started when the sunlight energy was captured by chlorophyll molecules, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">8</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>. Learning outcome 7 aimed to address a misconception focused on the role of chlorophyll molecules in photosynthesis -Chlorophyll is produced in photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Marmaroti &amp; Galanopoulou, 2006</ref>)-instead of molecules responsible for capturing the light energy in ETC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Marmaroti and Galanopoulou (2006)</ref> observed that students identified chlorophyll molecules as inputs or outputs of photosynthesis and not as part of the reactions. Ekici and Aydin (2007) also found a similar misconception among college students. They indicated that chlorophyll and CO 2 were produced at the end of the photosynthesis process.</p><p>Understanding the role of chlorophyll molecules in ETC is key to understand photosynthesis as an energy transformation process. Students might have difficulties seeing chlorophyll as the molecules responsible for capturing the light energy in photosynthesis because they learned at school that chlorophyll molecules give plants their green color <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Flores et al., 2003)</ref>. Visualizing the chlorophyll on PSII and PSI on the Electron Chute board might have helped students to understand the role of chlorophyll molecules in ETC. After playing the game, 43% of students in the whole class were able to name chlorophyll as the molecules responsible of absorbing the energy to activate ETC. Also, three quarters (74%) of these students were able to identify the absorption of sunlight energy as the phenomenon that started ETC, see  Learning outcome 8 (L.O.8) measured students' ability to recall that ATP production involved a gradient of protons (H+) through the thylakoid membrane, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">8</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Figure 7</ref>. Learning outcome 8 aimed to address a misconception focused on the ATP production -The ATP production is the end point of photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Parker et al., 2012)</ref>-instead of an output of ETC. The light energy from the sun is the source of energy for the synthesis of ATP that is used for the synthesis of carbohydrates in the stroma of the chloroplast <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lehninger et al., 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Parker et al (2012)</ref> found that students identified the ATP as an output of photosynthesis used for cellular metabolism throughout a plant. Some students mentioned ETC producing ATP, but no one mentioned a gradient of protons or a proton pumping. ETC is a source of misunderstanding for students mostly because of the multi-step processes such as proton pumping, electron movement and light absorption involved in ETC <ref type="bibr">(Russell et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Mimicking the proton movement from stroma to lumen toward the ATP synthase on the Electron Chute game might have helped students to relate the ATP production to a gradient of proton (H+). After playing the game, more than half (55%) of the students reported that there was a "movement a protons to the lumen" and 41% reported that the movement of to the lumen was done through a proton pump, see . Also after playing the game, a third (33%) of the students indicated that the protons move back to the stroma through the ATP synthase, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">11</ref>-5a. After playing the game three quarters (74%) of the students reported that ATP was produced at that point. Almost a half (42%) of the students in the video only provided the same information, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">11-5b</ref>.</p><p>Using a visual representation to learn about ETC in a game format supported students' ability to learn about ETC and helped to address to some extent, common misconceptions. Playing the game could have helped students to be aware of their own misconceptions about energy transformation in photosynthesis. This way of learning might have helped students to remove their cognitive obstacle <ref type="bibr">(Galli &amp; Meinard, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>A cognitive obstacle is referred to a teleological thinking of the ETC process as having a purpose, for example, the production of oxygen for human consumption. By removing their cognitive obstacle, students might be able to make their own conceptual change needed for addressing misconceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Galli, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class recording.</head><p>In an epistemic game, the moves or actions are associated with the epistemic form or target knowledge structure to support learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref>. Electron Chute has five moves, or positions, and every move involves movement of electrons. This flow of electrons was activated by sunlight energy, which was the starting point of the game. Therefore, ATP was synthesized and released to the stroma in the chloroplast. The winner was the first player to produce the maximum number of ATP and NADPH molecules to create one molecule of glucose. The class recordings showed how students interacted with the electron cards that mimicked the movement of electrons to produce the outputs of ETC -ATP and NADPH.</p><p>There was a casual relation between the moves in the game, represented by the movement of the two-electrons card, and the change of state configuration of electrons from ground to excited in the ETC process. The class recording results indicated that some students struggled with the progressive movement of electrons from the starting point to the end of the game. General information gathered in the open-ended section (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_55">30</ref>) also showed that a group of students struggled with the progressive movement of electrons. Finding a correlation between students achievement of learning outcomes in the test and students difficulties to execute the moves of the two-electrons card from position 1 to 5 according to the rules, would have provided relevant information about students' understanding of the process. A positive correlation between scores and the presence of the behavior -moves of the electron cards according to the rules-could have provided evidence that students grasped the ideas behind the game that define how ETC works.</p><p>Learning using epistemic games is effective when the learning environment facilitates the social playing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993)</ref>. The class recording showed that the classroom environment allowed students to engage in peer discussions about the game while they were playing. Also, the analysis of the class recording evidenced that students interacted well with the game features. Electron Chute included features to enhance interaction between the players (i.e. cards), and add randomness to the game (i.e. die) on the board where the play action occurs <ref type="bibr">(Elias, Gardfield, Gutschera &amp; Whitley, 2012)</ref>. In this study, some students reported (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_55">30</ref>) that they liked the design of the board and some elements, such as the cards, while others recommended to have fewer elements on the board, or make the board larger to avoid clustering of the cards while playing. The class recoding made it possible to identify the students' game actions or moves that did not follow the rules. See The time provided to read the rules was not enough for all students. Time constraint is an important element of the design of a game <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Deterding, Dixon, Khaled &amp; Nacke, 2011)</ref>. In this case, the playing time was 20-25 minutes. From the class recording, few students read the instructions. The researcher explained the instructions to the class before playing the game. There were three to five trained adults available during the activity to answer all students' questions regarding how to play the game. At the beginning of the game activity, most of the students spent at least 2 minutes asking instructors how to play instead of reading the instructions. Some of the teams were able to follow the instructions provided by the instructors and ask for clarification to them and to their teammates, but some of them struggled with the time constraint.</p><p>Besides the difficulties students faced with the rules and time constrain at the beginning of the ETC game, other explanations for the low interest of participants in learning other concepts similar to ETC could be related to the students': (a) attitude about learning science <ref type="bibr">(Singh, Mido &amp; Dika, 2005)</ref>; (b) interest in getting engaged in gaming for learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bonanno &amp; Kommers, 2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(c)</ref> interest in learning science through games <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Israel, Wang, &amp; Marino, 2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(d)</ref> gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bonanno &amp; Kommers, 2008)</ref>. Students' attitude in regard to science influences their engagement to learn science <ref type="bibr">(Singh, Mido, &amp; Dika, 2005)</ref>. Students' interest in learning science by playing a game depends on the content and personal characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Israel, Wang, &amp; Marino, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>One conjecture for using serious games in formal educational settings is that learners see games as fun <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Elias, Garfield, Gutschera &amp; Whitley, 2012)</ref> and less schoollike <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gee, 2003)</ref>. However, a game format might be less suitable for students who see games as a source of entertainment more than as a learning experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bonanno &amp; Kommers, 2008)</ref> and for those students who require formal instructional curriculum <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Reis &amp; Renzulli, 2004)</ref>. Students with positive views of learning are more likely to engage in informal learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bell, Lewenstein, Shouse, &amp; Feder, 2007)</ref>. Using a serious game such as Electron Chute in formal education could be a plausible instructional approach for those students who have a positive view of learning with different methods, such as the mainstream regular students in this study. Through more refinements of the game, these learning experiences could be a viable learning experience that accommodates the needs of a diverse population of students who might prefer different learning methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study explored a video and a game learning experiences for supporting students' learning of the ETC process. This instructional intervention focused on helping learners' conceptual representation of the ETC process in a way that would support their ability to explain the process at the molecular level. The conclusions of this study derived from the implementation of a pretest-posttest design to measure the effect of the treatment and academic readiness on score gain. Students' feedback was collected from a survey at the end of the treatments and it provided insights of how to improve the game for future learners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Conclusions of the Study</head><p>In an era where knowledge is provided to learners from many different channels, engaging students in serious game like the Electron Chute game could invite learners to gain understanding of abstract and complex scientific concepts. The schema of ETC provided by the video and reinforced by playing the Electron Chute game fostered students' ability to remember the vocabulary of ETC and helped them explaining how the ETC works. Several key points of this study are as follows. were able to write down several sequential ideas of the ETC process.</p><p>Learning key ideas could help students make connections with other similar scientific processes they would learn in a similar learning context and that scientist do in their everyday work. b. Students were able to remember the basics of the scientific language of a complex process -such as ETC-and to explain those concepts in an essay after playing the game just one time. This suggested that students were able to process data and information in a manner that allowed them to engage with science using different learning methods, such as a serious game. This kind of instructional intervention is challenging for students but it fosters group participation that allows them to actively engage in their own learning. 4) Social interaction in the learning environment created through game play.</p><p>a. Learning using serious games such as ETC can be effective when the learning environment facilitates social interactions. In this study, the classroom environment allowed students to engage in peer discussions about the game while they were playing. Additionally, students interacted well with the game features. Electron Chute included features to enhance interaction between the players (i.e. cards) and add randomness to the game (i.e. die).</p><p>b. A Reinforcement of ideas came from peer discussion. Playing the game within a community of learning -such as a classroom-provided the opportunity for all team members to learn through peer's discussions, even for those who were listeners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Limitations</head><p>Some additional limitations were found during the development of this dissertation, beside those mentioned in Chapter 1.</p><p>This research did not find the misconceptions participants' hold about the energy transformation process in photosynthesis by asking them to draw how they thought ETC occurs. Rather, the misconceptions were obtained from the literature review. Also, the ETC video and the Electron Chute game were not suitable for blind participants, but no participant in this study had a visual disability.</p><p>In regard to the lessons prior the treatments, there was not a pre-test that measures the effectiveness of the lessons about photosynthesis. Those lessons (Appendix D &amp; E)</p><p>were taught prior to treatments to help students gain the basic knowledge of photosynthesis -inputs and outputs-required to study the ETC process. The learning outcomes -1 to 4-of the lessons were measured with the items 1 to 4 of the instrument.</p><p>In this study, students did not have the chance to play a second round to reinforce retention of knowledge and aid students to improve knowledge performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Grechus &amp; Brown, 2000)</ref>. Considering that students had to fulfill the requirements of the school curriculum before the end of the academic year, students were available to play Electron Chute only once at the end of the school year. Also, the lapse of time students had to interact with the Electron Chute game might have not been enough to complete the task and retain what they were learning while playing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ausubel, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>For future research, the game should be played more than once to help students in remembering information. The number of repetition and the time allotted for playing would depend on the time and resource constraints the teacher has for his or her classes.</p><p>Learning under a constructivist view involves iteration to improve students' understanding of a process <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lee &amp; Hannafin, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Absence of repetition or playing Electron Chute only once reduced opportunities to reinforce learning outcomes. If students would have had the opportunity to play the game several times until they mastered the game, they could understand the energy transformation process in photosynthesis better. If students learn the ETC process in photosynthesis well, they could use the general concepts learned of this complex process in a similar process <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barnett &amp; Ceci, 2002)</ref>. Another study needs to be done to identify how many iterations it takes until achieving the learning goals is achieved.</p><p>In a way to best capture thoughts from the regular and challenge classes, interviews could have been conducted with a small number of students per group.</p><p>nterviews give the researcher the chance to ask for students' clarifications and expand their answers <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Saldaña, 2009)</ref>. In doing that, cognitive obstacle -teleological thinking-for understanding of ETC could be detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Galli, 2011)</ref>. A cognitive obstacle is referred to a teleological thinking of the ETC process as having a purpose, for example, the production of oxygen for human consumption. With the right questions, the researcher could pursue conjectures associated with the differences between the regular and challenge classes in regard to games as entertainment versus learning experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bonanno &amp; Kommers, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In the same context, it would have been enriching to have request from students to build their own representation or schema of ETC to determine their misconceptions and if their schema was sufficient for remembering and make sense of how ETC works <ref type="bibr">(Vosniadou, 2009)</ref>. .Providing additional questions could have helped the researcher to identify any cognitive obstacle-teleological thinking-that might be obstructing students' understanding of ETC <ref type="bibr">(Galli &amp;Meinard, 2011)</ref>. In doing so, inferences about the conceptual change needed for learning ETC could have been done <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Galli, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>instructional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Reis &amp; Renzulli, 2004)</ref> to reduce cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Sweller, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>These levels in order are: ( <ref type="formula">1</ref> photolysis of water molecules and production of oxygen. In doing so, the game makes clear that the activation of chlorophyll occurs first, and as a consequence of that event water molecules are split by the sunlight energy. Those reactions occur almost simultaneously. First the activation of light produces that electrons from chlorophyll "are lost" from PSII. Then, and therefore, there is a need to fill those lost electrons from others that come from the photolysis of water molecules. As a consequence, oxygen is produced from the split of water molecules by the sunlight energy.</p><p>A second recommendation is to create a video or game or both about the second phase of photosynthesis -Calvin Cycle-to complete the photosynthesis process. The outputs of ETC -ATP and NADPH-transform molecules of CO 2 from the air into carbohydrates-in the stroma of the chloroplast. Carbohydrates are used by plants for storage, cell metabolism for maintenance and build its structure and, therefore, for their survival.</p><p>The video and the game glance those ideas at the end and visualize that transformation with the scorecard (18ATP+12NADPH+6CO2=&gt; 1Glucose). However, this transformation remained unveil for students during the video and game learning experiences. Also, learning about the Calvin-Cycle as sequel game or video could help students to have a global picture of the relationship between energy and matter. Any molecule described in ETC and the Calvin Cycle has weight and then matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lehninger et al., 2005)</ref>. The transformation of molecules of CO 2 into carbohydrates is a matter transformation as well. The matter of plants, such as, the wood in the trees-bark and branches-come from an invisible molecule in the air known as CO 2 that leaves take in.</p><p>Therefore, most of the mass of trees come from the air. Differently to energy, which is one direction, matter in the planet is recycled over and over. This concept is frequently described in the Standards Indiana Academic Standards (Indiana Department of Education, 2016);and the NGSS standards (NGSS, 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Summary</head><p>The active participation of students during the Electron Chute game and the positive results in the test and essay provided evidence to suggest that a serious game might be suitable for learning complex scientific processes for middle school students in  Rubric for Data Analysis Photosynthesis and Electron Transport Chain Description and purpose: This instrument (knowledge test) consists of two main sections based on the revised version of Bloom's Taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson, Krathwohl, &amp; Bloom, 2001)</ref>. There are no penalties for misspelling words. The purpose of the instrument is to determine students' ability to <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> recall vocabulary related to photosynthesis and ETC; (2) identify the sequence of events happening in the ETC process; (3) explain a representation of ETC.</p><p>Multiple-Choice Section: Select the best option.</p><p>Objective: to determine students' ability to recall and recognize vocabulary of the main concepts of photosynthesis and the electron transport chain (ETC) process and to identify how the process of ETC occurs in a way that makes sense to the representation they were exposed during the ETC video and Electron Chute, the board game. All of them are worth 1 point.</p><p>1. What is the part of the plant where photosynthesis take place? a) Root. b) Leaves. Learning outcome 1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).      Demonstrate the experimental procedure and encourage students to think what the hypothesis of the experimental activity is. In doing so, scientific inquiry is promoted.</p><p> Team discussion in their lab tables (2 minutes): Identify the hypothesis of the experimental activity. Visit their lab tables to check and discuss with the students their hypothesis.</p><p>Expand (20 minutes):</p><p> Experimental activity (see instructions below). The goal of this activity is that students are able to see the presence of the starch in the leaves using a colorant of starch (iodine).</p><p> The task consists of boiling a leaf in hot water to destroy its structure. This allows the colorant (iodine) interact with the starch (blue spots). To make the blue spots visible, the chlorophyll pigments are removed by boiling the leaf in denatured alcohol. After the leaf is colorless, it is soaked in a iodine solution.</p><p>Evaluation (5 minutes):</p><p> Handout students filled during the lab experience (below).</p><p> Class discussion and feedback about the laboratory activity. e. One glucose card which is the final prize. Set the glucose card on its place on the board.</p><p>2. The center board is home for the major playing cards consisting of the essential element cards stack containing the key elements for the ETC process: water (H 2 O), light from the sun and chlorophyll cards. The light is a limiting factor on the ETC process in photosynthesis, therefore, there is a limited number of these cards. For two players, the essential element cards stack contains 30 water cards (blue color), 30 chlorophyll cards (green color) and 20 light cards (yellow color).</p><p>For three players, the essential element cards stack contains 45 water cards (blue color), 45 chlorophyll cards (green color) and 30 light cards (yellow color). These cards are shuffled and placed face down. 5. The discard: At the end of each turn, the player always discards one card. This card can be a different card or the same card the player picked up from the essential element card stack.</p><p>6. If the essential elements card stack runs out, the discard stack turns over.</p><p>Shuffling is optional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Turn Taking</head><p>Each turn consists of the following parts:</p><p>1. The draw: Each player draws cards only from the essential elements card stack to replenish their hand to five cards. Players always need to start their turn with five cards.</p><p>2. The lay down: In the first turn, players can only lay down cards at position 1.</p><p>After that, players can lay down the cards at positions 1 or 4 or both. At position 1 which is PSII (Photosystem II protein complex) , players lay down light (yellow), water (blue) and chlorophyll (green) cards. If the players do not have the three of them, they lay down the ones they have. At position 4 which is PSI (Photosystem I protein complex), players lay down light (yellow) and chlorophyll (green) cards.</p><p>The game starts in position 1.   *The absent of p-value in some codes indicates that both observers grades all the codes with the same binary number either "1" for present or either "0" for absent. In other words, there was not variability within the codes and between the observers. Therefore, Ho is not rejected in favor of Ha. Ho: μ observer 1= μ observer 2 (where μ is the mean of the population); Ha: μ observer 1 ≠ μ observer 2.</p><p>The classification procedure of the data in categories and codes is reliable. </p></div>

The researcher reviewed the main concepts of the board game and the rules of the game (Appendix I). The discussion of the rules was expressed in terms of the explanation of ETC: (1) flow of electrons =&gt; production of NADPH; (2) movement of H+ activated by the flow of electrons equals the production of ATP; (3) ATP + NADPH + CO2 = Glucose production (winning the game). This last formula was kept on the screen during the game play to remind students how to win the game.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_15"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>N=115) was organized in a histogram. To measure the level of difficulty of each item, the scores of the whole class (N=115) were considered to calculate the difficult index (p). The difficult index (p) is the proportion of learners who answered an item correctly. The p value should be between 0.21-0.60 which indicates that the item is neither too difficult nor too easy. The interpretation of value per range is: (1) below or equal 0.20, very difficult; (2) 0.21-0.40, moderately difficult; (3) 0.41-0.60, average; (4) 0.61-0.80, moderately easy; (5) above or equal 0.81, very easy (Popham, 2013). This parameter is calculated using the expression below: Difficult Index (p) = Number of students answering an item correctly Total number of students attempting item To measure the discrimination (D) of each item, the tests of all students (N=115) were divided into two groups consisting of the highest scores group (N=58) and the lowest scores group (N=57) tests each. The division of the tests for the high score and low score groups considers the total number of students who take the test and the distribution of the scores in the histogram. The discrimination index (D) indicates the extent to which an item differentiates between learners who score well on the test and those students who perform poorly. The value of D for the keyed response, correct option, of each item should be positive. The D value for each one of the distractors should be negative. Distractors that have a positive D should be rewritten. Distractors that have a D value equal to zero might be rewritten (Popham, 2013). This discrimination index (D) is calculated using the expression below: D =N° of students answering an item correctly in the high group-N° answering correctly in the low group Number of students in either the high or the low group Example of calculations. As an example of calculation, consider the following statement (item 12): "What molecules transform carbon dioxide into carbohydrates? (Answer: ATP, NADPH)" In the posttest, 41 out of 115 students answered it correctly. Therefore, the level of difficulty of item 12 was 0.36. This means that item 12 was moderately difficult with only 41 out of 115 students selecting the correct choice. See expression below: Difficult Index (p) = 41/115 = 0.36</figDesc></figure>

Also, open ended questions helped the researcher to identify any unanticipated issues and opportunities about what worked well and what they would improve about the experience. The goal of this information was to better profile students' interest in this informal education environment for learning science content, and how to improve the quality of the game experience related to generating interest, explaining complex abstract concepts and learning scientific facts.

This test was chosen based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which tells that a large sample (n) assumes normal distribution of the sampling distribution of the mean independent of the shape of the distribution of the population. The sample size n is considered large when np 0 ≥10 and n(1-p 0 ) ≥10 which means that the estimator p-hat p ) is approximately normally distributed(Devore, 2015). The formula for the single sample z-test is indicated below and it is valid when np 0 ≥10 and n(1-p 0 ) ≥ 10.Test statistic value z equal to In the expression, p is the proportion of the sample choosing strongly agree-agree, n is the sample size and p 0 (1-p 0 )/n is the standard error, s p0 . The margin error of the survey items was calculated multiplying the standard error and the z critical value. The margin error is 8.9 % (margin error = s p0 *1.96*100% = 0.0456*1.96*100 = 8.9%). As it was indicated above, p 0 is the proportion expected (0.5) if there is no difference between the proportion of strongly agree-agree and strongly disagree-disagree responses.

The sample size was n=120, therefore, 120*0.5 ≥10 and 120(1-0.5) ≥ 10 which means that the estimator p-hat p ) is approximately normally distributed, hence the following test procedure is valid. The statistic value z = (0.68-0.5)/( 0.5(1-0.5)/120) = 0.18/ 0.0021= 3.83 (3.83&gt; 1.96).</figDesc></figure>

Set the oxygen card in its place on the board. c. At the start of every turn a player can move the two-electron card they have on the board following these simple rules a) 2-electrons card moves from PSII to Mobile 1. b) 2-electrons card moves from Mobile 1 to Mobile 2. This movement pumps the 4-proton (H+) card to move to the ATP synthesis state-the player rolls the die and adds that many ATP molecules on their scorecard. c) If the player has Light and Chlorophyll cards on PSI, then moves the 2-electrons card at Mobile 2 to Mobile 3. d) 2-electrons card moves from Mobile 3 to NADP Reductase. The player rolls the die and adds that many NADPH molecules to their score card. d Immediately after collecting 12 NADPH and the 18 ATP molecules, the player can start adding CO 2 by rolling the die and adds that many CO 2 molecules to their score card. The player who first completes 12 NADPH, 18 ATP and at least 6 CO 2 molecules wins the glucose card and is the winner of Electron Chute game. The discard: The player discards one card facing up on top of the Discard pile at the end of his or her turn. This card can be a different card or the same card the player picked up from the Essential Elements card stock or Discard pile. If the Essential Elements card stock runs out, the Discard pile turns over and combined with the essential elements card each player used at PSII and PSI. Shuffle the pile. In each turn, pick up 5 cards at the beginning and discard 1 card at the end. a) Start laying down the essential cards on position 1-PSII. b) Start setting a two-electrons card on position 1-PSII. Lay down an oxygen card on the board. 2. In each turn, move the electrons from one position to the next position only if it is empty. In the following turns, lay down the essential cards either on position 1 or position 4-PSI. 4. When moving a two-electrons card from positions 2 to 3, roll the die for ATP. 5. Moving a two-electrons card from positions 3 to 4 needs chlorophyll and light cards. When moving a two-electrons card from positions 4 to 5, roll the die for NADPH.

Results were organized in three sections (1) Knowledge Test; (2) Class Recording; (3) Exit Survey. Sections 4.3 showed the results of the analysis of the Knowledge Test. Subsection 4.3.1 described the results from the multiple-choice section of the test and subsection 4.3.2 presented the results from the essay. Both sections gave the researcher different information about students' learning experiences of the video only treatment and the video+game treatment. The multiple-choice section measured students' ability to recall vocabulary and identify the various steps of the ETC process. The essay section provided insightful information regarding students' ability to interpret an ETC representation. Section 4.4 presented the results from the classroom video and audio recording of students playing the Electron Chute game. Students were divided into teams of three or four players. The recording captured the behavior of the teams and of each player while playing. Also, the recording collected valuable information about the students' game actions, moves, and investigated the strategies done by them in the game. The analysis of the recording allowed the researcher to identify the challenge students had in following the instructions, rules, and the model of the ETC process presented to them. The analysis of the students' moves helped the researcher to understand what the player was thinking when the action was done and to use that insights for improvement of the learning experiences.</figDesc></figure>

The items of the knowledge test were revised by calculating the difficulty (p) and discrimination (D) items. The difficulty index indicates the difficulty of an item by providing the proportion of students who responded the item correctly. The discrimination index measures the extent to what an item distinguishes between students who obtained the highest score in each test from those who obtained the lowest score. The logic behind calculating D is that students who answered the item correctly also responded well on the test and vice versa. Therefore, a positive discrimination index indicates that an item is measuring what the rest of the test is measuring (Popham, 2013).</figDesc></figure>

The quantitative analysis target students' understanding of information in the video and game, their comprehension of the rules of the game and their interest in the content area and future learning. A qualitative analysis was performed to help validate these results and identify any unforeseen issues or opportunities the students might have had about the learning experience. The following summarizes the results of the analysis.The presentation of results from the quantitative analysis section was divided in four parts (1) students' reactions to the ETC video and the Electron Chute game learning experiences; (2) effect of treatments on students' reactions to the video and game and interest in science; (3) effect of academic readiness on students' reactions to the video and game and interest in science; (4) effect of treatments between academic readiness on students' reactions to the video and game and interest in science.These results focused on comparing students' feedback after watching the ETC video and playing Electron Chute. The survey analysis was performed for both treatments. The video+game group experienced the ETC video and played Electron Chute on the same day. The video only group experienced a one day delay between watching the ETC video and playing the game.

In this chapter, results were organized in three sections: (1) knowledge test results; (2) class recording results; (3) exit survey results. The knowledge test was designed to measure students' achievement of the learning outcomes after participating in the instructional intervention presented in Chapter 2. The class recording provided insights about students' engagement with the game process and the benefits of peer interactions for learning. The survey collected students' feedback after watching the ETC video and playing Electron Chute. The instrument or knowledge test was divided in two sections (1) multiple-choice; (2) essay. The multiple-choice section collected information about the learning outcomes associated to the academic standards and students' misconceptions. The essay section provided general information regarding students' ability to interpret the ETC representation. The survey results were presented in two sections (1) quantitative analysis of the survey; (2) qualitative analysis for the open-ended questions of the survey. The results from the quantitative analysis targeted students' understanding of information in the video and game. The qualitative results provided information about any issue the students had about the learning experiences to improve the video and game for future learners.</figDesc></figure>

Students have difficulty in visualizing and understanding how the transformation of sunlight energy in plants occurs. Therefore, a model of how ETC works in a video and game format could help students to comprehend the phenomenon. The research question of this study was:</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_76"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>to the results found in the survey, students' schema of ETC before the treatments seems to be lacking.Ninety three percent of participants have not studied ETC before the treatments. The survey data suggested that there was a treatment effect on both classes. This effect was more obvious in the challenge class. Students' perceived achievement of the learning outcomes in the challenge-video only group was the lowest among the groups. The class rules, most of them from the challenge class. Rules were vital in the Electron Chute game because they constrained the movement a player could or could not take. The moves in the game were linked to the causal relations of electron change of state configuration from ground to excited in the ETC process. The rules supported players to learn specific content (Charsky, 2010) about the steps of ETC. Students in the video only treatment played the game after taking the posttest. Therefore, it is possible that their lower scores of the video only, in comparison to the video+game treatment, were not related to the unclear rules, but to the fact that these students took the posttest after only watching the video. A test after the video only group played the game would have helped the researcher to elucidate the quantifiable negative impact of the delay on students' achievement of learning outcomes.</figDesc></figure>

The learning outcomes were based on the understanding -remembering and explainingof the ETC process. The ETC process is a representation of the transformation of one type of energy -light energy-into another typechemical energy by the activation of particles known as electrons. Playing the game several times could reinforce the scientific language and the process by mimicking its steps continuously. Visual representation of abstract science concept supported learning and addressing misconceptions. a. Using a visual representation of ETC in photosynthesis as a game supported students' ability to learn about ETC and helped to address to some extent, common misconceptions. Playing the game could have helped students to be aware of their own misconceptions about energy transformation in photosynthesis. b. The design of a serious game for learning unseen processes needs to have a simplified but accurate representation of the process to be meaningful for the learners. The video was designed to introduce the idea of energy transformation represented by the ETC process. The game was designed as a model of causal ideas related to this energy transformation. The game explicitly triggered students' discussions about the rules that were intentionally designed to match the learning outcomes of the game and increase the learners' abilities to articulate explanations. Indirectly by learning how to play the game, students were addressing misconceptions and learning the science behind the game. c. To learn science well, learners should learn key concepts and the relationship between them. For example, the key concepts of the ETC process of photosynthesis that were displayed in the Electron Chute game are similar to the ETC process of cellular respiration. Viable alternate instructional approach aligned with NCSS standards promotes positive views of learning. a. Playing the game provided a transition between learning about science by watching visual images and learning science by mimicking a real process scientists study in their work. This is aligned to NGSS that indicate students learning science through methods that represent the scientific work.</figDesc></figure>

Mainstream regular students were positive about learning with the game. They were most likely to report understanding the rules of the game, finding it interesting, and being able to explain how plants transform energy from the sun into energy plants need to survive.

ETC is a dynamic process, then it starts when sunlight energy is captured by chlorophylls molecules in both PSI and PSII at the same time. To facilitate the understanding, in this rubric the explanation will start with the activation of chlorophyll molecules in PSII first, and then in PSI.

Give students the same handout but randomize the questions. Class discussion and feedback. What is the special part of the plants where photosynthesis take place? In leaves, what is the name of the special matter that captures the light energy from the sun and "help the plant" to perform photosynthesis? __________________________________________________________________ In leaves, what is the name of the special matter that gives the green color In the leaves, what is a kind of carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis? __________________________________________________________________ 10. In leaves, what is the gas released/given off from the plant to the environment? __________________________________________________________________ 11. What is the state of matter of oxygen and how is it involved in the cycle</figDesc></figure>

The twoelectron card moves one step in order from position 1 to 2, from position 2 to 3, from position 3 to 4 and from position 4 to 5. The movement of the five twoelectron cards from position 1 to position 3 produces one ATP. Throwing the die multiplies the number of ATP molecules to score on the scorecard. If the die marks 2 points, the player put the pin on number 2 in the ATP column in the scorecard. The movement of the five two-electron cards from position 4 to rolls/throws the die and adds on his or her scorecard as many ATP places as the die shows. The 4-proton (H+) card moves back to the stroma to its original position on the board. At this point of ETC, ATP has been synthesized. b.1. If in the same turn there is a two-electron card on position 1 (PSII), move it to position 2 (Mobile 1 molecule). b.2. Use the five essential element cards to start another electron movement. Repeat 3.1 and 3.2. c. The two-electron card is moved from position 3 (Mobile 2 protein) to position 4 (Mobile 3 protein) when the light (yellow) and the chlorophyll (green) cards are present on PSI. Remove the light and chlorophyll cards. Discard them to the discard card stack. d. The two-electron card is moved from position 4 (Mobile 3 protein) to position 5 (NADP Reductase protein). The movement of the five twoelectron cards from position 4 to position 5 produces one NADPH molecule. When that happens, the player rolls/throws the die and adds on his or her scorecard as many NADPH places as the die shows. Then, take the two-electron card in position 5 and return it next to the start point (arrow) on the board game. To continue the electron movement follow these rules: d.1. If in the same turn there is a two-electron card on position Mobile 2 protein) and light and chlorophyll cards on PSI, move the two-electron card from position 3 to position 4 (Mobile 3 protein).</figDesc></figure>

Use the five essential element cards to start another electron movement. Repeat 3.1 and 3.2. d.5. Use any additional chlorophyll or light cards to set on PSI but keep one card to discard. 4. In the same turn after collecting at least 12 NADPH molecules and at least 18 ATP molecules, the player can start adding CO 2 molecules by rolling the die and adds on his or her scorecard as many CO 2 places as the die shows. In the next turn, the player who is adding CO 2 molecules to the scorecard rolls the die until 6 CO 2 molecules are completed. The player who first completes 12 NADPH, 18 ATP and at least 6 CO 2 molecules wins the glucose card and move it from its position on the board to the scorecard. At this point, he or she is the winner of the Electron Chute game. 5. If the game finishes without completing the ATP and NADPH molecules in the scorecard or if two players have the same score, then the winner is the player who has more oxygen (O 2 ) cards and, therefore, has released more oxygen (O 2 ) molecules to the environment.</figDesc></figure>

The planting activity aimed to promote the importance of light into photosynthesis for plant survival, and the laboratory experience engaged students in the visualization of a product of photosynthesis in leaves by using a dying compound. All these activities were supported by handouts developed by the researcher and can be found in the appendix section of this document (Appendix D &amp; E).</p><p>Overall, each of the six classes participated in one 45 minutes session each week.</p><p>Lessons focused on achieving multiple standards related to life sciences for middle school students -Indiana Academic Standards-Biology Standard 2 (Indiana Department of <ref type="bibr">Education, 2016)</ref> and the NGSS for the life sciences-LS1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(NGSS, 2013)</ref>. The researcher conducted all the lessons with the support of the teacher. The teacher aided in managing classroom behavior and logistics. The ETC video and the Electron Chute game were the last set of learning activities conducted during the last two weeks of the spring semester.</p><p>The ETC video story board and scripts are in Appendix A. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> summarized the sequence of instruction leading up to the intervention presented in the following section along with the sequence of steps in the treatments.</p><p>The first intervention was the administration of a diagnostic test. The diagnostic test consisted of complex items that focused on the application of content about photosynthesis. The goal of this test was to gather information about students' ability to follow instructions and manage difficult concepts before teaching them the vocabulary and basic content about photosynthesis required to implement the treatments. In general, students struggled with the complexity of the items of the diagnostic test. Therefore, the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.2">Differences in Students' Interpretation of the ETC Representation between the Treatments for the Essay</head><p>The essay evaluated the students' ability to interpret the ETC process. Table <ref type="table">11</ref> summarizes in a quantifiable way the explanations students gave of the ETC representation designed by the researcher. The steps of the ETC process were presented in the video step by step. The image of ETC on the board game and the game actionsmoves-were developed based on the progression of images of the video. Table <ref type="table">11</ref> shows the proportion of students who best interpreted the ETC representation according to the rubric developed by the researcher. A comparison between the treatments is presented in <ref type="bibr">Table 11</ref>. Table <ref type="table">12</ref> shows a comparison of the pretest-posttest difference between the video only and video+game treatments. absence of light. The question in the diagnostic test provided more information to help students relate the curricular concept of "light-independent reactions" to the concept of "synthesis of carbohydrates." The question searched if students recalled that the stroma was the place inside the chloroplast where one of the products of photosynthesis -the carbohydrates-were produced.</p><p>Learning outcome 7: Recall that chlorophyll molecules in Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) capture sunlight energy. Learning outcome <ref type="bibr">7 (L.O.7)</ref> required from students to remember that the ETC process started when the sunlight energy was captured by chlorophyll molecules. Once activated, ETC behaves as a cyclical phenomena between PSII and PSI, however, ETC requires sunlight energy to be activated. Therefore, in this research, the activation of ETC by sunlight energy is defined as the starting point of ETC. See Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Also, see positions 1 and 4 on the board of the Electron Chute game -Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>-for reference. Learning outcome 7 corresponded to item 7 of the instrument. According the item analysis in the previous section, item 7 functioned well. See Table <ref type="table">17</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment.</p><p>Learning outcome 9: Understand that the ETC process in photosynthesis is the transformation of sunlight energy into chemical energy (ATP). Learning outcome 9 (L.O.9) summarized the ETC process and evaluated the students' ability to interpret the process beyond only remembering the vocabulary of the process. According to the item analysis in the previous section, the content of item 9 was relevant for the evaluation of the treatments but there was a problem with distractor "d." Distractor "d" referred to a step in the ETC process, but it was not the best definition of the whole process.</p><p>The data in Table <ref type="table">8</ref> suggested a negative impact of treatments on students' ability to achieve learning outcome 9. However, the data also suggested that item 9 failed to measure this learning outcome. Considering that distractor "d" should have been modified to infer conclusions regarding L.O.9, the data suggested that the treatments helped students to relate ETC to a movement of protons (H+) through a membrane. Data from distractor "d" showed a positive result in regard to this point. A third (36%) of the whole class related the ETC process to the concept of proton movement (H+). The flow of proton (H+) through the thylakoid membrane is a step of ETC involved in the ATP production. See Table <ref type="table">19</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning outcome 12: Recall that the products of ETC in photosynthesis,</head><p>ATP and NADPH, convert CO 2 into carbohydrates. Learning outcome <ref type="bibr">12 (L.O.12)</ref> referred to the outputs of ETC -ATP and NADPH-and the fixation of carbon dioxide by ATP and NADPH into carbohydrates. In the ETC video and the Electron Chute game, the carbohydrate is glucose. According to the item analysis in the previous section, distractors "a" and "d" were not appealing to the students because they drew almost the same number of answers from higher performing than lower performing students. Like item 11, the content of item 12 was relevant for the evaluation of the treatments.</p><p>The data in Table <ref type="table">8</ref> suggested a positive effect of the video+game treatment on students' ability to achieve L.O.12. The difference observed between those watching only the video and students who watched the video and played the game was statistically significant (Z=2.913; p&lt;0.05). See Table <ref type="table">22</ref> for the key and distractors analysis per treatment.</p><p>In the pretest, 36% of students in the whole class -39% video only and 33% video+game-selected foil "a" as correct answer: "Water and NADPH transform carbon dioxide into carbohydrates." After the treatments, there was a statistically significant difference between the proportion of students who selected foil "a" in the pretest and the posttest in the whole class and in the treatments. Therefore, the treatments helped students to clarify that ATP and no water -and NADPH-fixed CO 2 into carbohydrates.</p></div>

In the pretest, the scores distribution for the treatments showed a slight difference to begin with (Figure <ref type="figure">12a</ref>).

However, in the posttest, the score distribution for the video+game treatment was displaced toward the right side indicating that some students in the video+game reached higher scores in comparison to the video only treatment (Figure <ref type="figure">12b</ref>). Likewise, only students in the video only obtained the lowest scores between 0-2 points (Figure <ref type="figure">12b</ref>). The distribution for the overall average score gain between pretest and posttest for both treatments is presented in the following section. See Figure <ref type="figure">13</ref>.</p><p>Overall average score gain for pretest and posttest between the treatmentsmultiple-choice. The score distribution for the score gain between pretest and posttest for the treatments is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">13b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">13c</ref>.

The gain score distribution between pretest and posttest is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">15b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">15c</ref>. As it was expected, the graph shows that the score gain was higher in the video+game (Figure <ref type="figure">15c</ref>) than the video only (Figure <ref type="figure">15b</ref>). The video+game group increased its score in an average of 2.52 points out of 11 points (std= 1.39) which is approximately 22% of gain. The video only increased its score in 0.93 points (std=2.02) which is approximately 9% of gain. The difference of score gain between treatments is significant (p=0.000) and it is shown in Table <ref type="table">24</ref>.</p><p>Significance -essay. To determine if the treatment was significant for the score gain observed between treatments, a univariate analysis of variance was performed. The dependent variable was score gain and the statistical methods was ANOVA <ref type="bibr">(Devore, 2015)</ref>. More information is provided in the method section-essay. Results are presented in Table <ref type="table">24</ref>. The hypothesis 1 is presented in this section again to facilitate the explanations of the results. See the methods section. In brief, the difference of overall average score gain between the treatments was statistically significant (p=0.000) (Table <ref type="table">24</ref>). The analysis of the video only performance gave some indication of the benefits of the video while the performance of the video+game treatment provided some indication of the learning potential of the video and the Electron Chute game. According to the histograms in Figure <ref type="figure">15b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">15c</ref>, the video+game treatment increased its score an average of 2.52 points and the video only increased its score by 0.93 points. To determine if 2.52 points were significantly different from 0.93 points, a univariate analysis of variance was performed to test the hypothesis 1 for the essay. The univariate process works. Learning scientific language and mimicking the process supported students' ability to describe a visual representation of ETC in a essay format.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Game Actions that do not Follow the Rules</head><p>This section showed the moves and actions students were doing while playing the game. These actions have the particularity that do not follow the rules explained to the students before playing the game. These rules were developed by the researcher based on the learning objectives of the game. Before starting playing, the researcher gave to each one of the classes a presentation about the rules (Appendix G). Also, each team received the instructions with the rules in a hard copy. However, few students looked at them at the beginning of or during the game. Rules are restrictions that constrain the actions or moves and support players to learn specific content <ref type="bibr">(Charsky, 2010)</ref>. The moves presented in this section helped the researcher to visualize the different way the game could be play without affecting the learning objective of the game. The learning objective is helping students to connect the transformation of light energy into chemical energy (ATP, NADPH) to a flow of electrons using the ETC visual representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gordin &amp; Pea, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2002)</ref> and mimicking the process while playing. In other cases, the violations of the rules made the game unplayable. In this last case, a summarized set of rules-instruction-of the main moves of the game was delineated from this analysis to facilitate the flow of the game. They are presented at the end of this section. See the image of the board in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>The team thought that it was required to have three essential elements cards (light, chlorophyll and water) in one hand to lay them down together on PSII and start generating electrons. Also, they thought that both light and chlorophyll cards should be laid down simultaneously on PSI.  Reason: The player was not aware of the limiting number of light cards in the ETC game. Light is a limiting factor in the ETC process and in the game, therefore, there were a limited number of light cards. The science concept behind this idea is that the ETC process requires sunlight energy to occur. If she would have kept the light card, her chance to generate electrons in the next turn should have been higher.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reason:</head><p>The player thought we could use a card previously laid down on the board.</p><p>Conclusions. The game needs to be played several times to help students to fully learn about ETC-once a week for a month-for reinforcement of vocabulary and the process of energy transformation. Students could be tested at the beginning (pretest) and at the end of the activities (posttest) to evaluate learning.</p><p>Reducing the number of actions might help them to remember the steps of the game. Students tend to forget action because there are several actions happening at the same time. For example, in some moment of the game, when four electrons are moving on the board, there are 12 actions students need to remember and perform: (1) picking up the cards; (2) moving electrons from 1 to 2; (3) making a new electron (position 1) and Summary of the section. Playing Electron Chute on the same day than watching the video provided learning experience that lead to students having a positive reaction to their ability to explain how plants convert light energy into energy plants need to survive.</p><p>Participants who played Electron Chute on the same day than the video were more likely to agree that they understood the rules of the game and were not lost while playing the game. The challenge class in both treatments report the lowest interest in learning more concepts like ETC and demanded more explanations about how to play. They may have a higher expectation in their ability to explain scientific concepts that Electron Chute did not provide. The regular class was the most positive about learning with Electron Chute.</p><p>They were most likely to report understanding the rules of the game, finding it interesting, and being able to explain the ETC process. This kind of informal education might be more suitable for the mainstream students. The NGSS also defined as a core idea the use of matter and energy organisms need to live and grow <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(NGSS, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, learning about energy transformation in photosynthesis is key to understand why gaseous output such O 2 does not come from gaseous input such as CO 2 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), but comes from the photolysis of water (H 2 O) molecules. Seeing photosynthesis as a gas exchange process is a common misconception students hold <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Marmaroti &amp; Galanopoulou , 2006)</ref>. Understanding the energy transformation process in photosynthesis, known as the electron transport chain (ETC), would help learners to be aware of their own misconceptions and, by doing that, helped them toward reaching their own conceptual change needed for learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Galli, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>This study aimed to contribute to the research done about how to enhance students' learning of energy transformation in biological settings connected to the flow of electrons.

These learning outcomes were developed by the researcher based on common misconceptions students hold about photosynthesis described by previous researchers. The major findings of this research are summarized here and discussed in this chapter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning outcomes achievement and misconceptions. The ETC video and the</head><p>Electron Chute game are models of how the ETC process works. They were developed to support students' learning by teaching new vocabulary of ETC, engaging learners in peer discussion using a game format and addressing common misconceptions. Students could hold misconceptions about the energy transformation process in photosynthesis due to an incomplete model of ETC and insufficient knowledge of the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Deshmukh, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, 93% of participants have not studied ETC before the treatments. Therefore, those students' model of ETC was deficient. The low scores students received in the pretest could be related to their limited knowledge about photosynthesis and their limited knowledge of ETC. In the multiple-choice (Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>) and essay (Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref>) sections of the posttest, students enhanced their scores and more students reached higher scores. Half of the students who scored 0 points in the pretest scored 0 points in the posttest suggesting that after the treatments those students who left the essay blank in the pretest could explain some of the ideas related to ETC after the treatments. These results suggest that the learning experiences might have helped students to assimilate information for creating their own model <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kraidy, 2002)</ref>. recording did not show evident differences between both classes while they were playing the game (video+game treatment). This also suggested that the delayed time for viewing the video and playing the game might have reduced the learning potential of the challenge students who were part of the video only treatment. This situation could be associated to the characteristics of a challenge class or the rules of the game or both. An intent to improve the rules is in the appendix section (Appendix G).</p><p>Challenge students in the video only treatment could have experienced frustration <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Moon, 2009)</ref> because they were not comfortable to learn about the ETC process using an informal learning approach as it was playing the Electron Chute game. Regular students in both treatments appeared to like to game and to have more interest for learning through informal instruction such as playing a game, in comparison to the challenge students.</p><p>This could be related to (a) the level of pressure for success or the classroom environment stressors students encounter because of their comparable above average ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Moon, 2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref> fear to look incompetent in front of their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bonanno &amp; Kommers, 2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(c)</ref> frustration or low resilience when they face a more challenging activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Moon, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>All of these factors affect the emotional state of the player, which has an important impact on the player experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gilleade &amp; Dix, 2004)</ref>. These stress factors could have affected to the students who attended period 1 (challenge-video only) and that could explain on some level, that most of them reported to be lost while playing the game and few of them reported to be clear on the rules and how to play by the end of the game.</p><p>How learners learn to play a game must be clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Salen &amp; Zimmerman, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Students who were part of the video only treatment reported they were unclear about the Summary. The ETC video and the Electron Chute learning experiences had a positive impact on students' achievement of several learning outcomes. Playing Electron Chute one day after watching the ETC video affected the learning experience of challenge-video only group, who reported being lost unclear about the rules of the game.</p><p>Students' feedback could be used to make adjustment to the video's form and the game's form and play rules to provide a better learning experience.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1">Recommendations for Teachers</head><p>How to apply and assess the video and game experiences in the classroom.</p><p>The author has four recommendations for applying these learning experiences in the classroom: (1) Watch the ETC video and play the game on the same day; (2) Distribute 2-3 players per team to increase the chance of participation; (3) Read the rules aloud and discuss them with the class; (4) Play Electron Chute more than once (iteration). In regard to the assessment, teachers need to develop an effective test. In the case of test items, teachers need to exactly match the learning outcomes and the steps of the game with the content in the item. In the case of essays, teachers could ask students to draw and explain the steps of ETC representation. Teachers could decide to evaluate students with different strategies, but these need to be appropriately design to measure the learning outcomes of the game.</p></div>

This conversion process called photosynthesis uses light from the sun, water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air to produce carbohydrates inside it.</p><p>Inside the leaf of a plant, the cell chloroplasts capture sunlight energy and use water to activate what is called the electron transport chain. This process produces two metabolic molecules, ATP and NADPH, and also a byproduct, oxygen (O 2 ). Later, NADPH and ATP transform carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into carbohydrates.</p><p>Every leaf consists of many cells. Each one of the cells has tiny structures called chloroplasts. It is inside the chloroplasts where photosynthesis takes place. Inside each chloroplast, the sunlight energy is captured by structures called thylakoids which are surrounded by a liquid, the stroma. Each thylakoid has a membrane and a lumen. It is in the thylakoid membrane where the electron transport chain (ETC) process takes place. Let's take a look to a piece of thylakoid membrane. The thylakoid membrane has two protein complexes called Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII). Between PSI and PSII there are three molecules. Two of them are mobile molecules, which means they move through the membrane. The other molecule is a proton pump protein which moves protons (H+) from the stroma to the lumen. There are other three important proteins in the membrane. These are another mobile protein, a protein which is responsible for the synthesis of NADPH and an important protein which is responsible for the synthesis of ATP. Let's see how the electron transport chain works. Sunlight energy is captured by the chlorophyll molecules in PSI and PSII. After that, two electrons from PSII are transported to a mobile molecule. The mobile molecule transports those two electrons to the proton pump protein. This movement of electrons generate a proton (H+) movement from the stroma to the lumen. Once protons (H+) start accumulating in the lumen, they move back to the stroma through a protein called ATP synthase to produce ATP. In this way, sunlight energy is transformed into chemical energy.</p><p>The two electrons lost by PSII are replaced by two electrons coming from the split of water. In this process, oxygen (O 2 ) is produced and released to the air.</p><p>When sunlight energy is captured by the chlorophyll molecules in PSI, two electrons are transported from PSI to a mobile protein.</p><p>Then, the mobile protein transports those two electrons to the following protein in the membrane to produce NADPH.</p><p>Once NADPH and ATP are produced by the ETC process, they transform carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into carbohydrates. To sum up, during photosynthesis, the plant cell requires 12 molecules of NADPH + 18 molecules of ATP + 6 molecules of CO 2 to produce 1 molecule of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), a potential chemical energy for plant survival.</p></div>

From there ask them: What kind of food do cows eat? Most of them have seen cows eating grass. Then, ask them what grass is? Some of them are familiar with grass and can see grass as a plant.
