<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMN), the strongest form of multipartite nonlocality that describes fully collective nonlocal correlations among all experimental parties, can be observed when different distant parties each locally measure a particle from a shared entangled many-particle state. For the demonstration of GMN, the experimentally observed statistics are typically postselected: Events for which some parties do not detect a particle must be discarded. This coincidence postselection generally leads to the detection loophole that invalidates a proper nonlocality demonstration. In this work, we address how to close the detection loophole for a coincidence detection in demonstrations of nonlocality and GMN. We first show that if the number of detected particles is conserved, i.e., using ideal and noiseless experimental devices, one can employ causal diagrams and the nosignaling principle to prove that a coincidence postselection cannot create any detection loophole. Furthermore, for realistic experimental devices with finite detection efficiencies, we show how a general Bell inequality can be sharpened such that its new version is still valid after a postselection of the measurement data. In this case, there are threshold detection efficiencies that, if surpassed in the experiment, lead to the possibility of demonstrating nonlocality and GMN without opening the detection loophole. Our results imply that genuine N -partite nonlocality can be generated from N independent particle sources even when allowing for nonideal detectors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Bell nonlocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> is one of the most intriguing aspects of quantum systems and plays a central role in modern research of foundational physics and the development of quantum-enhanced technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, such as quantum key distribution and quantum random number generators. For a proper experimental demonstration of nonlocality, it is essential to exclude any local-realist explanation of the observed measurement results that appear to violate a Bell inequality, including any possible "loopholes" that the explanation could potentially utilize. Two main loopholes in Bell experiments are (i) the locality loophole, if the different parts of experimental configuration are not separated distantly enough to exploit the principles of special relativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and (ii) the detection loophole, if the measured statistics must be postselected due to a nonideal detection efficiency or particle losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, because of the possibility that the postselection generates fake nonlocal correlation via the selection bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>The most common way to address the detection loophole is to assume fair sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, i.e., to assume that the postselected statistics is a fair sample of the statistics that would have been observed using ideal experimental tools. However, the fair sampling assumption does not necessarily hold in real experiments: The detection loophole has been exploited to create false demonstrations of nonlocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, corrupting the security of quantum technological applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Therefore, for an unambiguous demonstration of nonlocality, the detection loophole has to be closed. To do so, one can include the nondetection events in the statistics, i.e., one does not discard any measurement data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, such that there is no effect due to postselection. The second approach is to postselect data but, at the same time, to sharpen the Bell inequality accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Both of these approaches yield a (minimal) threshold detection efficiency of the experimental apparatus that must be achieved, and, in this way, the detection loophole (and the locality loophole) was eventually closed in recent experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The precise values of the threshold efficiencies depends on the Bell inequality in question and has been subject to a long line of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. However, to our knowledge, there is no analysis of how to close the detection loophole in demonstrations of genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. GMN is the strongest form of multipartite nonlocality that requires that the correlations cannot be explained by nonlocal correlations shared only by some groups of the experimental parties, and constitutes the quantum resource for different quantum technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Furthermore, in most studies, threshold efficiencies were derived for setups where, in the ideal noiseless limit, each party receives a single particle. These results are not applicable to Bell scenarios in which the particles' destinations are prepared in a superposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, such as, the proposal by Yurke and Stoler (YS) to generate nonlocality from independent particle sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we consider a general N -partite Bell scenario with a coincidence postselection, i.e., a postselection of events for which each of the N parties detects a single particle. This postselection may be necessary due to nonideal detectors and particle losses, or a random distribution of particles among the parties, or both. We first examine an ideal experimental apparatus where the number of detected particles is conserved. In this case, we use causal diagrams and d-separation rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, together with the no-signaling principle, to show that a coincidence postselection is valid for demonstrations of GMN, extending the results of Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Second, we analyze general Bell inequalities (testing for nonlocality or GMN) if noisy experimental devices are employed, in which case causal diagrams cannot prove a valid postselection anymore. Instead, we derive sharpened Bell inequalities that must be used to close the detection loophole when postselecting the measurement results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The sharpened inequalities yield threshold detection efficiencies that, if surpassed in experiments, enable a demonstration of multipartite nonlocality or GMN. Our results can be used to demonstrate GMN also in setups where the particles are randomly distributed among the parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>, showing that one can create genuine N -partite nonlocality from N independent particle sources even for nonideal detectors.</p></div>

We will focus on the case that N T = N particles are distributed, and note that the analysis also holds for N T &gt; N if each party should receive a fixed number of particles.

We denote the detection of a single particle as D k = d k , while any other number of detected particles (e.g., D k = 0 and D k = 2) will be grouped to the outcome D k = dk . In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>   </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p |d 1 ,d 2 ,x 1 ,x 2 = p |d 1 ,d 2<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">p a 1 ,a 2 |d 1 ,d 2 ,x 1 ,x 2 , = p a 1 |d 1 ,d 2 ,x 1 , p a 2 |d 1 ,d 2 ,x 2 , ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">p a1,a2,d1,d2|x1,x2 = dλ p λ p a1,d1|x1,λ p a2,d2|x2,λ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Λ is a LHV and each probability p λ , p a1,d1|x1 , and p a2,d2|x2 sums to one. Note that we indicate the possible values of a random variable X as lower-case letters x and write p x for the probability P (X = x). The causal diagram of this LHV model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: The LHV Λ can influence all measurement outcomes, while the local setting X k (k = 1, 2) can only influence the outcomes A k and D k . Furthermore, we make no restriction on possible causal influences between A k and D k , which we indicate as a bidirected arrow with circular ends; this includes influences of the form A k → D k or D k → A k , and a hidden common cause between A k and D k (which can be included in Λ). Now consider a coincidence postselection of the statistics, i.e., a postselection of events where each party detects a single particle. We denote the detection of a single particle as D k = d k , while any other number of detected particles (e.g., D k = 0 and D k = 2) will be grouped to the outcome D k = dk . In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we indicate the coincidence postselection, i.e., the conditioning on D k = d k , as boxes around the variables D k . If the postselected statistics, p a1,a2|d1,d2,x1,x2 , can be written as a LHV model similarly to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>), they also fulfill the Bell inequality and, thus, the postselection does not open any detection or postselection loophole. Using p a1,a2|d1,d2,x1,x2 = dλ p λ|d1,d2,x1,x2 p a1,a2|d1,d2,x1,x2,λ , we see that p a1,a2|d1,d2,x1,x2 can be described as a LHV model if the conditions</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">p λ|d1,d2,x1,x2 = p λ|d1,d2<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">p a1,a2|d1,d2,x1,x2,λ = p a1|d1,d2,x1,λ p a2|d1,d2,x2,λ ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>are satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) can be inferred directly from Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> using the d-separation rules 1 : Any path that connects (A 1 , X 1 ) to (A 2 , X 2 ) passes through Λ and is blocked because Λ is a noncollider that is conditioned on. To show Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), we must use the fact that a constant number of particles is distributed among the parties and that we employ ideal noiseless (number-resolving) detectors. In this case, the value of D 1 can be inferred by the value of D 2 , and the other way around. Now, to show the independence of X 1 and Λ when conditioning on D 1 and D 2 , we must consider the two possible paths</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">X 1 → D 1 ← Λ and X 1 → A 1 → D 1 ← Λ that</formula><p>both appear open as D 1 is a collider that is conditioned on. However, if there was a nonvanishing influence from X 1 to D 1 (along any path), since D 2 is completely determined by D 1 , there would also be a nonvanishing influence from X 1 to D 2 , in conflict with the no-signaling principle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. (Genuine) multipartite nonlocality</head><p>To test for general nonlocality in the N -partite Bell scenario, one must extend Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>) to N parties. One again writes the correlations as p a,d|x = dλ p λ p a,d|x,λ with the factorization</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">p a,d|x,λ = N k=1 p a k ,d k |x k ,λ ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the kth party can choose the measurement setting x k and observes the outcomes a k and d k , and we have used the notation a = (a 1 , . . . , a N ) and similarly for d and x. However, for N &gt; 2, one can also test for a stronger form of nonlocality called genuine N -partite nonlocality. Here, one allows for nonlocal correlations shared among subgroups of the N parties. Thus, one only requires that p a,d|x,λ must factorize in at least two factors, yielding a hybrid local-nonlocal hidden variable (HLNHV) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. For instance, one possible factorization is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">p a,d|x,λ = p a k ,d k |x k ,λ p a\a k ,d\d k |x\x k ,λ<label>(5)</label></formula><p>for some 1 ≤ k ≤ N , where we introduced the notation a\a k = (a 1 , . . . , a k-1 , a k+1 , . . . , a N ) and similarly for d and x. In the HLNHV model, we furthermore assume that all nonlocal correlations fulfill the no-signaling conditions<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> [39, 51, 52], e.g.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">p a\a k ,d\d k |x,λ = p a\a k ,d\d k |x\x k ,λ ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>for any k. This ensures that the measurement setting X k of the kth party has no influence on the measurement outcomes of the other parties, even if conditioned on the hidden variable Λ.</p><p>We now focus on a coincidence postselection of a HLNHV model and note that the N -partite LHV model, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">4</ref>), can be discussed in completely analogy to Sec. II A. In the case of three parties, we sketch the causal diagram of the HLNHV model in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We indicate the nonlocal correlations that can be shared between any two of the three parties as light blue lines. These correlations are subject to the no-signaling conditions, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">6</ref>), representing fine-tuning conditions for the causal diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Furthermore, if we condition on a specific value λ, one of the three parties factorizes with the other two, see, e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref>. Again, the postselection of the events for which D k = d k is indicated as boxes around the variables D k . Similarly to the conditions Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref> for nonlocality in the bipartite case, there are conditions on the postselected statistics p a|d,x that, if fulfilled, validate the postselection for a GMN demonstration <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The first condition is that if p a,d|x,λ factorizes in a specific way for a given λ, e.g., into two groups of k and Nk parties as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">5</ref>) for k = 1, then the probabilities p a|d,x,λ must factorize in the same way. This can be shown directly with the d-separation rules: For instance, in the case of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b</ref>), every possible path that connects A 3 and X 3 to Alice's and Bob's settings and outcomes passes through Λ and is thus blocked because Λ is a noncollider that is conditioned on.</p><p>Second, we have to show the condition p λ|d,x = p λ|d , similarly to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>). Here, as in Sec. II A, we must use that a constant number of particles is distributed among the parties, and that we have ideal number-resolving detectors. Thus, the number of detected particles of the kth measurement station is determined by the number of detected particles at the other stations, i.e., it can be written as a function d k = f k (d\d k ). For instance, for three particles distributed among three parties, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">d 1 = 3 -d 2 -d 3 .</formula><p>To prove that, e.g., p λ|d,x = p λ|d,x\x1 , we first calculate that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p λ,d,x = p d1|d\d1,x,λ p d\d1|x,λ p x,λ<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">= δ d1,f1(d\d1) p d\d1|x\x1,λ p x,λ<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where we have used that d 1 = f 1 (d\d 1 ) and the nosignaling principle Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">6</ref>). Thus, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">p λ|d,x = p λ,d,x p d,x<label>(9)</label></formula><p>= δ d1,f1(d\d1) p d\d1|x\x1,λ p x,λ dλδ d1,f1(d\d1) p d\d1|x\x1,λ p x,λ</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">= p λ|d,x\x1 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where, in the last line, we have used the free-choice assumption p x,λ = p x p λ to see that the dependence on the setting x 1 cancels. Similarly, one can remove the influ- ence of any X k on ⇤ when conditioning on D = d and we obtain p |d,x = p |d . We note that p |d,x = p |d can also be shown using the d-separation rules, together with the no-signalling conditions and that the number of detected particles is conserved. However, these additional conditions on the causal diagram bring along that using the d-separation rules do not provide a faster way to demonstrate p |d,x = p |d than a direct application of the conditions.

Typically, even if we assume perfect detectors and no losses in the setup, undesired events occur with high probability. For instance, in the ideal threepartite YS setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, the desired events occur only with a probability of p = 1/4 and the remaining events show no multipartite correlations (because one of the parties receives no particle). Thus, when including all events, Bell inequalities that test for GMN are not violated, even in an ideal setup. We therefore take the second approach of sharpening the Bell inequality and postselecting the desired events.</p><p>A general Bell inequality in the N -partite scenario can be written as a,x c a,x p a|x ≤ I,</p><p>where c a,x , I ∈ R, and the kth party can choose from M k different measurement settings x k ∈ {1, . . . , M k } and observes the outcome a k from a finite set of possible outcomes. Note that this form includes Bell inequalities that, if violated, demonstrate multipartite nonlocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and GMN <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. As in Sec. II, we consider a coincidence postselection, i.e., the kth party additionally has the variable D k , the number of detected particles, where D k = d k denotes the detection of a single particle (or, more generally, the desired number of particles). We thus want to postselect the events for which D = d, so we are left with the probabilities p a|d,x . Since the probability of observing d may depend on the measurement settings x, the distribution of the LHV Λ of each summand of inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> generally depends on x as well. Thus, the Bell inequality is generally not valid for the postselected statistics p a|d,x without further assuming fair sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (see Appendix A for further details and explanations).</p><p>We now follow the approach by Larsson <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to sharpen the multipartite Bell inequalities using a measurable detection efficiency. In particular, for perfect detectors and no transmission losses, and if the number of distributed particles is constant, the sharpened Bell inequality should converge to the initial Bell inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. In this case, due to continuity, there is some threshold detection efficiency above which the sharpened Bell inequality can be violated by quantum mechanics (assuming there are quantum states that violate the initial Bell inequality). Similarly to Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we sharpen the Bell inequality using the minimal conditional detection efficiency</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">η c = min k,x p d k |d\d k ,x = min k,x p d|x p d\d k |x . (<label>14</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>The efficiency η c corresponds to the minimal probability of the detection of a single particle by the kth party, given that all other parties detect a single particle and given the measurement settings x, minimized over the party k and all possible settings x.</p><p>We emphasize why it is crucial to use the conditional detection efficiency η c to sharpen the Bell inequality if we want to obtain a useful result for setups with a random distribution of particles per party <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. This is because, in the limit of perfect detectors, we find that η c = 1, while a detection efficiency such as η coincidence = min x p d|x that in the standard scenario (one particle per party) yields η coincidence = 1, would have a lower value (e.g., η coincidence = 1/4 in the ideal YS scenario with N = 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>). Thus, even in the ideal YS setup, quantum mechanics could not violate the sharpened Bell inequality if the threshold efficiency η * coincidence is larger than 1/4. The threshold conditional efficiency η * c depends on the Bell inequality of interest, e.g., on the number of parties N and on the number of measurement settings M k . Furthermore, the method of how to sharpen the Bell inequality differs if one assumes an underlying LHV model (multipartite nonlocality) or an underlying HLNHV model (GMN). In the case of an underlying LHV model, one can directly generalize the proof of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and finds the sharpened Bell inequality a,x c a,x p a|d,x</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">≤ C + (I -C) 1 - 1 -η c η c k M k -N ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where we defined C = x max a |c a,x |. Inequality ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">15</ref>) is demonstrated in Appendix B and reduces to the results of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for the corresponding Bell inequalities. We note that, for η c =1, we recover the original Bell inequality ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">13</ref>).</p><p>In the case of an underlying HLNHV model, the technique of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> cannot be applied, but one can still demonstrate the sharpened Bell inequality (see Appendix C for a detailed derivation) a,x c a,x p a|d,x ≤ I + 4CN</p><p>(1</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">-η c ) η c ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>which, again, for η c =1, reduces to the original Bell inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. We note that, in inequality ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">16</ref>), one can slightly optimize the sharpened Bell inequality by using a optimized C opt instead of C 4 , see Appendix C. Using the maximal value I Q predicted by quantum mechanics that can be reached for the left hand sides of inequalities ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">16</ref>), one obtains a threshold conditional efficiency η * c . For experiments with η c &gt; η * c , one can thus potentially demonstrate (genuine) multipartite nonlocality while closing the detection loophole. We emphasize that our results are derived in a general setting. For specific Bell inequalities, there may be more specialized approaches that yield smaller η * c , see, e.g., Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> for the Mermin inequality that we discuss below. In this context, we note that the main objective of this work is to find some threshold conditional efficiency η * c &lt; 1 for Bell inequalities that certify GMN, such that the results can be applied to setups with a random distribution of particles among the parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>We finally note that one often has an inequality of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">x cx N k=1 A k x ≤ I,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">N k=1 A k x = a a 1 a 2 • • • a N p a|x , for instance,</formula><p>the CHSH inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for N = 2, and the Mermin inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and Svetlichny inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> for N = 3.</p><p>In this case, one has c a,x = a 1 a 2 • • • a N cx .

For the Mermin inequality, we have C = 4, I = 2, and I Q = 4, such that we find η * c = 3/4, similarly to Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Application to the Yurke-Stoler scenario</head><p>Finally, we consider the N -partite YS setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> that distributes N independent particles among the N parties. The parties are arranged in a circular configuration, where each two neighbouring parties share a singleparticle source in-between them. In the ideal noiseless case, each particle ends up at either of the parties with a probability p = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of each party detecting a single particle is p = 2/2 N , and the quantum state corresponding to these events is a Npartite GHZ state that displays genuine N -partite nonlocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. However, for the remaining events that occur with a probability of p = 1 -2/2 N , at least one party does not receive a particle, such that these events show no GMN, and we must employ a coincidence postselection to violate the Bell inequalities.</p><p>Since N particles are shared among the N parties, if one party detects two particles, a second party does not receive a particle.

This recovers the results of Sec. II.

For an experiment that only employs on-off detectors, i.e., detectors that cannot differentiate between one and two particles, then even in the noiseless case (η det = η tra = η 1|2 = 1), we obtain η c = 2/3 &lt; η * c . We thus find that if no number-resolving detectors are available, the detection loophole cannot be closed even in the noiseless bipartite scenario, and fair sampling must be assumed to demonstrate nonlocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, for the three-partite case with η tra = 1 and η 1|2 = 2η det (1η det ), we obtain η c = η det /(3 -2η det ). Thus, for the demonstration of three-partite nonlocality (η * c = 3/4), we find η * det = 9/10. For the demonstration of genuine three-partite nonlocality (η * c = 12/(11 + √ 2)), we find η * det = 36/(35 + √ 2) ≈ 0.989. We note that using GMN Bell inequalities for N &gt; 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, one obtains η * det &lt; 1 for any N &gt; 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have considered a coincidence postselection in Bell experiments, i.e., a postselection of measurement results for which each measurement party detects a single particle. For this postselection, we have shown how to close the detection loophole that is created due to the selection bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. If the number of detected particles is constant (requiring an ideal noiseless experimental apparatus), we have shown how to use causal diagrams and d-separation rules, together with the no-signaling principle, validate a coincidence postselection for the demonstration of nonlocality and genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMN). In a realistic experiment with nonideal detection efficiencies, we have shown how to sharpen the Bell inequalities for both nonlocality and GMN such that they are still valid for the postselected statistics. This results in threshold detection efficiencies that, if reached in experiments, enable a demonstration of nonlocality and GMN while closing the detection loophole. Finally, we have applied our results to the N -partite Yurke-Stoler (YS) setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> to demonstrate that genuine N -partite nonlocality can be created from N independent particle sources, even if nonideal detectors are employed.</p><p>Appendix B: Sharpened Bell inequalities for multipartite nonlocality</p><p>In this section, we derive the sharpened Bell inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> that can be used to demonstrate multipartite nonlocality.

The possible configurations that can contribute to this event are a configuration where all parties receive a particle and a configuration where the kth party receives no particle and one of the other (k -1) parties receives two (but only detects one). Therefore, we must calculate the probability p m 2 , k that the mth party receives two particles and the kth party receives none, while the remaining parties each receive one particle. If, e.g., the first party receives two particles, m = 1, we must have had a configuration with S 1 = r and S 2 = l, see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. For the kth party receiving no photon, we must have S k = l and S k+1 = r. Finally, for the remaining parties to detect a single photon, we must have that S n = l for n = 3, . . . , k -1, and S n = r for n = k + 2, . . . , N . A similar reasoning holds also for m = 1.

Second, one could have that the kth party receives no particle and the mth (m = k) party receives two while the remaining parties receive and detect a single particle (p = p m 2 , kη N -2 det η N -2 tra ). Furthermore, the mth party must only detect a single particle, which may happen because one particle is lost in transmission and the other one is detected [p = 2η det η tra (1η tra )], or both particles are received but only one is detected (p = η 2 tra η 1|2 ).

The Bell inequality a,x c a,x p a|x ≤ I is proven by assuming that the probabilities p a|x can be written as a hidden variable model p a|x = dλ p λ p a|x,λ , where p a|x,λ must factorize as Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) for a LHV model or as Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) for a HLNHV model. We can always write p a|d,x = dλ p λ|d,x p a|d,x,λ .</p><p>(A1)</p><p>The probabilities p a|d,x,λ again factorize in the desired way: For instance, if in the HLNHV model for a specific value λ, we have that p a,d|x,λ = p a k ,d k |x k ,λ p a\a k ,d\d k |x\x k ,λ , Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), one shows that</p><p>However, the distribution p λ|d,x of the hidden variable Λ generally depends on the setting x, such that we cannot write p a|d,x = dλ q λ p a|d,x,λ for some distribution q λ and, thus, we cannot prove the Bell inequality.</p><p>In the following sections, we will define a fixed distribution q λ (the distribution q (MN) λ for LHV models and the distribution q (GMN) λ for HLNHV models) such that we can bound the difference between p a|d,x and p a|d,x,q = dλ q λ p a|d,x,λ , (A5)</p><p>for any measurement setting x, using the experimentally measurable η c , Eq.

We then find new Bell inequalities for the postselected statistics p a|d,x by using the fact that the probabilities p a|d,x,q , being written in a settingindependent distribution q λ , fulfill the original Bell inequality, a,x c a,x p a|d,x,q ≤ I.</p></div>

First note that the fair sampling assumption also implies that p d|x = dλ p λ|x p d|x,λ = p d , where we have used the free will assumption p x,λ = p x p λ .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C: Sharpened Bell inequalities for genuine multipartite nonlocality</head><p>Here, we derive the sharpened Bell inequality ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) that can be used for demonstrations of GMN. We thus consider an underlying HLNHV model, Eq.

Therefore, we cannot use the previously defined HV distribution q (MN) λ to approximate the p a|d,x with p a|d,x,q (MN) using the conditional detection efficiency η c . In particular, the derivation of Appendix B breaks down at Eqs. (B9) and (B11-B15). Instead, here we use the hidden variable distribution defined as</p><p>where y is an arbitrary fixed measurement setting. Since q (GMN) λ is independent on the measurement settings, the Bell inequality a,x c a,x p a|d,x,q (GMN) ≤ I holds, see Eq. (A6).
