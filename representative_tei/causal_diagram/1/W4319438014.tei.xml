<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAG) are known to constitute a useful tool to improve the methodological and reporting quality of observational studies. At the same time, there are concerns that their (mis)use may lead to overconfident inferences. In this study, we investigate the reporting of study bias and limitations, and the use of hedging in articles with and without causal DAG. We performed a keyword search in two electronic databases (Medline and Web of Science) and one full-text repository (PubMed Central). The search strategy aimed to identify biomedical studies with an analytical observational design, that reported use of causal DAG. We selected a random sample of the articles that presented a graphic structure. We pair-matched individually 130 DAG with 130-Non-DAG papers on journal and issue. The number of research limitations acknowledged by the authors and of hedging terms per 100 words were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. From 2000 to 2020, we identified 2256 publications reporting the use of causal DAG, of which 1131 (50%) contained the actual graph structure. The number of study limitations acknowledged by the authors and the frequency of hedging were found to be similar in both samples. However, quantitative evaluations of study limitations were more frequently reported in studies with DAG (51 % vs. 25 %), while bias modeling techniques were uncommon in both groups (18% in DAG and 6% in non-DAG). In order to contextualize our findings, we used causal diagrams to discuss potential mechanisms for the communication of causal assumptions and related uncertainties in observational studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Studies have identified several issues related to the reporting of medical and epidemiological research, such as the omission of crucial information in the method descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jin et al., 2018)</ref> and the failure to acknowledge study limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(ter Riet et al., 2013)</ref>. The transparent communication of study bias and limitations in the academic literature is important for the assessment of research validity and reliability. Ideally, authors would describe their studies in order to facilitate this kind of evaluation by academics and other stakeholders. By omitting study biases and limitations, researchers forfeit the opportunity to have their findings properly scrutinized, thereby increasing the likelihood of misinterpretation.</p><p>Several suggestions have been made to enhance the reproducibility and transparency of biomedical research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blanco et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moher &amp; Altman, 2015)</ref>. In epidemiology, causal diagrams, also known as causal directed acyclic graphs or DAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pearl, 2000)</ref>, have been recognized as an important tool for improving both methodological and reporting quality in observational studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Greenland et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Porta et al., 2015)</ref>. Causal DAG offer a formal approach for communicating knowledge (and its limitations) about the data-generation process, and for evaluating any conclusions that can be drawn from the causal model (Petersen &amp; van der Laan, 2014). By offering a common language for addressing different sources of bias, these tools can support more accurate evaluation and communication of study biases and limitations. However, there are also concerns that DAG and other causal inference methods may lead to overconfident conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Greenland, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Dawid, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aalen et al., 2016)</ref>. Many of these concerns refer to the potential misuse of formal methods, as well as the challenges of justifying causal inferences in the complex settings often encountered in epidemiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Greenland, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Greenland, , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Dawid, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Recommendations for the construction and use of causal DAG can be found in the literature <ref type="bibr">(Haber et</ref>  In this study, we compare the reporting of bias and study limitations between articles with and without causal DAG. Specifically, we assess the number of study limitations and biases acknowledged by the authors, as well as their evaluation of these limitations. In addition, since authors can also communicate their uncertainty through linguistic cues, we compare the frequency of hedging between articles with and without causal DAG. Finally, we use causal diagrams to discuss potential mechanisms for the communication of bias and uncertainties in observational studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Selection</head><p>The search strategy aimed to identify biomedical studies which had an analytical observational design and reported it using causal DAG. Searches were undertaken in two electronic databases (Medline and Web of Science) and one full-text repository (PubMed Central) using various terms associated with causal DAG, including Directed Acyclic Graph, Causal Diagram, Causal Graph, Causal Bayesian Network and Structural Causal Model. Moreover, we searched the Web of Science for papers citing at least one of the two specific methodological publications identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Textor et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Shrier &amp; Platt, 2008)</ref>. Details of the search strategies are presented in the supplementary material (File S1).</p><p>We only included English-language, analytical observational studies published between 2000 and 2020.</p><p>Analytical (causal) studies were those that reported causal parameters (total effect, direct effect, etc.) or aimed to estimate the association between exposure(s) and outcome(s) or to identify risk factors. The few ambiguous cases were clarified by determining whether the study's main analysis was adjusted for confounders.</p><p>We excluded methodological articles (e.g., articles that describe or analyze methods), and studies using parametric graphical models (e.g., structural equations models) or other types of graphical models (e.g., non-causal Bayesian networks and causal loop diagrams). We also excluded COVID-19 articles, given that initial COVID-19 publications were under a faster peer review and publication process, which may have led to lower completeness of reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jung et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>One reviewer (TRC) evaluated the eligibility of all the selected studies, based on the title and abstract, and performed a full text assessment. We selected a random sample of approximately 10% of the eligible articles that presented a graphic structure (n =1,131). For each sampled article containing a DAG, we selected a comparator (an article describing an analytical observational study without a causal DAG) from the same journal and issue. The search for non-DAG articles was undertaken in Medline using the journal title, year, and issue as search parameters. Similar exclusion criteria were applied (i.e., exclusion of non-observational or non-analytical studies, COVID-19 articles, and studies using DAG or other types of graphical models). We selected the first eligible comparator article from the same issue. In cases where we could not find an exact matched, we searched the journal's website for publications in previous or subsequent issues, selecting the earliest one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The reporting of study limitations</head><p>The reporting of study limitations was assessed by the first author using a data extraction questionnaire based on the STROBE statement <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(von Elm et al., 2007)</ref> and a previous study (ter <ref type="bibr">Rie et al., 2013)</ref>. STROBE item 19 th suggests that researchers should discuss study limitations, taking account of potential sources of bias and imprecision, and the direction and magnitude of any potential bias. Therefore, we assessed the number and nature of study limitations and potential biases as described by the authors. In addition, we collected data about the evaluation of each study limitation or potential bias: whether the authors qualitatively addressed the magnitude and direction of bias or reported any sensitivity analysis to assess its potential impact.</p><p>The discussion of study limitations was classified as: a) acknowledgement: when the authors merely recognized limitations; b) qualitative assessment: when the authors qualitatively discussed at least one study limitation; c) quantitative assessment: when the authors reported at least one sensitivity analysis. Quantitative assessments of study limitations included the use of bias formulas (with algebraic calculations of the magnitude of the bias required to explain the observed association), bias modeling (e.g., techniques that use a distribution of bias parameters to readjust the effect and precision measures), and other types of sensitivity analysis (e.g., analysis including modifications to the final model, sampling restrictions, and/or redefining the variables, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lash et al, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hedging</head><p>Hedges are typically defined as words (or expressions) whose function is to "make things fuzzier or less fuzzy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lakoff, 1973)</ref>. In academic articles, they are generally used to mitigate the author's commitment to a statement or to communicate the degree of uncertainty or vagueness of a proposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hyland, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>To compare the use of hedging in the discussion sections of the DAG and non-DAG articles, we created an initial list of hedge cues (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>) based on previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Varttala, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Atanassova et al 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hyland, 1996)</ref>. First, PDF files were converted to text format to extract the discussion section. After processing the corpus, each hedge cue was evaluated for frequency, function, and context using AntCont <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anthony, 2005)</ref>, a freeware corpus analysis toolkit for concordance and text analysis. Items that frequently did not function as hedges were removed from the original list. The final list was composed of expressions, bigrams, and unique terms. The frequency of hedge terms was calculated using simple context rules (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>) that match regular expressions indicative of hedges or that excluded instances of non-hedging. Given that discussion sections may vary in length, we calculated the mean frequency of hedging terms per 100 words (tokens).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study and authors characteristics</head><p>We collected information on study design, objectives, location, sample size, and author names. The general characteristics of the studies were automatically extracted from the text and then manually categorized. Since the estimation of different causal parameters usually requires different causal assumptions, we classified the study objectives into groups with a similar range of potential biases: total effect or effect measure modification analysis; interaction or cumulative effects analysis; mediation analysis; and other types of analysis. The latter category comprised studies with ambiguous causal parameters, such as those that aimed at identifying multiple risk factors or independent outcome predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Westreich &amp; Greenland, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>We also collected data on journal impact factor (2019-2020) and research category (e.g., Public, Environmental &amp; Occupational Health; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Medicine; Dentistry, Pharmacology and Dietetics).</p><p>The native language of the first author was inferred from their names using Ethnea <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Torvik &amp; Agarwal, 2016)</ref> and categorized as English-speaking or non-English-speaking. Ethnea predicts a name's ethnicity based on the distribution of author's names and affiliations in multiple bibliographic databases. Ethnea includes twenty-six ethnic classes and has demonstrated good performance in ethnicity classification compared to other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Torvik &amp; Agarwal, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>The number of study limitations reported by the authors and the frequency of hedge terms per 100 words were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. Our analyses were guided by the DAG in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. To build the causal model, we followed the procedures proposed by Ferguson et al., (2020), Petersen &amp; van der Laan, (2014) and Tennant et al., (2021), as described in File S2. Briefly, we first constructed a highly connected DAG based on a review of the literature on factors associated with the reporting of causal assumptions, study limitations, and hedging. After mapping the main potential causes of exposure and outcomes, we assessed the plausibility of each directed relationship in the saturated DAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferguson et al., 2020)</ref>. At this stage, we also assessed the evidence (of a null effect) for excluding arrows and the potential for node recombination to reduce model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferguson et al., 2020)</ref>. Finally, the causal structure was revised to establish its connection with the observed data (i.e., identifying unmeasured variables, proxies and study selection mechanisms) (Petersen &amp; van der Laan, 2014). At this stage, the consistency between the DAG and the study data was evaluated using conditional independence tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Textor et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our final DAG (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) implies that the causal effect of DAG use on the outcomes is non-identifiable, due to backdoor paths that include only unobserved variables. Therefore, we considered a subset of variables for partial confounding adjustment. Although controlling for the matching variables is required in our analysis due to the presence of other confounding factors (e.g, native laguage of the first author) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sjölander &amp; Greenland, 2013)</ref>, including all these variables in the model, especially the journal of publication, would potentially result in sparse data bias. Therefore, we adjust our models by journal impact factor, research area, publication year, number of co-authors and native language of the first author. In addition, we carried out a sensitivity analysis using conditional logistic regression models as an alternative for dealing with sparse data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Greenland, 2021)</ref>. In the matched analysis, the models were adjusted for journal and issue (as a strata), number of co-authors and the native language of the first author. We also performed sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of our results for different operationalizations of the outcome variables. First, to minimize subjectivity when classifying study limitations, we performed an automatic search for terms related to limitations and biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ioannidis, 2007)</ref>. We also evaluated hedge frequency at sentence level, as opposed to full-text matching. Finally, we only calculated the hedging frequency for terms and expressions normally associated with a relatively high degree of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atanassova et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Statistical and text analyses were performed using the R program (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).</p><p>The dataset and R code will be available at <ref type="url" target="http://github.com/reprotc/limitations">http://github.com/reprotc/limitations</ref> (after publication).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Our search produced 13,103 records; after reference de-duplication and the initial screening (title and abstract), 3,306 publications remained eligible for full-text review (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We found 2,256 analytical observational studies that reported the use of causal DAG. Among these, only 1,131 (50%) contained the actual graphic structure. The first retrieved article was published in 2002, with publication peaks in 2016 (n = 222) and 2020 (n=332).</p><p>The characteristics of the sampled articles are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Most studies were longitudinal and assessed total effects and/or effect measure modification (65% in DAG articles and 77% in non-DAG articles, respectively). Identification of multiple risk factors was a more frequent study objective in the non-DAG articles (17% vs. 9% in the DAG-articles), while mediation analyses were more prevalent in articles using DAG (18% vs. 2% in the non-DAG). The distribution of study locations was similar in the two samples, with the majority conducted in the United States and Europe, and slightly more located in Asian countries among the non-DAG articles. Most studies had more than 5 authors, with a higher frequency of first authors from non-English speaking countries in the non-DAG sample (as predicted by author name). The majority of studies had sample sizes of at least 1000 subjects, with a median of 3,056 (interquartile range, IQR: 1,108 -15,173) for DAG-articles and 3,112 (IQR: 628 -15,022) for articles without DAG. The frequency of hedging per 100 words was similar in both corpora (4.0 in DAG and 3.8 in the non-DAG sample), with a mean difference of 0.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.02, 0.48) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The average number of limitations recognized by the authors of the DAG articles was 4.3, compared to 4.0 in the non-DAG ones. The difference in mean reported limitations associated with DAG use was 0.33 (95% CI: -0.05 to 0.72). More than half of the non-DAG articles merely acknowledged study limitations (53% vs. 33% in DAG articles) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Quantitative assessments of study limitations were more prevalent in the DAG sample (51% vs. 25% in the non-DAG). Nevertheless, bias modeling techniques were uncommon in both groups (DAG: 18% and non-DAG: 6%). The majority of the studies reported study limitations related to measurement errors (82% in DAG articles and 70% in non-DAG articles) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>). In addition, 56% of articles using DAG acknowledged the potential for unobserved or residual confounding, compared to 41% of articles without DAG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 2 Flowchart for the selection of studies</head><p>The results of the sensitivity analyses are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>. We found similar results when analyzing the frequency of hedged sentences and when using hedge terms associated with greater uncertainty. However, the results suggest a difference in the reporting of study limitations when measured by the frequency of terms related to bias (such as recall bias, information bias, confounding, etc.). Similarly, in the matched analysis, the use of DAG was associated with higher reporting of quantitative assessments of bias, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 4.08 (95% CI: 1.97-8.48).</p><p>While the adjusted odds ratio for reporting at least four study limitations was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04 -3.01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we compared the reporting of research limitations, bias and hedging in articles with and without causal DAG. The frequency of hedging terms and the number of study limitations acknowledged by the authors were similar in both groups. However, DAG articles were more likely to report quantitative assessments of biases and study limitations than non-DAG articles. Traditional sensitivity analyses were used in the majority of the quantitative evaluations of bias, whereas the use of bias formulas was only reported in 4 studies, and bias modeling techniques represented only 9% of the total evaluations (18 DAG-and 6 non-DAG articles).</p><p>Overall In this study, we found no evidence of a difference in language attenuation between articles with or without diagrams. However, the use of a relatively short list of cues to assess hedging was a significant limitation of our study. It is known that different types of language resources play a role in hedging. In addition, studies also suggest that individual differences in the use of hedging are a matter not so much of quantity as of the way hedges are used and the variability of resources applied (Kourilova-Urbanczik, 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Varttala, 2001)</ref>. Therefore, it is likely that our list of hedging cues may not have captured more nuanced hedging usage (e.g., conditional sentences), particularly among native English speakers, which could lead to differential measurement errors. Future evaluations should examine a broader range of terms by combining automatic methods with an annotated corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kilicoglu &amp; Bergler, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Another limitation of our work concerns the extraction of data from articles by a single reviewer and the lack of assessment of the reliability of the information collected. Given that authors sometimes do not report limitations clearly, classifications of study limitations are primarily based on subjective assessments. To minimize potential biases in this categorization and to establish common criteria for assigning each limitation to its category, we held multiple meetings throughout the process. Two members of the research team established examples of reporting limitations within each bias category (TRC and CJS) (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>), while other team members conducted a pilot survey to test and refine the questionnaire. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis assessing study limitations through an automatic keyword search, and found that DAG articles presented a greater frequency of bias-related terms than non-DAG ones. However, this difference is more likely to be related to the use of more explicit language to describe a study's limitations, rather than to a greater number of acknowledged biases. Consequently, potential bias may persist.</p><p>In addition, our reduced sample size might have led to low statistical power, which impose limitations on the interpretation of null findings and observed differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014)</ref>. While it is possible that the quality of reporting in health studies, as well as the use of DAG, has improved in recent studies, particularly after the publications on the reporting and construction of DAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ferguson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tennant et al., 2021)</ref>, our sample size does not allow an investigation on the effect measure modification by publication year and research area.</p><p>Although we found that the use of quantitative methods for bias assessment was more prevalent in DAG articles, this does not necessarily imply that these studies had greater methodological quality, as we did not evaluate the appropriateness of the study's methodology. Quantitative methods are often recommended to reduce errors in the assessment of bias caused by the use of heuristics (for instance, the frequent assertion that all non-differential and independent errors bias the estimates towards the null value) (Van Smeden et al., 2020; <ref type="bibr">Lash et al., 2011)</ref>. Nevertheless, the initial step in any qualitative or quantitative evaluation of bias, is to recognize the possibility that bias may exist.</p><p>While it is generally accepted that our minds are susceptible to systematic errors, the literature also suggests that recognizing our own limitations can be a difficult task. Previous research also indicates asymmetry in bias susceptibility, also referred to as a "bias blind spot," which reflects the fact that knowledge and awareness of errors and biases in human judgment, as well as the ability to recognize how these influence others, do not prevent one from expressing these biases, neither do they make one aware of doing so <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pronin et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Scopelliti et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we found no evidence of a differential use of hedging or the number of limitations acknowledged by these authors. However, DAG articles were more likely to report quantitative assessments of biases and study limitations, and to use clearer language to describe biases than non-DAG ones. Further empirical evidence on how causal inference tools are used in epidemiology and the factors associated with best practice is essential for identifying potential areas for improvement and intervention strategies. Future studies would benefit from more advanced methods of data collection and assessment, as well as a broader theoretical foundation, which includes evidence from psychology, linguistics, the sociology of science, and meta-research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>al., 2022; Tennant et al., 2021; Ferguson et al., 2020; Suzuki et al., 2020, among others).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, our findings are consistent with earlier research regarding the reporting of biases and limitations in biomedical studies. In a review of 300 biomedical studies, ter Riet et al. (2013) found that 27% of articles did not acknowledge any study limitations, while 73% acknowledged a median of three limitations. Similar to our study, measurement errors and confounding were the most frequently reported sources of bias (ter Rie et al., 2013). Previous research has also indicated that sensitivity analysis was rarely used to assess the potential impact of residual confounding (Pouwels et al., 2016), measurement errors (Ranker et al., 2019; Brakenhoff et al., 2018; Jurek et al., 2007), or missing data (Karahalios et al., 2012). Bastuji-Garin et al. (2013) found that the completeness of reporting in top-ranked dermatological journals remained suboptimal even in the post-STROBE period, and one of the lowest rates of adequate reporting was found in relation to the acknowledgment of study limitations and the description of efforts used to deal with bias.Compared to the quantitative assessment of bias, the communication of uncertainty through hedging is more easily identifiable by non-experts since it does not necessarily require knowledge of a specific scientific topic or method of analysis. Previous research indicates that hedging strategies may vary based on research area, author country, and writing proficiency<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Varttala, 2001</ref>; Kourilova-Urbanczik, 2012), as well as potential conflicts of interest (ter Riet et al., 2013). For instance, ter Riet et al. (2013) found that industry-supported publications acknowledged fewer limitations and employed significantly fewer hedging terms than publications not supported by industry.</figDesc><table /></figure>
