<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Escalation of commitment, the tendency of decision makers to keep on investing in losing courses of action, has been shown to be a costly decision bias that affects many areas of decision making. Even though escalation is a widely studied phenomenon, there has been comparatively little research on how to avoid this bias. The present study focuses on de-escalation of commitment and proposes that causal loop diagrams (CLDs) can help to decrease escalating commitment to a failing course of action.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the last decades, an extensive body of research has shown that decision makers have a tendency to keep on investing in failing courses of action. This phenomenon, studied under different headings such as escalation of commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Staw, 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Staw, , 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Staw, , 1997))</ref>, the sunk cost effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Tegar, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arkes and Blumer, 1985)</ref>, and entrapment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brockner and Rubin, 1985)</ref>, has been shown to affect decision making in many areas such as marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Biyalogorsky et al, 2006)</ref>, developing information systems projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pan et al, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pan et al, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tiwana et al, 2006)</ref>, business ethics <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Street and Street, 2006)</ref>, and accounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cheng et al, 2003)</ref>. Existing case evidence also highlights the costliness of escalation situations for business (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ross and Staw, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ross and Staw, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Drummond, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Keil and Mann, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pan et al, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical research investigating escalation of commitment has mainly focused on the determinants of escalation of commitment, leading to a variety of economic, psychological, social, and organizational explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Staw and Ross, 1987)</ref>. Research on how people can avoid or reduce commitment to failing courses of action has been comparatively less but has been growing in the last decade. Research on how de-escalation can be achieved is very important since it can lead to policy recommendations on how to avoid this very costly decision bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Simonson and Staw, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are proposed as a decision support tool to stimulate de-escalation. CLDs are qualitative system dynamics models consisting of variables, arrows denoting the causal relations between the variables, and feedback loops. They are very effective tools for representing the feedback structure of systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sterman, 2000)</ref>. The use of CLDs for problem structuring and solving has been common in operations research and management (cf <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sterman, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Perlow et al, 2002)</ref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of CLDs (or other OR tools) with the explicit purpose of decreasing the undesired effects of various decision biases has not been studied before. We propose that CLDs could be of help in coping with escalation of commitment through helping the decision makers to (1) better understand the decision situation, (2) generate explanations for the failure, and (3) identify alternatives that might also be considered.</p><p>In what follows, first, escalation and de-escalation of commitment are explained. Next, the potential role of CLDs in inducing de-escalation is discussed. Then, we describe an experiment, conducted to show that CLDs stimulate de-escalation and present the results. Finally, in the discussion, the implications of the results are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Escalation of commitment and past research on de-escalation of commitment</head><p>Escalation of commitment is defined as the tendency to keep on investing in a failing course of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Staw, 1976)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Brockner (1992, p 39)</ref> defines escalation situations as those that 'include repeated (rather than one-shot) decision making in the face of negative feedback about prior research allocations, uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of goal attainment, and choice about whether to continue'.</p><p>In a classic 'escalation of commitment' decision-making experiment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Staw (1976)</ref> showed that people who choose for a subsequently failing action invested more than those who did not make the initial choice. He proposed that people keep on investing in the same alternative because of the need to justify their previous choice. Even though the self-justification explanation received extensive support, over the years, it became clear that escalation is a multi-determinant phenomenon. Many factors, such as face saving and external justification needs, the sunk cost effect, biased information processing, institutional inertia, classified into four main categories (economic, psychological, social, and organizational factors), have been shown to cause escalation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Staw and Ross, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>De-escalation of commitment, on the other hand, occurs when there is 'reduced commitment to a failing course of action' <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Montealegre and Keil, 2000)</ref>. Previous research on de-escalation has focused on factors and/or processes that can stimulate de-escalation (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Simonson and Staw, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Keil and Robey, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boulding et al, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Montealegre and Keil, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pan and Pan, 2011)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents an extended list of factors and processes as found in literature grouped in three categories: (1) situational factors and processes, (2) factors and processes with respect to objective information on the project and its progress, and (3) specific de-escalation techniques.</p><p>Situational factors and processes are related to the organizational conditions under which de-escalation can occur. Examples are: change in top management support or project leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ross and Staw, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Keil, 1995b)</ref>, external pressures on the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ross and Staw, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Keil, 1995b)</ref>, stakeholder interest, and increased organizational tolerance for failure lead to de-escalation.</p><p>The second category refers to information on the project and its progress. Research showed that highlighting certain information leads to de-escalation. Some examples are highlighting endogenous causes of failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Staw and Ross, 1978)</ref>, and providing unambiguous negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Garland et al, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>The third category includes techniques or conditions devised or created with the intention of countering the main causes of escalation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Simonson and Staw (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boulding et al (1997)</ref> identified techniques against two main causes: justification motives (both internal and external) and inaccurate decision making. Techniques geared at decreasing the need for self-or external justification needs were 'threat reduction', 'focus on accountability for decision process', and 'sequential decision decoupling' (see also Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and techniques that intended to stimulate more accurate decision making were 'minimum goal setting' and 'commitment to a pre-determined stopping rule'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Keil and Robey's (1999)</ref> field survey of information systems auditors also supported the claims that pre-set limits and de-coupling responsibility for initiating and evaluating projects are associated with de-escalation. A related line of research focused on decision maker characteristics to devise de-escalation techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sivanathan et al (2008)</ref> showed that after negative feedback, affirmation of one's personally important qualities and abilities not related to the task-at-hand decreased commitment whereas highlighting the qualities and abilities directly related to the task increased escalation by triggering self-threat and self-justification needs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ku (2008)</ref>, on the other hand, showed that regret after escalation decreased the likelihood of subsequent escalation. Since even imagining escalation-related regret had the same effect he proposed that engaging decision makers in thought experiments where they imagine regret could decrease chances of escalation.</p><p>Although the literature discusses conditions and processes that stimulate de-escalation, one should be careful in interpreting these effects. For instance, the effect of presenting 'objective information items' on de-escalation is not always straightforward. In some cases, the de-escalation effects found might be attributed to the experimental designs employed. In some studies, a single 'objective' information item was presented to the subjects rather than exposing subjects to the full range of relevant information items. For example, in an experiment on internal versus external causes of failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Staw and Ross, 1978)</ref>, the subjects were presented with either internal causes or external causes, but not both at the same time. In reality, however, decision makers can be confronted with both types of information simultaneously and would have to make a decision against the background of both types. Moreover, extensive evidence indicates that decision makers have the tendency to disregard disconfirming information (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lord et al, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Frey, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kunda, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jonas et al, 2001)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr">Boulding et al (1997, p 166</ref>) stated 'unfortunately, simply providing information may not be sufficient to overcome forces that bias managers in favor of a losing course of action. Instead, like other people, managers may ignore or distort this information'.</p><p>Another caveat relates to procedures such as using pre-set limits and changing the evaluation mechanisms in organizations. They may, though shown to be effective, have some drawbacks. Setting pre-set limits may be dangerous because it may hinder any diagnostic approach that the decision maker can take during the process. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Molden and Hui (2011)</ref> pointed out, such strategies have the adverse effect of causing reduced information processing. Changing evaluation mechanisms might necessitate difficult-to-implement drastic changes in the way the organization operates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLD as a de-escalation tool</head><p>In this study, we set out to show that CLDs-as specific instances of decision support tools-may stimulate de-escalation. To understand CLDs' potential for de-escalation, we will first discuss what kind of features decision support tools should have so as to stimulate de-escalation. Next, we will briefly discuss the specifics of CLDs and argue that they meet the requirements set for de-escalation tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision support tools stimulating de-escalation</head><p>Which characteristics should a decision support tool have in order to be qualified as a tool stimulating de-escalation? To identify these characteristics, we propose to follow Montealgre and <ref type="bibr">Keil (2000)</ref>, who developed a process model of de-escalation, which includes the following phases of problem analysis: (i) problem recognition; (ii) re-examination of the prior course of action; (iii) search for alternative courses of action. (Their model includes a fourth phase, namely implementation of an exit strategy, which is beyond the scope of this paper.) A general requirement for a decision support tool to stimulate de-escalation is that it should help decision makers to go through these phases in a structured way. On the basis of previous research on causes of escalation, and on conditions and activities leading to de-escalation, this general requirement can be further elaborated.</p><p>To start with, a tool should help to recognize the problem and re-examine the original course of action. 'De-escalation requires a clear understanding that something is wrong with the present course of action' (Montealgre and <ref type="bibr">Keil, 2000, p 432)</ref>.</p><p>For the second stage, it is important to understand that the setback or the problem is indeed caused by the chosen course of action. To this purpose, it helps to have proper and salient information about the positive and negative consequences of the course of action and its costs and benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Staw and Ross, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Garland, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boulding et al, 1997)</ref>. Moreover, it is specifically helpful if decision makers do not just passively receive such relevant information, but if they are enabled to actively discover this information by themselves. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boulding et al (1997)</ref> point out, just passively receiving information may sometimes lead to downplaying or ignoring it (eg <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ross and Staw, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Keil, 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Montealegre and Keil, 2000)</ref>. By contrast, information that is actively discovered or constructed may be harder to ignore and helps to de-escalate (cf <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rubin and Brockner, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brockner et al, 1979)</ref>. De-escalation is stimulated if decision makers can explicitly trace the negative consequences to the chosen strategy and understand that they are not just temporary or externally caused setbacks (cf <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Staw and Ross, 1978)</ref>. Therefore, a tool should help decision makers to actively and unambiguously trace the negative consequences of the chosen course of action.</p><p>For the third stage of de-escalation, a thorough consideration of alternatives is necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boulding et al, 1997)</ref>. Hence, a tool should help to actively construct and compare alternatives and provide the relevant information on costs and benefits of these alternatives. Moreover, the tool should help decision makers keep track of goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brockner et al, 1979)</ref> and avoid (some) information processing biases as much as possible, for example by making it difficult to ignore information <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Staw, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Staw and Ross, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Montealgre and Keil, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, for the analysis stages, a tool may help stimulate de-escalation by increasing the accuracy of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Simonson and Staw, 1992)</ref>. This de-escalation might be due to an increased understanding of the nature of the problem situation, the role of the chosen course of action in the failure and/or the alternative courses of action. But it might also be due to making justification through escalation more difficult, precisely as a result of an increased understanding. If the decision tool presents the relevant information in such a way that the decision maker can understand the causes of failure, the negative consequences of sticking to the decision, and the possible positive effects of alternative courses of action, then the evidence 'against' escalation may become so salient and vivid that it may become more difficult to actually stick to the decision and hence, decision makers may be stimulated to de-escalate.</p><p>To summarize, based on the process model of Montealgre and Keil on de-escalation, for a tool to stimulate de-escalation, it should 1. help decision makers to actively and unambiguously trace the negative consequences of the chosen course of action; 2. help decision makers to actively construct and compare alternatives (by providing relevant information on consequences, by offering structure, and by helping to avoid biases in information processing);</p><p>There are, to the best of our knowledge, no studies, showing the effect of such support tools on de-escalation. The only test of a decision support tool tested in escalation situations is devil's advocacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schwenk, 1988)</ref>, which is used for introducing structured conflict in strategic decision making. Schwenk proposed that devil's advocacy can help decision makers question their assumptions and reduce escalating commitment. He found only marginal support to this proposition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Greitemeyer et al (2009)</ref> showed de-escalation effects of using devil's advocacy with groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLDs-a brief introduction</head><p>CLDs are qualitative system dynamics models that show cause and effect relationships between variables. They have been used quite extensively in different organizational contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vennix, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sterman, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Perlow et al, 2002)</ref>. CLDs consist of a combination of feedback loops that together represent the feedback structure of a system. A core assumption behind CLDs is that the behaviour of a system is a consequence of this underlying feedback structure. Therefore, understanding this structure is relevant for understanding the system's (problematic) behaviour; and the main goal of CLDs is to support this understanding (cf <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Richardson and Pugh, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Every feedback loop in a CLD represents a dynamic process. There are two types of feedback loops: reinforcing loops that amplify change and generate exponential growth and balancing loops that counteract change and try to stabilize the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sterman, 2000)</ref>. CLDs include all the feedback loops that are believed to be important for explaining the problem situation. The dynamic behaviour of a system 'arises from the interactions of these networks of feedbacks' <ref type="bibr">(Sterman, 2000, p 14</ref>). Hence, by using CLDs, it is possible to analyse and understand a problematic situation, identify the causes of the problem, and consequences of possible courses of actions.</p><p>To illustrate CLDs and their potential to analyse and understand problematic situations, consider the example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> that represents the underlying structure of a price war-the case we used in the experiment (see method's section). Through the analysis of this causal structure decision makers can identify how their company is linked with the competitors and that an action of lowering prices with the intended consequence of increasing their market share would rather end up forcing them to further decrease their prices: an initial decrease in price will (ceteris paribus) not only lead to an increase in the company's market share but also to a decline in the market share of the competitor causing the competitor to lower their price, which in turn will affect our company's market share negatively forcing us to decrease our price further. These loops entail a price war where both companies will be forced to decrease price and probably, lose money at the end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLD as a de-escalation tool</head><p>We propose that CLDs satisfy the two requirements for a de-escalation tool identified in the previous section.</p><p>First, a CLD provides relevant information about the chosen course of action and can help decision makers to actively trace its negative consequences. By analysing the CLD that represents the underlying causal structure of a system in terms of causally related variables and feedback loops, decision makers can understand why some problematic behaviour has occurred and the nature of these causes (eg, endogeneous/exogeneous, temporary/permanent). In fact, understanding problematic systemic behaviour is the purpose of CLD-based modelling (cf <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Richardson and Pugh, 1981)</ref>. The causal structure can also be used to identify the consequences if the same course of action is further implemented. For instance, by using the CLD given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, decision makers can trace the loops to identify what the consequences of a further decrease in price would be for the company. Moreover, the CLD can be used to identify the key variables on which further information should be collected. It is important to realize that while doing the analysis, decision makers will be actively involved in generating the information necessary to understand the situation as well as the nature and consequences of the implemented strategy.</p><p>Second, CLDs can help decision makers to actively construct and compare alternatives by providing relevant information about consequences, by offering structure, and by helping to avoid biases in information processing. A decision maker can use the CLD to actively trace the consequences of any course of action. Such a task might require assuming a change in the value of some variable (eg, increase in quality). In some cases, it might require extending the model to represent the changes implied by the new course of action (eg, introduction of a new product). In this way, decision makers use the structure offered in the CLD to find out and understand the consequences of alternative courses of action. CLDs may, because of the structure, also help to counter some biases that may cause escalation. CLDs enable decision makers to formalize their hidden cognitive processes and question any existing inconsistency (in their mental models and/or reasoning process). By making assumptions and analysis more explicit and giving decision making more formal grounds, using CLDs can make it more difficult for decision makers to ignore information on the (present and future) project performance and alternatives. In this way, one could argue that CLDs may help to counter particular forms of selective perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hogarth and</ref><ref type="bibr">Makridakis, 1981, Walsh, 1988)</ref> and attribution biases relevant in an escalation context.</p><p>To summarize, we argue that CLDs can help to stimulate de-escalation, because it satisfies the two requirements needed for de-escalation to occur. Therefore, we hypothesize that decision makers who use a CLD while making a re-investment decision after receiving negative decision consequences will invest less money in the original action than those who do not use any decision aid. Below, we will present an experimental study testing this hypothesis.</p><p>However, before we describe the experiment testing this hypothesis, we would like to conclude this section with one final remark. In this paper, we want to research the effect of CLDs on de-escalation, because they fulfil the requirements for supporting de-escalation. We are not saying that other operation research techniques (eg, decision trees or multi-criteria analysis) might not also help to decrease escalation. In this paper, we focus on CLDs-for several reasons. First, because we believe that they have a feature that makes them especially suitable for de-escalation: compared to other tools, CLDs make the system's causal structure visible and thus, make it possible to both identify the consequences of different course of actions and understand why these consequences would be faced if the action is implemented. Second, CLDs may also have the advantage of being easily and intuitively understood due to their graphical nature. Establishing the use of a CLD as a de-escalation technique is, in our view, a relevant research finding on its own. The possible use of other techniques in this respect would entail a thorough analysis of such techniques in the light of the de-escalation requirements, and a thorough experimental comparison. Even though we see merit in this research, it is beyond the scope of our paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and design</head><p>Management science undergraduate students (N = 68) following a methodology course participated in the study on a voluntary basis. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions in the 1 × 2 (Decision aid: No aid (n noaid = 38) and CLD (n CLD = 30)) factorial between-subjects design. The participants had no prior experience with building or using CLDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task and procedure</head><p>The participants worked on a case developed by the first author. The case described a successful high-quality supermarket chain that needed a new strategy to overcome the profit and market share problems it was facing. The case was designed to create an initial commitment to the so-called 'discounting strategy'--'lowering the prices to cope with the competition and not to lose the customers to the competitor'. The participants, assuming the role of a long-term member of the board of directors that was going to decide on a new strategy, were told that the new strategy was their own idea and that they proposed the so-called discounting strategy many times in the past but were not successful in having it accepted. However, now, the situation was different and the board was favouring the idea. The participants were told, 'As usual, you strongly favour the idea and argue why it is a very good strategy'. After reading the case, the initial commitment of the participants to the strategy was measured. Consecutively, they all received negative decision consequences stressing that the strategy was not performing well. Before the decision on whether to go on with the strategy, half of the participants received a CLD whereas the other half did not receive any aid. The participants were then asked to make a decision on how much they would re-invest in the discounting strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent and dependent variables</head><p>The only independent variable in this study was the availability of a decision aid before the re-investment decision. The control group did not receive any decision aid. The participants in the experimental CLD group were given a CLD along with its explanation and were told that this 'causal model shows the relations among important factors that affect the company's business' (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>The dependent variable was commitment to strategy. As in previous escalation research, commitment was measured with the amount of money participants would like to invest in the strategy after the negative decision consequences (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Staw, 1976)</ref>. We also measured the level of support the participants had for the strategy by using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (I do not support it at all) to 7 (I support it fully).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A preliminary analysis showed that there were no differences between the two groups in terms of their initial commitment to the strategy prior to receiving the decision consequences (t(66) = 4.18, p = 0.678). To investigate the effect of the decision aid on escalation, an independent-samples T-test was conducted on the commitment measures. An independent-samples T-test run on the money invested yielded a significant effect for the decision-aid manipulation (t(66) = 2.22, p &lt; 0.05), indicating that the group receiving a CLD (M = 433 333, SD = 393 773) invested significantly less than the group that did not receive any decision-aid (M = 623 947, SD = 313 709) (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). The T-test results for the amount of support the subjects had for the strategy showed similar results. Subjects in the CLD group (M = 3.93, SD = 1.79) indicated significantly lower support for the strategy than the subjects in the control group (M = 4.84, SD = 1.42), (t(66) = 2.33, p &lt; 0.05) (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that as compared to not using a decision aid, using a CLD prior to the second investment decision leads to a lower commitment in the failing strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper, the results of an experiment studying the effect of using a CLD on de-escalation were reported. When compared to subjects who did not receive any decision aid, the escalation effect was significantly decreased in subjects receiving a CLD. Those who received a CLD invested significantly less money in the failing strategy and were significantly less supportive of this strategy showing that the use of CLDs stimulates de-escalation. Even though we found that CLDs did have a stimulating effect on de-escalation, some questions about this effect and our study can be asked. Below, we will discuss some of these questions.</p><p>In this paper, we argue that by making the structure of a system explicit (in terms of interrelated feedback loops) a CLD helps decision makers to (1) actively and unambiguously trace the negative consequences of the chosen strategy and (2) actively construct and compare robust alternatives. In our view, CLDs thus satisfy two important requirements for de-escalation. However, we have not determined the relative contribution of the CLD characteristics. It could be that the CLD mainly triggered an objective trace of the negative consequences of the discounting strategy and that such understanding already led to de-escalation. It could also be that the CLD stimulated de-escalation by making the available alternatives explicit. And, it may also be that the CLD had both effects. However, considering that the subjects had limited time to analyse the CLDs and that they were not familiar with CLDs, it could well be that subjects only analysed the problematic situation and its relation to the discounting strategy (as both the problematic situation and the strategy were explicitly mentioned). Having more time, knowledge, and CLD-experience may help subjects to both understand the problematic situation/chosen strategy better and analyse alternative strategies. This might also mean an increased effect of CLDs on de-escalation. Future research is needed to shed some more detailed light on the reasons why CLD had the de-escalation effect.</p><p>One might also argue that a CLD may stimulate de-escalation just because it contains relevant objective information (eg the variables presented). However, to be sure that the CLDs stimulated de-escalation because of the causal structure they represent, we conducted a similar experiment in which the subjects (n = 19) were given only a list of variables that were also included in the CLD. Subjects were told that these variables were 'important factors that your company should monitor'. Therefore, the subject received the same variables, as the subjects in the CLD group, but without the structural relations between them. We found that this group showed no significant de-escalation compared to the group without a decision aid (ie, neither the mean money invested nor the mean support differed significantly from the control group. For money invested: t(55) = 0.34, p = 0.736, the group receiving a list M = 592 105, SD = 373 520 versus no decision-aid group M = 623 947, SD = 313 709. For support: t(55) = -0.26, p = 0.794, the group receiving a list M = 4.95, SD = 1.43 versus no decision-aid group M = 4.84, SD = 1.42). Even though this experimental group was somewhat small in size, these results are encouraging and support our argumentation that CLDs stimulate de-escalation because of the specific way they present relevant information.</p><p>In this study, student subjects were used in a laboratory experiment. And even though there is evidence showing that students and managers make similar decisions (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ashton and Kramer, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mowen and Mowen, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yavas, 1994)</ref>, replication of the findings using decision makers in real-life decision-making situations would be desirable.</p><p>The current study shows-for the first time-that a CLD as a specific decision tool can stimulate de-escalation. This is a promising result and can be the basis for further research. In particular, to generalize the results and to be able to understand the effect of CLDs better, more replications (in different contexts) seem to be warranted.</p><p>In this study, the subjects did not build the model themselves. The current results are encouraging in the sense that even without model building, CLDs triggered de-escalation. Given the evidence that being involved in model building increases the benefits from using models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rouwette et al, 2011)</ref>, we would expect model building to further stimulate de-escalation; especially, if the situation involves a group decision. Group model building (GMB) process can help decision makers share their mental models with one another and help generate consensus and commitment to the decisions taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vennix, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rouwette et al, 2011)</ref> making the implementation of an exit strategy easier. A potential advantage of GMB for escalation situation might be to have decision makers and evaluators of the results to go through the model building process together in order to increase the shared understanding and hence, decrease the justification needs of the decision makers. Testing the effectiveness of a GMB study in decreasing the escalation of groups could be very rewarding.</p><p>Another issue relates to whether de-escalation is always desirable. One could argue that de-escalation can prematurely stop ventures that could turn out to be great successes. For instance, it might be that the setback is just temporary before the actual take-off or the cause of failure might be some other factor(s) not related to the implemented strategy. An advantage of using a CLD is that it offers an understanding of system behaviour in terms of its structure and this understanding can help differentiate whether de-escalation is justified. Hence, if a course of action has future potential then it would be possible to identify that potential. In the same way, it would be possible to identify whether setback is temporary or whether causes are external to the strategy. If such realizations take place during analysis then, indeed, decision makers should choose to stick with the course of action rather than de-escalate. We do not advocate blind de-escalation but rather warranted de-escalation after careful analysis.</p><p>A final remark relates to other decision techniques. Our interest in this study was in finding out whether CLDs had a positive effect on de-escalation. Our result contributes to the OR/MS literature by showing the power an OR/MS tool has to counter a costly bias. Other OR tools and techniques may have an influence on de-escalation as well. Testing other techniques against the de-escalation tool requirements outlined in this paper and identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of various methods in overcoming escalation would be a very interesting line of future research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 An example of a CLD.</figDesc></figure>
