<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Biodiversity monitoring schemes periodically measure species' abundances and distributions at a sample of sites to understand how they have changed over time. Often, the aim is to infer change in an average sense across some wider landscape. Inference to the wider landscape is simple if the species' abundances and distributions are similar at sampled to non-sampled locations. Otherwise, the data are geographically biased, and some form of correction is desirable. 2. We combine causal diagrams with "superpopulation models" to correct time-varying geographic biases in biodiversity monitoring data. For a given time-period, expert-derived causal diagrams are used to deduce the set of variables that explain the geographic bias, and superpopulation models adjust for these variables to produce a corrected estimate of a landscape-wide mean of e.g. abundance or occupancy. Estimating a time trend in the variable of interest is achieved by fitting models for multiple time-periods and, if the drivers of bias are suspect to change over time, by constructing per period causal diagrams. We test the approach using simulated data then apply it to real data from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). 3. Where the variables that explain the geographic bias are known and measured without error, our method is unbiased. Introducing measurement error reduces the method's efficacy, but it is still an improvement on using the sample mean. When applied to data from the UKBMS, the approach gives different results to the scheme's current method, which assumes no geographic bias. 4. Where the goal is to estimate change in some variable of interest at the landscape level (e.g. biodiversity indicators), models that do not adjust for geographic bias implicitly assume it does not exist. Our approach makes the weaker assumption that there is no geographic bias conditional on the adjustment variables, so it should yield more accurate estimates of time trends in many circumstances. The method does require assumptions about the drivers of bias, but these are codified explicitly in the causal diagrams. Operationalising our approach should be less costly than full probability sampling, which would be needed to satisfy the assumptions of conventional approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monitoring biodiversity</head><p>The goal of biodiversity monitoring is to understand how some variable of interest 𝑌, often when summarised across the relevant landscape or study area, has changed over time (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yoccoz et al., 2001)</ref>. 𝑌 might be a species' (relative) abundance, occupancy or some summary thereof across many species. The landscape is often delimited by national boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moussy et al., 2022)</ref>, but in principle it could be any geographic area. 𝑌 is usually summarised across the landscape periodically by taking its mean or something similar (e.g. a categorical year effect from a model in which 𝑌 is the response; <ref type="bibr">Brereton, Roy, et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Powney et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Stroh et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>To calculate the landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 directly, one would need to know its distribution across the landscape as a whole (i.e. its value at every location). Generally, however, the landscape distribution of 𝑌 is not known, because it is not possible to collect data at every location. Instead, the usual strategy is to split the landscape into areal units, or "sites", and to collect data at some of them. The landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 is then estimated from the sample of sites for which data are available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geographic sampling biases</head><p>When estimating the landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 from a sample of sites, there is a risk of geographic sampling bias. A dataset is geographically biased if the distribution of 𝑌 across sampled sites differs from its distribution across the wider landscape. An equivalent definition is the existence of a nonzero correlation between 𝑌 and a sample inclusion indicator 𝑅, which takes the value 1 at sampled sites and 0 elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boyd, Powney, et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Meng, 2018)</ref>. If the correlation is positive, then the bias is positive (i.e. the mean of 𝑌 is larger across sampled sites than across the landscape as a whole), and vice versa. The greater the magnitude of the correlation, the more severe the bias.</p><p>Biodiversity monitoring data are often collected in such a way that the same factors affect 𝑅 and 𝑌, which induces a correlation between the two (and therefore a bias). To give one simple example (many others are possible), 𝑌 might be some species' abundance, which is positively affected by habitat quality. Habitat quality might also have a positive effect on 𝑅, because data collectors are often volunteer naturalists (i.e. citizen scientists) and prefer to visit sites that are interesting in terms of wildlife <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bowler et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Forister et al., 2023)</ref>. In this situation, 𝑌 would be larger at sampled sites, which is to say that there would be a positive bias. The reverse would be true if sampling was more likely at sites where species are faring poorly: say, in built-up areas that have poor quality habitat, but which are easy for recorders to access by road <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hughes et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Data from structured monitoring schemes are less susceptible to geographic biases than those from most other sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Geldmann et al., 2016)</ref>, but they are not immune. Many structured monitoring schemes aim to collect data at a random sample of sites (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pescott et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robbins et al., 1986)</ref>. If implemented properly, random sampling ensures no correlation between 𝑅 and 𝑌 in expectation (i.e. on average over many possible samples; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Meng, 2018)</ref>. Obtaining a true random sample is challenging, however, especially if there is a reliance on volunteers to collect the data (which is true of many monitoring schemes). The volunteers might be unwilling or unable to visit some randomly selected sites, whether because they are difficult to access, uninteresting in terms of wildlife or for some other reason <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pescott et al., 2015)</ref>. Nominally random samples with incomplete uptake of sites, or "nonresponse" in survey sampling parlance, are almost certain to be biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bailey, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mitigating geographic biases</head><p>Various approaches exist to mitigate sampling biases, most of which exploit the fact that some set of variables 𝐴 could explain the correlation between 𝑅 and 𝑌 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lohr, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Meng, 2022)</ref>. If, to use the above example, 𝑅 and 𝑌 are both greater at sites with good quality habitat, then the presence of that habitat will explain some of the correlation between the two. Where the variables in 𝐴 can be identified-a point we come back to below-and are reflected in available data, statistically "adjusting for" them will reduce the sampling bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collins et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mohan et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>One way to adjust for 𝐴 is to fit a "superpopulation model", which is a regression (or other type of) model for 𝑌 that includes 𝐴 as covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Elliott &amp; Valliant, 2017)</ref>. In effect, the superpopulation model stratifies sites based on levels of 𝐴 and predicts the average or expected value of 𝑌 for each stratum. If 𝐴 explains the correlation between 𝑅 and 𝑌, the two should be uncorrelated within each stratum, and the predicted within-stratum means should be close to their true values (as there is no sampling bias). Averaging the within-stratum means of 𝑌 with respect to the distribution of 𝐴 across all sites in the landscape yields an "adjusted" estimate of the landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 (i.e. the target quantity). More simply, the average of the superpopulation predictions across all sites is the estimate of the landscape-wide mean-or, in practice, the average of the predictions for non-sampled sites and the observations for sampled sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Elliott &amp; Valliant, 2017</ref>)-and it is unbiased if 𝐴 completely explains the geographic bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal diagrams and what to adjust for</head><p>To identify the variables in 𝐴, insight can be gleaned from causal inference, where a similar challenge arises. Recall that 𝐴 is the set of variables that explains the correlation between 𝑅 and 𝑌. In causal inference, where to goal is to estimate the causal effect of one variable on another, analysts must identify and adjust for the set of variables that explain the non-causal portion of the correlation between the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pearl et al., 2016)</ref>. One way to identify these variables, which could also be used to identify the variables in 𝐴, is to construct "causal diagrams" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Greenland et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Thoemmes &amp; Mohan, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Causal diagrams-not to be confused with parametric structural equation models-will not be familiar to some ecologists (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grace &amp; Irvine, 2020)</ref>, so we will introduce the relevant concepts using the example in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a full description of the graph in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is provided in the Methods section). An arrow from one variable to another indicates a direct causal effect; that is, it indicates that the cause is part of the real-world function that determines the value of the effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pearl et al., 2016)</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, annual temperature (annual_temp) has a direct effect on 𝑌, which is a species' abundance. A path consists of several variables linked by arrows regardless of the direction of those arrows. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts a path linking 𝑅 (site inclusion) to 𝑌: 𝑅 ← heather_grass → heather_grass_quality → 𝑌. The existence of a path between two variables implies that they are correlated, whether by association or a causal link. Hence, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> implies a correlation between 𝑅 and 𝑌 and therefore a geographic bias. While a path between two variables implies that they are correlated (dependent), it does not imply that the dependence is unbreakable. Rather, it might be possible to "block" paths between variables, which is to say, to block the flow of association. Blocking a path is achieved by adjusting for certain variables (i.e. 𝐴), and a set of rules-the rules of d-separation-tell us which ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cinelli et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pearl et al., 2016)</ref>. It is not necessary to spell out the rules of d-separation here, partly because they are described elsewhere (see the references above) and partly because they are built into software packages such as the R package dagitty <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Textor et al., 2016)</ref>. The important point is that the rules can be used to determine the sets of variables 𝐴 that, when statistically adjusted for, will render 𝑅 and 𝑌 independent (if such a set exists; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Thoemmes &amp; Mohan, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Identifying the correct set of variables in 𝐴 is contingent on the causal diagram being an accurate reflection of reality, and there are broadly two ways to achieve this (which are not mutually exclusive). One is to consult domain experts, who understand the relevant system, when constructing the diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Grace &amp; Irvine, 2020)</ref>. The other is to develop the diagram iteratively and test the implied conditional independencies (according to the rules of d-separation) of each iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pearl et al., 2016)</ref>. Where data are missing on 𝑌 for most sites (i.e. where 𝑅 = 0), it will not be possible to test many of a diagram's implied conditional independencies, in which case consulting domain experts is even more important than usual. Of course, experts cannot be expected to have a perfect understanding of most systems, and we come back to this point in several places below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of this paper</head><p>In this paper, we demonstrate how one might combine expert knowledge with causal diagrams and superpopulation models to mitigate geographic biases in biodiversity monitoring data. We assume that a time trend in the mean of 𝑌 across all sites in the relevant landscape is the target quantity, and it is estimated by fitting separate superpopulation models for each of several time-periods. Starting with some simple simulations, we test the abilities of superpopulation models including 𝐴 as covariates to recover the landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 from perfect and imperfect (i.e. including measurement error) data on 𝐴. Next, we apply our method to empirical data from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). The scheme estimates time trends in the mean abundances butterflies in the UK using a model that does not adjust for geographic bias, and we compare these trends to those produced using superpopulation models. In the final section, we discuss the pros and cons of our approach and how it could be improved in future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Demonstrating superpopulation modelling via simulation Although superpopulation models can mitigate geographic biases in theory, reality is more complex. It is likely, for example, that data will not be available on some variable(s) in 𝐴 at the exact location of a site. Instead, the available data might represent an average across some larger area in which the site is situated. Alternatively, data might be available on 𝐴 at the precise location of the site but not for the relevant time-period. In these cases, we would expect the data to correlate with the true variable(s) in 𝐴, but not to be a perfect proxy. To test the implications of including imperfect data on 𝐴 in a superpopulation model, as well as some other methodological choices, we conducted a simple simulation study. (See supplementary material three for an additional simulation that includes two time-periods and the estimation of a trend.)</p><p>Our simulation was based on the causal diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The diagram depicts the causes of some species' abundance 𝑌 and sample inclusion 𝑅 across 250,000 sites in a simple virtual landscape. It implies that the quantity of good quality heather grassland (heather_grass_quality) and annual temperature at each site directly affect 𝑌. The quantity of good quality heather grassland at a site is determined by the total quantity of heather grassland (of any quality; heather_grass) and the proportion that is well managed (management). 𝑅 is greater at sites with more heather grassland, because recorders know that it is a favourable habitat for the focal species, which they hope to see. The presence of major roads near a site makes it more accessible so also affect 𝑅. According to the rules of d-separation, the causal diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> implies that 𝑅 is independent of 𝑌 given heather grassland (i.e. there is only variable in 𝐴).</p><p>To simulate the data, we used the simulateSEM function in the R package dagitty <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Textor et al., 2016)</ref>. With the exception of 𝑅, all variables are standard normal (i.e. mean of 0 and unit variance). Other than causes of 𝑅 (see below), each variable explains ~25% of the variation in its direct descendent. 𝑅 is a binary variable (0 if the data is missing and 1 otherwise), so we could not simulate it in the same way as the others. Instead, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Thoemmes &amp; Rose (2014)</ref>, we simulated a latent standard normal variable and discretized it by assigning all values above the first percentile the value 1 and the remainder the value 0 (i.e. we assume data on 𝑌 are missing for 99% of sites). A consequence of this strategy is that each cause of 𝑅 explains less than 25% of its variance, because discretizing the latent normal variable attenuates the correlation between the two. Strictly speaking, the latent normal variable should be included in the causal diagram in Fig 1, but it does not affect its implied conditional independencies, so we omit it for simplicity.</p><p>Having simulated the data, we estimated the mean of 𝑌 across all sites using the data at sites where 𝑅 = 1 (i.e. the sample). We used six estimators, which are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The first is the sample mean, and the remainder are superpopulation models-in this case, linear regressions-including different covariates. The first superpopulation model includes 𝐴 (heather_grass) as a covariate. The second includes 𝐴 and an additional cause of 𝑌 (annual_temp), which should increase precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cinelli et al., 2022)</ref>. The remainder of the superpopulation models include correlates of 𝐴 (with different strengths of correlation) to reflect the fact that the available data are unlikely to be error-free. correlate of heather_grass (𝜌 = 0.9) Superpopulation model We evaluated the superpopulation models' performances in terms of their estimation error. The procedure involved simulating 100 datasets based the causal diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and calculating the difference between the true, landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 and the superpopulation model estimate for each one. The 100 datasets differed slightly from one another, as there is a random component to the simulateSEM function. Averaging the estimation error across the 100 estimates of mean 𝑌 for each method gives an estimate of its estimator bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UKBMS case study</head><p>The scheme To demonstrate how causal diagrams and superpopulation models might be used to correct biases in a real dataset, we applied them to data from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). The UKBMS has been running since 1976 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pollard &amp; Yates, 1996)</ref>. Data are collected by volunteers, who walk transects at a network of sites in the UK and count the butterflies that they see within an imaginary 5-metre box when weather permits <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pollard, 1977)</ref>. The volunteers are free to decide where to establish transects and generally do so in good quality semi-natural habitat, where butterflies are most abundant <ref type="bibr">(Brereton, Roy, et al., 2011)</ref>. Recorders are asked to walk UKBMS transects at least once in each of the 26 weeks from April 1 st to September 29 th to cover the main flight periods of UK butterflies. On average, however, ~20 weeks are sampled due to poor weather conditions, recorder availability etc.</p><p>In 2009, the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS) was established and incorporated in the UKBMS. The primary motivation for the WCBS was to increase coverage of habitats that were poorly represented by the UKBMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brereton, Cruickshanks, et al., 2011)</ref>. Hence, rather than being chosen by the volunteers, WCBS sites are located within randomly selected 1 km grid squares in the UK. Importantly, however, volunteers are not willing/able to visit all WCBS squares: they prefer to visit and to re-visit sites that are accessible or where they are likely to see species that interest them.</p><p>Consequently, WCBS squares are not truly random. WCBS transects also differ from traditional UKBMS transects in that volunteers are asked to walk them a minimum of twice in July-August (although some do more) at least ten days apart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Existing analytical method</head><p>The current method used to analyse the UKBMS (including WCBS) data has three steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dennis et al., 2016)</ref>. The first is to fit a GAM to estimate normalised seasonal abundance curves for each species and year (these do not vary geographically; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dennis et al., 2013)</ref>. The second is to estimate annual site indices of relative abundance using the fitted GAMs. The total observed counts are scaled by the proportion of the seasonal abundance curve that was surveyed to provide an estimate of the expected total had the entire season been surveyed. Finally, a Poisson GLM with site and year effects is fitted to the annual site indices, and the estimated year effects (log10 scale) are used as annual indices of relative abundance. In the final GLM, each site/year index is weighted in proportion to the fraction of the 26-week flight curve that was sampled (rather than imputed). Consequently, the WCBS sites, which are sampled as little as twice per year, should be heavily downweighted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New analytical method</head><p>We modified the current UKBMS framework by replacing the final GLM with superpopulation models that adjust for 𝐴. Steps one and two, which produce seasonally adjusted annual site indices of relative abundance, remain the same, and the superpopulation models are fitted to these indices. Taxon and dataset experts provided the information needed to construct causal diagrams and identify the variables in 𝐴 (more details below).</p><p>For demonstrative purposes, we focused on two species of butterfly, whose geographic distributions and ecologies are very different: the meadow brown (Maniola jurtina) and the small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). The causes and effects of 𝑌, i.e. relative abundance, differ between the two species. As we are only working with one dataset, collected by the UKBMS (including WCBS sites), the causes and effects of 𝑅 (site inclusion) do not differ between species.</p><p>We asked two taxon and UKBMS experts to provide information on the causes and effects of 𝑅 and 𝑌 via the forms in supplementary materials one and two. Both experts (redacted) are authors on this paper. To constrain their answers, we asked the experts to select causes and effects from a list of 49 land cover (i.e. habitat), bioclimatic, geological and other variables on which data are available (see supplementary material three for details of the data). Of course, this strategy risks omitting important variables-a point we come back to in the Discussion. The experts provided their feedback independently.</p><p>Rather than the transect-level, we asked the experts to think about causes and effects of 𝑅 and 𝑌 at the coarser resolution of 1 × 1 km, which was necessary for two reasons. First, it is the finest resolution at which data on some variables in 𝐴 are available. The second reason is more complex. Recall that the superpopulation model predictions of 𝑌 must be averaged across all sites in the landscape. It would be conceptually challenging the split the landscape into imaginary transects, which are the "true" sites, but splitting it into 1 × 1 km grid squares is simple. In the few cases where multiple UKBMS transects fell within the same grid square, we averaged the site indices across those transects in a given year to obtain a grid square-level data point.</p><p>The information provided by the experts enabled us to construct causal diagrams and, using the rules of d-separation, to identify the variables in 𝐴 (according to each expert). In total, we produced four causal diagrams: one for each species and expert. For any one diagram, there may be multiple sets of variables 𝐴 that d-separate 𝑅 and 𝑌. We selected the "minimal" (i.e. smallest) set that only included variables on which data are available (listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Both experts indicated that some land cover (habitat) types have negative effects on 𝑅 and 𝑌, but we did not include these in the causal diagrams. Our logic is that these land cover types are only detrimental to the species in the sense that they are not the right habitat (indeed, this is how it was phrased by expert two <ref type="bibr">[redacted]</ref>). The land cover data are expressed as the proportion of each 1 km grid square covered by each land cover type <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Morton et al., 2022)</ref>, which means that a large proportion of one necessarily means a small proportion of another (i.e. the land cover types are not independent). That is, a high proportion of favourable habitat would imply a low proportion of unfavourable habitat, and vice versa, so it is not necessary to include unfavourable land cover types in the causal diagrams.</p><p>Having identified two sets of variables 𝐴 (one from each expert) for each species, the next step was to fit superpopulation models including these variables as covariates. We fitted one model per species, expert (i.e. 𝐴) and year. As the data are (normalised) counts, and for consistency with the current UKBMS method, we used Poisson GLMs with a log link function. We used each model to predict 𝑌 for non-sampled sites, combined the predictions with the observations at sampled sites and calculated the mean for the relevant species and year. Each year's mean for a given expert and species gives an annual index of abundance. To measure change over time, we used the slope from a regression of the estimated abundance indices on year.</p><p>For simplicity, we treated the model covariates (i.e. 𝐴) as constant over time. This was a natural choice for elevation and calcareous bedrock, which are genuinely time-invariant (at least since 1976). Our approach might seem less appropriate for the three land cover classes that featured in at least one of the models (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), but inspection of the available land cover maps shows that there has been little change in the recent past (85% of 25 × 25 m grid squares in Great Britain were the same land cover class in 2015 as in 1990; supplementary material three). Full details of the auxiliary data are provided in supplementary material three.</p><p>Comparing trends from the current and new methods Some rescaling was needed to ensure comparability between the outputs of the current UKBMS analysis and the superpopulation models. The year effects from the current UKBMS model represent the average change in the focal species' relative abundance across sites in the relevant year relative to a reference year (1976) on the log10 scale. The estimates from the superpopulation models, on the other hand, reflect the average absolute count across sites in each year on the natural log scale. To match the two, we converted the natural log estimates from the superpopulation models to the log10 scale then subtracted the estimate from the reference year from each year's index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variance estimation</head><p>For both the superpopulation models and the simpler GLM used by the UKBMS, we estimated the sampling variance in each year's index of relative abundance by bootstrapping across sites. We created 100 bootstrap samples by resampling the site indices with replacement within each year and fitted a model to each sample. We present percentile (95%) confidence intervals for each year from the bootstrap distribution of the annual indices (year effects from the simple GLM and estimates of mean 𝑌 from the superpopulation models). Note that this procedure does not propagate uncertainty in the estimation of the site indices from the raw count data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Simulations Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the estimation error-the difference between the true, landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 and the estimate thereof-of each analytical method listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The sample mean is highly biased (mean error, i.e. bias, of ~0.35 in units of standard deviations of 𝑌). Using a superpopulation in which 𝐴 is the sole covariate (𝐴 comprises just one variable in this example), the estimate of mean 𝑌 across all sites is unbiased (scenario 2; mean error~0). The estimate is also unbiased if 𝐴 plus an additional cause of 𝑌 are included as covariates (scenario 3), and it has similar variance to the estimate from scenario 2. Including a correlate of 𝐴 as the covariate reduces the bias relative to the sample mean but does not eliminate it (scenarios 4-6; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The stronger the correlation between 𝐴 and its proxy, the closer the bias to that from scenario 2, where 𝐴 itself was included as a covariate.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UKBMS case study Identifying the variables in A</head><p>The experts provided different perspectives on the causes and effects of 𝑅 (UKBMS site inclusion including WCBS sites) and 𝑌 (the abundances of the meadow brown and small pearl-bordered fritillary). Their feedback is provided in full in supplementary materials one and two. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the causal diagram reflecting expert two's knowledge of the causes and effects of 𝑅 and the 𝑌 in the case of the small pearl-bordered fritillary.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Causal diagram depicting causes and effects of sample inclusion in the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (𝑅) and the abundance of the small pearl-bordered fritillary (𝑌). The diagram reflects the knowledge of a taxon and UKBMS expert (expert two). N_dep is nitrogen deposition, mean_T_wet_Q is the mean temperature of the wettest quarter of the year, elev is elevation, bl_wood is broadleaved woodland, protected is the proportion of each grid square that is some form of protected area and variables suffixed by "_quality" denote the proportion of each grid square that is both the relevant land cover type (indicated by the rest of its name) and managed appropriately for the species. The other variables are self-explanatory.</p><p>A major difference between the two experts' feedback is that expert two indicated positive effects of several land cover classes (habitats) on 𝑌 conditional on the way that they are managed. That is, the habitats support high abundances of the species, but only if they are managed appropriately. We codified these conditional effects in the causal diagrams by introducing new, unobserved variables. One is "management", which indicates whether the habitat is managed appropriately for the species, and the others are variables that denote the proportion of each site that is both the relevant land cover class and managed appropriately (i.e. "good" quality). For example, the expert indicated that heather grassland has a positive effect on the abundance of the small pearl-bordered fritillary conditional on appropriate management. In the causal diagram, the effect of heather grassland on 𝑌 is heather grassland → quality heather grassland → 𝑌, where management also has a direct effect on quality heather grassland (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Note that we did not specifically ask the experts to provide information on conditional effects, which is why expert one did not.</p><p>From each of the four causal diagrams-one for each species and expert-we identified the minimal adjustment set 𝐴 (the variables on which 𝑅 and 𝑌 are hopefully conditionally independent) using the rules of d-separation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). For each diagram, it is possible to d-separate 𝑅 and 𝑌 without having to adjust for any of the unobserved variables introduced to depict the conditional effects of land cover classes on 𝑌 (i.e. management or "quality" habitats). For both species, the variables in 𝐴 differ between experts, which meant that two superpopulation models had to be fitted for each one. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current versus new model outputs</head><p>We compared the superpopulation models' outputs to those of the current UKBMS GLM in terms of the annual estimates and the long-term trend, which is the coefficient from a regression of annual index on year (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). For both species, the outputs of the superpopulation models are markedly different to those of the UKBMS method. For the meadow brown, the two superpopulation models (one for each expert) agree that there has been a decline in abundance, whereas the UKBMS method suggests that abundance has been stable over time. For the small pearl-bordered fritillary, the current UKBMS method suggests a decline in abundance over time, whereas the two superpopulation models indicate a slight increase.</p><p>The estimates from one of the two superpopulation models (SM_2) for the small pearl-bordered fritillary appear to be very uncertain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). This uncertainty is a result of the fact that we rescaled the estimates in each year by subtracting the estimate from the reference year, 1976. In 1976, there were only eight grid squares with data on the small pearl-bordered fritillary, so the variance in this year is truly large. Subtracting these highly variable estimates from the estimates for subsequent years makes them appear similarly uncertain. The variance of the estimates on the absolute scale is far smaller (supplementary material three; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S4</ref>), but we chose to present the estimates relative to 1976 for consistency with the UKBMS approach.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have demonstrated how causal diagrams and superpopulation models might be used to estimate the landscape-wide mean of some variable of interest 𝑌 (e.g. a species' abundance or occupancy) from geographically biased monitoring data. Our simulations show that, if the variables that explain the geographic bias (i.e. 𝐴) are measured (without error), known and included in the superpopulation model, then that model is unbiased (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Clearly, these ideal conditions are unlikely, a point we come back to below. By fitting models for multiple time-periods, we estimated time trends in the mean relative abundances of two species of butterfly using data from the UKBMS. The trends are different to those estimated using the UKBMS's existing method, which does not adjust for geographic bias (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>).</p><p>The experts (redacted) were not confident about whether the superpopulation models more accurately captured the UK-wide trends for the two species than the existing UKBMS method. The UKBMS conducts a regional breakdown of each species' trend in the UK (<ref type="url" target="https://ukbms.org/official-statistics">https://ukbms.org/official-statistics</ref>).</p><p>For the small pearl-bordered fritillary, it reports a strong decline in England but a strong increase in Scotland. Scotland is relatively underrepresented in the UKBMS data, so a good adjustment should place more weight on the trend in this region. The superpopulation models clearly give more weight to the Scottish trend than the UKBMS method-one even suggests that the species is increasing at the UK level. Nevertheless, two experts (redacted) are sceptical that the small pearl-bordered fritillary is not declining at the UK level (based on e.g. an observed decline in its distribution). All experts felt that the superpopulation model estimates for the meadow brown are plausible (although none were highly confident). Their reasoning is that the species is probably doing better or at least as well at sampled than at non-sampled locations.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, there are some limited cases in which the UKBMS model and others like it could capture the true trend in the landscape-wide mean of a species' abundance 𝑌 despite not adjusting for geographic biases. If, for example, the bias is time-invariant in terms of both sign and magnitude, then no adjustment is needed. This scenario is highly unlikely, however. The distribution of sample inclusion 𝑅 changes over time, because different sites are sampled in different years. So too does the distribution of 𝑌 unless the focal species' relative abundance remains the same at each site in each time-period, which is clearly implausible. As the distributions of 𝑅 and 𝑌 change over time, it is highly unlikely that the correlation between the two, i.e. the bias, would remain constant. We also note that the existing UKBMS model could produce unbiased estimates of alternative estimands using the UKBMS data. For example, one might be interested in the trend in the mean abundance across occupied sites (i.e. where 𝑌 ≥ 1), in which case sampling all populations would permit unbiased inference. Of course, this would require knowing the locations of all populations, and range shifts would complicate matters.</p><p>The major benefit of using superpopulation models rather than conventional methods (e.g. a GLM with site and year effects) is that they relax the highly untenable assumption that there is no geographic bias; instead, they work on the weaker and slightly more tenable assumption that there is no geographic bias conditional on the adjustment set 𝐴. Of course, satisfying this weaker assumption means being confident that i) experts were able to identify all relevant causes and effects of sample inclusion 𝑅 and the variable of interest 𝑌 and that ii) data on those variables are available, which are doubtful. The hope is that the models have reduced the geographic bias, i.e. the correlation between 𝑅 and 𝑌, to the point where the adjusted estimates of the landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 are appreciably less biased than the naïve ones.</p><p>Whether a superpopulation model estimate of the landscape-wide mean of 𝑌 is less biased than a naïve (i.e. unadjusted) one depends on several factors, some of which were captured by our simulations. Where data on all 𝐴 are available, but they were measured with error, the adjustment should reduce but not eliminate bias (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Matters are more complex where some variables in 𝐴 are omitted from the model and/or where some variables that are not in 𝐴 are erroneously included (both of which may result from mis-specifying the causal diagram). Erroneously included/omitted variables that are more strongly related to 𝑅 and 𝑌 have greater potential to cause a bias, because they can induce a larger correlation between the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Collins et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Thoemmes &amp; Rose, 2014)</ref>. However, the sign of the relationships is also relevant: if one erroneously omitted/included variable induces a negative geographic bias and another induces a positive one, then the two might cancel each other out and cause no bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Thoemmes &amp; Rose, 2014)</ref>. Our simulations do not capture the effects of mis-specifying the causal diagrams, because any choice of a select few scenarios of strengths and directions of effects and causal diagram structures would have been necessarily arbitrary, but analysts should recognise that the success of the superpopulation modelling approach is contingent on accuracy of the causal diagram.</p><p>Indeed, constructing accurate causal diagrams is the major practical limitation of our approach. Analysts might have hundreds or even thousands of species in mind, and experts might not have the knowledge to construct causal diagrams for each one. Even if they did, it would be a time-consuming exercise (although less costly than full probability sampling, which would be needed to satisfy the assumptions of conventional methods). One option for reducing this burden might be to identify and adjust for a set of variables that have large causal effects on 𝑅 and 𝑌 for many species: for example, woodland in the case of woodland birds or grassland in the case of grassland butterflies. Such a strategy is likely to miss important variables in 𝐴 for some species, however, so it should only be used as a last resort. Another option might be to crowd-source information on the causes and effects of 𝑅 and 𝑌 from taxon and dataset experts. This strategy could work well for well-studied taxa such as butterflies, birds and mammals, but it will be more challenging for species whose autecology is less understood. It might also yield feedback from more than two experts per species (as here), which would be desirable.</p><p>Another question is how comprehensive the causal diagrams need to be. It might be sufficient to include direct causes of 𝑅 and 𝑌 and the causal links among those variables as we did here. However, there is a risk that including additional variables in the diagram, which do not do not directly affect 𝑅 or 𝑌, might reveal paths between them. For example, imagine the diagram broadleaved woodland → 𝑅; heather grassland → 𝑌. According to this diagram, 𝑅 and 𝑌 are independent, and there is no geographic bias. Now suppose that we construct a more comprehensive diagram that includes annual temperature as a cause of both broadleaved woodland (say, density) and heather grassland. Extending the diagram in this way reveals a path (i.e. a correlation) between 𝑌 and 𝑅 that would have been missed by including only direct causes of the two, and it would change the adjustment set 𝐴. Omitting variables whose effects on 𝑅 and 𝑌 are indirect is less problematic than omitting proximal ones, because indirect causes necessarily explain less of the variation in the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Grace &amp; Irvine, 2020)</ref>. Nevertheless, analysts should acknowledge that a more comprehensive causal diagram is more likely to yield the true set of variables in 𝐴, and this must be balanced against the increased effort required to construct it (also noting that a more comprehensive diagram might result in a more complex superpopulation model, which could increase its variance).</p><p>Having identified the variables in 𝐴, superpopulation models are just one of several methods that could be used to adjust for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boyd, Stewart, et al., 2023)</ref>. Alternatives include inverse probability weighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fink et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Johnston et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">), poststratification (Van Swaay et al., 2002)</ref> and others. Each of these methods can be recast mathematically as a means to eliminating the correlation between 𝑅 and 𝑌 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Meng, 2022)</ref>, but, crucially, they are only guaranteed to achieve this goal where the variables in 𝐴 have been identified correctly <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailey, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Alternative methods exist that do not require complete knowledge of or data on the variables in 𝐴, but their assumptions are challenging if not impossible to evaluate. It is becoming common to model geographic bias using spatial random fields, for example, which assign a value of sampling intensity to every location in the landscape based on spatial autocorrelation in the sampling locations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Simmonds et al., 2020)</ref>. Use of this approach essentially substitutes the assumption that 𝑅 and 𝑌 are independent given 𝐴 for the assumption that they are independent given the spatial field and other covariates in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Diggle et al., 2010)</ref>. Whether this assumption holds depends on whether the true variables in 𝐴 exhibit a consistent pattern of spatial autocorrelation across the landscape, which is not possible to verify without first identifying those variables.</p><p>It might seem like using causal diagrams and superpopulation models to estimate time trends in species' abundances requires stronger assumptions than traditional approaches (e.g. the GLM used by the UKBMS). Importantly, however, these non-parametric assumptions are codified explicitly in the form of causal diagrams (although parametric assumptions such as linear effects of covariates are not), whereas the assumptions of simpler approaches are often overlooked. When the goal is to draw landscape-scale inferences, using a model that does not adjust for geographic bias means assuming that it does not exist. Not only is this assumption untenable (we know that the UKBMS' and other biodiversity data are geographically biased), but it has the potential to introduce substantial estimation error if violated. As they make different assumptions, superpopulation models can be fitted in addition to conventional models as part of a sensitivity analysis (as in this paper). They can also be used as the primary method of analysis where there is clear risk of bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boyd et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
