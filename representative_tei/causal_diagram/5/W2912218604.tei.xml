<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study aimed to analyze the damage to the machine, look for the biggest trouble factor happen and the most important is the effect of the application of the concept of kaizen to skill up the performance of operators in CW machining maintenance division. In the analysis and handling of an engine failure, the authors use PDCA cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Action) and the application of kaizen to analyze it. From finding the highest cause of trouble that will be made the theme of improvement by collecting data on the check sheet engine trouble and Pareto diagram, analysis of existing conditions using 5W2H, causal analysis the occurrence of engine trouble using the fishbone chart, using the concept of kaizen, evaluation of the results, up to standardization and follow-up. From the analysis of damage to the machine and application FANUC machine kaizen concept, showed a decrease in engine trouble and the increase in skill up performance operator significantly, which is certainly very good impact in terms of engine performance. Of course the result is also impact both on the quality of the product that will be used by the customer</p></div>

The trouble Data presented in graphical form be am divided by type of machinery spare parts available   Of the few phenomena that damage occurs on the door of the machine, there is a kind of trouble that is very dominate in 2013. That trouble "Lever Door not return to its original position".  With the daily check sheet, then researchers collected data on all kinds of trouble group "Door" into a table. Below is a table of the damage that occurred in the group "door". Step 2 : Search for All Causes of Breakdown 9using tools Fishbone Chart) Furthermore, researchers perform data processing using tools fishbone diagram (Fish Bone Chart) to locate all causes -causes that resulted in damage "lever door not back to its original position" occurs. Below is a diagram fishbone / Fish Bone Chart result of data processing based on the data -field data as well as interviews to operators production and leader production who was in the field when the damage occurred, the researchers get. </p></div>

Movement of the door into drag (gap) for roller doors wear out. While the cause of roller experiencing wear, is because a lot of scrap coming into the roller area. So that the roller is made of nylon rubbing against the incoming scrap. Head lever door lock made of plastic experience wear and tear caused concussion with key switch made of iron plate. This is what causes head lever door lock lever does not return to its original position, after the door is opened.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1.3.">Method Factors</head><p>Repair trouble lever door lock does not return to its normal position requires a long time, because the position of the door lock unit itself is difficult to reach under normal circumstances and on a narrow position.

Once researchers get the kind of trouble damage data group "door", can be viewed insignificant that the trouble "Lever door lever does not return to the position of all" is changed to "alarm door not lock "a drop in the amount of time.

Researchers create a check sheet for checking part item cylinder lock door for all the machines Fanuc robodrill.</p><p>Check sheet serves to know the state part cylinder lock when the machine is operating. And check sheet is useful to know the life time part cylinder lock is used on the machine during operation. Checking performed 1 hour at rest hours work, and within a period of 1 month.
