<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>More organizations face a dynamic and changing environment, which further demands that organizations adjust. We live in an age of discontinuity where the past is a pretty good prologue to the future. In general, the concept of organizational change in Muhammadiyah Hospital refers to a series of efforts designed to change certain aspects of an organization such as identity, goals, structure, work processes, and human resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baykal, 2020)</ref>. Organizations always make changes to continue to survive, so that change is not an option but a necessity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gigliotti, Vardaman, Marshall, &amp; Gonzalez, 2019)</ref>. Changes made by an organization gradually and continuously can cause their performance to progress rapidly, to achieve success in the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baran, Filipkowski, &amp; Stockwell, 2019)</ref>. Organizational change is related to the concept of planned change and tends to focus on how change can be implemented in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lines, Sullivan, &amp; Wiezel, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>As a positive impact of this organization, there are now many hospitals, orphanages, and education places throughout Indonesia. The hospital is a professional healthcare institution whose services are provided by doctors, nurses, and other health professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Saralita &amp; Ardiyanti, 2020)</ref>. One of the hospitals, which is a positive result of the Muhammadiyah organization is the Muhammadiyah Hospital. Many Muhammadiyah Hospitals were established in Java and outside Java, a positive form of action by the Muhammadiyah organization. At present, Muhammadiyah has 104 hospitals and more than 300 clinics, seeing health services as a right of every citizen, so Muhammadiyah is trying to help the government expand Muhammadiyah health service units in the regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Malik, Budi Cantika Yuli, &amp; ., 2019)</ref>. However, the obstacle that is often faced is limited health workers, especially doctors. So the Muhammadiyah Organization, which has 10 Faculties of Medicine with an average of 700 graduates each year, seeks to establish a synergistic network between Hospitals, clinics, and the Faculty of Medicine in Muhammadiyah Higher Education to meet the availability of doctors in the regions. At present, Muhammadiyah hospitals in East Java are 38 hospitals spread across all cities and regencies in East Java. Muhammadiyah Hospital aims to support regional development by expanding employment (Ahmad, Soemanto, Drajat, &amp; Edi, 2019).</p><p>There are several factors, which contribute to the effectiveness of organizational changes that will be applied. One factor that plays an essential role in organizational change is the individual in the organization itself or its employees. The organization consists of several individuals who work together to achieve an organizational goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Batras, Duff, &amp; Smith, 2016)</ref>. It is essential for an organization to make changes to get support from employees who are open to preparing well and ready to change (Al-Hussami, Hammad, &amp; Alsoleihat, 2018). One factor of the individual is psychological capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pertiwi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roli &amp; Putra, 2020)</ref>. Psychological capital is a state of the positive development of individuals characterized by having confidence (self-efficacy), making positive attributions (optimism), directing goals (hope), and persisting (resiliency) in achieving success <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura &amp; Locke, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, researchers focused on the organization of Muhammadiyah Malang University Hospital that needs to pay attention to each of its hospitals' performance. Therefore, it is necessary to improve performance through planned and systematic changes using a human resource approach as a competitive advantage. Changes that can be implemented in the form of changes to the organizational structure to be more functional, and do job redesign to increase motivation and support the work process effectively. It also needs to be considered employee recruitment from internal sources through the job posting method, publicly announcing available positions, and open to all employees who meet the requirements for the position or recruiting new personnel needed by the contract system. Employee placement is no longer based on experience considerations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived organizational support (POS)</head><p>Perceived Organizational Support (POS) is a concept that describes an employee's assessment of organizational support <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lines et al., 2016)</ref>. In this case, employees assess whether the organization has management that takes into account the organization's vision, mission, and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kurtessis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muiruri, Kahuthia, &amp; Muraguri, 2019)</ref>. If the employee considers that the management of the organization has a concern for the organization's vision, mission, and goals, then the employee's perception of the organization is said to be a form of positive perception, in which the employee considers that the organization is concerned about the organization's vision, mission and objectives directly care about the presence of employees in it <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zehra &amp; Siddiqui, 2020)</ref>. Conversely, if the employee considers that the organization does not pay attention to the organization's vision, mission, and goals, then the employee considers the organization to have no exceptions to the employee <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kurtessis et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>POS not only emphasizes the employee's assessment of the organization's concern about the organization's vision, mission, and goals, but also emphasizes the employee's assessment of the organization's efforts to respect and place employees as the most important part in organizational management (Bakari, Hunjra, &amp; Niazi, 2017; Woiceshyn, Huq, Blades, &amp; Pendharkar, 2020). In this case, the organization's management pays attention to and fulfills the rights of employees by promoting the principles of fairness and equality. Therefore, organizations need to have regulations and organizational governance systems that foster a sense of comfort and ownership of the organization's employees so that employees have a high enthusiasm to realize organizational goals (Al-Hussami et al., 2018; Shah, Irani, &amp; Sharif, 2017). Organizations that can foster a sense of comfort and employee ownership of the organization have an impact on the growth of employee loyalty and loyalty to the organization, which then employees assume that the organization is part of their social identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gigliotti et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hussain et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In the context of POS, one of the indicators of organizational success is that the organization can convince and provide certainty for employees that the organization will carry out management that rewards employees who have good performance and achievements and influences the performance and acceleration of achieving organizational goals and targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fauzan, 2019)</ref>. In this case, organizational management needs to have a high commitment to giving rewards, salaries, incentives, and other facilities to employees who have performance and achievements. Furthermore, organizational commitment impacts the formation of employee commitment to achieving performance and performance that supports organizational productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ding &amp; Shen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kurtessis et al., 2017)</ref>. Organizations that reward employees' achievements have a positive impact on employees' assessment of the organization, where employees judge that the organization pays attention to employee performance and performance with professional treatment (Al-Hussami, Hamad, Darawad, &amp; Maharmeh, 2017; Kelly, Hegarty, Barry, Dyer, &amp; Horgan, 2018). Therefore, employees have a strong commitment and confidence to participate in making a positive contribution to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baran et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fauzan, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the explanation above, perceived organizational support (POS) is the key to supporting organizational success (DeConinck &amp; DeConinck, 2017; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kurtessis et al., 2017)</ref>. If the organization can present positive employee perceptions of organizational support, the organization will benefit from supporting a healthy organization, especially in the context of human resource management <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rockstuhl et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Xerri, Nelson, &amp; Brunetto, 2015)</ref>. Positive employee perceptions of organizational support are essential in creating a healthy organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gigliotti et al., 2019)</ref>. Forms of positive employee perceptions of organizational support, among others, are employees assuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Roli &amp; Putra, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Saralita &amp; Ardiyanti, 2020)</ref>. The organization has a high commitment to the organization's vision, mission, and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ullah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang &amp; Wang, 2020)</ref>. The organization has and runs regulations, systems, and management that can foster employee confidence and trust in justice and professionalism of the organization, and the organization pays attention to employee performance and Organizations that succeed in building positive employee perceptions of organizational support directly illustrate that the organization has adequate human resources, which then becomes capital for organizational acceleration and change in achieving organizational goals and targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baykal, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ding et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mugiono et al., 2020)</ref>. According to the organization's standards and targets, employees who have a positive perception of organizational support will carry out their roles and duties to the fullest. Besides, employees also have a commitment, confidence, and high loyalty to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kelly et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Saadeh &amp; Suifan, 2020)</ref>. Thus, employees strive to carry out their roles professionally in supporting the acceleration of achieving targets and good organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Allaoui &amp; Benmoussa, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fauzan, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, organizational support's positive employee perceptions make it easier for organizational management to encourage and encourage employees to support organizational change, both system changes, regulations, and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ding &amp; Shen, 2017)</ref>. In this case, employees believe that organizational change is an effort to create a performance that supports the organization's interests, including supporting the interests of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baran et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Positive employee perceptions of organizational support (perceived organizational support / POS) can generate positive benefits for the organization, including, commitment, fairness, ownership, and good employee performance, all of which have an impact on organizational performance and exemplary achievements (DeConinck &amp; DeConinck, 2017; Mrayyan, 2019). In addition, POS also produces comfort for the organization and employees in the organization's management process, where employees have confidence and confidence in organizational commitment, conversely, the organization has confidence in the commitment of employees in carrying out their duties and roles in a professional and totality <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kurtessis et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In the context of organizational change, POS encourages employees to support organizational change, in which employees are involved in every stage and process of organizational change, such as supporting ideas and ideas for change, being involved in making the decision on change, and participating in implementing organizations that support organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rockstuhl et al., 2020)</ref>. POS makes it easy for organizations to direct employees to participate and support organizational change, in which case the organization does not get employee resistance to ideas, ideas, plans, and activities of organizational change because employees believe that organizational change is in the interest of the organization, including employee interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Xerri et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-efficacy to organizational change</head><p>Self-efficacy is a construct proposed by Bandura based on social cognitive theory. In his theory, human action is a reciprocal relationship between individuals, the environment, and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura &amp; Locke, 2003)</ref>. Personal resources are selfassessment related to the individual's endurance and feelings towards his ability to control and influence his environment (van Woerkom, Oerlemans, &amp; Bakker, 2016). Self-efficacy is an important component of social cognitive theory, which indicates that individual behavior, the environment, and cognitive factors (for example, expectations of results and selfefficacy) have a high relationship. Self-efficacy is the ability of consideration possessed by a person to carry out certain patterns of behavior (Stajkovic, Bandura, Locke, Lee, &amp; Sergent, 2018).</p><p>Self-efficacy is a belief in one's ability to carry out tasks. People who are confident in their abilities tend to succeed, whereas people who always feel like fail tend to fail. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bandura &amp; Locke (2003)</ref> revealed that individuals who have high self-efficacy would achieve a better performance because they have strong motivation, clear goals, stable emotions, and the ability to successfully perform activities or behaviors. Different individuals with low self-efficacy who will tend not to try or prefer cooperation in difficult situations and high levels of task complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dehghani et al., 2020)</ref>. Self-efficacy is an individual's belief in facing and solving the problems he faces in various situations and determining actions in completing a particular task or problem so that the individual can overcome obstacles and achieve the expected goals/performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura &amp; Locke, 2003)</ref>. In this study, Self-efficacy is defined as the operational manager's confidence in his ability to improve his performance.</p><p>Bandura &amp; Locke (2003) provides a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the main sources of self-efficacy. According to its importance, self-efficacy sources are as follows: mastery experience or performance achievement, personal experience or modeling, social persuasion, and physical and psychological improvement. The process of self-efficacy affects human function directly and has an indirect effect on other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Yoo &amp; Cho, 2020</ref>). The Self-efficacy process begins before individuals choosing their choice to begin their efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nguyen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pertiwi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roli &amp; Putra, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readiness employee to organizational change</head><p>The theory of organizational change confirms that an organization is considered successful if it is able to make changes, both changes in aspects of the system, management, regulation, and cultural changes that support the development of internal and In the theory of organizational change, change readiness is the most important concept to consider in organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haque et al., 2016)</ref>. Change readiness or in Lewis perspective called unfreeze is the first step that supports organizational change, where at this stage, the organization seeks to build trust and convince employees that the change to be made is an organization's effort to realize shared interests and prosperity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hussain et al., 2018)</ref>. Organizational success creates awareness and willingness of employees (change readiness) to accept and support change is the key to an organization's success in making organizational changes successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rochmi &amp; Hidayat, 2019)</ref>. Conversely, an organization's failure to create change readiness or failure to unfreeze is a sign of organizational failure in making organizational changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Thakur &amp; Srivastava, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Change employee readiness is defined as the beliefs, attitudes, and exceptions of employees towards organizational change, where it is all needed to support the success and success of organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kurtessis et al., 2017)</ref>. In this context, organizations need to make active efforts to provide understanding and confidence of employees that the organization needs to make changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Smollan, 2017)</ref>, where the change to be made an effort to present a healthy organization, that is, an organization that is effectively realizing its goals and targets as well as a professional and fair organization in placing employees as the capital of the organization <ref type="bibr">(</ref> Some other researchers say that change readiness does not necessarily describe employee acceptance of the organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Thakur &amp; Srivastava, 2018)</ref>. In this case, change readiness, in addition to describing the behavior and attitude of employee acceptance of change, also describes the behavior and attitude of employee rejection of organizational change (Al-Hussami et al., 2017). Therefore, change readiness needs to be seen from the achievements or results of organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gigliotti et al., 2019)</ref>. If the organizational change goes well, that is according to the wishes of the organization, employee acceptance of changes is very high, on the contrary, if organizational changes do not go well, that is, changes activities are not significant, then employee rejection of changes is very high <ref type="bibr">(</ref> Employee acceptance of change is supportive behavior and employee commitment to the change that is about to occur, where it shows that the employee has high confidence and awareness to accept the change that is about to take place in an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Purwaningrum, Suhariadi, &amp; Fajrianthi, 2020)</ref>. Employee acceptance and participation in change impacts the success of the change itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lines et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, employees need to facilitate and contribute to the planning of changes made by the organization, because this then becomes an indicator of the success of change readiness to organizational change (Al-Hussami et al., 2018). Change readiness depends on employee acceptance of changes. Meanwhile, employee acceptance of change depends on organizational support that can convince employees that changes need to be made <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Thakur &amp; Srivastava, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head><p>This research is a part of descriptive quantitative research, which describes the effect of self-efficacy on statistically and perceives organizational support (POS) to change employees' readiness at the University of Muhammadiyah Malang Hospital (UMM). Muhammadiyah University Hospital Malang is a hospital managed by the Muhammadiyah University of Malang, a private university in Indonesia, part of the Muhammadiyah business charity. Muhammadiyah is the largest and oldest Islamic organization in Indonesia. The UMM Hospital was inaugurated in 2013, which has since been providing medical services to date. The hospital is classified as a young age who seeks to build a system and organizational culture that supports the implementation of health services according to the organization's vision and goals.</p><p>The location of UMM hospital is on Jalan Tlogomas No. 45, Tlogomas, Lowokwaru, Babatan, Tegalgondo, Karangploso, Malang, East Java, Indonesia. The population in this study were non-medical hospital employees totaling 129 employees. The sample used was 129 medical and non-medical hospital employees. The sampling technique used is total sampling, which uses all populations as samples in the study. The reason for using the total sampling technique is non-medical employees of the UMM hospital only amounted to 129 people, where this number did not meet the requirements for applying the sampling technique, i.e., the total population must reach 129 people.</p><p>Sources of data used in this study are primary data and secondary data. Primary data is data obtained directly from the source. The primary data in this study were data from 129 employees of UMM Hospital. At the same time, secondary data can be obtained from the website. Data collection techniques used are using questionnaires. Variable measurement techniques using a Likert scale with the lowest score of 1 strongly disagree to the highest score of a score of 5 strongly agree. The questionnaire was distributed to 129 respondents that are medical and non-medical employees directly. The testing of the instrument used the validity test and the reliability test. The sampling technique used is the non-probability sampling technique, which is a sampling technique that does not provide equal opportunity for each element or member of the population to be sampled. The data analysis technique uses path analysis SPSS software. Path analysis technique will be used in testing the amount of contribution shown by the path coefficient on each path diagram of the causal relationship between variables X1, X2, and X3 on Y and its impact on Z.</p><p>From the following variables Self-efficacy (X1), Perceived Organizational (X2) and Change Readiness (Y), in this study the hypotheses that will be tested one by one include Effect of Self-efficacy (X1) on Change Readiness (Y), Effect of Perceived Organizational (X2) on Change readiness (Y), Effect of Perceived Organizational (X2) on Self Efficacy (X1), and Effect of X2 on Y through X1. Testing between variables using regression analysis. Where, if the regression analysis is generally used to test whether there is a direct effect given by the independent variable on the dependent variable. Meanwhile, path analysis does not only test the direct effect but also explains whether or not there is an indirect effect provided by the independent variable through the intervening variable on the dependent variable. The regression analysis results can be seen in the results in the coefficient table, this shows that the value used in the regression analysis lies in the regression coefficient value or B. (Y = a + bX1 + bX2), while in path analysis the value used is the value located in beta which forms the equation (Y1 = PYX1 + PYX2 + Py1.e1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> reveals that the R-Square value in Model 1 (Line I) is 0.545. This value explains that Change Readiness at the University of Muhammadiyah Malang Hospital is influenced by self-efficacy and perceived organizational. Meanwhile, the remaining value, namely 100% -54.5% = 45.5%, is the influence of other independent variables that were not considered in the study such as leadership, trust, and justice. The R-square value is used to determine how much influence the independent variable contributes to the dependent variable. The results of the path model for each research variable can be seen in the table below. Based on the path model formed in table 2, it is known that the path constant is positive at 10.317, which shows that the higher the self-efficacy provided and perceived organizational, the higher the change readiness by the employees of the University of Muhammadiyah Malang Hospital. The self-efficacy path coefficient is positive at 0.381, which confirms that the higher the self-efficacy is given, the higher the change readiness. As for each increase in the self-efficacy unit, it can increase the change readiness by 0.381 units. The path coefficient for perceived organizational is positive at 0.412, which value explains that the higher the perceived organizational value, the higher the change readiness. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> reveals that the direct effect of perceived organizational on change readiness is 0.412, while the indirect effect of perceived organizational on change readiness through self-efficacy as an intervening variable is 0.279. These findings indicate that the direct effect of perceived organizational on change readiness is higher than the indirect effect of perceived organizational on change readiness through self-efficacy as an intervening variable. The increase in perceived value will increase the change readiness directly by 0.412 units in each unit. At the same time, the increase in perceived organizational units through self-efficacy has an effect on the increase in change readiness by 0.279 units. Therefore, the effect of total perceived organizational on change readiness is 0.691. significance level of 5% (α = 0.05). A mediator is proven to be an intervening variable that mediates the independent variable's effect on the dependent variable if the Sobell test statistic is greater than the Normal Z-score and the Two-Tailed probability value is smaller than the significance level (α = 0.05). The following shows the results of the Sobell Test (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>

This value proves that the self-efficacy variable is an intervening variable that is able to mediate the effect of perceived organizational on change readiness of employees at the University of Muhammadiyah Malang Hospital.</p><p>These results indicate that the effect of perceived organizational support on readiness to change will be greater if through self-efficacy mediators, compared to the direct effect of perceived organizational support on readiness to change without going through mediators of self-efficacy. This shows that, the contribution of self-efficacy as a positive mediator. The value of the effect of perceived organizational support through self-efficacy is greater than the direct effect of perceived organizational support on readiness to change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This research revealed that perceived organizational support (POS) and self-efficacy positively influence on the change readiness of employees in the University of Muhammadiyah Malang Hospital (UMM). These results indicate that the effect of perceived organizational support on readiness to change will be greater if through self-efficacy mediators, compared to the direct effect of perceived organizational support on readiness to change without going through mediators of self-efficacy. This shows that, the contribution of self-efficacy as a positive mediator. The value of the effect of perceived organizational support through self-efficacy is greater than the direct effect of perceived organizational support on readiness to change. This finding confirms that POS and self-efficacy has an essential role in shaping the The UMM hospital organization seeks to formulate regulations and organizational management systems that promote fairness and career certainty of employees, which are built based on the principle of professionalism, where careers depend on each employee's achievements and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baran et al., 2019)</ref>. The hospital's regulation and management system established is conveyed and communicated to employees so that employees can understand the direction of organizational change, namely the change in the organization of UMM hospitals aimed at realizing healthy organizational governance, namely governance that pays attention to and promotes the principles of fairness and professionalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lines et al., 2016)</ref>. The efforts of the UMM hospital had a positive impact on change readiness, in which employees accepted and supported the organizational change, i.e., they believed and believed that the change in the organization of UMM hospitals, namely aimed at the common good, both organizational and employee interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Caesens et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Another factor influencing UMM hospital employees' change readiness is the efforts of the leadership or pioneers of organizational hospital changes that involve employees in formulating ideas for change and implementing programs and activities that support organizational change. Employee involvement or participation in organizational change activities has an impact on growing awareness, trust, and responsibility of employees for programs and activities that support change <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haque et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, the factor of employee participation and involvement is one factor contributing to POS's positive influence on UMM hospital employees' change readiness.</p><p>Employee acceptance of the changes in the organization of UMM hospitals is also part of the manifestation of the organization's commitment to the needs of employees, who want employers to care about the incentives and rewards given to employees equitably (Al-Hussami et al., 2018). In this case, the employer or the pioneer of organizational change at UMM hospitals gave good attention to the appropriateness of incentives and rewards for all UMM hospital employees, where superiors conducted periodic evaluations of employee performance, which then the results of the performance evaluation were used as the basis for increasing incentives and giving appreciation for employees (Al-Hussami et al., 2018). The efforts of UMM hospital supervisors have a positive impact on employees' commitment to accept and support changes that lead to the achievement of the vision, goals, and targets of UMM hospital organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mrayyan, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Employees' confidence in organizational change at UMM hospital is a form of actualization of change readiness in each employee, where this illustrates the level of good acceptance from employees towards organizational change at UMM hospital <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lines et al., 2016)</ref>. Employees' confidence and confidence in changes is the most decisive indicator and influences changes in an organization, where this is the most important stage in the effort to establish POS that affects employee change readiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kurtessis et al., 2017)</ref>. A number of studies have revealed that organizational failure shapes employees' beliefs and beliefs about change is a form of organizational failure to make changes, where organizations do not get employee support to realize the idea of change and implement programs and activities that support organizational change (Jabbarian &amp; Chegini, 2017; Thakur &amp; Srivastava, 2018).</p><p>As described above, the findings of this study confirm that the perception of organizational support has a positive effect on change readiness, in which employees accept organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haque et al., 2016)</ref>. Employee acceptance of organizational change is inseparable from the support and commitment of the organization to the interests of the organization and the interests of employees, which is shown by the organization in the form of concern for the achievement of the organization's vision, goals, and targets, commitment to fairness and professionalism, and superiors commitment to the appropriateness of incentives and giving appreciation for employees who show high commitment to organizational change (Al-Hussami et al., 2018). Therefore, change readiness shows that UMM hospital employees have the attention, confidence, and trust in organizational change, which is expected to lead to the achievement of change goals, namely changes that support the interests of the organization and the interests of employees in it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on an analysis of the effect of the perception of organizational support and self-efficacy on change readiness, the following conclusions are drawn that self-efficacy is the perception of organizational support can influence readiness change readiness. Self-efficacy also mediates the relationship between perceived organizational support and willingness to change.</p><p>The findings of this study indicate that organizational change needs to be initiated by preparing organizational support for the interests of the organization and the interests of employees, where the support affects the formation of employee change readiness, which then becomes the strength of the organization in making organizational changes that support the achievement of more significant organizational interests. In this case, organizational commitment to change is the essential factor to put forward in building employee commitment, confidence, and trust in change, which in turn encourages employees to be actively involved in every stage of activities that support organizational change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATION AND STUDY FORWARD</head><p>This study has limitations on using descriptive statistical data that have not explained the indicators of perceived organizational support (POS), which most influence the change readiness of employees at UMM hospitals. Therefore, subsequent studies need to explain the POS indicators that most influence change readiness by using the mix methods research approach, where quantitative approaches are used to describe the role of POS in shaping change readiness, while the qualitative approach is used to explain the role and contribution of POS to change readiness, employee behavior and attitudes towards change, and symbiotic relationships between change pioneers and employees.</p></div>

Conversely, organizations that are considered fail are organizations that are unwilling or unable to make changes to respond to demands and internal and external interests of the organization (Al-Hussami et al., 2018;<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Haque et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, change in an organization is the most important thing to do, both profit organizations and non-profit organizations. Organizations that realize the importance of change will make efforts that support the change itself<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kurtessis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mrayyan, 2019)</ref>.Organizational support for change is the most determining factor for organizational change (Caesens, Marique, Hanin, &amp; Stinglhamber, 2016; Jabbarian &amp; Chegini, 2017). In this case, organizational awareness to change is the key to change. Because with that awareness, the organization prepares support for the occurrence of change, where the support is prepared, one of which determines the readiness and willingness of employees to support and play a role in the process of organizational change<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rochmi &amp; Hidayat, 2019)</ref>. In this case, organizational change needs to start with the organization's efforts to convince employees that the change to be made is an organizational step to create a healthy, professional, and fair organization for the interests of the organization, including the interests of employees<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haque et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jabbarian &amp; Chegini, 2017)</ref>.</figDesc></figure>

Kurtessis et al., (2017) said that change readiness is the attitude and behavior of employees accepting and supporting organizational change, which is shown in the form of actions that support change, such as complying with new organizational rules, mechanisms, culture, and management.</figDesc></figure>

Therefore, organizational change's success and failure are very dependent on the change readiness of employees, whether there is employee acceptance of changes or vice versa. Before making changes, organizations need to ensure that employee acceptance of changes is very high (Al-Hussami et al., 2018).<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lines et al., (2016)</ref> explain that change readiness of employees, namely the behavior of individuals or members of organizations that accept or reject ideas, plans, or activities that support organizational change. In this case, Lines et al. emphasized that change readiness is a concept to explain employees' attitudes and behavior in accepting or rejecting organizational change.<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lines et al. (2016)</ref> emphasized that the success of organizational change needs to be supported by employee awareness to accept organizational change. Employee acceptance of change determines the success of the organization in making changes. On the contrary, the employee's rejection of change impacts on the organization's failure to make changes (Qureshi, Waseem, Qureshi &amp; Afshan, 2018).</figDesc></figure>

In this case, employees of the University of Muhammadiyah Malang Hospital (UMM) considered that the organization of the UMM hospital had a high commitment to organizational changes that involved employees and paid attention to the interests of the organization, including the interests and needs of employees<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura &amp; Locke, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mrayyan, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rochmi &amp; Hidayat, 2019)</ref>.The positive effect of POS and self-efficacy on the change readiness of UMM hospital employees also showed that UMM hospital organizations tried to convince and build employee confidence in organizational change, including showing commitment to the organization's vision and targets<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Purwaningrum et al., 2020)</ref>, promoting the principles of fairness and professionalism in the employee career system, involve employees in the process of change, and show the commitment and loyalty of the leadership of the organization to the interests, rights, and needs of employees in carrying out their respective duties and responsibilities (Al-Hussami et al., 2018; Gigliotti et al., 2019). The positive influence of POS on the change readiness confirms that POS plays an important role in the formation of awareness and readiness of employees to accept Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Reviews eISSN: 2395-6518, Vol 8, No 5, 2020, pp 199-209 https://doi.org/10.18510/hssr.2020.8519 organizational change, which is also inseparable from the support of UMM hospital organizations (Kurtessis et al., 2017; Zehra &amp; Siddiqui, 2020). The admission of UMM hospital employees to organizational change is a direct influence of the support or leadership of the UMM hospital change on the organization's interests and employee rights (Al-Hussami et al., 2018; Stajkovic et al., 2018), where the leadership or pioneer of organizational change in UMM hospitals tried to encourage all elements of the organization to focus on achieving the goals and targets of the organization (Baran et al., 2019; Rahman &amp; Kholidi Hadi, 2019). In this case, the leader of the UMM hospital played a role in formulating the goals and targets of the organization in which it led to the principles of good hospital governance, namely paying attention to the values of humanity, religion, and justice (Mäkikangas, Mauno, Selenko, &amp; Kinnunen, 2019). This finding confirms that UMM hospital employees have great attention and exceptions to the vision, goals, targets, humanity, religious values, justice, and employee interests (Kurtessis et al., 2017).</figDesc></figure>
