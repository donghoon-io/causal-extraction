<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hearing loss (HL) constitute significant public health challenges worldwide. Recently, the association between T2DM and HL has aroused attention.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Hearing loss (HL) is a prevalent sensory impairment disease that affects approximately 430 million people around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the common hearing disorders facing general practitioners and otolaryngologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Although AOM mostly occurs in children, the incidence rate of AOM in adults is around 5/1000 person-years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM) is a subtype of AOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. ASOM often presents with fever, otalgia, ear purulence, tympanic membrane congestion, and tympanic perforation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Persistent ASOM can turn into chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and cause HL <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Untreated patients with CSOM may also develop further serious complications, including potentially lethal otitic meningitis and brain abscess <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</p><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Long-term hyperglycemia can lead to chronic damage and dysfunction of various organs, especially kidneys, blood vessels, nerves, and eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. It is reported that the number of DM patients worldwide will increase to 783 million by 2045 as the escalating global prevalence of DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 90%-95% of DM patients. T2DM results from a complex inheritance-environment interaction along with other risk factors such as age, obesity, and physical inactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. T2DM is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19)</ref>. Patients with T2DM are always complicated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and digestive tract dysfunction due to metabolic disorders and decreased resistance, which seriously affect the quality of life of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(20)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted a greater incidence of HL in DM patients compared to nondiabetic patients, and revealed a direct correlation between the severity of DM and the extent of HL <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref>. Patients with T2DM have shown both HL and vestibular dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(24)</ref>. It has also been shown that the insulin/glucose signaling pathology in T2DM can lead to inner ear pathology and accompanying HL <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(25)</ref>. However, other studies suggested that the association between DM and HL does not exist when age, sex, and hypertension were taken into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref>. The causal associations between T2DM and HL remain ambiguous.</p><p>Mendelian randomization (MR) is a type of instrumental variables (IVs) analysis, which has been increasingly used in observational studies in recent years. MR uses independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with strong associations with exposure as IVs, facilitating to estimate of causal associations between exposure and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref>. This effectively minimizes the potential residual confounding factors and other biases inherent in studies with an observational design.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the association between T2DM and 10 distinct types of HL disorders (conductive HL, sensorineural HL, mixed conductive and sensorineural HL, otitis externa (OE), otitis media (OM), ASOM, nonsuppurative OM, perforation of the tympanic membrane, hearing difficulty/problems with background noise, and sudden idiopathic HL) with T2DM. Univariate and multivariate MR analysis was used to examine the association between T2DM from two databases and 10 common types of HL disorders.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Genetic instrumental variables selection</head><p>The overall design of the MR analysis in this study is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This MR study utilized GWAS data for T2DM in European populations, categorized according to the ICD-10 standards, from the consortium NHGRI-EBI, for first validation. The data originated from a cross-population GWAS meta-analysis of genetic associations across 220 human phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(27)</ref>. We further repeated verification through DIAGRAM consortium data, a GWAS study that performed a meta-analysis of genetic variants in T2DM involving nearly 150,000 people, the vast majority of whom were of European ancestry <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28)</ref>. More information about the exposure is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In this MR analysis, we employed SNPs that exhibit robust associations (defined by a genome-wide significance threshold of P&lt; 5×10 -8 ) with T2DM as IVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(29)</ref>. We meticulously selected these IVs to ensure minimal linkage disequilibrium, setting the correlation coefficient threshold to r²&lt; 0.001 and adopted a clumping window exceeding 10,000kb to guarantee the independence of the IVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref>. To address potential confoundersnamely sleep patterns, alcohol consumption, smoking, and body mass indexwhich could impact exposure or outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(36)</ref>, we utilized the PhenoScanner tool (<ref type="url" target="http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/">http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/</ref>) to identify and subsequently exclude any SNPs linked to these confounding factors (P&lt; 5×10 -8 ). During the statistical harmonization process between exposure and outcome data, we meticulously removed palindromic SNPs incompatible with our analysis and SNPs directly associated with the outcomes under study. Additionally, we excluded SNPs with available exposure data but lacking corresponding outcome information. To address and minimize the potential bias from weak IVs, we calculated the F-statistic for each IV using the formula F exposure = Beta 2 exposure SE 2 exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(37)</ref>. IVs exhibiting F-statistics less than 10 were systematically excluded from our analysis to mitigate the risk of bias associated with weak IVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(38)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data sources of hearing disorders</head><p>Details of the outcomes (10 types of hearing disorders) can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Data on nine of these hearing disorders were sourced from the FinnGen database, an extensive public-private consortium dedicated to the amalgamation and analysis of genetic and health data from approximately 500,000 participants in Finnish biobanks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(39)</ref>. The data on "hearing difficulty/problems with background noise" as one of the types of HL disorders came from the Medical Research Council Integrated Epidemiology Unit (MRC-IEU). Participants in this study were asked on an ACE touchscreen, "Do you find it difficult to hear conversations if there is background noise, such as from a television, radio, or children playing?"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Statistical analyses</head><p>In our analysis, we applied the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) approach as the principal analytical method <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. The selection between fixed-effect (IVW-FE) and random-effect (IVW-RE) models was contingent on Cochrane's Q heterogeneity test outcomes: IVW-RE was used in cases of detected heterogeneity (P&lt; 0.05) to provide conservative estimates, while the IVW-FE model was employed in the absence of such heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, our analysis incorporated two supplementary MR methodologies: MR-Egger and weighted median, to bolster result credibility and ascertain causality direction. MR-Egger was used when assuming substantial horizontal pleiotropy among over half of the IVs, whereas the weighted median approach assumes less extensive pleiotropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. Causality was inferred only when consistent effects were observed across all employed MR methods, supplemented by significant findings from IVW analysis, thus ensuring a robust and concise evaluation of the studied associations. Furthermore, for sensitivity analysis, horizontal pleiotropy was assessed using the MR-Egger intercept's P-value <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>. The significance of the intercept was determined by its P-value, which indicates whether there is a pattern of pleiotropy that could bias the causal estimates. Also, we incorporated the MR-PRESSO distortion test to check the consistency of MR estimates after excluding potential pleiotropic outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. This test identified and corrected for outliers in the IVs analysis that could be attributed to pleiotropy and the subsequent recalculations, thereby ensuring the robustness of our findings against such biases. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the impact of each individual SNP on the overall MR estimation, which involves recalculating the causal effect with one SNP removed at a time. Significant alterations in MR estimates upon SNP exclusion suggest potential biases, whereas stable results across variations indicate robust findings.</p><p>Multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) extends the conventional MR analysis to enable the simultaneous assessment of multiple exposures on an outcome, proving invaluable for adjusting potential confounders and exploring the collective impact of several exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. In this study, we considered four significant confounders: sleep duration, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and smoking status.</p><p>Upon compiling GWAS summary datasets for T2DM and the aforementioned confounders, we verified that each IV maintained a strong association (P&lt; 5x10 -8 ) with at least one exposure or confounder. To mitigate the effects of linkage disequilibrium, SNPs were pruned within a 10,000 kb window with an r 2 threshold of&lt; 0.001. The IVW method was then utilized to discern the causal effects, post exclusion of palindromic SNPs and those absent in the outcome data, while accounting for the identified confounders, ensuring a refined and methodologically sound approach to our MVMR analysis.</p><p>Statistical significance was set at a threshold of P&lt; 0.05. The outcomes of the causal relationships were expressed in terms of odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). These procedures were implemented using the "TwoSampleMR" (version 0.5.6) and "MRPRESSO" (version 1.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51)</ref> tools in R software (version 4.2.3), ensuring a concise yet comprehensive analysis.</p></div>

The univariate MR analysis from the NHGRI-EBI and DIAGRAM consortium supports a significant causal association between T2DM and an elevated risk for ASOM. Furthermore, multivariable MR analyses, adjusted for genetically predicted sleep duration, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and smoking, continue to demonstrate a positive causal relationship between T2DM and ASOM. However, a causal link between T2DM and other hearing disorders was either observed only in analyses from a single source or not detected at all. Our study is the first to reveal the relationship between ASOM and T2DM with causal evidence. It has been reported that in the process of DM and its complications, the body will produce a persistent inflammatory response due to immune cell dysfunction and inflammatory pathway activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(52)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>. Patients with DM have hyperglycemia for a long time, which leads to increased plasma osmolarity and inhibition of leukocyte activity (55). In the middle ear (ME) of diabetic patients, inhibition of leukocyte activity leads to a decrease in the internal killing, phagocytosis, and adhesion of leukocytes, which increases the risk of infection. In addition, T2DM is often accompanied by microangiopathy, which is characterized by structural alterations of the capillary walls including thickening of the basement membrane and increased permeability of capillary vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>. The thickened basement membrane of the capillary wall reduces blood flow to certain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60)</ref>. Capillary damage leads to tissue ischemia and hypoxia, and metabolic disorder. Reducing the normal intake of calories and proteins impairs immune function and reduces antibody production, which in turn inhibits the ability to clear invading pathogens and increases the risk of infection. This may be one of the reasons why T2DM increases the risk of ASOM.</p><p>ASOM is a purulent lesion caused by pyogenic bacteria invading the tympanic mucosa through the eustachian tube (ET). ET is a complex structure connecting the middle ear cavity to the nasopharynx <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(61)</ref>, and eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is considered to be associated with most ME pathologies, although the mechanism of its role in ME diseases is still unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63)</ref>. Recently, the important functions of surfactant protein (SP) in the body have received increasing attention from different specialists. Studies have confirmed the presence of surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) in the human ET <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(64)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(65)</ref><ref type="bibr">(66)</ref>. As the major protein component of surfactant, SP-A plays an important role in innate and acquired immune processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref>. When inflammation occurs, SP-A can promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells, the activation of phagocytic cells, or directly kill pathogens, thereby preventing pathogen infection, regulating allergic reactions, and alleviating inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. This suggests that SP-A may enhance the resistance of ET to infection by participating in immune defense. In adult gerbils and mice, intranasal application of aerosolized metered dose inhaler surfactant reduced the severity and duration of ME infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>. In addition, SP-A plays a key role in the working process of ET. ETD impairs the clearance of inflammatory products and secretions in the ME and ET by affecting the mucociliary system of ET <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>. Recent studies have also shown that SP-D gene polymorphism (rs721917) was associated with gestational DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref>, and the serum SP-D was found to have negative association with extra-pulmonary infections in T2DM patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(73)</ref>. Therefore, it can be speculated that if the expression of SP in the ET changes, it may lead to the exacerbation of ASOM. This may be another potential mechanism by which T2DM increases the risk of ASOM. However, current studies only shown changes in the expression of SP. The associations between SP, ASOM and ET function have not been investigated. More experimental models are needed to demonstrate the possible mechanisms by which T2DM promotes the development of ASOM by affecting SP.</p><p>Our study shows several predominant strengths. Firstly, the causal relationship between T2DM and ASOM was revealed by MR for the first time. MR analysis design can avoid the influence of reverse causation and residual confounding in the process of exploring the causal association between T2DM and ASOM. In addition, the GWAS summary data of T2DM were obtained from two independent European populations, this non-overlapping exposure can avoid the possible bias. Finally, sensitivity analyses with various approaches support the robustness of our MR results. However, there are several certain limitations in our study. The GWAS data of the majority of participants in our study came from European, which makes our results avoid population heterogeneity while also may not be entirely applicable to subjects in other populations. Second, because of the limitations of summarized GWAS data, stratified analyses based on common factors (such as age, sex, hypertension, etc.) could not be performed in our study.</p><p>Our findings provide important insights into understanding and preventing diabetes-related complications, particularly ear infections. These findings offer significant insights into understanding and preventing T2DM complications, particularly in the realm of ear infections. They also provide valuable reference information for public health strategies and individual medical decision-making, highlighting the importance and necessity of considering T2DM as a potential risk factor in managing and preventing such complications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In summary, our study is the first to reveal the relationship of T2DM and ASOM with causal evidence. The univariate MR analysis from the NHGRI-EBI and DIAGRAM consortium supports a causal association between T2DM and an increased risk of ASOM. MVMR analyses adjusted for confounders continue to demonstrate this association. However, a causal link between T2DM and other hearing disorders was either observed only in analyses from a single source or not detected at all. To further confirm and elucidate the biological mechanisms underpinning the association between T2DM and ASOM, more experimental models are need to perform in future studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1</figDesc><graphic coords="3,113.56,88.84,368.50,407.23" type="bitmap" /></figure>
