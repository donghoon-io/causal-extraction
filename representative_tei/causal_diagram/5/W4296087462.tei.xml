<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Based on the accident causation theory, the mechanism and inducement of construction safety risk in mining enterprises are clarified. The safety risk system of mining enterprises is divided into five subsystems : personnel, material equipment, technology, environment and management by rough set theory. The comprehensive weight of each risk factor is calculated by network analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Taking a mine in Shanxi Province as the research object, the causal traceability diagram and flow stock diagram of the risk system of mining enterprises are constructed by means of system dynamics model. The influence of various risk factors of the mine on the overall safety risk management level of the enterprise is simulated, and the numerical value of key technology influence factors is adjusted. The sensitivity changes of safety productivity and safety risk management level of mining enterprises in different situations are analyzed. The results show that: (1) The management and personnel subsystem has the greatest impact on the safety risk management of mining enterprises, followed by the technology, material equipment and environment subsystem. (2) Increasing safety input can improve the safety level and reduce the expected safety value time, otherwise it will reduce the safety level and delay the expected safety value time. (3) Further simulation of the technical subsystem, it is found that the factors affecting the safety level of mining enterprises are construction survey and monitoring, support structure, construction design, mining scheme and engineering technology application. (4) The conversion rate of safety technology input to engineering technology application and construction exploration and monitoring shows a "W" type development trend of decline-rise-slow decline-slow rise, mainly because the benefits of safety input have certain time delay and lag.</p></div>

This means that the development direction of coal resource in time adjustment will become the first content of the future low carbon development strategy of our country. Therefore, mining enterprises must quickly identify the various risk factors that affect the economic benefits and safety level of enterprises, and find the production and operation management mode suitable for the development of mining enterprises themselves, so as to improve the overall economic benefits of mining enterprises.

In addition, the existing risk assessment models tend to view the problem subjectively and statically, and there are few studies on identifying technical risk factors according to different stages of the whole life cycle and conducting simulation prediction analysis on them, which leads to insufficient dynamics of risk assessment. In view of the existing research, there are few literatures on the economic risk and simulation caused by safety technology in the whole life cycle of mining enterprises, which is still in the exploratory analysis stage. On the basis of existing research and from the perspective of multidisciplinary theory, this paper analyzes the internal and external risk drivers in the whole life cycle of mining enterprises, and draws the causality tracing diagram and flow stock diagram of the risk system of mining enterprises by using the system, dynamic and nonlinear characteristics of the system dynamics model. To simulate the impact of each risk factor in the case mine on the overall safety risk management level of the enterprise, and adjust the value of key technology impact factors, analyze the sensitivity changes of safety productivity and safety risk management level of mining enterprises under different circumstances, and clarify the risk-driving mechanism of the enterprise, in order to provide a more accurate risk assessment basis for the case mining enterprises and similar high-risk enterprises.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unit decomposition</head><p>The production and operation of mining enterprises is a complex, dynamic and nonlinear opening process. Enterprise operation risk is driven by external risk factors such as policy and legal risk, environmental risk, and internal risk factors such as technological risk, economic risk, schedule risk and management risk. In order to accurately control the safety input in the whole life cycle of mine, the whole cycle is divided into units. Combining with the actual mine operation situation in China, the whole life cycle of mine can be divided into the stage of exploration and construction, the stage of mine production, the stage of mine reconstruction and expansion, and the stage of scrap treatment <ref type="bibr">(Kocsis. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hitch et al. 2014)</ref> </p></div>

Forrester of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in U.S.A. SD is a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis method. It is a dynamic evaluation method based on complex feedback theory and computer simulation technology. It can not only analyze the influence links of risks on projects and the internal influence relationship between risks in complex systems, but also analyze risks dynamically <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cooke. 2010)</ref>. Using SD theory and method to construct the dynamic evaluation model of safety risk in mining enterprises can well realize the integrity which base on causal loop diagram and stock flow diagram, the continuity by means of simulation analysis, the intuitiveness by the final simulation comparison diagram.</p><p>In view of the complex and abstract nature of the safety production system of mining enterprises, directly fitting the collected key technical risk factors into the SD will make the risk system redundant, resulting in insufficient dynamics, and the number of key risk factors will directly affect the numerical relationship and the final results. On the basis of full investigation and literature research, the dynamic reduction algorithm of Rough set theory (RS) is used to effectively simplify the key risk factors, and the whole life cycle safety risk system of mining enterprises is divided into five subsystems, namely personnel, materials and equipment, technology, environment and management subsystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Yin et al. 2019)</ref>. In terms of empowerment, subjective or objective empowerment methods were single used in the past, with a certain degree of one sidedness. According to the specific needs, this paper comprehensively uses the subjective and objective empowerment method to make the weight closer to the objective fact under the premise of conforming to the subjective will. In addition, since safety input is the sum of manpower, material resources and financial resources in mine safety production, safety input also directly affects the safety level of the system.

According to the actual situation of the case mining enterprise, the following assumptions are made:</p><p>(1) Taking human-machine-technology-environment-management as the endogenous variable of the safety production system of mining enterprises, only the influence of the interaction of internal factors of the system is considered, and the other factors as exogenous variables are not considered.</p><p>(2) Safety input covers human, financial, material and other inputs. Combined with the actual situation of the investigation, this paper only considers the safety capital investment, that is, the safety capital investment in the five subsystems of human-machine-technology-environment-management.</p><p>(3) Security management has a certain control effect on the system, but it fails to completely eliminate the influence of other factors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causality diagram of technical subsystem</head><p>The technical risk factors of safety production in mining enterprises mainly refer to the unsafe factors caused in the process of mining design, construction exploration and monitoring. The technology subsystem is not only affected by its own system, but also by the interference of other risk system factors. The causal feedback loop of the technology risk subsystem is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. The Causes Tree shows that technical risk is not only affected by its own system factors, but also by other subsystems such as environment and personnel. The Uses Tree shows that when technical risks lead to accidents, compensation strategies should be adopted according to the results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SD flow stock diagram of mining enterprises</head><p>According to the causal feedback loop and research hypothesis, the flow stock diagram of the safety risk management system of mining enterprises is constructed (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Considering the principle of typicality, comprehensiveness, applicability and operability of the evaluation index, the SD model selects a total of 5 level variables, 5 rate variables, 14 auxiliary variables, 14 table functions, 26 constants and 24 main NYNAMO equations. Assuming that the construction period of a certain stage of production in a mining enterprise is 24 months, the model sets the starting and ending time in months. Each variable can truly and objectively reflect the actual safety status of the human-machine-technology-environment-management subsystem of the mining enterprise, and accurately characterize the logical relationship and dynamic correlation between the index variables.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation results analysis Simulation analysis of mine safety risk management level</head><p>In this paper, a mine in Shanxi is selected as the research object, and the corresponding parameters are brought into the system dynamics equation through data statistical analysis. Through simulation, the change trend of the safety risk management level of mining enterprises can be obtained, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Within the research period (24 months), the level value of safety risk management level of mining enterprises increases gradually with the increase of safety input, which is consistent with the change trend of the actual situation of the mine, indicating that the model is reliable.</p><p>In the daily mining process of the case mine, with the capital investment of risk management on the construction site, the safety risk management level of the mining enterprise continued to grow, and the growth in the first six months was relatively slow, which also shows that the economic or social benefits generated by safety input have a certain time delay and lag. There is a feedback relationship between safety risk management level and safety input, and safety investment is a long-term investment process. After that, the growth rate of safety risk management has accelerated, indicating that the system risk has reached the expected control limit.  Adjust and control the change value of the safety level of the five subsystems of human-machine-technology-environment-management one by one, so that the initial value of each subsystem increases by 0.5. By observing the change trend in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, it can be seen that the change trend of the safety risk management level of the management and personnel subsystems is relatively significant, the change of the technical safety level is in the middle, and the change of the material, equipment and environment level is relatively slow.</p><p>Select Table <ref type="table">Time</ref>, calculate the change rate of each subsystem, subtract the Current average value from the average value of each group, and then divide it by the average value of each group to obtain the corresponding change rate, that is, the change rate of the safety level of the five subsystems of human-machine-technology-environment-management is 45.25%, 27.68%, 36.16%, 17.32% and 48.08% respectively. Finally, the influence degree of the five subsystems on the safety risk management level of mining enterprises is obtained as follows: management, personnel, technology, materials and equipment and environment subsystems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical subsystem simulation analysis</head><p>The "14th Five-Year Plan" for scientific and technological innovation in the energy field points out that focusing on the major needs of green and intelligent coal mining, major disaster prevention and control, qualitative and hierarchical transformation, and pollutant control, forms a green, intelligent and efficient development and utilization technology system of coal. Coal is one of the main energy sources in China. In the process of the transformation from "made in China" to "intelligently made in China", the field of coal mining continues to pay attention to technological innovation, fully apply various intelligent technologies to improve the quality of coal mining, and improve China's economic and social benefits. Therefore, in this paper, the technical subsystem is extracted to carry out simulation again, and the causes of fluctuations and changes of the technical subsystem are analyzed deeply, and the causal tracking analysis of the technical safety level is carried out.</p><p>(1) Causal tracing analysis According to the causal tracing analysis results (a) of the safety level of the mine technology subsystem, the increment of the technical safety level has a great impact on the technical safety level, and it is found that the increment of the technical safety level has an overall upward trend. Then, the causal tracing of the technical safety level increment (b) shows that the engineering technology application and construction exploration and monitoring have a great impact on the fluctuation of the technical level increment. Further causal tracing is carried out for engineering technology application (c) and construction exploration and monitoring (d), and it is concluded that engineering technology application is mainly affected by the input on the conversion rate of engineering technology and technical safety input, and construction exploration and monitoring is mainly affected by the input on the conversion rate of construction exploration and monitoring and technical safety input. It is found from figures (c) and (d) that the change trend of the conversion rate of the input to the engineering technology application and construction exploration and monitoring is in a "W" development state of decline-rise-slow-decline-slow rise. The main reason is that the benefits generated by the safety input have a certain time delay and lag, resulting in a reverse change relationship between the safety input and the conversion efficiency at the initial stage, but this relationship will not last for a short time. In the later stage, with the increase of the maturity of relevant intelligent technologies and the improvement of the operation level of construction technicians, the conversion rate of technology input will gradually increase to a gentle state.</p><p>(2) Determination of parameter value and equation</p><p>According to the risk factor value of the technical subsystem calculated in the previous article, the key technical factors are further adjusted and the changes of the safety level of the technical subsystem are simulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tian et al, 2019)</ref>. The assignment is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.  By solving the change rate of each risk factor of the technology subsystem, subtract the Current average from the average of each group, and then divide by the average of each group to obtain the corresponding change rate. The results show that the change rate of five risk factors of support structure, mining scheme, construction design, engineering technology application, construction investigation and monitoring to the safety level of technical subsystem is 10.19%, 6.67%, 9.46%, 5.06%, 16.49%. According to the SD simulation results, the influence degree of internal factors of technical subsystem is successively: construction investigation and monitoring, support structure, construction design, mining scheme, engineering technology application. The influence degree of the internal factors of the technical subsystem is measured by the comprehensive weight, which is successively construction investigation and monitoring, support structure, mining scheme, engineering technology application and construction design. This is slightly different from the SD simulation results, indicating that the internal factors of the technical subsystem or the external factors will interact with the internal factors, resulting in differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and suggestions</head><p>The main purpose of the simulation of the safety risk management level of mining enterprises is to study the fundamental causes of accidents. By using system dynamics, the internal action relationship of the system can be displayed with dynamic numerical values. The safety risk management system of mining enterprises is divided into five subsystems: human-machine-technology-environment-management. On the basis of risk factor identification, the system dynamics software Vensim-PLE is used to define the relationship between the internal factors of the system, form the causality diagram and flow stock diagram of the safety risk of mining enterprises, carry out sensitivity testing, regulate the safety input level of the subsystems one by one, and compare and analyze the effect rate of each subsystem on the safety risk management system of mining enterprises. Then the causal traceability analysis of the technical subsystem is carried out to intuitively display the causal feedback of the safety risk system of the mining enterprise, so as to provide reference for the managers to carry out dynamic risk management.</p><p>(1) Formulate reasonable safety input distribution plan. The safety input of mining enterprises is mainly used in technology introduction, machinery and equipment, safety education and training and other aspects. By establishing SD model, the safety risk management level of mining enterprises under different safety input distribution is simulated, and then the optimal safety input scheme is formulated according to the actual situation. It can be seen from the simulation results of system dynamics of the case mine that increasing safety input can improve the safety level and reduce the time required for the expected safety value, while on the contrary, it will reduce the safety level and delay and lag the time of the expected safety value. Therefore, when the funds are sufficient, we can consider proper increasing the safety input to improve the safety level of mining enterprises.</p><p>The increase trend of safety level is the most obvious when safety funds are invested in the management and personnel subsystem. It can be seen from the flow stock diagram that the amount of capital investment directly affects the safety protection of construction personnel, technical level, safety education and training, safety supervision and hidden danger investigation and other. Therefore, in the safety management of mining enterprises, it is necessary to ensure the safety input of people. In addition, in the design of the optimal safety input scheme, technical factors also account for a large proportion of investment. In the process of mining, we should pay attention to the introduction of intelligent technology and equipment, improve the quality and performance of mining, and help achieve the "double carbon" goal as soon as possible.</p><p>(2) In the process of the whole life cycle of mines, the safety of mining enterprises is affected by many internal and external factors. Among them, human behavior directly affects the construction plan; The level of mine mechanization can improve the construction efficiency and ensure the safety of machinery; Technology is the premise of mine enterprise construction, and advanced management technology can scientifically guide the construction process and accurately identify mine risks; Environment is an objective factor, which can not be ignored, and the whole construction environment should be continuously monitored by intelligent technology; The so-called is "three points are technology and seven points are management". The management risk is the most sensitive to the mine safety risk, and effective measures should be taken to improve the mine safety management level.</p><p>Among the technical subsystems, construction investigation and monitoring and support structure have the greatest influence on the technical safety level. Therefore, before the preparation of the construction plan, the mine construction environment should be accurately surveyed, the hydrological data over the years should be checked, and the surrounding environment and underground pipelines should be understood. Then, combined with the construction experience to determine the scheme, and take appropriate isolation, shock absorption measures to avoid accidents due to vibration. At the same time, a special monitoring scheme is formulated, and an automatic monitoring system is set to implement dynamic monitoring of the whole process, monitor the stability of the supporting structure in the process of roadway excavation in real time, and formulate corresponding emergency prevention and recovery measures.</p><p>The construction safety risk system of mining enterprises is affected by many internal and external risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Koo et al, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gul et al, 2018)</ref>. This paper only considers the key system variables involved in the construction process. The integrity and applicability of the system may be deficient, and the SD model constructed still has a certain gap with the actual mine. In the follow-up study, risk factors and relevant data should be further improved, and more variables should be added to the model. Besides considering safety input <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Feng et al, 2020)</ref>, system objectives such as mine type and mining progress should be gradually included in the research scope.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1The division of the whole life cycle of mine</figDesc></figure>
