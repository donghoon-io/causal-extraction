<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Current high-throughput data acquisition technologies probe dynamical systems with different imaging modalities, generating massive data sets at different spatial and temporal resolutions posing challenging problems in multimodal data fusion. A case in point is the attempt to parse out the brain structures and networks that underpin human cognitive processes by analysis of different neuroimaging modalities (functional MRI, EEG, NIRS etc.). We emphasize that the multimodal, multi-scale nature of neuroimaging data is well reflected by a multi-way (tensor) structure where the underlying processes can be summarized by a relatively small number of components or "atoms". We introduce Markov-Penrose diagrams -an integration of Bayesian DAG and tensor network notation in order to analyze these models. These diagrams not only clarify matrix and tensor EEG and fMRI time/frequency analysis and inverse problems, but also help understand multimodal fusion via Multiway Partial Least Squares and Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization. We show here, for the first time, that Granger causal analysis of brain networks is a tensor regression problem, thus allowing the atomic decomposition of brain networks. Analysis of EEG and fMRI recordings shows the potential of the methods and suggests their use in other scientific domains.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>ITHOUT doubt this is the era of "Big Data". Technological advances in data acquisition technology are spurring the generation of unprecedentedly massive datasets-thus posing a permanent challenge to data analysts. Recent international efforts are marshalling the use of a bewildering array of different technologies to acquire highthroughput multimodal information about real world systems. E. Karahan is with the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Bogazici University, Kandilli Campus, 34684, Istanbul, Turkey (e-mail: esin.karahan@boun.edu.tr) P. A. Rojas-Lopez and P. A. Valdes-Hernandez are with the Cuban Neuroscience Center, Ave 25 #15202 esq.158, Cubanacan, Playa, Cuba (e-mail: pedro.rojas@cneuro.edu.cu, multivac@cneuro.edu.cu)</p><p>Examples of the systems and modalities probed are the internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, geophysical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , and the human genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The Human Brain is today perhaps the most challenging biological object under study and has been pushed recently to the forefront of public awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This interest stems from the fact that identification of the brain structures involved in cognitive processes would not only yield essential understanding about the human condition, but would also provide leverage to deal with the staggering Global Burden of Disease for Brain Disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The challenge of datasets stems from the fact that the brain is a highly nested set of interacting dynamical systems-from the subcellular level to the whole system. In turn, each level is actively being probed with an impressive arsenal of different measurement and imaging modalities. Some examples of system level measurements are high precision postmortem anatomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, electro encephalography (EEG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. These are just some of the techniques that are rapidly populating publicly available databases (see for example those listed at www.incf.org). For an overview of the methods providing data see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In this review brain information will serve us as an example of the complexities encountered in analyzing Big Data multimodal sets, as well as to illustrate possible strategies (tensor models) to cope with these issues. These approaches of course may be applied to other knowledge domains.</p><p>Typical issues that arise when analyzing neuroscience data are:  Brain data is highly multidimensional and multimodal. Each imaging modality is always an indirect measurement of the underlying dynamical systems that are of interest. Thus we are required not only to solve multiple inverse problems (one for each measurement modality) but also to carry out multimodal fusion.  Each modality is recorded at different spatial and temporal resolutions and reflects different physiological processes. This poses challenging problems for multimodal data fusion.  To compound the complexity of brain data, the analysis is not only required to identify specific components and functions of the system but also to elucidate their interactions (i.e. to identify patterns of brain connectivity). This objective derives from consensus that neural computations are not the activity of relatively isolated neural masses but rather the coordinated activity of dynamically changing networks that involve huge amounts of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Though the methods we describe here for inverse problems and multimodal fusion are quite general, we will confine examples and detailed discussions to two types of brain imaging modalities, EEG and fMRI (BOLD). The choice of these is based on their common physiological basis and complementarity as we will immediately explain. On the one hand it induces an ensemble of postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) that creates primary current density G in gray matter. The second stream of events is the emission of Γ , a vasoactive feed forward signal (VFFS), that triggers a delayed and sluggish increase in blood flow resulting in an excess of oxyhemoglobin which produces the BOLD signal B (fMRI). As shown in the left part of the figure, the cortical patch is embedded in a volume conductor (the head). As a consequence G is projected at electrodes (V1 and V2) placed at the scalp as determined by the lead field matrix K which encapsulates the effects of the volume conductor. The generation of V is further specified by use of the Markov-Penrose notation defined in this review (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4(d)</ref>). Modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. A detailed model concerning the generation of B can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4(e)</ref>.</p><p>As can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> both types of measurements arise from neural activation which produces, on the one hand, primary current densities (G) that are reflected on the scalp as the EEG (V), and on the other hand as a vasoactive feed forward signal (VFFS, Γ ) that produces a rush blood rich in oxyhemoglobin that is measureable as a local BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signature (B) with magnetic resonance imaging, being the best known method of fMRI. The physical models describing the generation of V and B from G are known as the respective forward problems.</p><p>It is precisely due to the effect of these forward models that we must solve modality specific inverse in problems in order to uncover the underlying brain activation and connectivity. In the case of the EEG, the objective is to overcome the spatial smearing of the G that is due to volume conduction. For the EEG frequency ranges usually studied, the quasi-static approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> guarantees that both forward and inverse problem are linear. EEG frequency components, or rhythms have been found to be important biomarkers of normal and abnormal brain states. A review of the basic facts about brain oscillations can be found in the comprehensive book <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In the case of the fMRI, the inverse problem compensates for the temporal blurring of the BOLD signal produced by the hemodynamic response function. Strictly speaking, the BOLD forward and inverse problems are nonlinear <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Nevertheless a useful first approximation is to linearize these equations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> for a recent example).</p><p>Thus, in this review we shall be dealing with a dual set of linear forward and inverse problems. It is not a coincidence that much of the EEG and fMRI analysis literature read as exercises in the matrix analysis of ill posed linear inverse problems. This has been beneficial due to the large and rapidly expanding toolkit of matrix based methods analysis. As we shall show in Section IV, the indeterminacies of matrix decompositions have required additional assumptions in order to obtain well defined models tuned to the data. One such approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA) which has become quite popular in both EEG and fMRI analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> [21] <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Coming back to the generative models depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, it is clear that the EEG and fMRI have complementary strengths. EEG inverse solutions have low spatial resolution, while BOLD is weak in temporal granularity. Thus these modalities seem ideally matched for image fusion in order to create an brain mapping modality that simultaneously has high spatial and temporal resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. As with the modality specific inverse problems, a majority of the modeling strategies for this type of fusion is based on matrix methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. In particular, ICA methods for EEG/fMRI fusion are also very popular and have been recently reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>An alternative to purely matrix based EEG/fMRI inverse solutions and fusion methods is to take full advantage of the inherent structure of the multimodal brain data, which many times is actually recorded as a multidimensional array or tensor. It was early recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> that tensors could be, under mild conditions, uniquely decomposed, a property applied with great advantage to the analysis of the EEG in the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Following this lead, tensor based data analysis has been vigorously developed in the past few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The applications to neuroimaging data seem quite promising and have been extensively reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. Of course tensor methods have penetrated many fields of work. Several examples of their use in multimodal fusion outside of brain science can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Rather than replicating the material covered in the excellent reviews just mentioned above, our purpose here is to illustrate how tensor methods can enrich the statistical methodology underlying EEG/fMRI electrophysiological inverse solutions, brain connectivity, and image fusion. In order to do so we integrate and generalize work initiated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. To facilitate visual representation of models we introduce Markov-Penrose diagrams (M-P diagram), a combination of Penrose diagrams with notation from the theory of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that we use to represent Bayesian tensor models and clarify inferential steps. We shall proceed as follows. Basic notation will be set down in Section II. This will allow us to first review matrix based EEG/fMRI analysis methods in Section III and to argue for the need of multi-linear approaches to the field. Section IV will present the Markov-Penrose diagrams as a convenient representation of tensors and operations. We then apply the ideas and notations of this section successively to EEG analysis (Section V); brain connectivity (Section VI); and EEG/fMRI fusion (Section VII). The descriptions will concentrate on model structure and results. We defer comments upon numerical algorithms to VIII, where we mention software packages for tensor based problems. Finally in section IX, we present some conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. NOTATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Tensor terminology</head><p>We selectively summarize here the notation used in this article, referring to the general texts for a more complete description. Tensors are a generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions, being embodied in different programming languages as multidimensional arrays. The order of a tensor is the number of its dimensions. Thus:  A scalar is a zeroth order tensor denoted by lower case symbols (e.g. x) except when denoting the number of levels in a given dimension, in which case, will be an upper case italic letter (e.g. I) without or with subscripts.</p><p> A vector is a first order tensor denoted by lower case bold symbols (e.g. x).</p><p> A matrix is a second order tensor denoted by upper case bold symbols (e.g. X).</p><p> In its general form an N-Dimensional tensor (or an N order tensor) is represented by calligraphic uppercase letters (e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 2 N I I I       </formula><p>). In order to refer to subparts of tensors we shall use, when needed, MATLAB notation for multidimensional array indexing. Thus ( ,:) l X indicates the th l row of a matrix, (:,:, ) l  is the frontal slice (or face) of a three dimensional tensor defined by fixing the third index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X and H</head><p>X are the transpose and conjugate (Hermitian) transpose of the matrix X , respectively. I is the identity matrix, log is the natural logarithm, and SVD is the singular value decomposition.</p><p>We shall also make use of the following operations (in Section VI) defined specifically for three dimensional tensors:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Tensor t-operators</head><p>We now define a series of concepts and operations introduced by Kilmer and her group <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref> that allows three dimensional tensors to be treated as though they were matrices. As we shall see in Section VI on brain connectivity three dimensions are adequate to define emitter, receiver and temporal signatures of nodes. In what follows   will denote the Fourier transform of  along the third dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>The MatVec operation matricizes a three dimensional tensor</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I J K     </formula><p>as defined below:</p><p>(:,:,1) (:,:, 2) MatVec( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(:,:, ) K                    Tensor-product (t-product) is a special type of product</formula><p>modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. Let  be a tridimensional tensor of size</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I J K   and  of size J L K   , then the t-product t    is the I L K</formula><p>  tensor found by the carrying out the following operation for all k faces of the multiplicands</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">    :,:, :,:, k k     </formula><p>. This multiplication is in effect a type of circular convolution along the third dimension.  With this operation in place it is possible to define analogues for tensors of matrix concepts such as inverse, transpose, identity and diagonal tensors, orthogonal tensors and the singular value decomposition. We shall refer to these operators as with their usual name preceded by a t: e.g. t-inverse.</p><p> The t-SVD of</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">I J K      is: T t t         , where I I K      , J J K     </formula><p>are t-orthogonal tensors and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I J K     </formula><p>is a tensor with diagonal faces. As with the usual SVD it provides an optimal approximation of a tensor in the Frobenius norm of the difference. (see <ref type="bibr">Theorem 4.3 in [51]</ref>).  The tensor nuclear norm (TNN) is defined from the t-SVD as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">min( , )<label>1 1</label></formula><p>( , , )</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">I J K i k i j k        </formula><p> t-product operators can be efficiently computed by taking means of the Fourier transforms of tensors along the third mode. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</p><p>The Tplz operation: A three dimensional tensor</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">I J K     </formula><p>can be converted into a block toeplitz matrix of dimension I K J K    by rearrangement of its faces as follows:</p><p>(:,:,1) (:,:, 2) (:,:, ) (:,:, 2) (:,:,1) (:,:, 1) tplz( ) (:,:, ) (:,:, 1) (:,:,1)  Let us represent the recorded EEG by the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H H H K K K K                                  </formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">E T I I   V </formula><p>, where E I denotes the number of electrodes in the recording sensor array placed on the scalp, and T I denotes the total number of observations obtained during the recording epoch. The sampling rate of the EEG is typically in the range of around 1 KHz.</p><p>BOLD measurements are available for all brain voxels in an image but we will assume that standard preprocessing techniques have allowed us to project this activity to a more restricted space. This can be either a standard 2-D grid distributed on the cerebral cortex, or a larger set defined for a 3-D grid that spans cerebral cortex and thalamus. The distinction between the two cases will be clear from the context but in both cases with a total number of voxels Cx I . This activity is sampled at much slower rates than the EEG (typically in the order of 1 Hz) which results in a total number of observations T T I I   . We therefore denote the recorded fMRI by the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Cx T I I    B </formula><p>. We also assume for EEG and fMRI recorded concurrently, that the time samples for the fMRI are obtained at integer multiples of those for the EEG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Matrix EEG inverse problem</head><p>The discretized version of the forward problem for the EEG is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">V    V K G<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Cx T I I   G </formula><p>denotes the primary current density defined over the same cortical grid as the fMRI and sampled at the same time points as the EEG.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">E Cx I I   K </formula><p>is the lead field matrix which summarizes volume conduction effects in the head 1 . We shall henceforth assume that that the sensor error</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E T I I V    </formula><p>is a matrix with entries that are identically distributed zero mean Gaussian variates. This assumption allows us to measure the fit of models to the data by means of the Frobenius norm Estimation of G, also known as Electrophysiological Source Imaging (ESI), is a well-known ill posed problem. Therefore a solution by naive minimization of the functional 2 2  V KG is not possible and, in fact, does not have a unique solution. Uniqueness may be obtained by adding prior anatomical and physiological information to the problem formulation.</p><p>According to this approach, estimation of G involves finding the argument Ĝ that minimizes the following augmented functional:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">2 2 ˆarg min ( )     G G V KG G<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The penalization term ( ) </p><formula xml:id="formula_18"></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">  G</formula><p>LG , that encourages estimation of spatially smooth sources on the cortex.  Another variant is VARETA <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> which uses the penalty term 1 ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">  G</formula><p>LG with an L1 norm to impose both spatial smoothness and sparseness.  More recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, the following penalty term was proposed</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">2 1 2 1 2 ( )      G G</formula><p>LG . This penalty achieves an optimal balance between spatial sparsity and smoothness of cortical sources by data driven hyper-parameters 1  and 2  .</p><p>A comparison of these and other types of source imaging may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. In that same paper STONNICA (Spatio-Temporal Orthogonal Non Negative Independent Component Analysis) was proposed as a solution for the EEG inverse problem. This model not only illustrates more complex penalty terms, but also shows how additional constraints might be useful to find interpretable sources. A tensor extension is described in Section V.</p><p>STONNICA is different in two ways from usual applications of ICA to EEG source localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>  1 Note that this is a linear operator under the quasi-static approximation for Maxwell's equations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[140]</ref>.</p><p>The parameter estimates for this model are obtained as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">2 2 , , 2 1 2 1 2 1 ˆˆ2 ( , ) arg min s.t. , 0 T                   V V V V V V V M T F V V V V V V K M T M T M L M M M I M<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">Cx I R   V M </formula><p>is the spatial signature or cortical distribution of the ONN-ICA components. The ONN condition is equivalent to specifying spatially non-overlapping EEG sources. This requirement, in addition to the smooth Lasso type <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, results in the identification of sparse isolated clustered components that were used to identify distinct cognitive processes involved in face processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Matrix fMRI Inverse problem</head><p>As mentioned before, while the generation of the BOLD signal from the VFFS is best described by a set of nonlinear differential equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, strictly speaking the forward and inverse fMRI problem should be solved using neural mass models based on nonlinear random differential equations as reviewed in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. But this would detract from our objective of simplicity in illustrating matrix and tensor techniques.</p><p>We shall therefore resort to a useful linear generative model for the BOLD signal which is the convolution of the vasoactive feed forward signal, (g, ) t</p><p> at point g of the cortical grid with the hemodynamic response ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">h t : ( , ) ( ) ( , ) ( , ) b b g t h t g t d g t        <label>(4)</label></formula><p>If this continuous time model is discretized over time at the T I  sampling times of the fMRI and the convolution operation stated as a matrix product, the resulting fMRI forward model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">B    B ΓH<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Cx T I I   Γ </formula><p>is the vasoactive feed-forward signal matrix and</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">T T I I    H </formula><p>is the hemodynamic response matrix.

Using similar procedures as those outlined in the discussion of ESI, the deconvolution of the fMRI may also be stated as an inverse problem:</p><p>Glover <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> was the first to propose this type of deconvolution using a Wiener filter, that is with</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">2 2 ( )   Γ Γ .</formula><p>Later <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> proposed the use of the penalty 2 2 ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">  Γ</formula><p>Γ L (a "LORETA style" inverse problem) in the context of EEG/fMRI fusion, a topic which we now turn to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Matrix based EEG/fMRI fusion</head><p>From an examination of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) it is clear that in order to carry out EEG/fMRI fusion a link must be established between G and Γ . A first attempt was carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> in which both quantities where assumed to be proportional to each other. Under these conditions a form of matrix EEG/fMRI fusion procedure was developed that was formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">2 2 2 2</formula><p>ˆarg min ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">       G G V KG B G H G<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Using LORETA type penalties this method was capable of accurately localizing separate components of the Somatosensory Evoked Magnetic Response. Also note that this was the first formulation of a symmetrical type of EEG/fMRI fusion, since neither modality has a priori priority over the other-their relative weight is determined by the data chosen constant . Symmetrical data fusion approaches use complementary information of both modalities to estimate the common source of neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref> whereas in asymmetrical fusion methods one modality is given priority to guide the other one. A review can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Another type of matrix based fusion is extracting the features of two modalities such as contrast maps for fMRI and averaged time course of EEG and apply fusion methods on second statistics to reveal the between subject variance. For example, in joint ICA, data features matrices are concatenated and decomposed by assuming that the datasets share the same mixing matrix/modulation profiles but different source components. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>, the temporal data feature matrix of EEG (V) constituted by the average ERP time courses over subjects and contrast maps of fMRI over subjects (B) are jointly decomposed to find the temporal ( V T ) and spatial components ( B M ) as stated below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">1 1 [ ] [ , ] s.t .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Beyond Matrix Based Methods</head><p>As we have just seen, matrix based methods have been very useful for EEG/fMRI inverse solutions and their fusion.</p><p>Nevertheless many EEG and fMRI datasets and model constructs are not best represented as matrices. Consider a set of EEG spectra recorded on a common set of sensors, for a number of subjects, for different experimental conditions. This is actually the data that can be arranged as a multidimensional array (derivation, frequency, subject, condition).</p><p>Instead of reshaping the data into matrices for use with more standard methods, tensor decomposition leverages the natural format of the data in order to discover hidden structures (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>). It is therefore not surprising to see the waxing of tensor methods in the analysis of brain data <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Penrose Diagrams</head><p>Tensor objects and operations may be represented by Penrose diagrams (P diagram) that were inspired by Penrose's original work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref> in theoretical physics and later adapted, with modifications, for tensor networks. Examples of P diagrams can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>. Expressions in usual mathematical notation for vectors, matrices and tensors as well as their corresponding Penrose diagrams are shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2(a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). In this type of diagram, tensors are denoted as nodes and each dimension is depicted as a line (link) leaving the node. The model order of a tensor can be read off from its Penrose diagram as the number of dangling lines. Note that any tensor may have any number of additional "singleton" or virtual one-element dimensions (e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">1 2 N I I I       </formula><p>is the same tensor as Any junction between lines of two or more tensors denotes an operation between them that may result in a lower order tensor. We now list those tensor operations used in this review, though of course there are many more. These are:  Tensor contraction [See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3(a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>)] which is a generalization of matrix multiplication for tensors. Consider a tensor  of size 1 <ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure">,</ref><ref type="figure"></ref> )</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">1 N M I I J J        and  of size 1 1 M P J J K K        .

Consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_37"> of size 1 1 1 n n N I I J I I         and  of size 1 1 1 n n N I I K I I        </formula><p>, concatenation of these tensors on the th J and th K dimensions will give the tensor</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">  = ,      of size 1 1 1 n n N I I J K I I          .</formula><p>Note that tensor concatenation preserves tensor order. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3(c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) for an example.</p><p> The Kruskal operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> is an important operation for constructing a tensor from matrices with the same number of columns R. For a three dimensional tensor the product is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">  {R} {R} , ,     A B C A B C  .</formula><p>The famous PARAFAC model is defined in terms of this operator, R being the number of atoms and each of the matrices characterizing a certain signature. (All of the factor matrices are normalized to unit norm except for the first matrix.) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> shows an example of an M-P diagram for a PARAFAC model.</p><p>For clarity, we sometimes emphasize a particular tensor, the result of several operations, by surrounding it with triangular or rectangular shapes as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>(e). Note that the dimensionality of the resultant tensor will be clear from the lines leaving the shape.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_40">I J K      with K L M      giving I J L M      </formula><p>. This operation is denoted with a black dot in a junction between the lines representing dimension K on both tensors. See section II-A for a detailed formulation. (a) is the P diagram, (b) is the three dimensional representation of contraction of the same tensors. (c,d) Graphical definitions of the tensor concatenation operator is exemplified between two tensors of identical number of dimensions and elements per dimension with at most one mode being different, is this case</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">I J K      and I L K      gives ( ) I J L M      </formula><p>. As can be noted, the resulting tensor preserves all the dimensions of the original except the differing dimensions which is augmented with their sum. See Section II-A for a detailed formulation. (c) is the P diagram, (d) is the three dimensional representation of concatenation of the same tensors. (e) Tensors resulting from an operation involving other tensors can be surrounded by shapes (e.g triangles, squares) to highlight the resulting tensor, rather than on its parts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Markov-Penrose Diagrams</head><p>Missing from the usual P diagrams are the concepts of probabilistic dependency. It is, probabilistic graphical models are extremely useful for making explicit the conditional dependence in a statistical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>, in particular directed graphical models (DAGs) or Bayesian networks for graphical models.</p><p>A junction between the links of two tensors in a P diagram signifies undirected arithmetic operations (as in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3(a)</ref>). By contrast, an arrow between two variable nodes in a DAG signifies directed conditional dependence.</p><p>To specify statistical models for tensors we need both types of links. To summarize, P-diagrams are useful for the visualization of tensors and tensorial operations whereas DAGs are useful for showing the probability models.</p><p>This has prompted us to define a notation that incorporates both types of links as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4(a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). Here a directed arrow denotes a conditional probabilistic dependency between tensors.</p><p>Functional penalties    x on nodes (such as those described in Section III) are depicted inside a special box shape node from which an arrow is directed to the constrained node.

Their respective M-P diagrams are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4(d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</p><p>The DAG notation is operation blind, we can see the dependence between variables, but not the actual arithmetic. In M-P notation we can show both the same conditional dependence structure as in DAG notation, but we can also infer the formula for the model in this graph using the Penrose notation for operations.</p><p>There are other types of decompositions that might be applied to these models, such as Tucker decompositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> that are easily shown with this notation but, for reasons of space, will not be included in this review.</p><p>Note the inclusion in some DAG type arrow of an error term  indicates measurement noise. Of course in reality these can be drawn from any probability distribution but for ease of exposition, as in the matrix case, will be considered a tensor of adequate dimensions containing identically and independent Gaussian variates.</p><p>The close formal affinity between certain types of tensor networks and graphical models studied in the machine learning community has already been pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> of that reference) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref> also highlight the similarities between particular types of tensor networks (depicting matrix product states) with Hidden Markov Models. Nevertheless, the links in these two types of structures are of a fundamentally different mathematical nature and a distinctive notation was not considered. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Parallel Factor Analysis of scalp EEG</head><p>One of the main advantages of tensor based analyses is the ability to represent large multidimensional arrays in terms of much simpler structures. The best known of these representations is the Canonical Decomposition or Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) decomposition, a tensor equivalent to Principal Component Analysis. As mentioned before, for tensors of order equal or larger than 3 this decomposition is unique under rather mild conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</p><p>For the sake of concreteness we shall illustrate PARAFAC in the context of time/frequency decompositions of the EEG which naturally lead to three way tensors.

By convention we shall assume that factors are all normalized except the first one in the Kruskal operation. This is the model applied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> which isolated several rhythmic components of the EEG. There are several variations on this basic PARAFAC model that can improve interpretability. For example we may impose sparseness, smoothness, non-negativity and orthogonality for the spatial signatures similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>The resulting model -a PARAFAC/ICA -is depicted in M-P format as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>.

The combination of ICA with PARAFAC has also been developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref>. A slightly different approach -applied to fMRI data -in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref> is to impose the PARAFAC structure during ICA extraction. A characteristic of the PARAFAC model that underlies our presentation, is that, as a consequence of the outer product structure of signatures, reconstructed atoms may appear as "oval blobs". While useful as a first approximation, this is a limitation that may be taken care of by including non-linear crossed terms as variables or by using more complex multilinear models (e.g. Tucker decomposition). This is a topic that will be the subject of future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. BRAIN CONNECTIVITY AS A TENSOR REGRESSION</head><p>We now address the use of tensor methods to evaluate brain connectivity. Of the different types shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> we shall concentrate on effective connectivity. This is the direct causal activation of one neural mass by another mediated by axonal pathways. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Different types of Brain Connectivity. Several related concepts of brain connectivity are summarized. Anatomical connectivity is defined as the existence of axonal pathways that link two distinct neural masses. If this pathway is activated there is effective connectivity between these neural masses. On the other hand if one only measures a correlation between the activities of two neural masses one is measuring functional connectivity. It is effective connectivity that is of interest in defining functional neural networks.</p><p>This topic has been reviewed in in depth in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref>. In that paper it is argued that current work in this area is a fusion of several strands of research:  One strand is based on graphical representations of causal models and the conditions under which causal inference is possible. This structural approach is best exemplified by the work of Pearl <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref> who formalizes role of interventions to determine true causal relations.  A second line of work is that of Wiener <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>, Akaike <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>,</p><p>Granger <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref> and Schweder <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref> in which predictability of one time series by another is used to define Granger (actually WAGS) influence measures.  A third strand is the integration of WAGS theory with the structural approach previously mentioned which has been carried out for discrete time by Eichler <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref> and for continuous time <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref>.  Structural and WAGS influence are amplified by the biophysical modeling (c.f. by random differential equations) as best illustrated by Dynamic Causal Modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref>.</p><p>Biophysical causality explicitly examines the state space equations that not only model system dynamics but also the observation equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref>. From the discussion of the EEG forward problem in Section III-A, it becomes evident that volume conduction is a serious problem affecting the interpretation of influence measures. For a recent attempt to overcome the complexities of EEG Granger causality see <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref>.</p><p>Since our purpose is to show that the estimation of Granger Causality (influence) measures for fMRI data can be profitably approached using tensor methods, we exclude the EEG from this section and will limit our examples on a standard dataset of BOLD measurements. This is fast fMRI data (sampled at 10 Hz) from one of the subjects reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>. The subject recorded had to respond with the corresponding hand to right or left visual hemi-field stimuli. Data from 1100 voxels were recorded from the visual (V), parietal (PCC), premotor (PreM), somatosensory (S), and motor (M) regions of interest (ROIs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. WAGS influence or Granger Causality (GC)</head><p>This influence measure is based upon the Multivariate Autoregressive model (MAR). For a review and freely available toolbox see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>. The algorithms described in this and many other papers are useful only when analyzing a quite small number of time series. We first set out its matrix formulation.</p><p>As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>, for brain imaging data a high dimensional MAR is needed to search for the influence fields that are the spatial maps of the influence of one brain area on rest of the brain.</p><p>To formalize these ideas, we remind the reader that the BOLD signal is denoted by</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">Cx T I I    B </formula><p>. Then the spatial MAR is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">1 lag lag lag lag I t i t i t i      b A b e<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where (:, ) To avoid the high dimensional scenario, the problem can be reduced in size, first by averaging the BOLD signal over voxels for pre-selected ROI, and then carrying out bivariate GC for all pairs of ROI-correcting for multiple comparisons. The results of this analysis for our standard dataset is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">10(a)</ref> in which an outflow of influence from the VC spreads out to other ROIs. An alternative approach is to use methods for high dimensional data regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>. This penalized MAR approach was first presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref> and reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Here all voxels of interest (the whole brain if necessary) may be included in the regression but statistical procedures that lead to variable selection were carried out.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. TENSOR EEG/FMRI FUSION</head><p>As reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> symmetrical fusion of EEG/fMRI is an equal opportunity combination of modalities in which the influence of each modality to the final solution is selected by the data. Fusion can be of two types: model driven and data driven. We will concentrate on data driven approaches as an extension of the matrix based approaches of Section II-C. We recall Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and note that we will assume that the VFFS Γ and the primary current density G related to each other in a simple fashion.</p><p>Fusion can be carried out by using tensor techniques that link the two modalities along a common dimension, usually temporal or spatial. Another possibility for multi-subject data is to use subject identity as the common link. In this section we will give three examples of fusion: EEG/fMRI along the temporal domain, EEG/DTI along the subject domain and EEG/fMRI along the spatial domain. We now explain these examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Multiway Partial Least Squares (N-PLS)</head><p>Multiway partial least squares is a tensor based method in which both dependent and independent variables constituted as tensors are decomposed simultaneously, while the signatures or factors of the shared dimension are required to have maximal covariance. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> to find the BOLD correlates of EEG rhythms, time-varying EEG spectrum T  is decomposed into spatial V M , temporal V T and spectral V F signatures and fMRI data matrix B is decomposed into spatial B M and temporal B T signatures such that temporal factors V T and B T will have the maximum covariance. We therefore set the regression model between temporal signatures by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">    s.t.</formula><p>, , and ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">t T      B V V V V B B T T C M T F B M T  (18)</formula><p>Source localization is performed on the corresponding spatial signatures of EEG ( V M ) to find the generators of each component. Then the source signatures of EEG denoted by G M is estimated through the forward model defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">V M    V G M KM<label>(19)</label></formula><p>The M-P diagram of this type analysis is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">11</ref>. This method was applied on the resting state EEG/fMRI data of a single subject originally collected in <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[96]</ref>. Since this has been a well-studied dataset we will only briefly mention the results that can be found in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.</p><p>The time varying EEG spectra The N-PLS analysis described in ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) is applied by maximizing the covariance between temporal signatures. The scatterplot of the atoms identified shows this correspondence.</p><p>Both topographic and source spatial signatures of EEG, spatial signature of fMRI are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">12</ref>.</p><p>Three atoms were extracted exhibiting spectral peaks in the alpha , theta  and gamma  range of the EEG. There was a significant covariance between EEG and fMRI components only for the  and  , which are the only ones we will comment on. Note in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">12</ref> that both the scalp and source topographies are clearly delimitated as being in the occipital region ( ) and the frontal lobes ( ). The  atom showed frontal negative activity means that increased BOLD signal corresponds to decreased spectral activity. Note that the spatial signature of the  atom is positive for the thalamus and negative for the cortex. This negative associations between BOLD and EEG activity in cortex have been interpreted as due to desynchronization of neural activity with greater thalamo-cortical input; a hypothesis that has been received support with a large scale neural model described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Identifying the coupling between EEG rhythms and resting state fMRI is a topic of current great interest. An example for this type of work is <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97]</ref>. Thus it seems that tensor methods could be of use for the study of these inter related phenomena.  due to the resemblance of their spectral characteristics to EEG rhythms as revealed in the plot of the spectral signature of EEG. EEG spatial signatures show activation in occipital regions for alpha, frontal regions for theta and pario-temporal regions for gamma atoms. On the other hand for alpha atom, fMRI spatial signature shows negative activation in occipital and superior temporal regions and positive activation in the thalamus and insula. Theta atom of fMRI spatial signature shows negative activation in anterior cingulate and occipital regions. Gamma atom of fMRI spatial signature shows similar activity with the alpha atom. Scatter plot of fMRI temporal signature against EEG temporal signature significantly reveals positive correlation in alpha atom. Correlation of these signatures for theta and gamma atoms are found insignificant. EEG spectral signatures show three distinct peaks at alpha, theta and gamma frequencies. Note the topographically distinct pattern of relations BOLD signals and spectral components that indicates stable relations between fMRI, resting state components and EEG oscillations. Figure is adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.</p><p>A recent application of N-PLS to a different pair of modalities was to the joint decomposition of EEG and DTI functional anisotropy (FA) This was carried out in order to explore the neuroanatomical determinants of the interindividual variability of the peak frequency of the EEG scalp alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). Here the common dimension for both modalities was subject identification with an N of 200.</p><p>The data for each modality was encoded by an array with the common "subject dimension". The first modality is related to white matter architecture, as measured by DTI-FA. The voxels of the FA images in which white matter probability is lower than 0.5 and FA is below 0.1, were masked out, leaving 24764 F I   is the number of frequencies in the range of 0.39-29.68 Hz. For the details on the MRI and EEG acquisition and preprocessing see <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref>. Here both arrays were scaled and their grand mean subtracted. Inverse source localization was performed on the scalp spatial signatures of EEG using LORETA and the MNI-based head model.</p><p>For the correlation of EEG and FA data, N-PLS is used in which the covariance between subject signatures are maximized. We determined that 3 atoms were adequate for the description of the EEG dataset. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">13</ref> shows the spectral signature V F , derivation signature V M , inverse source constructions G M of the atoms obtained from the N-PLS. The spectral and spatial signatures associated to the atoms allowed us to identify them as follows:</p><p>a) An atom with a spectrum dominated by "slow wave activity", with essentially a 1/f decay. Its distribution was frontal. This atom might correspond with the EEG process identified as the " ξ process" described in [99],</p><p>[100]. b) An "alpha" ( ) atom with a spectral peak very similar to those shown for other in Figs 6 and 12. Its localization was occipital, as expected. c) An "alpha contrast" atom, with a spectrum that resembles the derivate of that that  atom, also with an occipital topography. It is interesting that the first two components are similar to those described for the   ξ model <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[100]</ref> which was obtained by individual parameterized spectral models for the EEG of a different set of 211 normal subjects.</p><p>The alpha contrast atom seems to reflect the individual to individual fluctuations of the peak alpha frequency across the sample. Interestingly, the subject signatures of both modalities for this atom have the highest and significant correlation ( 8 R 0.7701, p 10    ), suggesting that white matter architecture indeed is correlated with the interindividual variation of the alpha rhythm. The spatial signature of the FA dataset FA M for this atom, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">13</ref> is loaded on the major tracts, especially thalamo-cortical, in accordance with the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref>. This type of result is important in order to test models of the origin of the alpha rhythm. The first one is dominated by a low 1/f behavior. We shall therefore identify this signature as the "slow wave signature". The second one is a pure alpha peak. We shall therefore identify this atom as the "alpha signature". The most interesting signature, the third one, seems to be a contrast between low and high alpha. We shall therefore identify this signature as the "alpha contrast signature". The slow wave signature shows a frontal source near to the theta signature described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. As clearly seen the spectral alpha signature co-localizes with the source of the alpha rhythm as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. The new alpha contrast signature has a localization very similar to the alpha signature. We only showed the corresponding spatial signature of the FA to alpha contrast signature. Major tracts, especially talamo-cortical are enhanced in this signature in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref>.</p></div>

The  parameter takes into account the scale difference between EEG and fMRI. The M-P Diagram for this type of analysis is provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">14</ref>. We applied the proposed algorithm on a simultaneously recorded EEG -fMRI data <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[103]</ref>. In this experiment, flashing light stimuli in thirteen frequencies in the range of 6 Hz to 42 Hz were presented in a block design paradigm.

Further information about the acquisition and preprocessing of the data can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[103]</ref>.</p><p>The EEG was filtered with a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency at 60 Hz and segmented in 2981 ms duration segments to match repetition time of fMRI (TR = 2981 ms).

We extracted the resting periods of the whole experiment and used for further analysis. This resulted in an EEG tensor The fMRI data was normalized to standard MNI space. The voxels on the cortical grid of EEG source space were extracted. Grand mean scaling over the session for the voxels inside the mesh was performed and BOLD values were normalized to obtain a percentage change.

When the model order of the fMRI is increased these regions are distributed on separate atoms (results not shown).

ALGORITHMS AND SOFTWARE FOR TENSOR BASED PROBLEMS</head><p>Throughout this review has concentrated on the graphical properties of tensor diagrams and on the modeling advantages of tensor models. In this section we focus on a more practical subject, that is, the methods and algorithms used for fitting such models. We explain the choices we have made motivated by the main numerical difficulties. We then describe major software packages that are available to implement tensor models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimization of the model functional</head><p>Though there are many techniques for tensor network decomposition, we present only the PARAFAC decomposition. Besides ease of interpretation, a major reason for this selection is the ease it may be augmented with multiple penalizers that enhance interpretability and numerical stability. In fact, the alternating least squares algorithm (ALS), often used to estimate PARAFAC model, is an easily implementable and flexible algorithm. ALS is an iterative algorithm in which, at each step only one signature is estimated, considering all others to be fixed. Since each step is a linear regression, penalization methods can be incorporated naturally. ALS has been improved with line search at each step <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[109]</ref>, though it can converge slowly, especially when the components are collinear.</p><p>Other methods such as gradient based optimization methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[110]</ref> and generalized Schur decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[111]</ref> have been developed as an alternative to overcome the limitations of ALS. In addition, probabilistic methods for general tensor factorizations are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[112]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[113]</ref>. These are alternatives to the algorithmic choices we have made.</p><p>Our choice in this article has been a modification of ALS, the Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares algorithm (HALS) in which, at each step of ALS, only one of the component of a factor is estimated, fixing other signatures of all atoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[114]</ref>. In particular we have implemented a gradient based HALS for the estimation of parameters for which orthogonality and nonnegativity is required: orthogonality can easily be imposed column wise (refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref> for details).</p><p>In addition since we use a combination of penalties with different forms of regression and decomposition, we decompose our optimization problem into its additive components and combine the solutions by means of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[116]</ref>[117] <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[118]</ref>.</p><p>The distributed nature of ADMM is also especially geared to solve very large problems in big data since multiple penalization problems may merged into a single global optimization which is solved piece-wise. An example of this this splitting behavior of ADMM is illustrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>. Influence fields may be required to be smooth both in incoming (receiver) and outgoing (emitter) directions with a different profile. An analytical solution with these two priors is not possible due to the penalization on two of the dimensions of the connectivity tensor. ADMM shows its strength by splitting this optimization into two tractable sub-problems. Similar approach can be embraced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> for assigning multiple priors on components of a PARAFAC decomposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Selection of model parameters</head><p>Multiple penalization methods entail tuning of a large amount of hyper-parameters, with scant knowledge about the actual effect of parameters changes.</p><p>We have adopted the approach to carry out parameter selection based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) This requires the estimation of the degrees of freedom (dof), which reflects model complexity, for a given set of the parameters. While general formulations of dof exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[119]</ref> and explicit formulas are available for many of the most common regularization problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[121]</ref>, the complicated nature (e.g. non-differentiability) of some regularizers makes it very hard to find an accurate mathematical expression. For this means, general purpose non-parametric methods have been developed, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[122]</ref>. Dof for tensor problems are calculated according to the penalization function applied on each signature e.g. for a smooth lasso type of penalization, the degrees of freedom formulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref> is used.</p><p>The hyper-parameters chosen are those that minimize BIC, a search over a suitable grid being carried out. We illustrate this procedure by one of the most extreme cases in terms of number of hyper-parameters. This is the CMTF objective function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> with 10 hyper-parameters: 6 for smooth lasso type penalization, 3 for the orthogonality constraints on spatial signatures and 1 for the variance difference between two modalities. Hyper-parameters for orthogonality constraints are determined as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref>. We present the BIC formulations for this model in Appendix I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Selection of the number of atoms</head><p>PARAFAC type decompositions requires the determination of the number of components or atoms which is also known as the tensor rank. There is not any straightforward algorithm to determine the rank of a specific given tensor; in fact, this problem is NP-hard <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[123]</ref>. Nevertheless practical methods and heuristics have been developed in order to automatically determine the number of components in PARAFAC model such as Corcondia by <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[124]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[125]</ref>. For the determination of model order of PARAFAC based models defined in this article, we used Corcondia and evaluated the explained variance for different number of components. For the selection of the number of components (RC) of CMTF model, a heuristic approach is applied by decomposing two datasets independently. After deciding for an initial value of RC based on spatial signatures, several model orders are tried and the best model is selected.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a general framework for tensor analysis of single modality model inversion and multimodal data fusion. We introduce the Markov-Penrose (M-P) diagrams to unify graphical tensor notations with that for Directed Acyclic Graphical (DAG) description of Bayesian statistical models. Using these diagrams different approaches for the solution of inverse problems of EEG and fMRI are described as well as models for their fusion in common domains. Additionally we proposed a tensor MAR for modeling the causal brain networks and reviewed symmetrical fusion methods with the proposed notation. We reviewed algorithms and software packages for implementation of tensor based problems.</p><p>EEG and fMRI are mediated by different physiological processes from neural activation leading to differences in their spatial and temporal resolutions. Biophysical models have been addressed to fuse electrical and metabolic signals in meso-scale. Due to the indirect nature of these signals, inverse problems for each modality should be solved to cover the interactions between modalities which are intrinsically ill-posed in their nature. The examples shown with simulations and real data support the usefulness of this type of approach.</p><p>As the amount of neuroimaging data increases tremendously, methods dealing with this problem should be developed. Statistical methods based on tensors embraces the high dimensionality of the multimodal data.

When necessary, the number of elements of a dimension will be indicated beside the link that denotes it. Singleton dimensions (dimensions with only one level) are shown as dashed lines with the number 1. (e) Nonnegativity and other relations for tensor elements indicated with the usual mathematical notation in the circle or square. (f) Orthogonality constraints are shown as squared bars on the orthogonal dimensions.</figDesc><graphic coords="7,46.56,401.04,252.48,192.96" type="bitmap" /></figure>

This is quite similar to the usual Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) notation. (d) Usual DAG [67] diagrams for the generative models of the EEG (left) and its equivalent version in the M-P notation (right). The M-P diagram explicitly states that the EEG V is the contraction of the lead field matrix K with the primary current density matrix G corrupted by sensor noise  . This example model also includes a prior probability distribution for G. (e) Similar DAG and M-P diagrams for the generative model of the BOLD signal.

The data corpus described in Section VI was used for analyzing brain connectivity by means of different techniques, which offer comparable results. The arrows denote directional dominant flows of Granger causality between the visual (V), parietal (PPC), premotor (PreM), somatosensory (S), and motor (M) cortex. (a) The original results were published by [85] and extracted from Fig 2 in that paper. This is the dominant information flow calculated from the difference between two uni-directional Granger estimates among the ROIs. Only connections that have a pvalue ≥ 0.05 are shown. (b)Results using the t-product technique described in Section VI make more valuable the connectivity analysis revealing the bi-directional and inter hemispheric interaction between ROIs. A major interaction was found at the left hemisphere that could be related to the right handed condition of the subject. (c) The resulting three spatial atoms retrieved by the PARAFAC decomposition of the connectivity matrix. Note that in all of these results there is a predominance in causal directionality emerging from the V and PCC cortex to the rest of the areas.
