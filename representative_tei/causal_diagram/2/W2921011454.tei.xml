<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Frequent changes pervasively undermine project schedule performance. Despite voluminous research into project delays, however, the persistence of the problem demands that a systemic approach be adopted to investigate design change causation and to explore the efficacy of communications and knowledge as strategic project controls. Drawing on a hybrid research design, the critical variables are identified and mapped onto causal loop diagrams to enable practical holism.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Despite a wealth of research in the quest to investigate the causes of delays in construction, design changes remains a perennial plague inhibiting schedule management worldwide, both in developed (e.g., United States: Han, Lee, &amp; Peña-Mora, 2012; United Kingdom: Olawale &amp; Sun, 2010; Taiwan: <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Yang, Chu, &amp; Huang, 2013)</ref> and developing countries (e.g., Thailand: <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ikediashi, Ogunlana, &amp; Alotaibi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vietnam: Le-Hoai, Lee, &amp; Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">United Arab</ref> Emirates: <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mpofu, Godfrey, Moobela, &amp; Pretorious, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Yap and Skitmore's (2017)</ref> recent survey of Malaysian building projects reports that design changes can induce 5 to 20% timecost overruns. More than 70% of rework in construction and engineering projects is design change-induced <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Burati, Farrington, &amp; Ledbetter, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Part of the problem appears to be due to the adversarial 'them and us' attitude engendered by the high degree of fragmentation between the various contracting parties hampering the level of project communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yap &amp; Skitmore, 2018)</ref> required for coordination and trust building <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cheung, Yiu, &amp; Lam, 2013)</ref>, contributing to project management problems in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Wearne, 2014)</ref>. Teamwork and experience sharing are subdued given the limited trust within project teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Eriksson, Leiringer, &amp; Szentes, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>A further issue is that construction involves incredibly complex and highly dynamic projects that involve multiple feedback processes, non-linear relationships, and critical managerial decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Sterman, 1992)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Wearne (2014)</ref>, time, change and inexperience constitute the greatest problems for project management across project-based industries in Europe. One aspect is that the contracting parties have little appreciation of the disruptive knock-on effects of a design change request on another parties' portion of work, leading to snowballing modifications and spiraling rework. The lack of competency of project personnel also inevitably proliferates variations <ref type="bibr">(Yap et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>It is evident, however, that there are gaps in knowledge germane to the causality of overruns and strategic project management in construction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Alsehaimi, Koskela, and Tzortzopoulos' (2013)</ref> critical evaluation and synthesis of 16 delay studies in developing countries reveals that, although poor project management practice is consistently identified as the prime cause of delays, the major shortfall of these published studies is the absence of practical recommendations to address delays. Similarly, Ahiaga-Dagbui, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Love, Smith, and Ackermann's (2017)</ref> recent examination of a large amount of academic literature on construction cost overruns studies conducted worldwide concludes that most research is superficial, replicative and ineffectual in alleviating the problem. This may be considered surprising by many in view of the project management research community's relentless pursuit of alternative approaches to offer additional insights from different perspectives for both project management practice and theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ackermann &amp; Alexander, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Systems thinking offers a potential way forward to this problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ackermann and Alexander (2016)</ref>, for example, prescribe causal mapping to take a systems viewpoint. For better project control decisions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lyneis and Ford (2007)</ref> advocate the need for more studies within the change management, risk management, and project control domains. System dynamic models in these areas are required to train and teach these heuristics among project management practitioners <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Sheffield, Sankaran, &amp; Haslett, 2012)</ref>. This is in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Coyle (2000)</ref> on the use of a qualitative causal model to place complex problems that may require many pages of narrative explanation onto a single piece of paper to enable practical holism. To improve project performance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lyneis and Ford (2007)</ref> also propagate controlling dynamic systems through management actions. Applications in delay studies are limited however, with little work being conducted integrating project communications management and knowledge using the systemic approach in the management of design changes and schedule control for example. In a similar vein, conceptualizing construction as a nonlinear system may engender a more practical context for the understanding of the causal relationships involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Olaniran, Love, Edwards, Olatunji, &amp; Matthews, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Given the current shortcomings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ahiaga-Dagbui et al. (2017)</ref> recommend future delay studies to shift from single-cause identification and conventional correlation analysis between variables to pursue the causal nature of overruns through systemic thinking and retrospective sensemaking. Likewise, given that time and cost management are inseparable <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kerzner, 2017)</ref>, a similar observation can be inferred for delay studies. To gain further insights into construction delays and the complex interactions between the causative factors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aibinu and Odeyinka (2006)</ref> also suggest the need for adopting a systemic approach to evaluate the interrelatedness of the critical factors involved. Their proposal concurs with <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lyneis, Cooper, and Els (2001)</ref> on utilizing system dynamics models to improve the performance of the management of complex projects.</p><p>In response to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ahiaga-Dagbui et al.'s (2017)</ref> assertion of the methodological deficiencies of the majority of cost overrun research and the call by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ackermann and Alexander (2016)</ref> on the use of causal mapping for researching complex issues, this study adopts a systemic paradigm to understand the causes of design changes. It seeks to understand design change causation vis-à-vis scope creep that results in schedule delays induced by frequent design changes during construction. The effects of these factors are systemically explored to provide more profound insights into how active communications and continuous learning in projects can be leveraged to control design changes and ultimately improve schedule performance in a project environment. Heeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Olawale and Sun's (2010)</ref> proposition for exploiting preventive measures in project schedule management, the study seeks to examine the value-addedness of project communications management and project knowledge management as project control actions. Both are outlined by Project Management Institute's (2017) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide as key areas to achieving on-time and within-cost delivery of projects. The paper also contributes to bridging the gap in the literature concerning design change causation employing a systemic thinking approach with the aid of causal mapping to understand the multiple causal relationships beyond the traditional identification of single-causes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design Change-induced Overruns</head><p>More than two decades ago, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Ogunlana, Promkuntong, and Jearkjirm (1996)</ref> examined the causes of delays of high-rise building construction projects in Thailand to observe that project clients request for changes in plans are predominantly responding to changing economic climate, meeting customer demands or some marketing reasons. This is akin to <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kaming, Olomolaiye, Holt, &amp; Harris's (1997)</ref> findings for high-rise building projects in Indonesia, where the leading causes of delays are design changes, poor labor productivity, and inadequate planning. In 2010, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Olawale and Sun's (2010)</ref> survey conducted on 250 construction organizations in the UK revealed design changes, risks/uncertainties and inaccurate evaluation of project duration as the three leading factors inhibiting the effective schedule management and cost control of construction projects. A year later in Australia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Orangi, Palaneeswaran, and Wilson's (2011)</ref> case study of three pipeline projects in Victoria identified the major root causes of delays as including design changes, design errors and design submission delays -all of which are related to design matters. Another comparable observation is also reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hanna, Camlic, Peterson, and Lee (2004)</ref> in the U.S.</p><p>In Denmark, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Larsen, Shen, Lindhard, and Brunoe (2015)</ref> observed that errors in design documents, inconsistencies in project documents, and late user changes to function, demand extensive modifications, resulting in significant cost increases. Their findings concur with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Josephson, Larsson and Li's (2002)</ref> claim in Sweden that 26% of rework is relating to designrelated causes. Likewise, a more recent study in Malaysia by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nurul, Aminah, Syuhaida, and Chai (2016)</ref> examined National Audit Reports, noting that change in design by the client in the implementation phase is listed as one of the 69 low-performance factors in public development projects. It is evident that design changes persistently hinder construction projects from attaining schedule and cost objectives in many parts of the world -further justifying the need for further research to access this problem. This provided the motivation to examine this phenomenon from the alternative systemic perspective used in this study.</p><p>A design change is a form of change that deviates the way work is planned, budgeted or scheduled (Abdul-Rahman, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Wang, &amp; Yap, 2016)</ref>. Almost all projects undergo various degrees of design changes throughout the project lifecycle. Even though design changes are widely accepted by practitioners in the construction industry, however, they have undesirable adverse consequences on project outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mohamad, Nekooie, &amp; Al-Harthy, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Notwithstanding the voluminous reports of projects having run over time and over budget due to frequent design changes during construction, there has been limited academic research, particularly regarding the nature and causes of design changes. This motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Yap and Skitmore (2018)</ref> to investigate the various reasons for design changes in Malaysian building projects. They conducted a review of the extensive literature to categorize the 39 causes into those related to the project (1) client, (2) consultant, (3) contractor, (4) site, and (5) external.</p><p>The three most significant causes observed are poor coordination among various professional consultants, variations in the specification, and frequent changes to scope requirements. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Suleiman and Luvara (2016)</ref> in Tanzania evaluated the implications of design changes to include schedule delays, increase in costs, abandonment, wastage of materials and disputes among the contracting parties. Their major causes are owner changes, an unclear initial design brief, and inadequate design details. In Indonesia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Yana, Rusdhi, and Wibowo (2015)</ref> grouped the influential factors of design changes under internal and external factors.</p><p>Using a questionnaire survey, they further analyzed the data using partial least squares (PLS) to reveal that the client was the main responsible party inducing design changes, followed by professional consultants. However, the ranking of the causes is not available. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ahiaga-Dagbui et al.'s (2017)</ref> reflection, these captioned studies are merely replicative where similar causal variables are identified. Another shortcoming worth highlighting is that these studies lack clear recommendations for mitigation measures, in line with <ref type="bibr">Alsehaimi et al.'s (2013)</ref> claim noted earlier -limiting the construction industry's efforts to devise effective strategies to contain the problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Olaniran et al. (2015)</ref> further echoed that research is often fixated on apportioning leading reasons for overruns without proffering remedial actions. An exception is <ref type="bibr">Mohamad et al.'s (2012)</ref> corrective actions of allowing longer time for the design process, involving experienced personnel, providing a clear design brief from the client and delivering prompt information concerning the impact of each proposed change. It is the interest of this study, therefore, to explore the avenues for reducing avertable design changes during construction.</p><p>Related to design changes, many past studies blame rework for undermining project performance. Design change-induced rework can account for nearly 50% of cost overruns <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Love, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Senaratne and Sexton (2009)</ref> note that rework due to unplanned changes can cost up to 15% of contract value. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chang, Shih, and Choo's (2011)</ref> study found an average of 8.5% cost increase due to design changes in Taiwan, which concur with <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cox, Morris, Rogerson, and Jared's (1999)</ref> claim that the cost associated with design changes was 5-8% in the UK. The reasons are obvious: design-change induced-rework results in a higher cost due to the further efforts of disassembling and restarting some completed works <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Emuze, Smallwood, &amp; Han, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Yap, Low, &amp; Wang, 2017)</ref>, resulting in the loss of project productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cooper &amp; Reichelt, 2010)</ref> and higher wastage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kakitahi, Alinaitwe, Landin, &amp; Mone, 2016)</ref>. These non-value adding activities generate multiple knock-on effects that result in delays and disruptions to the construction workflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Howick, Ackermann, Eden, &amp; Williams, 2009)</ref>. When rework increases, the project cost, and schedule is likely to increase, which eventually leads to unnecessary disputes and claims <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ibbs &amp; Liu, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Project Control Measures</head><p>To better control time and cost, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Olawale and Sun (2010)</ref> conducted in-depth interviews with 15 industry practitioners to devise 18 mitigating measures for design changes, which were then classified as: preventive, predictive, corrective, and organizational measures. Following their classification, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chai, Yusof, and Habil (2015)</ref> conducted a broad survey in Malaysia to explore the relationship between the mitigation measures and delay factors in housing delivery, employing a structural equation modeling approach (SEM). Their SEM analysis revealed preventive measures to be the most influential in mitigating delays. For this reason, the preventive approach is adopted to strategically control design changes in this study.</p><p>To explore the factors influencing project success, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Andersen et al. (2006)</ref> gathered critical factors from four culturally different regions (France, Norway, UK, and China), in which a principal components analysis (PCA) found strong project commitment and effective communications significantly contribute to project success. Their study in Norway also revealed that such 'soft skills' as rich communications and learning from experience are prerequisites for the project team to deliver results on time and within budget. Another study of critical success factors by <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Yong and Mustaffa (2013)</ref> in Malaysia also acknowledges the significance of human-related factors such as commitment, competence, communication and cooperation on the successful delivery of construction projects. This is akin to <ref type="bibr">Eriksson et al.'s (2017)</ref> attributes of successful co-creation practices and requisites to project knowledge management <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gasik, 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Anantatmula's (2015)</ref> project performance enhancement model, developed using interpretive structural modeling (ISM), suggests that effective communication is the critical contributing factor, resulting in a cohesive project team that encourages participative decision-making. <ref type="bibr">Love and Smith (2016)</ref> propose a collective learning framework in the pursuit of productivity and performance improvements, particularly focusing on experiential learning in error management. A separate study by <ref type="bibr">Love et al. (2016)</ref> using a case study of a mega Australian water infrastructure alliance project advocates the critical need for project learning and continuous improvement to be engendered through mutual trust, shared values and rich project communications to reduce rework in order to improve overall project performance. In the following year, <ref type="bibr">Yap et al. (2017)</ref> interviewed 12 experts from the construction industry to conceptualize a collaborative model that stresses the importance of project communications and continuous learning towards enhancing team capacity and synergy in managing construction projects. Their model explicitly elucidates the enablers of effective communication, enablers of project learning and types of reusable project knowledge. <ref type="bibr">Manley and Chen (2017, p.</ref> 3) describe construction project collaborative learning as "an absorptive capacity … to explore, transform, and exploit knowledge" which positively influences project performance. It is worth mentioning that the exchange of information, knowledge and new ideas between team members is motivated by synergic team dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Koutsikouri, Austin, &amp; Dainty, 2008)</ref> and facilitated by an effective communication management plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Senaratne &amp; Ruwanpura, 2016)</ref>. As such, collaborative teams can successfully learn from change events in construction projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Senaratne &amp; Sexton, 2009)</ref> and reuse the knowledge gained for future projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kivrak, Arslan, Dikmen, &amp; Birgonul, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Tan, Carrillo, and Anumba (2012)</ref> stress the need to learn from construction projects, and that the real benefit in time-cost control can only be realized when project knowledge is effectually reused. Nevertheless, project knowledge management is significantly influenced by organizational leadership and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Zhang &amp; Cheng, 2015)</ref>. In recognizing learning in project-based organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chroneer &amp; Backlund, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gasik, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koskinen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Mueller, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reich, 2007)</ref>, 'manage project knowledge' is incorporated as a vital process within project integration management in the latest (6 th ) edition of Project Management Institute's (2017) PMBOK Guide.</p><p>Having synthesized the above studies, project communications management and project learning are envisioned as the strategic preventive measures to control design changes to reduce rework and improve project performance in this study. Although previous studies indicate the efficacy of project communications management and project learning as effective measures for time-cost control, there is little systemic evidence of the implications of these measures in managing design changes in project environments. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Anantatmula (2015)</ref>, managerial strategies for enhancing project performance are more akin to mental models. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lyneis and Ford (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Senge (2006)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sterman (2000)</ref> advocate that building shared mental models engenders learning by creating a shared vision using systemic thinking. Different actors in the system can make sense of discerning feedback mechanisms to schedule control under a common perspective and shift mental models <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Galanakis, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, the relationship between these variables is explored using a systemic approach to bridge the knowledge gap in this domain and encourage project manager practitioners to implement changes in project management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systemic Approach</head><p>Systems thinking is the underpinning paradigm and research approach for this study. Systems thinking is a holistic (integrative) approach to problem-solving based on general systems theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bertalanffy, 1968)</ref>, a philosophy of science and engineering based on the idea of combining the knowledge gained through analysis and the understanding attained through synthesis to address the root causes of problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Caulfield &amp; Maj, 2001)</ref>. Systems theory is an approach to intellectually engaging change and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen &amp; Stroup, 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Weinberg (1975)</ref> describes systemic thinking as a way of thinking about problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Checkland (2000)</ref> notes that systems thinking is an inquiring process in making sense of complex situations. This lead to <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Senge (2006)</ref> introducing systems thinking as the key component of organizational learning, where the process of inquiry into real-world complexity is itself a system for learning. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gates (2016)</ref> points out the emerging trend of integrating systems thinking into complexity science to provide an alternative science paradigm and methodological approach to studying complex systems.</p><p>There are generally two distinctions in systems practice -soft and hard systems thinking.</p><p>While 'hard' systems thinking is often used to understand a relatively well-defined technical problem, 'soft' systems thinking is more suitable for solving complex management problems involving human beings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Checkland, 2000)</ref>. In dealing with real-world managerial issues, soft systems methodology can be instigated to develop conceptual models to evaluate the underlying dynamics of the system-problem structuring <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Reisman &amp; Oral, 2005)</ref>. Hard systems thinking on the other hand, involves problem-solving using formal models following the results of the process of inquiry <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Reisman &amp; Oral, 2005)</ref>. It is the purpose of this paper to employ the soft systems approach using cognitive mapping to offer guidance in structuring design change management and project schedule performance with an integrative systems perspective and methodological pluralism. This is in agreement with Reynolds and Holwell's (2010) first purposeful orientation of systems thinking in making sense of, or simplifying (in understanding), the interrelationships in a complicated situation. They assert that the prime intention of the systems approach in research is to acquire more profound insights in order to improve the situation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Monat and Gannon (2015)</ref> conducted a systematic literature review to recommend systems thinking in solving complex problems that are not solvable using traditional reductionist (dissective) approach because this 'new way of thinking' stresses interactions between elements in the systems. <ref type="bibr">Arnold and Wade (2015, p. 675)</ref> describe systems thinking as "the capability of identifying and understanding systems, predicting their behaviors, and devising modifications to them in order to produce desired effects." All things considered, complexity in project management may be tamed by systemic thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Sheffield et al., 2012)</ref> in the pursuit to improve efficiency and project performance. As such, the systemic approach is a fast emerging technique for applying non-linear causal thinking to improve understanding of project management problems over the past decade. This includes rework causation <ref type="bibr">(Emuze &amp; Smallwood, 2014)</ref>, risk management <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Wang &amp; Yuan, 2017)</ref>, delay factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Das &amp; Emuze, 2017)</ref>, change management <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lee, Peña-Mora, &amp; Park, 2006)</ref>, procurement management <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Park, Ji, Lee, &amp; Kim, 2009)</ref> and sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Onat, Egilmez, &amp; Tatari, 2014)</ref>. The notion of examining the underlying dynamics of the causes of design change creates a complex net. As such, a systemic approach is adopted to deal with the complexity and attempts to create the paradigm shifts needed to transform current work practices in managing change in a project environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrated Model of Systemic Thinking</head><p>The iceberg analogy representing the four levels of systemic thinking outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Maani and Cavana (2007)</ref> is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The tip of the iceberg, which is the most visible part, represents the event level -in this case the observable late delivery of building projects. In reality, most interventions to address the problem take place at this reactive level <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Maani &amp; Cavana, 2007)</ref>, oftentimes ineffectually <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kim, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Hidden from view, the second level of thinking involves noticing a pattern/trend by linking together a set of consistent and recurring discrete events, where schedule control is inhibited by frequent design changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Olawale &amp; Sun, 2010)</ref>, lack of project communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Doloi, Sawhney, Iyer, &amp; Rentala, 2012)</ref> and poor project knowledge of members from wideranging disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Al-Kharashi &amp; Skitmore, 2009)</ref>. These patterns are more meaningful than events, because the underlying causes of schedule delays are recognized so that a response can be taken.</p><p>A further hidden third level of thinking is systemic structures, which reveals the interconnected relationships of the patterns that cause schedule delays.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Methodology</head><p>This study adopts a hybrid research strategy (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), heeding Ackermann and Alexander's (2016) suggestion to mix qualitative data with that obtained from a structured survey in the development of causal mapping. In addition, the triangulated approach provides rigor and robustness to the empirical findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Joslin &amp; Müller, 2016)</ref>. First, a comprehensive review was conducted of the literature to formulate the potential causes of design changes.</p><p>This comprised that relating to design changes, construction delays, cost overruns, rework, and change orders. The review resulted in initial list of 43 causes relating to project (1) clients, (2) consultants, (3) contractors, (4) site, and (5) external. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection using the Triangulated Approach</head><p>Both qualitative and quantitative data collection were conducted sequentially employing semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey, which was then amalgamated to achieve data triangulation to increase reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Joslin &amp; Müller, 2016)</ref> as well as reduce complications associated with bias and validity <ref type="bibr">(Love et al., 2016)</ref>. The building construction sector in Malaysia was chosen for the primary data collection. Interviews are considered a suitable data collection mechanism to gain insights into a phenomenon in an exploratory study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Creswell, 2014)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Arksey and Knight (1999, p. 2)</ref>, "interviews are concerned with exploring data on understandings, opinions, what people remember doing, attitudes, feelings and the like, that people have in common." The overall quality of the interview questions was first pretested with five experts and their feedback was used to improve the questions further. To explore the aptness of the causes to the Malaysian context, a total of 12 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with industry practitioners, involving 4 representatives from clients, consultants and contractors respectively to provide an equitable understanding of the research topic (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). All these practitioners had sufficient working experience in the building construction sector.</p><p>They were requested to identify the causes of design changes from the projects in which they were involved, to pinpoint the effects of design changes-induced rework, and to elucidate how active communications, knowledge and past project experience influences project performance. To elicit the participants' rich experiences in dealing with design changes, critical incident <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Flanagan, 1954)</ref> and retrospective sensemaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Weick, 1995)</ref> techniques were adopted, using probing questions such as 'can you share with me how this event happened?', 'please give an example' and 'how are these causes related?' to motivate them to  Depending on the validated critical variables fit for the Malaysian context, a questionnaire was developed for the four categories of variables. The questionnaire consists of five parts. The first part aims to collect the respondents' background information, and the second, third, fourth and fifth parts contain the 39 causes of design changes (category 1), 9</p><p>effects of design change-induced rework to project performance (category 2), 4 influences of effective project communications (category 3), and 2 benefits of project knowledge (category 4) to be evaluated. A 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) was adopted to measure the agreement of each variable. A pilot survey involving 35 industry practitioners was conducted to ensure clarity and unambiguity -an essential step to ensure the success of the main survey. For the main survey, a total of 1100 questionnaires were distributed over a period of 3 months, of which 303 valid responses were returned, attaining a consolidated response rate of 29.4% with a total of 338 responses after combining with the responses from the pilot survey, which is considered an acceptable practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fellows &amp; Liu, 2008)</ref>. The responses collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (Version 23). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the descriptive statistics concerning the respondents. With 69% of the respondents having more than 5 years' experience and 49% having more than 10 years of experience, the sample is representative and can reflect current positions in the industry. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis and Evaluation of Critical Variables</head><p>The scale reliability of the four categories is established considering the computed Cronbach's alpha values ranges from 0.745 to 0.901, which is greater than the 0.7 value for exploratory research <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the mean score of the ten most significant critical variables identified in category 1 and the mean score of the critical variables in categories 2, 3 and 4. The one sample t-test (test value = 3) indicates that all these critical variables are perceived to be significant by the respondents at the 95% confidence level, attaining both content and construct validity requirements -where the critical variables amply represent and measure the phenomenological reality of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lucko &amp; Rojas, 2010)</ref>. A close examination of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> reveals that 83% of the respondents acknowledged that design changes induce rework. The majority of the respondents agreed that active project communications (mean = 4.305) and project learning (mean = 4.340) can effectively shorten the project duration of construction projects, with apparently increased productivity from less design changes and resultant rework. More than 80% of the respondents are of the opinion that graphical representation of the causal relationships could assist in their better understanding of overrun causation. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ackermann and Alexander (2016)</ref>, traditional approaches can be integrated with causal mapping to provide new insights. This study adopted a similar approach utilized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Wang and Yuan (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Emuze et al. (2014)</ref> of using the significant variables evaluated based on the responses of their questionnaire surveys as essential elements in the CLDs. Based on the critical variables identified in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and the hypothesized relationships in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, retrospective sensemaking was used to determine why and how design changes occurred and how project communications management and project learning can facilitate the schedule control of building projects. As such, a more nuanced understanding of the critical variables can be accomplished to maintain internal validity and ensure the causalities involved are logical <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lucko &amp; Rojas, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The next section discusses the steps employed to systemically formulate the CLDs for design change causation, design change-induced rework, effective project communications, project learning, and causal relationships for preventive control of design change-induced overruns considering active communications and the continuous learning approach.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptualizing Causal Loop Diagram</head><p>As noted earlier, independent single-cause identification and simply ranking variables do not provide a complete understanding of causation and may even be counterproductive.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ahiaga-Dagbui et al. (2017)</ref>, a systemic approach is therefore required to make sense of causality by examining the interdependencies of the critical variables using causal mapping. Qualitative project causal mapping provides a rich grounding for understanding why the key events behave in the way they do and make sense in establishing causality and learning lessons from project experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Howick et al., 2009)</ref>. With this in mind, the causes of design changes should not be considered in isolation but are dynamically linked accommodating combinations of cause-and-effect feedback loops with the aid of the Vensim PLE software.</p><p>The causal loop diagram (CLD) is a valuable tool for systemic thinking, particularly for representing the feedback for a problem, eliciting, capturing and comparing mental models of people, and enabling explicit graphical representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sterman, 2000)</ref>. As such, CLD reveals the causal relationships among a set of variables influencing a system where the variables are connected by arrows (causal links) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Maani &amp; Cavana, 2007)</ref>. Each causal link is allotted a polarity, either positive (+) or negative (-), to show the way the dependent variable is affected each time the independent variable changes. The dynamics of all systems derive from the interaction of two types of feedback loops. Thus, the causal relationships can be recognized by tracing the direction of the arrows, starting from any one variable, traversing the loop, and coming back to the same variable. Positive loops (R) tend to reinforce or amplify whatever is already occurring, whereas negative loops (B) counteract and oppose change <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sterman, 2000)</ref>. Hence, positive or reinforcing loops create a vicious or virtuous cycle while a negative or balancing loop is goal seeking.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sterman (2000)</ref>, CLD conceptualization involves two primary steps, namely   decision-making', which then leads to superfluous 'scope creep' as the system becomes out of control. The other vicious reinforcing loops, R5 to R7, indicate that 'changes to specification' triggered from 'additional requirements' and 'changes to government regulations' induces excessive design changes from 'design errors' and 'incomplete drawings', which results in an exponential upsurge in rework and further increases schedule delays. This can propel the rapid growth of design changes at an ever-increasing rate that supports dynamic hypothesis 1 as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Given the undermining effects on project performance, preventive actions are essential to alleviate these dynamics.  The second dynamic hypothesis is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>, where project learning is facilitated by active communications for solving problems relating to design changes.</p><p>Learning increases the competency of project managers which leads to enhanced expert judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Yap, Abdul-Rahman, &amp; Wang, 2018)</ref>. On the other hand, miscommunication hampers project coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yap &amp; Skitmore, 2018)</ref>, resulting in a 'blame-shifting game' that delimits trust and collaboration between project team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mainga, 2017)</ref>. As such, less communication also leads directly to more design changes. For this reason, two balancing loops are formulated alongside design changes, project learning and communication required for problem-solving. However, there seems to be a side effect loop R1 based on the parallelism of design changes and communication required for problemsolving after a delay period. To explain this, the reinforcing loop leads to early exponential growth, but then, after a delay, the negative feedback loops come to dominate the system with goal-seeking behavior. As such, an S-shaped pattern is attained. To control design changes at some point, some exploitation of past project experiences -such as best practices and lessons learned coupled with synergic team dynamics -can stop the growth. The causal loop diagrams developed from the critical variables for effective project communications and project learning from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> are presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> respectively. As is evident in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, effective project communication is capable of reducing schedule delays through team cohesion, collaborative culture, sharing of project experiences and a common understanding of problems (loops B1 and B2). It is worth mentioning that, although frequent design changes are detrimental to schedule performance, they demand intensified project communications between team members -a counterintuitive effect of team collaboration. Frequent face-to-face interactions and project meetings engender an effective communication of storytelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abdul-Rahman, Yahya, Berawi, &amp; Low, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Considering this, there is an aspect around the problematic design change events that offers excellent opportunities to elicit more communication and the collective sharing of lessons learned to enhance the likelihood of future project time savings. This collaborates with Akkermans and van Oorschot's (2016) observation in complex radical aircraft development projects that time lost due to rework cycles in past projects expedites team learning, which leads to higher productivity in future projects. A closer examination of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> manifests that project learning from experiences engenders knowledge reuse, resulting in better decision making that makes up a virtuous reinforcing loop R1. On the other hand, more learning from past projects will improve future project performance, as shown by balancing loop B1. Many studies, as discussed earlier, accentuate the significance of project learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abdul-Rahman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gasik, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Love et al., 2016)</ref> and it is apparent that collective learning depends on team cohesion and rich communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Anantatmula, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yap et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Yong &amp; Mustaffa, 2013)</ref>.  <ref type="table"></ref>and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">B4</ref>). However, it is also interesting to note that increased design change events generate added essential learning for the team. In line with the discussion above, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> explicitly explains the virtuous influence of active communications and continuous learning (loop B2) to mitigate schedule delays (loop B3).</p><p>However, a substantial delay in loop B3 and B4 may lead to unintended consequences.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Research into the Causes of Design Changes and Overruns</head><p>The present study aims to extend the understanding of the causes of design changes, and exploring control measures using communications and knowledge, by employing a systemic approach. However, while a significant amount of research has been carried out in the past to identify the major causes of overruns, the single or independent root cause evaluation is inadequate to contain frequent design changes. As asserted by Ahiaga-Dagbui et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>), these studies merely assess the 'events level' that is visible (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As noted earlier, in reality, most decisions and interventions take place at this reaction level. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Maani and Cavana (2007)</ref>, events simply represent the symptoms of complicated problems.</p><p>Therefore, quick fixes and fire-fighting policies reacting to events often only address superficial problems. It is therefore crucial for more studies to move to a deeper level in order to respond, design and transform the industry. With this in mind, instead of simply identifying and listing the critical variables involved, the dynamic interactions between the critical variables determined from the empirical study are further explored to provide insights into multiple cause-and-effect relationships. The CLDs for critical variables of design changes 4), design change-induced rework (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>), effective project communications (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>) and project learning (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>) provide alternative perspectives to understand the underlying dynamics of design changes and the preventive control measures from a systemic viewpoint, particularly examining the systemic structures involved. The conceptualized CLD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>) is useful for making sense of design changes and delay causation and mitigation through effective communication and project learning. In addition, this study makes a contribution to addressing the methodological weakness in mainstream time-cost overrun research in project management domain that lacks systems thinking and demonstrable causality as underscored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ahiaga-Dagbui et al. (2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications and Exploitation</head><p>This paper documents the critical causes of design changes in building projects and the effects of design change-induced rework on project performance. The use of the systemic thinking approach helps to address the critical variables more systematically. The conceptualized CLDs will support industry practitioners in appreciating the causal relationships of these significant variables with project outcomes. As the use of systems thinking tools by project managers is still limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Sheffield et al., 2012)</ref> and mostly researcher-led <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ackermann &amp; Alexander, 2016)</ref>, making an overwhelming complex CLDs have negative consequences on the comprehensibility and appreciation by managers in project-based settings. For the sake of both clarity and ease of better understanding, the simplicity of the conceptual CLDs presented in this paper help in framing the multiple relationships of the critical variables for better design change management. They also support the need for close collaboration and continuous learning in managing projects as propagated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Eriksson et al. (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Love and Smith (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Yap et al. (2018)</ref>. In essence, the conceptual CLDs demonstrate the cause and effect cycles of a complex problem into graphical representations that are easy to understand, as acknowledged by over 80% of the survey respondents in this empirical study. The increased understanding of the causes of design changes and the commendable benefits of effective communication and project learning have the potential to transform design change management in the global projectbased community. Thus, industry practitioners are advised to shift to a new form of practice and 'discover' for themselves the efficacy of project communications management towards collaborative team dynamics to exploit project knowledge management to enhance competencies in the quest to transform existing project management practices to attain the desired project performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future Studies</head><p>Design changes are inevitable in any construction project. However, frequent design changes during construction are extensively blamed for schedule delays and cost overruns worldwide.</p><p>Despite the plethora of studies involved over the years, efforts to contain the problem have yielded little success to date, partly attributable to the superficial and replicative traditional single-cause identification research without proffering solutions that has stagnated the development of a robust theory to mitigate the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahiaga-Dagbui et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Alsehaimi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Olaniran et al., 2015)</ref>. In response, this study adopts a systemic approach to understand the systemic and dynamic nature of design changes and explore the efficacy of communications and knowledge as strategic preventive measures for their control.</p><p>From the hybrid research strategy, the ten most significant causes of design changes, effects of design change-induced rework, critical variables of project communications and project learning are identified. A systemic thinking tool using causal loop diagram (CLD) is employed to represent the causal relationships of the critical variables explicitly. The conceptualized CLDs help make sense of the complex nature of the critical variables that in reality are influenced by multiple interdependencies. A thorough understanding of the multiple causal relationships involved is essential for devising intervention strategies.</p><p>The major contribution of this study is that it heeds the calls from various researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahiaga-Dagbui et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Maani &amp; Cavana, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Sheffield et al., 2012)</ref> for a crucial shift from the event level of thinking to deeper level of thinking to explore the patterns/trends and systemic structures to provide an understanding of how these factors interact. Reacting to the problem at the event level merely addresses the problem superficially. The ability to respond, design, and transform the perennial problem of frequent design changes is strengthened by deeper levels of thinking. In addition, the systemic approach using causal mapping in this study supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ackermann and Alexander's (2016)</ref> stated need for a pluralism of approaches in researching the management problems of construction projects to provide an understanding from a different perspective. The conceptualized CLD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>) supports the notion that project communication management engenders collaborative team dynamics and collective learning while project knowledge management contributes to the knowledge reuse and improved expert judgment needed for project controls in design change management.</p><p>This study is not without some limitations. The industry practitioners involved were sampled from the building sector. Thus, a generalization of the study's findings to other sectors such as infrastructure or hydrocarbon may be limited, although it is likely that the results will equally apply to such other similar flexible-design-change project-based industries as information technology, aerospace, marine shipyard, and defense. Nevertheless, this empirical study has provided insights into the underlying dynamics of design changes and their influence on project performance in construction and beyond.</p><p>As building projects are distinctively categorized into private and public sectors, future research may perhaps compare the causes of design changes, and the implications for project performance and practice in project communications management and project learning in both sectors. Hence, specific strategies could then be customized to meet the sectors' discrete requirements. To further understand the virtuous benefits of effective communication and project learning in design change management, it would be interesting to extend this research by exploring the influence of leadership styles, cultural contexts, and organizational issues in project communications and knowledge management.</p><p>The conceptualized CLDs can be further validated using real case studies and be extended as a pre-cursor to form stock and flow diagrams so that computer modelling with system dynamics tools can be employed, as the hard systems approach to investigating the quantum of the multiple relationships of the critical variables (identified in the current study) over time as well as to postulate and test strategies exploiting communications and knowledge in design change management and project time-cost control.</p></div>

It is evident that the causes have multiple interrelated relationships, with seven reinforcing loops, suggesting that the relationships are non-linear and the traditional net-effect correlational analysis are insufficient to cope with the systemicity of the design changes. The reinforcing loops R1 to R4 appear to be 'vicious loops' denoting that the critical variables need to be dealt with care as they act together to generate further design changes, resulting in lack of control of scope creep. Contrary to popular belief, the insight gained is that, although 'value engineering' is always considered to have a positive effect on controlling cost, the effects on project schedule are unfavorable, particularly due to rework.
