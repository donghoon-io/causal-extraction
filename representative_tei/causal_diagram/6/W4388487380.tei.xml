<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Numerous observational investigations have hinted at a possible link between Graves' disease (GD) and the susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes (T2D). The primary objective of this study was to explore the potential underlying causal connection between GD and T2D through the application of bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.</p><p>Materials and Methods: MR analysis was conducted with summary-level data from genomewide association studies (GWAS) for GD and T2D. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for GD were extracted from 458,620 (1,678 cases and 456,942 controls) Europeans in the NBC Human Database, and the summary-level data of T2D (180,834 cases and 1,159,055 controls) were extracted from the DIAGRAM consortium.</p><p>The primary analysis method was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. Heterogeneity and pleiotropy were considered to assess the causal relationship between GD and T2D. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The initial analysis found no significant causal relationship between GD and an increased risk of T2D (OR = 1.019, 95% CI (0.997,1.042); SE = 0.01, P= 0.373) . However, after sensitivity analyses and removal of outlier SNPs, a significant causal relationship was found (ORIVW = 1.017, 95% CI (1.002,1.033), P= 0.03, Cochran's Q= 7.8, p-value = 0.932, I = 0.0% ) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The study indicates a causal link between GD and an elevated T2D risk, underscoring the need for blood sugar monitoring and specialized care for GD patients.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) stands as a prevalent global health challenge, affecting approximately 9% of the global populace, with nearly 90% of cases attributed to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Furthermore, an alarming 22.9 million new T2D cases surfaced worldwide in 2017 <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Controlling the increasing T2D burden requires an insightful comprehension of its underlying etiology and risk factors <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Thyroid hormones assume a pivotal role in metabolic regulation, exerting both direct and indirect influences on insulin dynamics including production, secretion, and clearance.</p><p>Notably, hyperthyroidism engenders hyperglycemic states <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. Graves' disease (GD), an autoimmune disorder characterized by antibodies targeting the thyrotropin receptor, is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism. Observational studies have reported the comorbidity of thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus, with prevalence rates of thyroid dysfunction ranging from 10.8% to 13.4% within DM cohorts <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. Interestingly, a notable subset of hyperthyroidism cases transitions into DM. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between GD and DM remains yet to be elucidated, with most of the studies reporting the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in DM cohorts <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>.</p><p>Observational studies, as is inherent to their design, are susceptible to various biases, including confounding factors, study design intricacies, and the complexities of reverse causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(5)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the scarcity of conclusive causal evidence linking GD and T2D, the innovative approach of Mendelian randomization (MR) holds the potential to furnish insight. MR efficiently utilizes the genetic diversity that naturally affects thyroid function and the likelihood of developing T2D. This basis is reinforced by genetic elements that account for approximately 65% of the detected variations in Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free Thyroxine (Free T4) levels <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>.</p><p>This study uses the results of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to investigate the causal interplay between GD and T2D. In parallel, we also investigate the reciprocal relationship, exploring whether T2D increases vulnerability to GD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the causal relationship between GD and T2D using the MR approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>We were used a bidirectional MR analysis. Due to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, it is essential to assess the validity of these assumptions in every MR analysis <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>: 1) The SNPs chosen as instrumental variables (IVs) should have a strong association with exposure. 2) The IVs should not be related to the confounding factors that influence outcome and exposure association. 3) The effect of the IVs on outcome should be solely through their impact on exposure and not through a direct association with outcome.</p><p>MR analysis was employed to investigate the causal relationship between GD and T2D. GD as an autoimmune disorder that leads to overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), and T2D as a type of chronic metabolic disorder of insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels were assessed in this study.</p><p>The summary-level data for bidirectional MR analysis were obtained from the GWAS catalog database, namely Graves' disease (GCST90018847) and Type 2 diabetes (GCST90132184).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrumental SNPs selection</head><p>For extracting significant SNPs for GD, we used a relaxed GWAS threshold of p -value &lt; 5 × 10 (8, 9).

After clumping, SNPs that were missed in the outcome GWAS dataset were replaced with SNPs from the NIH LDproxy database according to EUR ancestry <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref>. The exposure and outcomes data were harmonized to ensure alleles were aligned, and the presence of ambiguous and palindromic variants was checked. Additionally, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.01 were omitted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Comorbidity is a common situation in clinical practice where certain medical conditions are frequently observed together. This often leads to the simultaneous identification of these cooccurring diseases by healthcare professionals. When diseases are comorbid, it suggests the possibility that they may have common causes and mechanisms. This understanding is particularly significant for determining appropriate treatment approaches for these interconnected diseases. In this study, we examined the potential cause-and-effect relationship between GD and T2D using the MR technique. The results indicated that GD, as a distinct medical condition, plays a causal role in the development of T2D. However, the bilateral relationship does not exist and we could not find a causal effect between T2D on GD.</p><p>Genetic factors play a crucial role in the onset of various diseases. Previous research has demonstrated that the concordance rates, which indicate the likelihood of both monozygotic twins developing T2D can be remarkably high, reaching up to 76% <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(22)</ref>. Moreover, extensive studies on GD involving twins have shown a significant concordance rate of 35% in monozygotic twins, in contrast to a mere 3% in dizygotic twins.</p><p>GWAS studies have shown a significant genetic susceptibility that overlaps across various tissues, particularly in the context of immune-related diseases like GD. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)</p><p>genes exert control over immune response-related genes, and the presence of HLA associations signifies their implication in autoimmunity. The HLA-DPA1*01:03-*01:03 and HLA-DPA1*01:03-02:01 alleles are associated with both T2D and GD <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(23)</ref>. Additionally, HLA DRB103 is proposed as a shared causative factor in both GD and T2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(24)</ref>. Furthermore, besides HLA genes, non-HLA genes also play an important role in development of these diseases. For instance, microsatellite polymorphisms in the PSMA6 is also associated with T2D on GD in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(25)</ref>.</p><p>The acknowledgment of the connection between hyperthyroidism and DM can be traced back to 1927, when it was initially observed by Coller and Huggins. In their study, they documented a series of 12 cases with DM and hyperthyroidism. They noted that hyperthyroidism exacerbated hyperglycemia in these individuals, and significant improvement in managing blood sugar levels was observed following thyroidectomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(26)</ref>.</p><p>The impact of thyroid hormones on glucose metabolism is well-established. Thyroid hormones play a direct and indirect role in regulating insulin secretion, glucose disposal and hepatic glucose output. In hyperthyroidism, many aspects of glucose metabolism are altered. Namely, the cleavage of C-peptide to pre-insulin is impaired <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(27)</ref> and the first response to glucose is lowered <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(28)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, consensus exists concerning the impact of thyroid hormones on hepatic insulin resistance. Early experiments conducted with hyperthyroid rat models revealed their incapacity to synthesize glycogen and inhibit hepatic glucose production in the fed state <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(29)</ref>. When compared to individuals with normal thyroid function (euthyroid patients), those with GD exhibit a significant 90% increase in fasting glucose production and a notable 50% reduction in the ability to suppress hepatic glucose production when insulin is administered (30).</p><p>It's important to note that the binding of insulin to hepatic receptors remains unaltered in the context of thyrotoxicosis. This suggests that the hepatic insulin resistance observed in thyrotoxicosis occurs downstream of the insulin receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(31)</ref>. Furthermore, triiodothyronine (T3) directly stimulates hepatic lipogenesis, which appears to be independent of insulin's influence.</p><p>This stimulation contributes to a cycle of continuous lipogenesis and lipid oxidation, ultimately promoting the development of ketoacidosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(32)</ref>.</p><p>However, it is noteworthy that in hepatocyte culture models exposed to excessive T3 levels, several insulin-dependent processes show decreased function. These include insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, insulin's ability to suppress gluconeogenesis, and insulin-induced lipogenesis , independent of T3 effects, all of which are compromised, indicating a state of insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(33)</ref>.</p><p>In adipose tissue, thyroid hormones (TH) have several effects. They enhance the process of lipid oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(34)</ref> and amplify the responsiveness of adipocytes to catecholamines, which in turn indirectly boosts the release of fatty acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(35)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, in skeletal muscles, TH has a different impact. It reduces the rate of glycogen synthesis and diverts glucose toward conversion into lactate, a process that contributes to the Cori cycle in the liver. Consequently, this redirection of glucose metabolism leads to an elevated output of glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(36)</ref> Despite the established evidence of insulin resistance in GD patients, the precise risk of developing new-onset DM in individuals with hyperthyroidism in real-world clinical practice remains uncertain There are only a few long-term studies examining the risk of DM in individuals with thyroid dysfunction with most of them primarily associating this risk with hypothyroidism rather than exploring its link to hyperthyroidism <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(39)</ref>.</p><p>In our study, we found a causal effect between GD on T2D, our results were in line with that of Remarkably, current guidelines for managing hyperthyroidism do not include recommendations for monitoring blood sugar levels or screening for diabetes in hyperthyroid patients Considering that individuals with longstanding GD have a notably higher susceptibility to diabetes compared to the general population, it is crucial to provide specific care and regular monitoring for the emergence of DM in these patients, especially those who have experienced prolonged periods of hyperthyroidism <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">41)</ref>.</p><p>Although the mechanisms of which the GD may impact T2D has been documented in the literature, studies regarding the effect of T2D on GD is scarce. Diabetes may impair thyroid function by reducing TSH level and inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 in the peripheral tissues. Diabetic ketoacidosis could also lower the T4 and T3 level (4), and it worth mentioning that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia enhance thyroid issue proliferation and hence can cause goiter and also increase the incidence of nodular thyroid disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(42)</ref>. Despite the effect of diabetes on thyroid function, the exact effect of T2D on GD is not well understood. The result of the present study also could not found any significant causal effect between T2D on GD (ORIVW = 1.118, 95% CI (0.987,1.271), P= 0.085).</p><p>The identification of a causal effect between GD on T2D calls for attention for a comprehensive approach to clinical management. To address this, it is beneficial to implement regular blood sugar monitoring in individuals with GD as a standard practice. Simultaneously, healthcare professionals should emphasize lifestyle modifications, including dietary improvements and increased physical activity, which can help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of T2D development.</p><p>Patient education about the GD-T2D connection is vital to promote proactive self-care. Long-term surveillance programs, can detect potential T2D cases early, enabling timely intervention. Further research on the mechanisms linking GD and T2D is crucial for developing targeted therapies and interventions that minimize the T2D risk in GD patients. These measures can not only lower T2D incidence but also enhance the overall quality of life of the individuals living with GD.</p><p>This study boasts several notable strengths. Firstly, it leverages data from well-established and extensively-utilized GWAS databases, which are renowned for their reliability and encompass considerable sample sizes. The use of such robust data sources enhances the study's scientific rigor and the confidence in its findings. Secondly, the application of the two-sample MR method, where genetic variants serve as instrumental variables, contributes to the study's methodological robustness. This approach effectively diminishes the influence of confounding factors, ensuring that the observed relationships are more likely to be causal in nature. Moreover, the study incorporates sensitivity analyses and evaluates pleiotropy, which are critical steps in strengthening the reliability of the results. By systematically assessing the possibility of bias from outliers and considering the multifaceted effects of instrumental variables, the study demonstrates a comprehensive and thorough research approach.</p><p>Despite these strengths, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations within the study. One notable limitation is the reliance on GWAS data primarily derived from European populations.</p><p>While these data sources provide valuable insights, their generalizability to other ethnic groups may be restricted. As such, caution is warranted when applying the study's findings to populations with different genetic backgrounds and environmental contexts. Additionally, the use of GWAS data introduces potential challenges related to population stratification and relatedness. Even though extensive efforts were made to account for these issues, there remains the possibility of residual bias stemming from these sources. It is crucial to recognize that despite the study's robust methodology; the results should be interpreted with caution due to these limitations. Furthermore, due to the cross-sectional origin of this study, it cannot determine the effect of the duration of the clinical or subclinical hyperthyroidism on T2D and how the amount of time the disease stays in remission affects the causality of GD on T2D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, we conducted a comprehensive bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the intricate relationship between GD and T2D. we reported a causal association, suggesting that GD increases the risk of developing T2D. These results highlight the clinical IR.SBMU.ENDOCRINE.REC.1400.084). In this study, all participants provided written informed consent for participating in the study.

Genomewide significance means that the SNP is highly associated with exposure. Clumping: Clumping involves selecting a subset of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with the primary SNP. Replacing Proxies: Sometimes, the initial genomewide significant SNP is not qualified as an instrumental variable due to issues like pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs. In such cases, the primary SNP is replaced with a proxy SNP that has a similar effect on the exposure but fewer issues. Harmonization Step: Data harmonization is the process of standardizing genetic data from different sources or studies to ensure compatibility. This step is crucial when combining data from multiple datasets. Removing HLA Gene: The HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) gene region is known for its extensive genetic diversity and complex associations with various traits. In MR analysis, it's common to exclude SNPs in the HLA region to minimize potential confounding or pleiotropic effects. Check Phenoscanner: Phenoscanner is a tool used to explore genetic associations with various phenotypes, which can provide insights into pleiotropy. Removing Weak Instrument: It's crucial to assess the strength of the selected genetic instrument(s) by checking for the F-statistic or MAF value. Weak instruments can lead to imprecise estimates, so we removed them from the analysis. Detect outliers: MRPRESSO and the Radial Test aim to improve the robustness of Mendelian randomization by identifying and addressing potential sources of bias due to pleiotropy. By detecting and correcting for outliers, these methods help ensure more accurate causal inference in MR analyses. Additionally, SNPs with high Cook's distances were checked more closely. If these SNPs are identified as influential outliers, they are candidates for exclusion from the MR analysis. Finally, it's essential to use a combination of statistical techniques and biological knowledge to make informed decisions about which SNPs to include or exclude in MR analyses.  Table1.

Figure1shows the framework of two sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis is based on several key assumptions. 1: The genetic variations are strongly associated with exposure; 2: The genetic variations are not associated with either known or unknown confounders; 3: SNPs should influence risk of the outcome through the exposure, not through other pathways. The green line represented the Mendelian randomization analysis of the association of GD with T2D. The red line represented the Mendelian randomization analysis of the association of T2D with GD.</figDesc><graphic coords="20,132.00,90.48,347.28,189.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure2: Selecting an appropriate instrumental variable (IV) in Mendelian randomization is a crucial step because the validity of your causal inference depends on it. Here are the key steps involved in the selection of an IV in Mendelian randomization. Genome-Wide Significant SNP: In this step, researchers identify a genetic variant (SNP) that is genome-wide significant in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the exposure of interest. Genomewide significance means that the SNP is highly associated with exposure. Clumping: Clumping involves selecting a subset of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with the primary SNP. Replacing Proxies: Sometimes, the initial genomewide significant SNP is not qualified as an instrumental variable due to issues like pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs. In such cases, the primary SNP is replaced with a proxy SNP that has a similar effect on the exposure but fewer issues. Harmonization Step: Data harmonization is the process of standardizing genetic data from different sources or studies to ensure compatibility. This step is crucial when combining data from multiple datasets. Removing HLA Gene: The HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) gene region is known for its extensive genetic diversity and complex associations with various traits. In MR analysis, it's common to exclude SNPs in the HLA region to minimize potential confounding or pleiotropic effects.
