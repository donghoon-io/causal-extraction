<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Observational studies examining causal effects rely on unverifiable causal assumptions, the violation of which can induce multiple biases. Quantitative bias analysis (QBA) methods examine the sensitivity of findings to such violations, generally by producing bias-adjusted estimates under alternative assumptions. Common strategies for QBA address either a single source of bias or multiple sources one at a time, thus not informing the overall impact of the potential biases. We propose a systematic approach (roadmap) for identifying and analysing multiple biases together. Briefly, this consists of (i) articulating the assumptions underlying the primary analysis through specification and emulation of the "ideal trial" that defines the causal estimand of interest and depicting these assumptions using casual diagrams; (ii) depicting alternative assumptions under which biases arise using causal diagrams; (iii) obtaining a single estimate simultaneously adjusted for all biases under the alternative assumptions. We illustrate the roadmap in an investigation of the effect of breastfeeding on risk of childhood asthma. We further use simulations to evaluate a recent simultaneous adjustment approach and illustrate the need for simultaneous rather than one-at-a-time adjustment to examine the overall impact of biases. The proposed roadmap should facilitate the conduct of high-quality multiple bias analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many epidemiological studies aim to quantify the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome, often relying on unverifiable causal assumptions. Violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic bias -a discrepancy between the expected value of the causal effect estimate and the true (unknown) value. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Quantitative bias analysis (QBA) aims to examine the sensitivity of findings to violations of the assumptions made in the primary analysis, generally by producing bias-adjusted estimates under alternative assumptions. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> A common strategy in practice involves analysing a single type of bias (producing a single bias-adjusted estimate) or multiple biases one at a time (producing multiple bias-adjusted estimates). <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> Given that different biases do not necessarily act independently of each other or in the same direction, both these strategies can lead to invalid conclusions about the overall effect of biases. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3</ref> A multiple bias modelling approach can account for dependencies between different sources of bias, generating a single estimate simultaneously adjusted for all biases. However, there is a stark lack of guidance for systematically identifying multiple biases, and multiple-bias modelling methods are scant. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> A recent approach quantifies bounds, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> but all bias-bounding approaches examine "worst-case" scenarios that are implausible in the real world. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> Another approach is to sequentially adjust for the different biases, in the reverse order in which the biases are assumed to have occurred. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The final estimate will vary depending on the order chosen <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> , which poses challenges for many settings where ascertaining a plausible order is difficult. Recently, an approach that can simultaneously adjust for multiple biases has been developed, but evaluations and applications of this method are limited. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> This work seeks to substantially expand the currently limited guidance for identifying and analysing multiple biases appropriately. First, we propose a roadmap for systematically identifying and analysing multiple biases (see Box 1) and illustrate the roadmap using a case study investigating the effect of breastfeeding on risk of childhood asthma. Second, we investigate the performance of the recent simultaneous bias-adjustment approach using an extensive simulation study based on the case study. The simulations assess, across a range of scenarios, the extent to which the method corrects bias in causal effect estimates of the risk ratio and risk difference under the alternative correct assumptions, and how one-at-atime bias adjustment compares in this regard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminaries: Illustrative case study example and target estimands</head><p>We consider a case study based on a published investigation <ref type="bibr">10</ref> from the HealthNuts cohort study, a prospective observational study of 5279 infants aged 11-15 months recruited via immunization clinics in Melbourne, Australia from 2007-2011 and followed up at ages 4, 6 and 10 years. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Here we focus on the specific question: To what extent does any (versus no) breastfeeding in the first 12 months reduce the risk of asthma at 6 years?</p><p>Let 𝐴 denote a binary indicator for whether the infant was breastfed (𝐴 = 1) in the first 12 months or not (𝐴 = 0), and let 𝑌 denote the binary outcome, with 𝑌 = 1 if child is diagnosed with asthma by age 6, and 𝑌 = 0 otherwise. Although 𝐴 summarises a timevarying behaviour over 12 months, under the plausible assumption that breastfeeding is either established in the first one to two weeks or is never established, <ref type="bibr">12</ref> it is equivalent to an indicator of breastfeeding initiation in those first weeks. This allows us to consider "any breastfeeding" as a (single time-) point exposure, which is the focus of the paper.</p><p>Our target estimand is the average causal effect (ACE) in the population of all neonates born in Melbourne in 2006 -2010 who may be able to be breastfed, specifically the causal risk difference is P(𝑌 1 = 1) -Pr(𝑌 0 = 1), and the causal risk ratio P(𝑌 1 = 1)/Pr(𝑌 0 = 1), where 𝑌 𝑎 is the potential outcome when intervening to set the exposure 𝐴 to the value 𝑎.</p><p>In the absence of missing data, causal consistency, positivity and conditional exchangeability given a selected set of confounders 𝑪, the causal risk difference and the causal ratio are identifiable from observable data based on the g-formula: 𝑃(𝑌 𝑎 = 1) = ∑ 𝑃(𝑌 = 1|𝐴 = 𝑎, 𝑪 = 𝒄) × 𝑃(𝑪 = 𝒄) 𝒄 . <ref type="bibr">13</ref> This implies that unbiased estimation is possible using a number of methods <ref type="bibr">13</ref> . We focus on outcome regression, given its widespread use <ref type="bibr">14</ref> and that the simultaneous bias-adjustment approach studied in this paper (detailed in section 5.1) has been implemented with outcome-regression in previous studies <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref> . The outcome regression models have mean specification as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pr(𝑌 = 1|𝐴 = 𝑎, 𝑪 = 𝒄) = 𝛽 0 𝑅𝐷 + 𝛽 1 𝑅𝐷 𝐴 + 𝜷 𝟐 𝑹𝑫 ′𝑪 log[ Pr(𝑌 = 1|𝐴 = 𝑎, 𝑪 = 𝒄)] = 𝛽 0 𝑅𝑅 + 𝛽 1 𝑅𝑅 𝐴 + 𝜷 𝟐 𝑹𝑹 ′𝑪<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝛽 1 𝑅𝐷 and 𝑒 𝛽 1 𝑅𝑅 equal the causal risk difference and ratio, respectively, if the outcome models in (1) are correctly specified and there is no effect-measure modification across strata of 𝑪 (in addition to the above-mentioned assumptions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systematic determination of assumptions in the primary analysis and depicting these using DAGs</head><p>The first step of the roadmap involves systematically identifying all assumptions underlying the analysis. To facilitate this step, we propose defining the ideal randomized trial which, as we have argued elsewhere, defines the causal effect of ultimate interest in any causal study. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using the ideal trial to articulate assumptions for the primary analysis</head><p>The ideal trial is a hypothetical trial with an infinite and representative sample, perfect adherence and follow-up, and no missing data or measurement error. It is defined by specifying its protocol components: eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome measure. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The ideal trial defines the target causal effect, i.e. the referent for consideration of biases. The observational analysis can then be seen as an attempt to emulate the ideal trial. The emulation of each component will rarely be perfect, with systematic bias avoided only under unverifiable identifiability assumptions. By considering the emulation of each protocol component in turn, we can determine all the identifiability assumptions and assess their plausibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directed acyclic graphs</head><p>Once the identifying assumptions are systematically recognised, it is helpful to depict these using a DAG. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Briefly, DAGs are graphs with nodes representing variables (and their measurements thereof) related to the research question of interest, (e.g., treatments, outcome, covariates, missingness indicators) connected by arrows, which depict assumed causal relationships between variables. DAGs are especially useful in understanding how biases may enter an analysis as described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> (see section 4). Note that the primary analysis assumes no biases under its assumptions as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. Comprehensive reviews and tutorials on DAGs can be found elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref> Application to the case study First, we detail features of the published analysis that are relevant for examining potential biases, along with notation for related variables. Firstly, the HealthNuts cohort and thus the study only included children with consent (denoted by 𝑆; 1: yes, 0:no) from a guardian who was able to speak and understand English (denoted by 𝐸; 1: yes, 0:no). Second, the study relied on parental reports of breastfeeding (𝐴 * ), and asthma (𝑌 * ), as more objective measures (e.g. doctor diagnosis) were not collected by the investigators. Third, a potential confounder, pre-exposure hypertension (𝑈; 1: presence, 0: absence), was not measured. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Fourth, there was substantial loss to follow-up, leading to missing data in 𝑌 * (denoted by response indicator 𝑅 𝑦 ; where 𝑅 𝑦 = 1 if 𝑌 * observed and 𝑅 𝑦 = 0 otherwise).</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> we outline the protocol components for what we conceive as the ideal trial capturing the estimand of ultimate interest in the published study (column 1), as well as their emulation, as implicit in the published primary analysis (column 2) and the corresponding identifiability assumptions (column 3). *Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> below shows the assumed DAG under the primary analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>*Figure 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using causal diagrams to depict the assumptions of the primary analysis and identify potential sources of bias under assumption violations</head><p>The second step of the roadmap involves considering the plausible violations of the assumptions in the primary analysis (i.e. the sources of biases) and depicting these graphically using DAGs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal biases and their graphical structures</head><p>Causal biases can be broadly categorised into three types, each stemming from distinct processes: selection, confounding and measurement (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The different biases can be depicted using DAGs, generally as arising from open non-causal pathways from A to Y, except in certain cases as explained in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>  *Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> *Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> Application to the case study Below we consider the plausible violations of the assumptions made in the primary analysis as identified in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> and hypothesise their structure by proposing an alternative DAG (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3*</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection bias</head><p>The primary analysis assumes that infants recruited to HealthNuts in 2007-2011 are representative of all infants aged 1 year born in Melbourne in 2006 -2010 who may be able to be breastfed (see eligibility criteria in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Given the high immunization rates in Victoria during this period <ref type="bibr">21</ref> , and the low infant mortality <ref type="bibr">22</ref> , we assume differences between the study sample and the target population due to these factors are minimal and resulting selection bias (if any) is negligible, so we do not consider possible violations in the alternative DAG. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Additionally, the primary analysis did not exclude infants who may not be able to be breastfed (subgroup 1: infant unable to ingest or digest breastmilk; subgroup 2: mother unable to breastfeed), as data on these factors were not available. Therefore, there is a possible positivity violation in the emulation (subgroup 1), with a form of Type II selection bias possible due to extrapolation if the effect in these subgroups is not defined (subgroup 1) or different (subgroup 2). However, the size of subgroup 1 is expected to be small and we do not expect a different effect in subgroup 2, so these biases are expected to be negligible, and we do not consider them in the alternative DAG.</p><p>On the other hand, the study was restricted to infants with consent from a guardian, 𝑆 = 1, who can speak/understand English, 𝐸 = 1, but the primary analysis assumed no effect measure modification by these variables (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). However, parents who consented were more likely to have infants with a history of eczema, which is a potential effect measure modifier (i.e. the effect of breastfeeding on asthma could be different among those with eczema and no eczema). <ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> This implies a likelihood of effect measure modification by proxy for 𝑆, in which case the primary analysis estimate is subject to Type II selection bias (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). If 𝐸 (which is a strong proxy for ethnicity) is an effect measure modifier, a similar bias can arise. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> thus depicts the plausibility of 𝐸 and 𝑆 being effect measure modifiers and in bias analyses we consider this in the risk difference scale (which implies effect measure modification also in the risk ratio scale <ref type="bibr">13</ref> ) .</p><p>The primary analysis assumed that missingness in the outcome was only dependent on the observed variables, 𝐶 and 𝐴 * . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> considers potential collider-stratification (selection) bias due to missingness in the outcome being additionally dependent on the outcome, which is plausible through unmeasured common causes of the outcome and missingness in the outcome such as healthcare-seeking behaviours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confounding bias</head><p>The primary analysis adjusted for a set of measured confounders. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> depicts a potential unmeasured confounder due to unmeasured gestational hypertension (U) <ref type="bibr">20</ref> , a common cause of breastfeeding practices and child asthma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement error</head><p>The primary analysis assumes perfect measurement of exposure and outcome. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> depicts potential measurement error due to parent reports of the outcome and exposure.</p><p>Although adjusting for 𝑪 in the primary analysis renders the measurement error to be nondifferential and independent given 𝑪, this does not preclude measurement bias. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> In general, measurement error will lead to bias, except when the errors are non-differential and independent, and there is no causal effect of 𝐴 on 𝑌. <ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">25</ref> Quantitative multiple bias analysis A range of analytic approaches for QBA is available. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">26</ref> The majority of these approaches involve correcting the effect estimates obtained from study data to produce a "biasadjusted" estimate and require so-called bias parameters. <ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28</ref> Bias parameters stipulate the strength and direction of the association between observed and unobserved data under alternative assumptions. Different bias parameters are required for the different types of bias (e.g., see Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). By their nature, bias parameters cannot be estimated directly from observed data and therefore need to be informed by expert opinion, substantive literature, or internal/external validation data. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Investigators may treat bias parameters as fixed (simple bias analysis), vary them systematically across a range of plausible values (multidimensional bias analysis), or conduct a probabilistic bias analysis in which a (joint) prior probability distribution is assigned to the bias parameter(s) followed by a Bayesian analysis or utilisation of a Monte Carlo sampling procedure. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> In the following section we review a flexible approach recently introduced by Brendel et al <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref> that can simultaneously adjust for multiple biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simultaneous bias-adjustment method</head><p>The approach works by expressing the desired joint probability (or model), which involves variables of the ideal trial that in the study are unobserved, incomplete and/or mismeasured, as the product of the joint probability of the observed variables and a biasadjusting probability that depends on bias parameters according to the assumed alternative assumptions. This enables derivation of an expression for the bias-adjusting probability that is then used to generate values for the full (ideal) data under the alternative assumptions and thereby obtain bias-adjusted estimates. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Below we describe the steps involved in a setting like the case study, where Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> depicts the alternative assumptions (in grey):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Step 1. Derive an expression for the bias-adjusting probability and posit bias models</head><p>In a setting like the case study, the desired joint probability is P(𝑌 = 𝑦, 𝐴 = 𝑎, 𝑪 = 𝒄, 𝑈 = 𝑢) and the observed joint probability is P(𝑌 * = 𝑦 * , 𝐴 * = 𝑎 * , 𝐶 = 𝑐|𝐸 = 1, 𝑅 𝑦 = 1). Let 𝜋 denote the bias-adjusting probability such that the desired joint probability is the product of 𝜋 and the observed joint probability. That is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝜋 = P(𝑌 = 𝑦, 𝐴 = 𝑎, 𝑪 = 𝒄, 𝑈 = 𝑢) P(𝑌 * = 𝑦 * , 𝐴 * = 𝑎 * , 𝐶 = 𝑐|𝑆 = 1, 𝐸 = 1, 𝑅 𝑦 = 1)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Based on the assumptions encoded in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, 𝜋 can be expressed as follows (see supplementary files for detailed steps): </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝜋 = P(𝑈 = 𝑢|𝐴,</formula><p>In the above model(s) for 𝑆 (and 𝐸), an interaction between 𝐴 * and 𝑌 * is included to allow for the association between 𝑆 (and 𝐸) and 𝑌 * to vary across levels of 𝐴 * and vice versa, reflecting the potential effect measure modification of the association between 𝐴 and 𝑌 by 𝑆 (and 𝐸). The regression coefficients of bias models are bias parameters and as such have to be assigned values or distributions that are elicited from external information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Step 2. Impute the unobserved variables and derive selection weights for each individual</head><p>The unobserved/incomplete/mismeasured variables 𝑈, 𝐴, 𝑌 are imputed for each record based on the corresponding bias models in (3) using the elicited values for the bias parameters and the observed data. In our example, with binary 𝑈, 𝐴 and 𝑌, the imputations are created by sampling from a Bernoulli trial for each patient with success probability set to the predicted probability from the corresponding bias model.</p><p>Selection probabilities are estimated from the corresponding bias models for 𝐸 and 𝑅 𝑦 using the elicited values for the bias parameters and the observed data. These can be multiplied if assumed independent as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, and then used to derive inverse probability weights for each record in the analytic sample: 𝑊 ̂= 1/[𝑃 ̂(𝑆 = 1|𝐴 * , 𝑌 * ) × 𝑃 ̂(𝐸 = 1|𝐴 * , 𝑌 * ) × 𝑃 ̂(𝑅 𝑦 = 1|𝐴 * , 𝑌 * , 𝑪)]. These weights are used in the next step to create a pseudopopulation that is representative of the target population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Step 3. Perform weighted outcome regression</head><p>The bias-adjusted estimates of the causal risk ratio and the risk difference under the alternative assumptions can be obtained by fitting the outcome regression models in (1) to the imputed data using weighting.</p><p>The uncertainty in the bias parameters can be incorporated in the final estimate using a probabilistic approach. First, bias parameters are sampled from a plausible distribution over a number of replications, then Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for each draw, producing multiple bias-adjusted effect estimates. A simulation interval (SI) can be calculated using the range of estimates (e.g., the 2.5 th and the 97.5 th percentiles as the 95% SI) 2 . To also incorporate sampling variability into the SI, the bias-adjustment procedure can be replicated over bootstrap samples or via a normal approximation as detailed elsewhere. 9,28</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application to the case study</head><p>We applied simultaneous and one-at-a-time bias adjustments to the case study, both using analytic method described in Section 5.1 (but latter strategy considering one type of bias at a time) with a probabilistic approach, considering the assumptions depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>.</p><p>Where available, the key bias parameter distributions were obtained via a literature search and cross-checked with substantive context experts; otherwise, they were elicited from experts [see Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>]. Other bias parameters were set to approximations based on the observed data. Sampling variability was incorporated by repeating the procedure over 1000 bootstraps.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows results for the bias analyses alongside those for the primary analysis.</p><p>Although the results across approaches were only minimally different, the simultaneous adjustment approach resulted in somewhat stronger causal effect estimates, suggesting a larger reduction in risk of asthma under any breastfeeding versus not, compared with oneat-a-time adjustments as well as the primary analysis.</p><p>*Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> Simulation study</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation study aims and design</head><p>We conducted a simulation study where our aim was two-fold. First, we wanted to assess performance of the simultaneous adjustment approach described in Section 5.1 in estimating the causal risk ratio and difference under different strengths of bias and misspecification of bias parameters in complex and realistic scenarios mimicking the case study. Second, we wanted to compare simultaneous adjustment approach to the more common strategy of one-at-a-time bias adjustments. As in Section 5.2, for we used the analytic method described in Section 5.1. In the simulation study, for brevity, we only consider one type of generalizability (selection) bias, specifically due to restriction to those with parents/guardians who can speak and understand English.</p><p>A detailed description of data generation procedure is provided in supplementary files [Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>]. All parameter values in the data generation models were set to approximations based on the observed data except for those listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. As these parameters are likely to exert the greatest influence on the biases, data were generated under two different simulation scenarios: a "realistic" scenario, where parameter values were derived based on a literature review and cross-checking with substantive context experts (see Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> for relevant references), and an "enhanced" scenario, where values were simultaneously increased by doubling the deviations of values under the realistic scenario from the corresponding null value (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>*Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> The true values of the ACE under each simulation scenario were computed empirically using models in (1) to a large synthetic population (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). To assess robustness to misspecification of bias parameters, in each scenario, both strategies (simultaneous, one-ata-time) were implemented applying the correct bias parameters (estimated by fitting the models in (3) to a large synthetic population) and then repeated with all bias parameters multiplied by 2. For simplicity, in the simulations we considered the bias parameters to be fixed. The estimates of the risk ratio and difference obtained were compared with the true values to compute for each analytic strategy: bias, relative bias, empirical standard error(SE) , model-based SE, coverage probability of the 95% confidence interval and bias-eliminated coverage (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> for definitions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation study results</head><p>With correct bias parameters, in both scenarios, the simultaneous bias adjustment strategy resulted in approximately unbiased estimates of the (log) risk ratio and coverage close to nominal values (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> for realistic scenario, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">S2</ref> for enhanced scenario). For the risk difference, although coverage was close to nominal values, some bias was observed. Meanwhile, all one-at-a-time bias-adjustments produced estimates of the risk difference and risk ratio with large relative biases and also exhibited undercoverage. For the risk difference, one-at-a-time adjustments produced bias-eliminated coverage probabilities at nominal levels, with empirical and model-based SEs that were close, indicating that the poor coverage observed was due to bias in point estimates. Similar observations apply to results for the (log) risk ratio, except with one-at-a-time adjustments for measurement error in the outcome where model-based SEs exhibited large deviations from the empirical SEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>*Table 4</head><p>With incorrect bias parameters, as expected, all approaches including the simultaneous approach resulted in considerable bias and severe undercoverage for the (log) risk ratio and the risk difference (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">S3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_12">S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper we introduced a three-step roadmap for facilitating the systematic identification and simultaneous analysis of multiple potential sources of bias and illustrated it using a real case study. The steps include identifying all assumptions in the primary analysis through specification and emulation of the ideal trial and depicting these using DAGs, <ref type="bibr">16</ref> , considering the plausible alternative assumptions and depicting these using DAGs to assess under which assumption violations causal biases might arise, and obtaining a single bias-adjusted estimate simultaneously considering the multiple biases. We also illustrated via simulations how the common strategy of one-at-a-time bias adjustments can lead to estimates with large remaining biases and poor coverage, thus resulting in invalid conclusions about the potential impact of bias on study findings. In contrast, a simultaneous adjustment approach provided approximately unbiased estimates when the bias parameters were correctly specified.</p><p>The ideal trial in the first step of the roadmap is defined as the hypothetical, perfect randomized experiment that would truly answer the ultimate scientific question of interest. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> As such the eligibility criteria must characterise the target population for which inference is ultimately sought, and the ideal trial must also have perfect adherence, and no missing data or measurement error (e.g. the outcome measure must be the gold standard measure that would be used in practice, even in the absence of data mapping to these protocol components). This is different to a recently recommended approach to target trials, <ref type="bibr">29</ref> but is necessary to systematically assess all potential sources of bias. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We operationalized the final step of the road map using a recent simultaneous biasadjustment approach. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In contrast to the previous evaluations of this approach in estimating an odds ratio, <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref> we observed some biases, particularly in estimating the risk difference. This could be due to the use of a regression-based estimator for this estimand which does not guarantee the probabilities from these models to be bounded between 0 and 1. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> A solution for this could be to use an approach like G-computation for obtaining estimates in the final step of the simultaneous adjustment approach. Implementation and evaluation of the simultaneous adjustment approach in conjunction with such estimators would be a useful area of future research. In line with previous simulations, <ref type="bibr">9</ref> when bias parameters were misspecified, the simultaneous approach produced large biases and poor coverage, indicating the need to incorporate uncertainty in the bias parameters byway of a probabilistic approach.</p><p>The final step of the roadmap could in theory be operationalised using the sequential approach described earlier. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> However, to our knowledge existing implementations of this approach rely on simplistic causal assumptions. The sequential approach has been compared to the simultaneous approach under such simplistic causal assumptions (e.g. measurement error in exposure dependant only on the true exposure, selection only dependant on exposure and outcome etc.), <ref type="bibr">9</ref> and was shown to perform similarly when using the "true" order of biases. Extending the sequential approach to handle multiple biases under more realistic and complex causal assumptions (e.g., as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>), and comparing it with the simultaneous approach under such assumptions is a potential area of future research.</p><p>An obvious caveat in performing simultaneous bias analyses is the requirement of specifying distributions for many bias parameters. Our case study illustrates how investigators can make a reasonable attempt to source and justify bias parameter distributions [see Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>].</p><p>However, further research on approaches for calibrating marginal parameters sourced from external sources to conditional bias parameters, as available for other sensitivity analysis methods, <ref type="bibr">31</ref> are required to enable wider application of the simultaneous bias-adjustment approach.</p><p>All studies assessing causal effects either explicitly or implicitly make causal assumptions that, if violated, may result in biases with respect to the estimand of interest. Investigators should move beyond simply making qualitative statements about the possible biases in their studies and quantitatively demonstrate the robustness of their results to multiple possible biases simultaneously. This would allow greater transparency to readers and journal editors in identifying areas for improvement and inform future research efforts. The roadmap presented can aid in this pursuit by providing a systematic guide to the necessary steps.</p></div>
