<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A key component of epidemiological research is causal inference from longitudinal studies, where the objective is often to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) of an exposure on an outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> For a binary exposure (X=1 exposed; X=0 unexposed), the ACE can be defined as the difference in the average potential outcome if all were exposed versus unexposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> In the absence of missing data, under the assumptions of conditional exchangeability given a vector of measured confounders Z, consistency, and positivity, the ACE is identifiable from observable data by the g-formula E[E(Y|X = 1, Z) -E(Y|X = 0, Z)],</p><p>where Y is the outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Several singly robust approaches, including g-computation and propensity score methods, and doubly robust estimators, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), are available for ACE estimation in the absence of missing data. Here, we focus on TMLE, which combines models for the outcome and propensity score.(7-9) A detailed description of TMLE is available elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Briefly, the first step is the same as in g-computation, where a model for the expected outcome conditional on exposure and confounders (E / [Y|X, Z]) is estimated and used to predict outcome for all records under exposure and no exposure. In g-computation these predictions are directly plugged into the g-formula to estimate the ACE. In TMLE, they are updated using information from the propensity score (P / [X = 1|Z]) (the targeting step), before being plugged into the g-formula. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> The targeting step in TMLE ensures that the estimator is doubly robust, where only one of the two models (outcome or propensity model) needs to be consistently estimated to ensure consistent estimation of the ACE. Unlike with singly robust methods, data-adaptive approaches (e.g. machine learning methods) can be used for the exposure and outcome models in TMLE as long as the Donsker class condition (requiring that outcome and propensity score estimators do not heavily overfit the data) holds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Given these desirable properties, interest in the application of TMLE for ACE estimation is growing.</p><p>Missing data are ubiquitous in epidemiological studies and can lead to biased estimates and loss of precision if handled inappropriately. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> Commonly used approaches for handling missing data in studies using TMLE for ACE estimation include multiple imputation (MI; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>), complete-case analysis (CCA; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>), extending TMLE to handle missing outcome data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>), and the missing covariate missing indicator (MCMI) approach for handling missing confounder data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>). No study has compared these methods in terms of bias and precision. Also, while a requirement for valid inference with MI is that the imputation model should incorporate all relationships assumed to hold in the analysis method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> the optimal implementation of MI when using TMLE with data-adaptive methods for ACE estimation is unknown. Answers to these questions are key to developing guidance for appropriate handling of missing data in the context of the growing use of TMLE in applied epidemiological research.</p><p>In the current paper, we sought to address this knowledge gap using a simulation study based on an illustrative example from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study (VAHCS). Our interest was to compare the performance of readily available missing data methods to inform current practice. We begin by introducing the VAHCS example, then describe methods for handling missing data with TMLE, present the simulation study we conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these approaches, then illustrate the assessed approaches in the VAHCS example. We conclude with a general discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Illustrative example</head><p>Our example was based on a previous investigation using data from VAHCS, a longitudinal cohort study of 1,943 participants (1,000 females), recruited in 1992-1993 at ages14-15 years.( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) Data were collected during participants' adolescence (waves one-six) and in young adulthood (1998, wave seven). Investigators aimed to estimate the ACE of frequent cannabis use in adolescent females on mental health in young adulthood, measured using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R). We revisited this analysis using TMLE with data-adaptive approaches, using the same confounders considered in the original investigation: parental divorce, antisocial behaviour, depression and anxiety, alcohol use, parental education, all measured across waves two to six. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows descriptive statistics for analysis variables, and age at wave two, which is useful as an auxiliary variable in MI (a predictor of missing values but not included in the analysis method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>). All variables had some degree of missingness, ranging from 0.1% to 30.8%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods for handling missing data in TMLE</head><p>Approaches proposed for handling missing data when estimating the ACE using TMLE in studies like our example are described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-MI approaches</head><p>Complete-case analysis (CCA): only records with complete data for target analysis variables are used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> This approach generally leads to loss of precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and, depending on missingness mechanism, may inflict bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> Extended TMLE in a sample with complete exposure and confounders (Ext-TMLE+CEC): records with missing data for Z and X are deleted. From records with complete data on Y, E[Y|X, Z] is estimated. In the targeting step, the predictions of the outcome are updated using information from models for P[X=1|Z] and P[M ! =0|X,Z], where M ! is the missingness indicator for the outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> Updated predictions for the outcome under exposure and no exposure are obtained for all records, regardless of whether they have missing outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> The model for M ! can also be fitted using data-adaptive approaches. With missingness only in the outcome, the extended TMLE method is unbiased under an extended exchangeability assumption (Y " ∐ M ! |X, Z and Y " ∐ X|Z for x = 0,1, where Y " is the potential outcome when X = x, and ∐ denotes independence). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> Extended TMLE plus missing covariate missing indicator (MCMI) approach (Ext-TMLE+MCMI): missing outcome data are handled using the extended TMLE approach, and missing confounder data by including missingness indicators for the incomplete confounders in the confounding adjustment set. Records with missing exposure data are excluded. In settings with complete exposure and outcome data, the MCMI approach can be expected to yield an unbiased ACE estimate under an extended exchangeability assumption (Y " ∐ X|Z, M # forx = 0,1, where M # is the vector of missingness indicators for the incomplete confounders), and the assumption that the exposure or outcome depend on the confounder only when the confounder is observed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref> This assumption is plausible in some settings, such as electronic health record data where the decision to prescribe a medication might be influenced by family history of disease only when the clinician has the relevant information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MI approaches</head><p>The MI fully conditional specification (FCS) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> enables simultaneous handling of missing exposure, confounder, and outcome data. Under this approach, univariate imputation models are specified for each incomplete variable conditional on other variables and imputations are drawn sequentially until convergence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> The process is repeated multiple times to generate multiple completed datasets. Analysis is performed within each completed dataset and the results are pooled using Rubin's rules to obtain the final estimate and its standard error (SE).( <ref type="formula">24</ref>) For valid inference with MI, each univariate imputation model should be tailored to be compatible with the analysis method. To achieve this, all analysis variables and complexities such as interaction terms in the target analysis should be included as predictors in each univariate imputation model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> There are various possible implementations of MI within the FCS framework:</p><p>Parametric MI with no interaction (MI-no int): each univariate imputation model is based on a regression model with main-effects terms only -the default in most MI software. In the example and simulations, we considered main-effects logistic regression for the binary variables and predictive mean matching (PMM) for the continuous outcome based on a main-effects linear regression. In PMM, imputed values are drawn using the nearest observed value after fitting the regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> which makes it robust to misspecification of the latter, for example in the presence of nonlinear associations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> Parametric MI with two-way interactions (MI-2-way int): each univariate imputation model is based on a regression model as above, but including two-way exposure-outcome, exposure-confounder, confounderoutcome, and confounder-confounder interactions. Interaction terms are generated within each cycle of the MI algorithm from current values of relevant variables involved in the interaction term (the so-called "passive" approach in mice in R). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> Parametric MI with two-, three-, and four-way interactions (MI-higher int): as above, but all univariate imputation models additionally include three-and four-way confounder-confounder interactions as predictors.</p><p>MI using classification and regression trees (MI-CART): instead of regression, for each variable with missing data a tree is fitted using a recursive partitioning technique, with all other variables as predictors.</p><p>Each record belongs to a donor leaf, from which a randomly selected value for the variable is taken as the imputed value.( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) MI-CART (and MI using random forest (MI-RF), see below) have been proposed to enable imputation that can more flexibly allow for interactions and non-linearities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> MI using random forest (MI-RF): for each variable with missing data, multiple bootstrap samples are drawn and for each a separate tree is fitted. Each tree contributes a donor leaf, and a randomly selected value for the variable from all these donors is taken as the imputed value. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> All MI approaches can be implemented with the mice package in R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation study</head><p>To compare the performance of the described methods for handling missing data, we performed a simulation study based on the VAHCS example (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We considered six scenarios. For each, we generated 2,000 datasets of 2,000 records.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generating the complete data</head><p>We used parametric regression models to generate the variables. The values of parameters in the models were determined by fitting similar models to the available data in VAHCS (unless stated otherwise). We considered two data generating scenarios (simple and complex), differing in the confounder-confounder interaction terms used in the data generation models. No exposure-confounder interaction terms were included (no effect modification). Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides the parameter values used for simulating the data and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> the descriptive statistics of the variables in the simulated data.</p><p>For both scenarios, we generated a continuous auxiliary variable A(age at wave 2) and a set of confounders Z = (Z $ (parental divorce), Z % (antisocial behaviour), Z &amp; (depression and anxiety), Z ' (alcohol use), Z ( (parental education)).

Under both outcome generation models, we set the coefficients for X (θ $ ), i.e., the true value of the ACE, to 0.2. For this effect and 2,000 records, the null hypothesis of no causal effect is formally rejected (p &lt; 0.05) in approximately 80% of the simulated datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Imposing missing data</head><p>We considered missingness scenarios depicted by m-DAGs (missingness directed acyclic graphs) A and B (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).(19, 28).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Illustrative example results</head><p>We analysed the VAHCS example using the tmle package in R, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and applied the eight missing data methods described. Unlike in the simulations, a small proportion of participants had missing data for parental divorce and parental education (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), which were handled in the same way as missing data for the other confounders.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We compared methods for handling missing data when estimating the ACE using TMLE with data-adaptive approaches. We considered six scenarios with different exposure and outcome generation models (presence/absence of confounder-confounder interaction terms) and missingness mechanisms (whether the outcome influenced missingness in other variables and presence/absence of interaction/non-linear terms in missingness models). CCA and EXT-TMLE+CEC had small bias under m-DAG A (where the outcome did not influence missingness in other variables), and large bias otherwise. MI-no int -the default in most MI software -had large bias in the complex scenarios 1 and 2 (when the exposure/outcome generation models included interactions) and small bias otherwise (regardless of m-DAG). MI-2-way int and MI-higher int performed best in terms of bias and variance across all settings, except for m-DAG B in complex scenario 2</p><p>(where a non-linear outcome term influenced missingness in other variables). MI-RF had consistently large bias across the six scenarios. MI-CART had small bias under m-DAG A in the simple and complex scenario 1, and large bias otherwise.</p><p>Based on previous investigations in a setting without effect modification, we determined that for m-DAG A, where the outcome did not influence missingness in any variable, the ACE was identifiable (or "recoverable").( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) Further, because auxiliary variables did not influence missingness in any variable, we expected both CCA and an appropriate implementation of MI to yield low bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Indeed, CCA (and Ext-TMLE+CEC) produced estimates with small bias for m-DAG A across all data generation scenarios. Also, implementations of parametric MI that were approximately compatible with the analysis method (i.e., all parametric MI procedures in the simple scenario, and MI including interaction terms in complex scenarios)</p><p>returned estimates with little bias, while an inappropriate MI method (e.g., MI-no int in our complex scenarios) was considerably more biased.</p><p>Contrary to CCA and Ext-TMLE+CEC, the Ext-TMLE+MCMI approach had higher bias under m-DAG A.</p><p>A key assumption under which the MCMI approach has been shown to be unbiased is when the exposure or outcome only depend on the confounder when the confounder is observed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref> We did not consider missingness scenarios where this held, because this assumption is implausible in a prospective cohort study, like VAHCS, where the data are not used for medical decision-making.</p><p>For m-DAG B, the ACE was determined to be non-recoverable, but since the outcome did not influence its own missingness, based on a previous simulation study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, we speculated that an implementation of MI that was tailored to the analysis method may offer some bias reduction compared with CCA. We observed that parametric MI approaches including interactions performed better than all other approaches in terms of bias for the simple scenario and complex scenario 1. For the complex scenario 2, where the missingness models included exposure-confounder interactions and a quadratic term for the outcome, all parametric MI approaches were highly biased. MI-CART outperformed parametric MI approaches in this scenario, but it was still moderately biased.</p><p>Within the FCS framework, recursive partitioning techniques, such as CART and RF, have been suggested</p><p>as alternative approaches that could automatically incorporate interactions and non-linearities in the imputation process.( <ref type="formula">27</ref>) Previous simulation studies have shown that MI using CART performs better than parametric MI without interaction terms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref> However, in these studies, the target analysis was a correctly specified outcome regression model with interactions, and biases in estimates of the main effects were not that different following MI using CART or parametric MI without interaction. These studies imposed missingness in the outcome only <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> or outcome and covariates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> In both, missingness depended on fully observed variables. In the present study, the only setting where MI-CART outperformed parametric MI approaches was for m-DAG B in the complex scenario 2. In all scenarios, bias in the ACE approaches, in terms of bias of point estimates as discussed previously, but even more so for bias in variance estimates. A promising alternative approach for obtaining SEs for MI in the presence of incompatibility has been recently proposed using the bootstrap,(38) but we did not explore this because of computational constraints. Incompatibility between the models used in MI and TMLE may also compromise the double robustness property of TMLE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> Other approaches, such as EXT-TMLE considered in this paper to handle missing outcome data, and an alternative likelihood parameterization to construct doubly robust estimators in adjusting for confounding and missing data in the presence of missing confounder data,(39) guarantee double robustness under extended assumptions.</p><p>Our simulation study was broadly based on VAHCS. We evaluated the performance of missing data methods under various missingness mechanisms. To describe what variables influenced missingness, we used m-DAGs because the standard classification of missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to comprehend and substantively assess when there is missingness in multiple variables. Also, although it is possible to estimate key parameters unbiasedly if the MAR assumption holds, MAR is not necessary for unbiased estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref> We did not consider missingness mechanisms where outcome influenced its own missingness, under which none of the approaches could be expected to perform well. For each MI approach, due to computational constraints we generated five completed datasets in the simulation study, which is fewer than we would do in practice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> We do not expect this to have affected the comparison between MI approaches, but it could have affected comparison of non-MI with MI methods. Our simulated data had a relatively simple structure across the assessed scenarios. Extensions of our study could investigate the performance of these missing data methods for datasets with high-dimensional confounders, binary outcome, and more complex m-DAGs including longitudinal auxiliary variables.</p></div>
