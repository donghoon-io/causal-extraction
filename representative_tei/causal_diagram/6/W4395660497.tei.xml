<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Home means house, residence, or hometown. Meanwhile, the industry can be interpreted as crafts, goods product businesses, and/or companies. The home industry is a product house or small company. In general, the definition of SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) usually includes at least two aspects, namely the initial investment value aspect, the number of assets, and the number of personnel aspects. According to BPS, the number of workers includes the home industry with a workforce of 5-9 people, the small industry with a workforce of 10-19 people, medium industry with a workforce of 20-99 people, large industry with a workforce of 100 people or more. (Jakfat and Dian 2020). This convection is a home industry that operates in the field of carpet and heat-resistant product manufacturing, founded in 2005 and located in Cikini, Central Jakarta. In the production process, a sewing machine is used, which is done with human assistance to control the operation of the machine. The process of making heatretaining products begins by inserting tissue material and polyester knitting thread, then entering the weaving machine process which produces rope, after the tissue material and the polyester knitting yarn have become rope. The next process is to enter the production machine which will produce heat-retaining products.</p><p>The research was carried out in a home industry that operates in the manufacturing sector with the production of heat-retaining products. The production process for heat-resistant products includes forming and sewing processes. In the production process, a defect was found in the product produced. Based on the results of interviews and field observations, there are problems in controlling the quality of heat-retaining products, causing defects in the products. This research aims to identify and provide suggestions for improvements to reduce product defects in the production process. To reduce existing defects, the author will use the FMEA and FTA methods which aim to determine the causes of product defects and to reduce defects in the production process. <ref type="bibr">Engineering and Operations Management Bangladesh Conference Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 26-28, 2023</ref> © IEOM Society International Based on the research conducted, the aim of this research is to find out the causes of failure and reduce product defects that occur. This research also aims to analyse the failure mode, causes of failure, and effects of failure. From the analysis carried out, the aim is to provide suggestions for improvements to improve the quality of home industry products.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>Developments in the manufacturing industry, which is currently full of competition, encourage home industries to maintain their performance so as not to be left behind by other home industries or other companies. The world of the manufacturing industry has a system for using machines, labor, equipment, and also raw materials so that it can become a product that has selling value. <ref type="bibr">(Ruihuang et al. 2020)</ref>. Production machines and equipment are the main resources that cannot be separated from the overall resources owned by both home industries and companies. A machine is a tool that can determine the success in making a product to shorten the production process. The performance of the machine and the performance of the workers also determine the quality of the product that will be produced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Singh et al. 2018</ref>) Basically, a machine has a lifespan and over time the machine's performance will decrease and it will not work optimally. Preventive efforts are needed as a basis for preventing defective products from occurring due to less-than-optimal machine performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beatrix et al. 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>Research was conducted in the Cikini area, Central Jakarta. This home industry was originally a trading business that supplied necessities to homes or shops. This research focuses on heat-retaining products, to determine the types and causes of defects in the product. The research begins by making a control chart P to see the proportion of defects in the product whether it is still within the control limits or outside the control limits. If it is outside the control limits then improvements are needed. After making the control chart P the next stage is making a fishbone diagram, after analyzing the diagram the next stage is fishbone to carry out FMEA analysis and provide suggestions for improvements to the analysis results. Then the next stage is the analysis stage using the FTA method which aims to find out more deeply the causes of defects in the product. After that, recommendations for improvements will be provided regarding the known causes of the problem. Then, suggestions for improvements will be given so that they can provide improvements for the home industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Collection</head><p>The data used for research that focuses on improving the quality of heat-retaining products is based on defect data for home industry heat-resistant products. The following is production data and product defect data obtained from March to August 2023 in monthly form. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Discussion</head><p>With the data collection that has been carried out, the next stage of analysis using FMEA &amp; FTA will be carried out to find out more about the causes and repair solutions for the failures that occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Control chart P</head><p>The P control chart is one of the control charts used in attribute quality control, which aims to identify defects in the product produced. <ref type="bibr">(Chanika et al. 2023)</ref>. Control charts are also commonly used to monitor and evaluate activities or processes that are under quality control statistically so that they can solve problems and produce improvements in quality. (Mazen. 2022). Calculations carried out to create a P control chart from March to August 2023, resulted in CL = 0,032; UCL = 0,037; and LCL = 0,021. The following is a P control chart to determine the proportion of product defects. Based on the P control chart that has been created, there are 7 production points (production week 1, 9, 15, 16, 21, 23, and 24) that are outside the UCL (upper control limits), so improvements are needed so that they can reduce the number of product defects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Fishbone Diagram</head><p>Fishbone diagram is an analysis method used to identify quality problems and check points which includes four types, namely materials or equipment, labour, and methods. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis)</head><p>At this stage, the causes of defects in heat retaining products are analyzed. To find out the causes of product defects, use the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) method. FMEA functions to identify the cause of failure or the mode of occurrence of a failure. <ref type="bibr">(Muhammad et al. 2021)</ref>. Assessment of the level of damage (severity), possibility of (occurrence), and failure detection (detection). Based on the results of the analysis and calculation results using the FMEA method, the highest RPN value was found from the product of the severity value, occurrence value and detection value. The RPN value for the nonstitched rope defect type is 192 and the parallel RPN value for the sloppy stitching defect type is 168 and 147. Proposed improvements are given regarding the analysis of the causes of failure in the FMEA table.</p></div>

Proposed improvements were given, namely replacing needles from previously once a month to twice a month, and making a regular machine maintenance schedule to reduce the occurrence of product defects due to less than optimal production machine performance, adding ventilation or fans to the room. production so that air circulation can circulate, and adding lighting to the production section to minimize the occurrence of product defects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Based on the results and discussion in this research, researchers can conclude several research results, namely: 1. Factors that cause product defects are caused by human factors, the machines used, and the tools used. Identification is carried out by analyzing the production process, type of failure, potential consequences of failure, and causes of failure. 2. The results of calculations using the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) method for heat retaining products obtained the highest RPN value from the product of the severity value, occurrence value and detection value. The highest RPN value is found in the unstitched rope defect type with an RPN value of 192 and the lowest value is found in the sloppy stitching defect type with parallel RPN values of 168 and 147. 3. Based on analysis using the FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) method, defects in non-stitched ropes are caused by bent or blunt needles. Apart from that, this is caused by the inappropriate size or type of needle and operators being in a hurry during the production process due to chasing production times and targets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
