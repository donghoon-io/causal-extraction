<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: Continual cost reduction of overhead costs of building projects can realign the concept of post-contract cost control towards value driven construction projects and stakeholders satisfaction. This study synthesized and analysed the viable continuous improvement measures critical for waste reduction during the execution phase of a building project.</p><p>Design/Methodology/approach: A review of existing literature facilitated a list of continuous improvement measures. This literature review findings enabled a Likert scale questionnaire which was administered to two-hundred and fifty (250) small and medium scale construction companies (SMSCC) in Nigeria. Multiple linear regression statistical tests deduced the significant cost reduction measure from which a causal loop diagram was designed to indicate continuous improvement measures during the execution phase of a building project.</p><p>Findings: Cogent construction activities associated with overhead costs were deduced from the statistical tests as being payment of suppliers and subcontractors; and purchase orders. An all-inclusive casual loop model for cost reduction through waste minimisation in construction projects as a viable oriented mechanism for meeting clients' requirements was developed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background of the study</head><p>Construction post-contract cost control should ensure that resources of construction projects are kept within the budget for the timely delivery of construction projects <ref type="bibr">(Potts, 2008)</ref>. The resources used during construction projects are typically identified within the categories of plant, labour, and materials but also include professional expertise from skilled workers, finance, and information technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Emuze, Smallwood and Han, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ameyaw et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amoatey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Asiedu, Frempong and Nani, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Broft, Badi and Pryke, 2016)</ref>. These resources are dependent on a finite budget. Therefore, the quantity surveyor has the prerogative to manage the available resources using relevant techniques and expertise efficiently. A number of such techniques fall within the remit of post-contract cost control, with the use of cash flow by the contractor to assess cash inflow and expenses and to keep the project within budget <ref type="bibr">(Ashworth and Perera, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, efficient post-contract cost control can determine the profitability of a contractor. The available finances for construction projects have to be managed effectively for the construction company to gain (profit) without lowering the quality in the process of cost reduction and maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ozcan-Deniz and Zhu, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Santos, Flintsch and Ferreira, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Professionally, a quantity surveyor ensures that construction cost is maintained within budget, while allowing an appropriate profit margin for the contractor and delivery of the final product to the client at a reasonable cost. According to <ref type="bibr">Sanni and Durodola (2012)</ref>, some cost controlling techniques used in Nigeria are monitoring labour, equipment and material cost; overhead monitoring; taking corrective action; identifying cost overruns; analysing cost reports; keeping and using historical data; analysing cost variance, forecasting cost of completion; summarising profit and loss. These are traditional cost control techniques and do not provide necessary cost checks at the operation stage in a project lifecycle <ref type="bibr">(Omotayo and Kulatunga, 2016)</ref>. Due to increasing complexity of construction projects, new post contract cost control techniques for complex projects are needed <ref type="bibr">(Abobakr, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Kaizen costing is an effective post-contract cost control technique in construction. Kaizen costing emphasises on continuous improvements, as opposed to phased improvements in the production process to reduce costs <ref type="bibr">(El Dardery, 2017)</ref>. Kaizen has been identified as effective techniques for construction waste reduction, improved quality of the final product, improved profitability, and competitiveness of a company <ref type="bibr">(Kaur &amp; Kaur, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smadi, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Omotayo et al., 2019)</ref>. The use of kaizen in construction can be combined with the traditional costing systems for enhanced effectiveness by improving the number of productive working hours <ref type="bibr">(Budugan &amp; Georgescu, 2009)</ref>. The study conducted by <ref type="bibr">Budugan &amp; Georgescu (2009)</ref> shows that employee working hours improvement can lower the impact of variable costs and thereby the total production cost. The number of productive hours achieved by employees in a construction company has an influence on the overall cost of a project; therefore, teamwork is vital to the success of a kaizen approach. These key benefits of Kazien have not been widely studied in Nigerian construction industry settings, as the focus has mostly been on items such as target costing and improved estimating techniques for reducing cost overrun and project abandonment <ref type="bibr">(Sanni and Hashim, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Frimpong et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Mansfield et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>This study analyses the feasible kaizen measures critical for non-physcial waste reduction during the execution phase of a building project. Such knowledge contribution is beneficial to SMMMCs in identifying and implementing waste minimisation and control practices in construction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nagapan et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nagapan et al. (2011)</ref> opined that waste can be physical and nonphysical. They defined physical wastes as debris from the construction process and can include materials waste in the form of concrete, wood, metals, plastic, tiles, insulations, paints, soil, and stones, ceramics, glass, and bricks. While the non-physical waste is non-value adding activities such as material handling, inventory, process, and delays. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nagapan et al. (2012)</ref> classified these wastes as originating from procurement, workers, site conditions, handling, management, and external influencing factors such as waste from packaging; leftovers from construction materials; design error or changes; poor storage; pilfering and handling of materials. The general causes of construction waste include poor allocation of resources; poor record keeping; vandalism, variation and rework; damage as a result of weather or mishandling; damage as a result of transportation; composite and design of building; poor quality material supplied and used on-site, and site office waste <ref type="bibr">(Wahab and Lawal, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overhead cost and incremental waste reduction</head><p>Construction waste is a problem in the Nigerian construction industry, especially material wastes on construction sites <ref type="bibr">(Eze, Seghosime, Eyong, and Loya, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Haruna, Usman, Oraegbune, Muhammad, &amp; Bamidele, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ugochukwu, Agugoesi, Mbakwe, and Abazuonu, 2017)</ref>. On a typical construction site in Nigeria, <ref type="bibr">Ugochukwu et al. (2017)</ref> estimated the average percentage of waste from timber, tiles, sandcrete blocks, reinforcement bars and concrete to be 5.5%, 3.47%, 1.6%, 1.58% and 1.55% respectively. However, this is quite lower than the Built Environment Project and Asset Management 11.28% average waste generation on construction sites in India (Amirthakadeshwaran and Kalpana, 2017). Nevertheless, the effect of these wastes is increased project costs <ref type="bibr">(Haruna et al., 2017)</ref> or 4.0% project cost overruns <ref type="bibr">(Saidu and Shakantu, 2016)</ref>. The wastes occur mainly from material handling <ref type="bibr">(Ugochukwu et al., 2017)</ref> and theft and vandalism on construction sites <ref type="bibr">(Eze et al., 2017)</ref>. Generation of wastes is also associated with poor construction on sites; for instance, poorly designed formwork leads to enormous concrete wastes <ref type="bibr">(Haruna et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>There is also very limited reuse of wastes on construction sites <ref type="bibr">(Mudashiru, Oyelakin, Oyeleke, and Bakare, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, artisans such as carpenters, masons, iron benders and electricians are mostly responsible for material wastes on construction sites <ref type="bibr">(Haruna et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Mitigating construction wastes enhances the performance of construction projects, especially to prevent cost overruns by about 0.4% of construction cost <ref type="bibr">(WRAP, 2014)</ref>. As a result, in the UK, the waste management policy, particularly with regard to materials wastage, is well implemente <ref type="bibr">(Clarke, Williams and &amp; Turner, 2019)</ref>. However counterparts in the developing economies such as in Nigeria are yet to adopt and embrace these strategies. On the other hand, strategies for non-physical construction waste miimisation are rare. Kaizen can be employed to reduce both physical and non-physical waste.</p><p>Meanwhile, the implementation of lean construction and the derivate (Kaizen) for construction waste reduction in the Nigerian construction industry is very low due to barriers to implementation (See <ref type="bibr">(Aisha &amp; Kasimu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oladiran, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Olatunji, 2008)</ref>). The barriers are related to skills and knowledge, management in construction organisations, government support, construction professionals' attitude and resources. <ref type="bibr">(Olatunji, 2008)</ref>. The knowledge and skills for implementing lean construction are low in the industry (Amade, Ononuju, Obodoh, Okorie, &amp; Tech, 2019; Sholanke, Chen, Newo, &amp; Nwabufo, 2019), and more professional training is required <ref type="bibr">(Amade et al., 2019)</ref>. Also, the commitment and support of top managers and executives in construction companies to lean construction implementation is almost non-existent <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sholanke et al., 2019)</ref>. There is a general lack of government policy for promoting changes that can influence the application of lean construction in Nigeria.</p><p>Furthermore, negative attitude to embrace changes is generally dominant in the industry, often exacerbated by silo procurement, sentience, corruption and adversarial relationships <ref type="bibr">(Amade et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sholanke et al., 2019)</ref>. Finally, there is a shortage of resources such as power Built Environment Project and Asset Management infrastructure and IT platforms to support lean construction planning and implementation <ref type="bibr">(Amade et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Olatunji, 2008)</ref>. The funding of construction projects is very poor, leaving no room for the implementation of new process techniques like lean construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sholanke et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In incremental waste reduction for Kaizen, activities culminating to post-contract cost reduction are mainly overhead cost reduction. Overhead cost is also non-value adding, labour expense that raises the overall cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Enshassi, Aziz and Karriri, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lan Oo, Yean Yng Ling, and Soo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hetherton and Jennifer, 2015)</ref>. Examples of non-labour overhead cost are depreciation, the cost of processing payments, administrative charges and costs which are indirectly related to the construction process. Hence, in the context of a Kaizen application in post-contract cost control, the focus will be on overhead cost reduction. This is because overhead cost reduction is usually fixed during a time period. Kaizen is concerned with activities which can be controlled by the stakeholders involved in the construction process. The construction team needs to focus on the supply chain, material handling, equipment hire and preliminary items of work. The Table <ref type="table">1</ref> below shows the different activities carried out by construction operatives which lead to the accumulation of overhead cost.</p><p>The activities in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are related to the general overhead cost which can be reduced through the continuous improvement process (Kaizen costing). Plant and equipment depreciation costs (MSETUP) are usually paid by the contractor during the lifetime of the construction process.</p><p>By engaging in constant negotiation with the equipment supplying company, the overhead cost &gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Table <ref type="table">1&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> relating to depreciation of plant and equipment will be reduced. Handling of equipment (setup) and materials which are supplied as a result of the purchase of building materials (POM) have overheads such as administrative charges relating to payment. Preliminary items of work that are related to fixed payments for water, electricity, first aid, inventory, security and so on, can be reduced by monitoring usage. Hence, incremental reduction of muda (the Japanese term for waste) on construction sites will provide an opportunity with the implementation of Kaizen.</p></div>

Variation is an evidence of inadequate cost planning leading to increasing cost of construction. Variations occur when there is poor estimation; inflation; fluctuations in prices of building materials; program planning problems; exchange rate increment; workmanship errors; rework and quality issues; theft; design information misinterpretation; interest rates; corrupt practices on the site and inexperienced skilled and unskilled workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Omotayo, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Danese et al. 2012</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The workings of incremental cost reduction</head><p>Shang and Pheng (2013) explained that Kaizen could be separated into maintenance and improvement. Maintenance is related to keeping the cost within budget, while improvement identifies gaps which allow for the additional reduction of cost. The maintenance aspect involves a management function which would be narrowed down further to a policy guiding waste reduction in the office, rules and regulations, guidelines and procedures for an employeeemployer relationship, and elimination of waste. This managerial function is essential to be represented as a culture within the organisation before the commencement of site activities.</p><p>Reduction of waste which is also known as Muda in Japanese involves all non-value adding activities <ref type="bibr">(IFS, 2010)</ref>. Therefore managing value during production is essential to the realisation of waste reduction during production, the achievement of which is dependent on data / information such as the work breakdown structure and cost estimates.</p><p>Cost estimates must be established in a standardised framework. A repetitive process of reducing waste in organisations and on construction sites can proactively eliminate waste before it occurs <ref type="bibr">(Omotayo and Kulatunga, 2015)</ref>. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) process, for example, can be implemented from inception to completion of construction projects.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure">2&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> &gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure">3&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> The PDCA process is the bedrock of continuous improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Omotayo and Kulatunga, 2017)</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the PDCA process begins with a section area identification of waste generating activities such as material handling during construction. Implementation of this process has a concomitant relationship with the refining of construction workers' response(s) towards change. The kaizen team is also a change management team. Therefore, the process of Built Environment Project and Asset Management implementing this type of change deals with the monitoring, conforming and controlling of practical approaches to minimising waste on construction sites.</p><p>The process of incrementally reducing cost during construction for SMSCC depends on activities which are not actually adding value. Non-value-added activities in construction are the gaps which can be noted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. They are categorised as material delivery (transportation and handling); overhead cost reduction during construction; preliminary cost reduction; supply; variation management; plant and equipment hire (depreciation), and payment of sub-contractors <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yates, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jayamathan and Rameezdeen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Khanh and Kim, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yahya, Boussabaine and Alzaed, 2016)</ref>. The waste category in this study can comprise both physical and non-physical wastes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sandhu, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajayi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chatziaras, Psomopoulos and Themelis, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yahya, Boussabaine and Alzaed, 2016)</ref>. For instance, waste arising from material handling and transportation are physical, but waste arising from overheads are non-physical. Preliminary items such as the overhead costs of electricity, water, stationery, road, security and so on are also major gaps which can be closed for the reduction of cost. Overhead costs relating to preliminaries, payment of contractors (administrative charges), suppliers, equipment and variation management can be minimised throughout the course of the construction project.</p></div>

Furthermore, Ala-Risku and Karkkainen ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Omotayo and Kulatunga (2017)</ref> confirmed that overhead cost related to material delivery have a massive impact on overall construction cost.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Table <ref type="table">3&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> The predictors are PEOV, CVMI, PSL, CPGP and PI. In reference to table 2, these aforementioned four predictors displayed significant values above 0.05 twice and tangible correlations within variable set. The linear regression analysis further justifies their inclusion.</p><p>The R square value of 0.070 signifies a 7% variance of the predictors in overhead cost relating to purchasing orders and material deliveries (POM). Although the R squared is very low, the model significance in table 4, indicates a significace of P&lt;0.013. Hence, the model is significant for this analysis.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Table <ref type="table">4&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> The F value of 3.032 and a p-value &lt;0.013 indicates a significance on the model. The significant contributory change to the dependent variable from the standardised Beta for POM is PSL with a value of 0.217 p-values &lt;0.050 at 0.007. PE overheads have a Beta effect on the dependent variable with a value of 0.121. However, this is not significant.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Table <ref type="table">5&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> The findings of the linear regression analysis confirmed that overhead costs related to paying subcontractors, labourers and suppliers have a comprehensive impact on overhead costs associated with purchasing orders and material delivery. Hence, the key findings identified subcontractors and supplier payments, purchasing and delivering building materials as the key components of those overheads which continuous improvement can focus on. Some of these overheads are fixed costs, of which some are percentages and charges which can be reduced incrementally.</p></div>

Hence, change management in an organisation can benefit from understanding matching variables to comprehend scenarios. <ref type="bibr">Senge (1990)</ref> as cited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akhtar et al., 2018)</ref> opined that systems thinking is the fifth discipline of a learning organisation. Applications of systems thinking in organisational culture studies prove the existence of unforeseen phenomenon in every unilateral decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Király, Köves and Balázs, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grohs et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Molderez and Ceulemans, 2018)</ref>. In the attainment of effectiveness in organisations, systems thinking inclines towards cohesive change management and continual mitigation of effects as end games for causes.</p><p>In continuous improvement studies, systems thinking can clearly delineate the causes and effects in a loop diagram. Thereby showing the relationships between sub-factors influencing the major factors leading to continuous improvement. Vensim PLE 7.2 software for systems thinking was used to create a direct relationship between the outcomes of the regression analysis.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure">6&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> A causal loop continuous improvement model was designed for SMSCC. The model expunged latent variables which are outside the statistical phenomenon. For a detailed analytical perspective for this study, a causal loop diagram was developed for POM and PSL causal variables. The causal variables have determinants in the form of sub-causal variables. The dynamic complexities for continuous improvement implementation in the construction industry primarily depend on cost control, people management skills and the supply chain system. The POM and PSL causal variables are thus presented as a hierarchical chart. The chart in figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, displays the two criteria representing the causal variations and sub-criteria for sub-variables for incremental cost reduction. These sub-criteria were elucidated from the literature review sections.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure">7&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> The internal and external influences on overhead costs have been listed under the sub-criteria.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the external factors which are not under the control of the cost consultant and stakeholders are distinguished for the purposes of systems thinking.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure">8&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> The external and internal relationships for the variables were considered in analysing the causes and effects of overhead costs and continuous incremental reduction. The systems thinking causal loop diagram in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> created relationships and additional variables for this study as illustrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Implications of findings for non-physical waste reduction</head><p>Causal loop diagrams in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> has arrows, + and -signs. The arrows indicate the relationship between the variables, while the + and -signs expressed the effect of one variable on another.</p><p>In designing the causal loop diagrams, the positive relationship between variables drives the thought process of the designer. For instance, POM and PSL lead to more overhead costs in construction. There are Nine (9) reinforcing loops were generated from the causal loop diagram in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The first reinforcing loop R1 created a relationship between PSL and communication via relationship and teamwork. The existence of relationship and teamwork strengthens effective communication and this proper payment of supplier and subcontractors.</p><p>Relationship and teamwork were added to the sub-variables as part of the systems thinking model after thorough analysis by the researcher. R2 has a positive reinforcing loop between accounting software cost and PSL. Effective communication will lead to improvements in the quality of materials delivered and this promotes better relationship and teamwork during construction as evident in R3.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure">9&lt;&lt;&lt;</ref> R4 has a negative reinforcing loop between collusion between contractors and suppliers, and the quality of materials delivered. If there is a collision, the quality of materials delivered will be lower and thus, a vicious cycle. R5, an increase in purchase orders and material deliveries will also add to the transportation cost and vice versa. R6, associated a reinforcing loop between the supply chain system and POM. When purchase orders and material deliveries increase, the supply chain system will boom. Construction method applied for a project depends on the management strategy and health and safety policies. Between construction methods and health and safety policies, there is a positive reinforcing loop. Health and safety policies will lead to the type of scaffolding, construction hours and approach to the construction project. The construction method also influences, the security provided on the construction site positively.</p><p>R8 revealed new variables which are meant to enhance the causes and effects of corrupt practices on the payment of suppliers. In R1, management strategy was discovered to have a massive influence on managing grievances. For a causality of dispute, there has to be some form of grievance amongst the stakeholders. The effect of grievance during construction is conflict and dispute resolution by the management. Initially, conflict and dispute resolution Built Environment Project and Asset Management were combined. During the causal loop diagram construction, the researcher discovered a disjointed variable led to the decomposition of conflict and dispute resolution. R9 connects expertise and communication. When there is excellent communication, expertise is improved.</p><p>Effective application of expertise also promotes good communication during the construction process.</p><p>Management strategy was discovered to have a massive influence on a number of variables such as health and safety policies; construction method; plants and equipment; transportation cost; grievances and dispute resolution. In general management strategy reduces overhead costs during construction cost control. The purpose of this system thinking causal loop diagram is to make decisions leading to the reduction in overhead costs. Hence, the variables and subvariables associated with the reduction of construction overhead costs are thus, identified as management strategy; relationship and teamwork; corrupt practices; communication; expertise, transportation cost, quality of materials delivered; construction method; collusion; interest rates and inflation. The selection of these variables is based on their existence in the reinforcing loop and externality.</p><p>The sub-variable listed in table 5 are all very important when considering factors associated with waste reduction. Construction waste may be tangible or intangible, whichever the nature of the waste, the causal loop diagram and the factors in table 5 all indicate a strategic approach towards minimising construction waste. A management strategy is very essential for every waste management policy. Once a waste management strategy is in place, communication, corrupt practices; relationship and teamwork; quality of materials delivered and construction methods can be controlled. Other external factors such as inflation and interest rates are very difficult to manage within a project. Notwithstanding, the early identification of external factors which may derail the project objectives can easily be mitigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion and implication for further studies</head><p>The aim of this study was to identify measures for gradual reduction of non-physical waste in construction activities managed by SMSCC. Nigeria was selected as the data source location because of her nature as a developing economy with large number of SMSCCs. The findings identified management strategy enahcnement as a core area within SMSCCs. An incremental improvement in the management strategy of SMSCCs will lead to an overaching improvement in the reduction of nonphysical waste. Furthermore the continual reduction of overheads costs resulting from the activity of suppliers, subcontractors, and labourers will definitely create more profit and value for the contractor and project. In most cases, it is very difficult to monitor the activities of the suppliers because of certain forces in the Nigerian construction industry. This type of influential factor includes conspiracy with a project team member to inflate the prices of the construction materials, kickback and other vices on construction sites. Inflation and market forces also have external effects on supplier's and subcontractors' charges.</p><p>Incremental reduction of activities related to purchasing orders and material deliveries was identified as the second critical activity. The Kaizen team can focus on this aspect to ensure that the wastage arising transportation of material to site and purchase orders are kept within an allowable cost limit. The cost limits allowed can have a profit and overhead of twenty-five percent plus (25 %+). In some construction companies, it is a management function. However, focusing on actions relating to purchase orders and material deliveries will definitely assist the contractor in getting more value for money and client satisfaction. Most contractors view construction projects as opportunities to claim for funds arising from all forms of variation.</p><p>Therefore, some contractors may expect more variation during the course of the project timeline.</p><p>Further studies into the systems dynamics of physical and non-physical waste reduction can enhance construction industry productivity and the spur economic growth of developing nations.   </p></div>
