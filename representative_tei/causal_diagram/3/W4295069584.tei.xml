<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Fault tree analysis has been a standard method in reliability and risk analysis since the 1960's. It provides a notation for describing a full range of failure combinations that can lead to an unwanted event, such as a system failure or an accident. A limitation of fault trees (FTs), as described in the Fault Tree Handbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , for example, is that the "events" are all binary, they either occur or do not occur. In some cases, more values are allowed, such as HIGH, NORMAL and LOW, but the values are still discrete. There exist also dynamic fault trees (DFTs) that can model temporal interactions between components, priorities among events and dynamically changing architecture of systems. With multiple small deviations however, there are situations in which a complete system can fail even when there are no failures or catastrophic deviations in any of its components, just deviations which on their own would represent acceptable or even normal performance for each component, but result in unacceptable performance for the system as a whole when occurring together. We regard these as emergent/system effects because failure arises from the structure of the system, not from the failure of individual components of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</p><p>The motivation for this paper is an observation during FT analysis of autonomous vehicle lane finding software using video camera input. The software can "lose" the lane if lighting is poor or if lane marking is dirty or obscured. The lane will not be lost if the roadway is straight, and the navigation software can simply output the same heading value until lane tracking can be re-established. If there is a curve in the road, loss of the lane can result in the vehicle leaving the road, and possibly crashing. In the lane following software, there is no clear failure, just small deviations such as increased noise, varying degrees of curvature on the road, and varying obscured or missing lengths of lane marking. The failure event,</p><p>The importance of small continuous deviations and partial failures (performance deterioration) in determining system failure probability have been recognized in several areas of application. In structural reliability, failure is a function of variations from intended values in strength and in load. Small, continuous deviations are also known as a problem in mechanical construction, where varying degrees of deviation in dimension tolerances can combine to exceed the ability of parts to fit. In project planning, cumulative delays in different subtasks can combine to cause deadlines to be exceeded <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p><p>For simple systems where the cause of deviations in parameters is irrelevant, or where there are only a few causes of deviation, it is possible to analyse systems for reliability or risk directly by solving the system equations for the full range of causal deviations. This is commonly done using simulators, "fault injection" and deviation sensitivity studies (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ). Nevertheless, there are cases where there exist so many causes of deviation, and so many combinations of these, that effort for simulation becomes excessive. There are several fields of engineering, such as automotive, aerospace, power supply, and oil, gas and chemicals where high-quality simulators are used extensively, but where the number of fault simulation cases must be limited for practical reasons. This paper demonstrates a method which can allow the advantages of FTs in representing complex combinations of failure causes, to be extended to model system's failure by tracing interactions among continuous system parameters and their deviations from nominal values. The trees can also include discrete events that can have an influence on the performance. The special type of the FT that is described in this paper has much in common with dynamic FTs, nevertheless, it has very distinct features too. For example, continuous variables are not necessarily dependent on time, and it has also a special event type that prompts the analyst to consider the possibility of a system effect of interconnected variables and events. We refer to this kind of the FT as a continuum fault tree (CFT).</p><p>The methodology for constructing CTFs suggests also developing equation bi-graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , a causal diagram visualizing and combining all continuous performance parameters. The bi-graphs serve several purposes, one of which is the explication of feedback loops that are of importance for identification of emergent hazards attributed to the loops. Feedback loops can in turn give rise to other emergent behaviours that are referred to as tipping points. In these, small disturbances working together push a system to a threshold at which feedback becomes positive and runaway occurs.</p><p>In the following section the paper first briefly explains what earlier work underlies CFT analysis. Then the model of the system performance, an automobile engine, is described in the form of analytical expressions in section 3. Section 4 exemplifies how equation bi-graphs should be developed for the chosen system, and the following section 5 suggests an explanation of the CFT construction for the same system. Special attention is paid to emergent events triggered by small deviations in performance parameters. Section 6 draws attention to other possible types of emergent behaviours that can emerge in control loops and loops of the controlled physical system. More examples, where construction of CFTs can be useful for identification of unwanted behaviours, are provided in section 7, which is followed by an explanation of how CFTs can be quantified (section 8). Finally, the concluding section completes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Earlier work</head><p>As mentioned above, CFTs have much in common with DFTs and a literature review carried out on this topic is briefly described in this section along with other existing methods underlying the CFT analysis.</p><p>1. Taking into account sequencing that necessitates the introduction of new dynamic OR and AND gates; 2. Those considering a dynamic change of the architecture of the system; and those 3. Accounting for both sequencing and updating time-dependent probabilities as well as containing continuous and discrete variables.</p><p>DFTs that belong to the first class are of five distinct types that are characteristic of different kinds of gates. The priority-AND (PAND) gate was introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . It captures the priority behaviour so that the output will be true when both inputs occur and the first input occurs sooner than the second input. In the Priority-OR (POR) gate first input has priority over other inputs. The output event must happen first for the POR gate output to be true. However, it does not require all other events to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . The Sequence-Enforcing (SEQ) gate models the sequential failure behaviour of events A, B, and C. These events must occur in time exactly as they appear in this sequence A, B and C <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . The SPARE gate is used to model redundancy in system design <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . The left most of the inputs corresponds to a primary event and other inputs represent spare components. When the primary component fails, the first spare will be activated; and if the first spare fails, then the second spare is activated. Refinements of this gate are able to consider different types of dynamic redundancy: cold, hot and warm standby spares. The Functional Dependency (FDEP) gate helps to model scenarios when operations of some components are dependent on the operation of one component that triggers the failures of the others <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Finally, sequencing can be expressed as an inhibit/condition gate <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> meaning that certain conditions must arise prior to the event that 'opens' the gate. This type of gate is important here because for the CFTs, many are actually condition/event gates expressing system dynamics such as the occurrence of car brake failure prior to gradual increase in speed when travelling downhill.</p><p>The second class of DFTs serves to account for changes in system's configuration, or more generally, changes in states of the system in time. This is needed, for example, due to equipment outages while the system is in operation, reduced level of production or seasonal changes in the system's architecture or different valve line ups for different operating modes. These changes can be captured in a number of different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Generally, some formal structures and algorithms are introduced to dynamically reconfigure the system, and consequently their FTs, and update time-dependent probabilities of basic events. For example, different system configurations can be encoded in a matrix, from which a specific configuration can be dynamically extracted. In addition, the probabilities of basic events are modified following the change in the architecture.</p><p>The third class of DFTs can capture both sequencing and temporal change of the probabilities as well it can tie together continuous and discrete variables. However, the increase in the modelling capabilities of DFTs possessing these features comes along with the increased computational complexity. To be able to solve these DFTs, Bayesian Networks were offered <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and their extension to time-dependent modelling, Dynamic Bayesian Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Nevertheless, the weak point was still their inability to incorporate both continuous and discrete variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Hybrid Bayesian Networks offer computational algorithms that are able to solve DFTs possessing the all mentioned features. This is achieved either through static <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> or dynamic discretization of the timeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</p><p>As noted before, in the physical world however, there are situations where several small deviations can combine to cause failure of an entire system, even if any one of these deviations is insufficient of itself to cause any failure. It is exactly this system effect that needs to be included in a FT and for which none of the existing DFTs provides a notation.</p><p>4</p><p>In addition to this, we want a FT to include feedback loops that can also trigger system effects and give rise to emergent unwanted behaviours.</p><p>The underlying work enabling to model these system phenomena is found in methods that make possible automated FT construction. The point of departure for the automation is a suitable form of system representation. There exist several different forms of system representation to support the analysis, for example, digraphs due to Lapp and Powers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> or SysML models as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . However, the method of our choice is the one that is built on equation bi-graphs because unlike the other methods, provided that a number of rules are followed, it is possible to build up a standard library of component models which capture the two way causality of many physical systems, such as the possibility of "reverse flows". These component models can then be automatically coupled together using as a basis system diagrams such as electronic circuit diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams and mechanical interaction diagrams.</p><p>Other system representations described in the literature require the analyst to construct the representation needed for analysis by hand and this can be both time consuming and error prone for larger systems.</p><p>Additionally, the equation bi-graph representation is useful for generation of CTFs because the physical and functional equations for individual components are built directly into the representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . In most analyses, the bi-graphs do not even need to be drawn, since the system diagram such as the electronic circuit diagram or the piping and instrumentation diagram can be converted directly to an equation bigraph by software. The bi-graph can then be used directly within the computer fault tree construction software <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</p><p>As described above, a further advantage of the bi-graph notation for failure analysis is explicit visualization of feedback loops in both control and physical systems, including conditional feedback depending on system states such as valve and switch line up, and incorporating failure events and tracing their influence on the change of the performance model. A particular advantage is the ability to recognize hidden loops, that is those not recognized by the designer, and which can lead to failure phenomena such as tipping points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Example: an automobile engine</head><p>To exemplify how to develop system representation in the form of equation bi-graph and the following CFT construction, an automobile engine is chosen. The analytical model presented below is based on one by Kunanoppadol <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> . The original steady state model has been extended to a dynamic model vehicle accelerator and brakes were added to the model, as well as the slope of the roadway.</p><p>The top event of interest for the FT construction is engine damage due to engine speed being too high, beyond the speed at which the cooling system can remove the heat of friction in the motor. It is worth noting at this point that actual heat production may be a function of both engine speed and torque, depending on the balance between heat conduction from the combustions in the cylinder and heat from friction. This implies that two fault trees may be needed. To take additional heat from the burning gases in the motor cylinders, an extended model would be needed. There are in fact many top events which could be chosen as relevant for this system. For this example, only the single top event of high motor speed will be used.</p><p>Engine damage can occur if the engine temperature becomes excessive, i.e., 𝑇 &gt; 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 , arising when the engine rotational speed is very high for a longer period. Let 𝑁 𝑖 stand for the engine rotational speed when the engine is in gear 𝐺 𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛, where 𝑛 is the number of gears.

This is not the case for larger systems, and especially where component failures such as valve closure or breakage of a mechanical component can cause changes in causal structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">System representation for fault tree analysis</head><p>As described above, the systems representation used here is that of "equation bi-graphs" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . In these, component input, internal and output parameters are drawn as circles, and physical equations are represented as squares (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). To have the graph compact, references to the equations are provided in the squares. Links in the graphs are made where a parameter enters into an equation. The direction of the links is made according to the following rules:</p><p>• Each variable is determined by just one equation (indicated by arrow direction).</p><p>• Each equation determines just one parameter.</p><p>• When a change in parameter 𝐴 precedes in time a change in parameter 𝐵, the link is from 𝐴 to the delay equation and then to 𝐵. • When a parameter 𝐵 is related to parameter 𝐴 by an integration, the link is from 𝐴 to the integration equation and then to 𝐵. • In links representing pipes and wires, generally there are several possible causal direction markings dependent on the way in which a component is incorporated into a system. For example, for a centrifugal pump, the pump may determine the pressure, and downstream controller may determine the flow. A positive displacement pump will generally determine flow, and downstream components will determine pressure. In all cases, flow from a pump will depend on whether there is an open flow path both upstream and downstream of the component. Component models must reflect these possibilities and constraints. In other words, component models in the library must take into account the different configurations in which components can be connected into a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</p><p>Inspecting the model, the engine torque 𝑇𝑞 𝑖 is determined by the selected gear 𝐺 𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛, where 𝑛 is the number of gears, the engine rotational speed, 𝑁 𝑖 ; and the fuel supply determined by the accelerator position 𝐴𝑐. The engine torque in turn determines the force at the wheels, 𝐹𝑤, which also depends on the braking as determined by the braking torque 𝑇𝑞 𝑏 . The braking torque 𝑇𝑞 𝑏 depends on the braking pedal position 𝐵 𝑟 .The force on the wheels, 𝐹𝑤, minus the rolling and the air flow resistance 𝑅, and minus the gravitational force from the roadway slope 𝑆𝑙 , determines the acceleration 𝐴 𝑖 . The numbers in the square boxes refer to the equations in section 3. The second feedback loop is also a physical one, with vehicle velocity influencing engine rotation speed in turn influencing torque which in turn influences acceleration. This feedback loop can have a positive or negative feedback depending on gear position (gears normally being used to allow greater acceleration at low speed, and adaptation to good engine performance at higher speeds, but also being used for "engine braking" under some conditions, including those of brake failure). Here too it is possible to reach tipping points where for example "engine braking" fails when the vehicle is driving down a steep hill.</p><p>Note that in automated fault tree analysis it is not necessary to actually draw the bi-graphs, they are implicit in the generic models together with the system diagrams. Software such as RIKKE <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> and HAZEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> construct data structures equivalent to the bi-graphs internally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Continuum fault tree construction for the example</head><p>The FT's top event chosen is engine damage due to engine speed being too high, beyond the speed at which the cooling system can remove the heat of friction from the motor. The FT is built up by tracing the causal paths in the bi-graph. For example, since the top event involves engine temperature T, disturbances in T will initially be traced to equation 1, and from there to the engine rotation speed.</p><p>Tracing will then be to equation 2 and to vehicle velocity 𝑉 𝑖 and so on. At each stage the equations visited are recorded, along with any conditions applicable for the equation. For example, equation 12 describing braking will be a simple dependence of braking torque on brake pedal position under normal conditions, but there will be alternative values of the braking constant 𝑘 𝑏 for worn brakes, if the brakes are too cold or are overheated, and zero braking torque if the brakes have failure. The collected set of equations along any path being traced in the fault tree construction is called the path predicate. At each stage in the tracing, the path predicate equations are solved as far as possible, both in order to minimize the complexity of the predicates and also to be able to recognize more easily any tipping points.</p><p>The top event for the FT construction for this example is excessive engine temperature, 𝑇 &gt; 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 , arising when the engine rotational speed is very high for a longer period. The FT for this top event is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Its construction follows the causal paths from the top event, for which the initial path predicate is 𝑇 0 + 𝑞 • 𝑁 𝑖 &gt; 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (event 1).</p><p>OR gate 2 in the fault tree examines the ways in which event 1 could arise, first looking at ways in which the engine normal temperature 𝑇 0 could be too high, arising first from ambient temperature being too high (event 4), and then from failure of the cooling system or the cooling water failing (events 5 or 6). In a more extensive model, the causes of these events could be investigated, including failure of the cooling system pump or drive, or failure of the air flow around the cooling system radiator.</p><p>Event 7 propagates further the causes of the engine rotational speed 𝑁 𝑖 being larger than the limit set by the cooling system capacity.</p><p>Event 8 is the one that prompts us to pay attention to a possible system effect that can cause engine overheating and that cannot be identified by a separate analysis each of the two events 3 and 7, but only seeing them in unity. On a general note, any formula is a model of reality and there can be several models modelling the same effect or phenomenon. This is what is called model uncertainty. It is quite easy to see that formula (1) is in fact a rough approximation of reality. Constant 𝑞, defining how fast the engine temperature will grow, in reality is dependent on the cooling system and so is the base temperature 𝑇 0 . Degraded lubrication and wear-out of the pistons and cylinders are also the deviations that influence the growth of the temperature. All these and other uncertainties that are implicit in formula (1) -but not specified due to our limited knowledge -should be manifested to avoid a false impression of our 'perfect' understanding of failure mechanisms. We suggest doing it by introducing an additional event 𝑇(𝑇 0 , 𝑁 𝑖 ) &gt; 𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 that occurs when the function of the two variables (possibly dependent) exceeds the limit regarded as a border of successful operation.</p><p>Event 9 is the verbal statement of the cause for event 7, which is the determined by formula (3) and which means that a high rotational speed 𝑁 𝑖 is cased by a high velocity.</p><p>Events 11 and 13 describe two of the causes for event 10 to occur (inequality ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">8</ref>)). These are too high a slope 𝑆𝑙 and too long an acceleration period, 𝑡, i.e., pressing on the accelerator pedal too long. From experience we know that over-speeding of the motor is possible, and this is the reason that RPM indicators on many cars have a red zone. Event 14 considers the possibility of a system effect of the two variables 𝑡 and 𝑆𝑙. This event is alike event 8.</p><p>Event 16 represents too low rolling or aerodynamic resistance for the given accelerator position. The resistance 𝑅 is itself dependent on velocity and represents an inherent feedback loop. Since the resistance increases monotonically with velocity, the decrease in velocity contradicts the monotonic increase, and should be edited out of the fault tree. This kind of feedback loop is characteristic of many physical systems. In this case, the feedback is negative, such that the acceleration and velocity can be selflimiting. Up to this point in the fault tree construction, the equations used for variable substitution in the path predicates have all been explicit, which makes solution by substitution easy. The explicit equations are characteristic of physical equations representing mass, energy, momentum and current conservation. Loops, like those based on equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>), make the path predicates implicit, and may require rearrangement to enable understanding. Solution of the path predicate equations or inequalities may lead to identification of conflicts, as for example in event 16. Solution of equations of this kind in general may reveal that the loop gains may be positive under some conditions, as described above.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Velocity too high</head><p>Deeper consideration of event 10, and specifically its term (𝐹𝑤 𝑖 -𝑅), shows that while aerodynamic resistance does increase with speed, there are some possibilities which would reduce aerodynamic resistance, including the possibility of a following wind, or "tailgating" a vehicle ahead. These possibilities illustrate that a full range of hazards must be considered when building the model. Just simple acceptance of a performance model is not sufficient. Tailgating, for example, can reduce aerodynamic resistance and increase velocity, but can also reduce the effectiveness of cooling systems. It has been found that "model informed brainstorming" is a useful approach to this problem. The brainstormers ask, for each variable: "What can cause variations in this parameter, including unusual conditions and failures?".</p><p>Events 17 and 18 continue the sequence of variable substitutions into the path predicates. Events 19 and 20 cover the possibilities of engine torque becoming too high due to a "heavy foot" on the accelerator pedal. Events 21 and 22 cover the possibilities of inadequate braking.</p><p>In this illustrative example, some important factors have been left out. In particular, the driver, or in an autonomous vehicle, the controller has been left out.</p><p>For a good analysis, physical effects of a wider range of situations will be needed (consider engine temperature effects when the engine cooling fluid is boiling). Also, for quantification of probabilities and for risk reduction, deeper physical models are needed. For example, the failure mode "low braking force" for a vehicle will depend on brake wear, brake line breakage due to impact (stones, curbs etc.), or brake line cracking due to corrosion or fatigue, loss of brake fluid or air bubbles in the brake line. This type of physical effect is added to the fault tree once the system failure modes have been identified.</p><p>In some cases, failure analysis can be made without investigating physical behaviour in depth. Behavioural or performance models can be made by establishing an empirical relationship between variables. For example, the relationship between initial vehicle speed and braking distance can be measured without investigating all the physical phenomena between the vehicle mass, the wheel friction, the brake friction and the road friction. Wherever possible, physical models are preferred to behavioural models, but in some cases, as for example the relationship between road conditions and tire temperature and braking force is only imprecisely understood, while a behavioural model can be developed by testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Importance of feedback loops and tipping points</head><p>Unwanted behaviours can also stem from existing control loops and loops in controlled physical systems. They are difficult to identify, because they cannot be discovered by analyzing separate components or subsystems but only by understanding the wholeness of several connected units. A loop consists of a number of those that all in unity can give rise to unwanted behaviours because of a system effect. As mentioned before, this type of behaviours is called emergent.</p><p>As noticed, equation bi-graphs, besides serving as building blocks for automation of FT construction and accounting for physical effects and failures, are the graphical model displaying the loops, that can in fact be also recognised automatically. Detection of loops is important for the identification of emergent hazards, and once detected, they should prompt the analyst to see whether the loop properties can have an adverse effect on the system. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides a short list of loop failure modes in physical systems that should be invoked as soon as a physical loop is identified. The list is by no means complete and should be extended to become an operational means to improve the quality of the analysis. Two loops, each with its own control objectives, but with two-way interactions, so that there are feedback loops between the two primary loops 6</p><p>Nested feed forward loops</p><p>The first loop works well but drives the second loop into unwanted zones of operation so that the loop is overdriven or starved For loops within the physical system itself, parameter change due to non-linearity or drift may make loop response larger or smaller. As described above with the automobile engine for example, a following wind may cause both higher speed and reduced cooling. It may also reduce air flow over the brakes, higher brake temperature and brake "fading", which in turn can lead to unwanted higher speed.</p><p>As mentioned in Introduction, feedback loops can also give rise to another type of emergent behaviours that are referred to as tipping points.</p><p>Examples of tipping points of in the car engine are braking systems in which temperature rise causes loss of braking, allowing vehicles to continue at high speed and even higher temperatures to be achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> . In a completely different field of economic systems, a situation in which the system is overheated, with asset prices considerably above their inherent value, can undergo a rapid transition from just a little selling, if this is regarded by other investors as a symptom of a "correction". The result can be collapse of a "bubble".</p><p>Identifying potential tipping points in a system in simple cases can be done by solution of system equations over a full range of initial system state values. In many cases though, the number of possible system state values is too large for simulation investigations to be practical. The problem is reduced by investigating each loop identified in the fault tree construction and determining the conditions under which loop gain becomes positive.</p><p>There are other emergent effects which can arise in control loops, beyond just exceedance of tipping points, including overshoot or undershoot in response, delayed response, stick slip performance, hysteresis and reset wind-up, which are well known from practical control and servo system design, but are generally overlooked in systems hazards analysis because they are essentially continuum problems and are emergent because they arise due to system structure and not due to failure in any one component 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Step-by-step guidance for the continuum fault tree analysis</head><p>The fault tree analysis method is very flexible, particularly in selecting the degree of detail in events at different stages of construction and in the order of addition of events to the tree. The algorithm which is used here is basically that of Taylor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> , but with extension for continuum events and for emergent hazards related to loops in the causal model. At each stage at the construction, the system components are examined for internal and external events coming from other components via system links such as wires, pipes and information flow paths. The fault trees developed in the version of fault tree construction are all sequential or dynamic fault trees because the AND gates distinguish between "events" which are changes of component states, and "conditions" which are values of component states. These gates correspond to the "condition" or "inhibit" gates of DFT analysis, and express sequence.</p><p>Additionally, time delays are incorporated into the models, such as the time to reach tipping points.</p><p>1. An analytical model of the system performance is chosen and presented as a function of performance characteristics and other influencing parameters. An example of the performance of an automobile engine is given in Section 3.</p><p>2. An equation bi-graph visualizing connections between the continuous variables (performance characteristics) and influencing parameters is developed. If a model for any component can be found in the library of pre-developed bi-graphs of the typical physical systems, it is simply recovered from the library.</p><p>3. A Top event is selected for the fault tree, e.g., by brainstorming or by reference to accident reports. The Top event is localized within the system.</p><p>4. At each stage in the fault tree construction, internal events within a component are considered, and the associated conditions for the event. Then events at the input to the component are considered, and are traced through the system links.</p><p>4.1. Depending on the scope of the study, discrete events (spontaneous components' failures, change of outer and inner conditions and states) contributing to the accident can be added as conventional AND gates. 4.2. A visual check for feedback and feed-forward loops is made and these are assessed for the possibility of system level effects (emergent effects) such as runaway, oscillation etc. (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) 4.3. Combinations of the interacting continuous variables/parameters are added to the tree as inputs to AND gates. They should be subjected to analysis as possibly giving rise to system effects. Gaining more knowledge may be needed to foresee whether the effects are a reality. 4.5 Timing of events is taken into account for all the steps in development and relative timing of events entering into an AND gate are assessed for the possibility of races, such as the time taken for a an adverse event to occur versus the time for an emergency response. 5. Step 4 is continued until the causes of all events and conditions have been added as far as "basic event" for which causal analysis is not needed. 6. Collect data needed for the FT quantification and carry out quantification of the scenarios (find the probability or frequency of the top event to occur). Different software tools can be used for this purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Examples of application of continuum fault trees</head><p>In the project which motivated the use of continuum fault trees, a controller was designed using multiple convolutional networks, each of which having a single purpose, such as detection of an edge, and each having a single output in the form of a probability that the feature to be detected has been found. The reason for this design was to ensure the analysability of the controller, and enable risk assessment with just a manageable amount of testing. 13 One of our first observations of a system effect triggered by two continuous variables is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> , where we were constructing a FT for autonomous vehicles (AVs) controlled by neural networks (NNs). As part of a large FT with the top event 'AV crashed' there was the event 'Wrong classification of a road sign' by the NN. There were two continuously changing variables: contrast intensity and light intensity (i.e., brightness). The prediction accuracy for each variable had a threshold of 90%, so that if the accuracy for one parameter is greater than or equal to 90%, the road sign is considered classified correctly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). These results were obtained from the test of performance of a 5-layer convolutional NN against perturbations. The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset for the traffic sign classification was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> . To our surprise, certain points of the two-dimensional space 'contrast-brightness' demonstrated the system effect of the two combined variables (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Despite brightness level and contrast reduction were lying in the correct classification region, their combination fell into the misclassification region for some points of the space (the selected cells contoured in bold in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).   This observation prompted us to be attentive to possible emergent behaviours arising when two or more continuous variables can interplay in a way that is difficult to foresee if each is considered separately. Here are some more examples of continuum events in the autonomous vehicle safety analysis:</p><p>• Lane following depends on the contrast of the marking or curbstone colour, the lighting level, any mist and continuity of the marking. Good performance under adverse conditions was obtained only by combining vision algorithms and convolutional neural networks. • Cornering, where the possibility of leaving the road and possible crash depend on bend curvature, vehicle speed, tire condition and road condition, and the degree of braking <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> . • Approaching a leading vehicle, where vehicle response depends on own vehicle speed, leading vehicle speed, time at which the leading vehicle is recognized, the braking curve for own vehicle, brake condition and road condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> . • Vehicle recognition (leading, following or in an adjacent lane), where possibility of failure depends on illumination, contrast in the image of the vehicle and hence lighting, vehicle colour and fog or rain, degree of partial obscuration, colour contrast of the other vehicle against the background and "pose". • Report 27 includes a study of 18 actual accidents reported for autonomous vehicles, all of which concerned to some degree the speed and accuracy of recognition. As an example, the "sudden reveal problem" where a stationary vehicle or other obstacle in the lane is obscured by a leading vehicle and the leading vehicle pulls out to overtake the obstacle, leaving limited time for the own vehicle to recognize the obstacle and react <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> . The probability of (re-)occurrence of this kind of accident depends on continuous parameters such as degree of obscuration, speed at which the obstacle is revealed, distance to the obstacle and speed of the vehicle.</p><p>In the analysis, which we have carried out, for a test case vehicle, all the failures identified for neural network components involved the analysis of the behaviour of continuous multi-dimensional variables, as did those involving camera, lidar and radar detection, and those involving braking and steering performance. The fault trees were useful especially in identifying the ways in which different detection methods could support each other, and helping to determine the level of detection probability necessary for safety under varying road conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Quantification of continuum fault trees</head><p>The methods of quantification of FTs are well-known <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . As soon as the probabilities of basic events are estimated, the calculation of the probability of the top event is a rather simple mathematical exercise that is automated in many existing software tools. However, CFTs have an extra special event type, like event 8 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the calculation of the probability of which requires an explanation.</p><p>A failure of a system may arise from a deviation of a single system parameter when it passes a performance threshold. For example, oversteering (fishtailing) of a vehicle can arise if the vehicle takes a corner at too high a speed. Oversteering can lead to a spin or to the vehicle leaving the road, and these two possibilities introduce a further threshold, still for the single parameter.</p><p>For this case, it is natural to assume that the single parameter, centrifugal force, is a continuous stochastic variable which is governed by a given probability density function (pdf). It is truly stochastic because the centrifugal force, as determined by the following formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">𝐹 𝑐𝑓 = 𝑘 • 𝑀 • 𝑉 𝑖 2 𝐶 𝑟 ⁄ ,</formula><p>depends on the condition of the tires, pressure in them, roughness of the road, the tire/road cohesion, which can be very different depending on whether it is covered by water, snow or possibly spilled substances, wind speed and wind direction, the center of gravity of the car and some other characteristics that all are accounted in constant 𝑘. The other variables in this formula are the radius of the curvature, 𝐶 𝑟 , weight of the car, 𝑀, and velocity, 𝑉 𝑖 . The velocity, as well as the force, are of course dependent on time, which is omitted in the formula.</p><p>The probability of failure can then be determined by integrating the pdf for all values of the centrifugal force from zero (or very low) up to the threshold at which oversteer occurs.</p><p>The parameter values for failure can be described in a "parameter space". For example, the values for vehicle cornering and bend curvature can be described in a two-dimensional or multidimensional space. The separation of acceptable performance and failure in a two-dimensional space can be expressed as a line or threshold function. For a three-dimensional space, this is a surface, and for higher dimensions, a hypersurface.</p><p>In some cases, the threshold function is multivalued. This especially applies to the change of phase in substance. An example is the boiling point of water at different pressure, where the temperature for transition from liquid to gas is different from the temperature of transition from gas to liquid over a wide range of pressures.</p><p>Assume that there are two variables, 𝑋 1 and 𝑋 2 , that determine whether the system of interest operates in the acceptable performance region of a two-dimensional space. If 𝐿 𝑋 1 stands for the upper limit for 𝑋 1 , above which the value enters the failure region, we can define the failure event</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">𝐸 𝑋 1 = {𝐸 𝑋 1 : 𝑥 1 &gt; 𝐿 𝑋 1 } 1 .</formula><p>Similarly, 𝐸 𝑋 2 = {𝐸 𝑋 2 : 𝑥 2 &gt; 𝐿 𝑋 2 } is the failure event if 𝑋 2 exceeds the limit.</p><p>However, the important and distinctive feature of the CFT is that it can have the special event that makes the failure region a more complex shape. So, there is a third event determined by the two variables 𝐸 𝑋 1 ,𝑋 2 = {𝐸 𝑋 1 ,𝑋 2 : (𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ) &gt; 𝑝(𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ), 𝑥 1 ≤ 𝐿 𝑋 1 , 𝑥 2 ≤ 𝐿 𝑋 2 } that is also a failure event. This should be understood as follows: while each variable, 𝑋 1 and 𝑋 2 , lies in the permissible (acceptable performance) region, their combination may belong to the failure region. The border dividing the two regions is determined by a threshold function 𝑝(𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ).</p><p>Usually, this type of failure event takes place when variables (parameters) lie in the vicinity of the border points. That is to say, the effect of small deviations results in a failure.</p><p>The failure region can formally be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Ω = {(𝑥 1 &gt; 𝐿 𝑋 1 ) ∪ (𝑥 2 &gt; 𝐿 𝑋 2 ) ∪ ((𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ) &gt; 𝑝(𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ), 𝑥 1 ≤ 𝐿 𝑋 1 , 𝑥 2 ≤ 𝐿 𝑋 2 ) },</formula><p>where "∪" is the union operator.</p><p>Given 𝑋 1 and 𝑋 2 are independent variables and their pdfs, 𝑓 𝑋 1 (𝑥 1 ) and 𝑓 𝑋 1 (𝑥 2 ), are known, the probability of failure can be calculated by the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">𝑃(𝐹𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑢𝑟𝑒) = 𝑃((𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ) ∈ Ω) = ∬ 𝑓 𝑋 1 (𝑥 1 )𝑓 𝑋 2 (𝑥 2 )𝑑𝑥 1 𝑑𝑥 2 Ω .</formula><p>Similar formulae can be written for three and four continuous performance variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Conclusions</head><p>As with any other fault tree, continuum trees give the possibility to map events and preexisting conditions on the causal diagram that provides both a tool to overview contributing causes to the unwanted top event and a tool for quantification of the likelihood of the top event to occur. The main difference between continuum and discrete fault trees is the ability to trace the change of continuous variables characterizing the performance of components of the system until the variables enter the area in a multidimensional space that is defined as a non-operational or non-permissible region. This means that degrees of partial failure and poor component performance can be included into the trees.</p><p>This can be useful for any safety-critical system operation that can be described by analytical functions both continuous and discrete. Continuum fault tree can accommodate both failures caused by the deviation of continuous parameters and momentary discrete failures such as failure of sensors, brakes, fuel feed, etc., as for the above example of engine overheating. (The discrete events were deliberately not included to the illustrative fault tree in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> to keep it compact and focus on the continuous performance parameters).</p><p>The equation bi-graphs provide a formalisation which allows adverse physical effects to be described by means of physical models, and for component model libraries to be built up for use in future high integrity simulations. Currently, check lists of physical effects are being derived from accident and incident case histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> . The component modelling requires care to be sure that it covers relevant effects under a wide range of system configurations.</p><p>For the overall characteristic of continuum fault trees, their important and value-adding feature is the potential to help identify emergent unwanted behaviours that either rooted in multiple small deviations from nominal performance parameters or in feedback loops in control systems or/and physical systems themselves. We draw special attention to emergent behaviours such as tipping points that can be triggered by poorly designed feedback loops.</p><p>A question which was raised by a reviewer of an earlier version of this paper is that of significance or importance of continuum events in fault tree analysis. A direct approach to determination of this would be to analyse a system quantitatively, both with and without continuum events. This is not at present possible because databases of small deviation frequencies have not as yet been collected. It is however possible to assess the importance of continuum events in accident reports. A few studies were made:</p><p>• In 92 process plant risk assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> , only a small fraction of causal events identified via hazard an operability analysis involved continuum type deviations, notably: operational drift to increased production levels and closer to operational safety limits; gradual reduction in cooling efficiency of heat exchangers due to tube deposits; time to reaction runaway due to self-heating of the reaction versus time to effective operator response; and gradual build-up of coking in fixed bed reactors. On the consequence side, almost all the events and conditions are of the continuum type, such as size of release, atmospheric stability and speed of emergency response. • In our studies of autonomous vehicles camera based controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> all of the failures involved multiparameter continuum deviation except for computer failure, power supply failure and sensor failure. Of 18 actual incidents involving autonomous vehicles, 17 were caused by continuum events and 1 was caused by a missing functionality. • A study was made of Formula 1 races between 2018 and 2022, for causes of vehicles crashing into barriers or spinning out. All of these involved multi-parameter continuum deviations, especially those of timing. There were in the same several cases where vehicles left the race due to discrete events such as engine failures, fuel leaks, engine fires, gear box failure and controller failures. • Studies of road traffic crashes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> showed that about 10% of the proximate causal events could be properly described as discrete events or conditions, and all involved adverse continuum background conditions such as traffic density, visibility and speed. • Another study of ship groundings <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> (26 accident investigation reports) showed that they all were an interplay of multiple causes. All but one accident involved a discrete failure event or operational error, but all involved continuum conditions such as fairway geometry, ship traffic, wind and current.</p><p>Our conclusion is that for some risk analysis problem, continuum fault trees are occasionally useful, and for some problem types they are essential if the advantages of fault tree analysis are needed.</p><p>For individual cases, the failure probability of systems subject to multiple failures or small parameter deviations can be determined by vehicle simulation. The technique of fault insertion into simulators is well known and has been automated (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> ). The fault insertion method is the main alternative to the use of continuum fault trees for reliability and safety demonstrations of complex systems, such as engine control units, automatic braking systems and autopilot systems. Simulation has the advantage of being intuitive and being able to provide visual results for interpretation. However, the equation sets to be solved in the fault tree analysis are much smaller than those needing to be solved by simulators since a set of equations needs to be solved only once for each fault tree path, and in many cases, the equation sets for subsystems are solved just as the fault tree is developed. Also, the equation sets are related to performance limit states, which means that equations only need to be solved for equation sets which actually lead to system failure. This in turn means that far fewer parameter combinations need to be investigated. Continuum fault tree construction can be regarded as a backwards in time simulation, in which only those cases actually resulting in accidents are considered. As an example, the evaluation of the fault tree in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> requires solution of just 5 Sets of equations. For simulation, there are 5 external variables and 8 failure/degraded performance conditions. Even if only 4 numeric values are selected for each parameter for the simulation, and only combinations of two deviations at a time are considered, a complete simulation set involves at least (4 5 ) 2 simulations, or about 1 million cases. In realistic systems, rather than the illustrative case shown here, there may be several tens of parameters, and the effort in obtaining a complete simulation grows exponentially.</p><p>In practice, the two approaches, fault injection simulation and continuum fault tree analysis are considered complementary. Fault tree analysis allows far more hazard scenarios to be considered for a given amount of effort, and also supports hazard identification to select significant cases. These can then be used for fault insertion into simulations for greater understanding and observation of system performance under accident conditions. The continuum fault tree analysis can then be used for calculation of accident probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Future work</head><p>Collecting data for continuum fault trees quantification is straightforward for controllers, where performance testing can be used, as in section 8. For physical systems such as mechanical and process plant equipment, even collecting discrete event data has proved to require a large effort, and the range of data in publicly available databases is still limited. For continuum deviations in performance, the task of data collection is harder. Work is needed even to define in general what is a significant deviation in performance. For highly instrumented systems such as aircraft and autonomous vehicles under development, performance data can be collected directly for the specific system. This approach is not generally practical, however. For this reason, the approach of a good promise is that of failure physics (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> ) in which the physical processes underlying failure, and in our case, reduction in performance, are described by physical equations. This avenue still needs to be researched.</p><p>To make the continuum fault tree analysis a good engineering practice, an essential effort is required to establish and populate a library of standard component models in the form of equation bi-graphs. Such libraries were made with discrete events for process equipment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> . With models for a wider range of systems, construction of continuum fault trees can be automated and become a quite affordable risk and reliability analysis approach.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
