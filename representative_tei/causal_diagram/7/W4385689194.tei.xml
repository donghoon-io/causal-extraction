<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Indonesian government continues to launch a battery-based electric vehicle acceleration program. It is estimated that there will be significant growth in sales of battery-based electric vehicle (EVB). The battery costs about 40% of the cost of an electric vehicle (EV). With a battery life of around 8 to 10 years, EV batteries will intensively face the retirement stage and have an impact on the environment in the form of unused battery waste. The target number of EVs in Indonesia in 2030 will reach 2 million units; hence, it is estimated that there will be 0.718 million tons of batteries that need to be recycled by 2040. There is a need for a study on the reverse logistics of the electric vehicle and electric vehicle battery industries. The causal loop diagram was utilized to examine the potential dynamics existing in the reverse logistics system of EV. The results could provide support the capacity planning of EVB remanufacturing as required by the potential regulation in the future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Along with the growth of world population, the need for energy continues to increase. Concurring to the International Energy Agency projections, global energy consumption will increment by 45% until 2030 or a normal increase of 1.6% each year. Approximately 80% of the global energy needs are provided from nonrenewable fuel source <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(IEA 2022)</ref>. Indonesia is one of the countries with a continuously increasing amount of energy consumption, driven by the rate of population growth and GDP. Fuel consumption and emissions have received serious attention from the stakeholders in recent decades. The problems faced are global temperature change, climate change and side effects on human health <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Sukarno et al. 2016)</ref>. The transportation sector is expected to contribute 82% to the overall increment in liquid fuel use in 2035. Over the past three years, this segment has reached the highest yearly development percentage of 6.45% compared to other segments. 30% consumption comes from the transportation sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Sukarno et al., 2016)</ref>. Meanwhile in Indonesia more than 40% of the total energy consumption comes from the transportation sector (Ministry of Energy 2021).</p><p>At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in 2021, the Indonesian government has outlined ambitions to accelerate the deployment achieving carbon neutral by 2060. It has already built this into the government's strategic plan to accommodate sustainability standards that can be realized with low carbon emission vehicles, electric cars and their components (Ministry of Industry 2018). The indicated target is to achieve 2 million electric cars in 2030. This number would relate to around 9% of the particular stocks, compared to well beneath 0.1% in 2021. To Proceedings of the 4 th South American Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, <ref type="bibr">Lima, Peru, May 9-11, 2023</ref> © IEOM Society International aid implementation, the Presidential Regulation on Battery Electric Vehicles and the Battery Electric Vehicle Guidelines set objectives for the share of low-carbon emission vehicles including battery electric vehicles, PHEV, flex-fuel motor, and low-cost green cars in domestic manufacturing. The guideline aims to fulfill 20% of local car manufacturing in 2025 and 30% in 2035 (Ministry of Industry 2018). The development of EV in Indonesia is heavily influenced by the simultaneous development of relevant stakeholders and growing is environmental concern to be an fundamental factor in adopting Electric Vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Lonan and Ardi 2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Setiawan et al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Global government agencies are very concerned about how EV battery recycling will be handled: EV batteries typically have a lifespan of 8-10 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Li et al. 2020)</ref>. More than 5 Kg EV batteries are categorized as harmful wastes in Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Sun et al. 2015)</ref>. Without appropriate treatment, EV batteries contain plastics, mostly metals, and toxic electrolytes that can have irreversible and catastrophic consequences for the environment and human well-being <ref type="bibr">(Li et al. 2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Yang et al. 2020)</ref>. Electric vehicle batteries (EVB) can be recycled, repurposed, reused, and remanufactured at the end of life stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alamerew and Brissaud 2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Yang et al. 2020)</ref>. With battery weight 359 kg per vehicle, Indonesia's EV battery volume will reach up to 718,000 tons by 2038-2040. This study aims to investigate relationships of the complex dynamic among factors that influence battery remanufacturing capacity affecting the EV growth in Indonesia and determine capacity planning strategy to fulfill demand of remanufacturing and collection battery through a system diagram and a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD). This study will help the Indonesian government to define effective policies and regulations for EV battery waste management.</p></div>
