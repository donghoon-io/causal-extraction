<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Agriculture is the predominant user of both, freshwater and land. With rising population leading to increasing demand of food, the impacts of water-intensive food production in view of constrained soil-fertility, limited supply of land along with increasing energy-costs of irrigation and labor, may make regional cropping patterns unsustainable. Further, water-scarce regions may face additional challenges to meet requirements of local agriculture.To assess sustainability of regional agriculture, a generic model is developed using Vensim PLE software for system dynamics modeling (SDM). Considering agriculture as a complex system, the developed model captures the causality between various components of an agricultural-system in the form of a causal loop diagram (CLD) and, further simulates environmental-economic costs of rain-fed, irrigated and rainwater harvested agricultural-systems, through a quantitative model, namely, stock and flow diagram (SFD).</p><p>The SFD model is capable of simulating water-demand, energy-requirement and monetary-return (MR), on the inputs used, using crop-specific data of quantity produced, area-harvested and crop-water-requirements (CWR). The developed SFD model is further extended to simulate potential impacts of infield-rain-waterharvesting-structures (IRWHS). To support its applicability for regional assessments, it is calibrated and validated for a water-stressed region, namely, the Free State, South Africa. For this region, the model is simulated till 2035, with and without IRWHS, for four crops (namely, potato, wheat, maize-white and maizeyellow). Further, crop-specific data required for the simulation (production, area, yield etc.) is obtained for the period 1990-2010 and, CWR-data is obtained from the Water Footprint Network (WFN) database. IRWHS implementation is simulated starting 2011, with the assumption that IRWHS leads to 50% increase in the productivity of considered crops. The model was validated for both, behavior and structure. Additionally, to assess the robustness of simulated-results against the available data, the simulated results were statistically analyzed using regression techniques. For the Free State, the results indicate that due to least area and CWR, potato offers the highest MR on irrigation-energy and water-used, with or without IRWHS in both, irrigated and rain-fed systems. Further, MR on water-used in irrigated-areas is higher than in the rain-fed-areas.</p><p>Additionally, the greatest beneficiary is expected to be maize-yellow with IRWHS, followed by maize-white, wheat and potato. Furthermore, effective MR is expected to be lower for green-water (rainwater available as soil moisture), except for wheat. The biggest revelation from the simulated results is that various crops using different amounts of water and land, offer unequal MR. That is, simulated results indicate variability of MR, for both, water and electricity, used for different crops. Thus, though other studies exploring rainwater-harvesting systems indicate that water-harvesting has both, monetary and productivity, benefits; this simulation clearly shows that crop-wise-benefits are not equal. These results suggest that the crops that have lower CWRs (potato in current case) may offer the highest MR on electricity and blue-water (water from surface and ground water-bodies), whereas, the highest MR on water used under harvesting-structures is offered by the crops that have higher CWRs (wheat and maize, in present study). Due to the generic nature of this model, it can assess regional-specific environmental-economic costs of different agricultural-systems, and therefore, can assist in selection of sustainable cropping-patterns.</p></div>

Further, though the irrigated farms consume about 70% of Earth's blue-water 1 supplies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, overall contribution of the green-water 2 to the global agriculture is more than 80% <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Furthermore, agriculture operates on nearly 38% of Earth's terrestrial surface for the current global, food and feed, requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Out of which, nearly 60% is rain-fed area <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Thus, both, water and land, are integral to agriculture. However, lesser suitable-land for cropping exists in low-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, rising local water-stresses across the globe suggest lesser availability of water <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, including for agriculture.</p><p>From the perspective of agricultural-productivity, countries of Asia and Africa suffer from higher productivitygaps along with rising water-stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Additionally, majority of the future population growth is expected within the countries of Asia and Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Thus, enhanced use of water in food-production is crucial to the 'water and food security' of these nations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Since agriculture is the largest consumer of water thus, judicious use of water in agricultural-systems is paramount for the sustainability of all the systems dependent on this crucial resource.</p><p>Highlighting the role of water-use in rain-fed area, Rockström et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> stated that world's "semi-arid, dry sub-humid savannah and steppe regions" suffer from large yield-gaps due to inefficient management of inputs (water, soils &amp; crops) and, not due to lack of water. Further, to minimize the risk of crop-failure during the dryspells in small-scale agricultural systems, the researchers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) emphasized the role of water-harvesting-structures as a source of supplemental irrigation. Assessing the potential of rain-fed agriculture to meet food-demand in 2050, Fraiture et al also advocated investments in water-harvesting-structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Further, they also suggest that risks to profitability of rainwater-harvested rain-fed agriculture may be considerable, due to the uncertainty associated with labor and other inputs, along with governance and marketing issues.</p><p>Assessing the potential of rainwater-harvesting (via 'In-field Rain-water Harvesting Structures' (IRWHS) 3 ) in the semi-arid areas of the South Africa, Woyessa et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> reported that the yields of maize and sunflower increased by 30-50% compared to conventional tillage. Further, they also report that due to limited availability of suitable land and slow expansion rate of the IRWH technique, the impact from runoff-reduction to the downstream irrigation, is not significant in the short to medium-term. Thus, the stated study ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>) substantiates that effective deployment of apt knowledge and technology in the rain-fed farms can lead to higher grain-productivity, thereby, enhancing the productivity of both, land and water <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p><p>Along with highlighting the main physical components of the agricultural-system, namely, water, land, energy for irrigation, etc., above mentioned studies attempts to capture the differences between irrigated and rainfed systems, especially focusing on the role played by water. Further, to address the challenge of increasing productivity in water-scarce regions, the role of water-harvesting is emphasized. Additionally, many models of the agriculture-systems have been both, developed and used. These models address objectives such as, crop 1 Surface and groundwater <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> 2 Rainfall &amp; trans-evaporation through soil and vegetation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> 3 Structures built in the field to tap rainwater before runoff, to be used later for irrigating crops productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, GHG emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, food security <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, land-transformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, carbon-flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, waterused in crop production <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> etc. Additionally, water-specific dynamic models have also been developed for agriculture-policy making <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Although agricultural-models integrating both, physical and socio-economic components <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, have been developed, however, these stand-alone assessments do not offer insight about the sustainability of regionalagriculture (irrigated or rain-fed), from both, ecological and economic, perspectives. Furthermore, decision supporting models, simultaneously exploring the role of both, blue and green, water used in agriculture, along with estimating monetary-return (MR) on water-used at the regional scale, has been a relatively unexplored territory.</p><p>Additionally, many of the above mentioned studies do not dwell on the intricate structure of agricultural system/s. Thus, it does not assist in understanding how a particular cropping pattern can be environmentally and economically sustainable, with available renewable (land, rainwater, etc.) and non-renewable (fertilizer, pesticides etc.) inputs. Additionally, the dynamic aspect of short-term versus long-term sustenance is also not captured in the above mentioned studies.</p><p>Thus, the objective of this research is to assess sustainability of different types of agricultural-systems. To achieve the stated goal, this study first acknowledges agriculture as a 'complex-system'. Wherein, a 'complex system' is defined as a system whose behavior is dependent on the dynamics attributed to its integral components.</p><p>Next, to support the argument that agriculture is a complex human-environment system <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, the structure of an agricultural-system is elucidated. The structure, elucidated through the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (and Supporting Information (SI), Figure S.1), captures the coupled interactions between ecological and social components of the agricultural-system.</p><p>Thus from a systems' perspective, the dynamics of the agricultural system is governed by its various components (land, water-use etc.) and the interactions between them. That is, by changing the total area or crop-type sown in the field, irrigation and energy requirements, can be projected, which in turn, can be subsequently transformed into production and revenue statistics, along with providing forecast of demand of water for agriculture in a region. Since the objective of this study is to assess the sustainability of agricultural-systems by ascertaining regionalspecific environmental-economic costs of different agricultural-systems (while considering agriculture as a complex system), thus, a causal loop diagram (CLD) is developed to capture the causality between various social-economic and ecological components with Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> as the background. The technique used for developing the causal-model is a dynamic modeling approach, namely, system dynamics modeling (SDM). Further, the dynamics of the system is explored via a quantitative model, namely, a stock and flow diagram (SFD). The developed SFD simulates the environmental-economic costs of regional cropping-patterns.</p><p>With the system boundary of analysis being limited to the production-site, the SFD estimates water-use, energy, land and, monetary return (MR) on inputs (water, land and energy) used for individual crops, of both, rain-fed and irrigated, agricultural-systems. Additionally, the extended model, explores the role of policy-interventions, such as, IRWHS, to tap green-water for irrigation. Among other things, the results (obtained from the model) can highlight the role of both, irrigation and rainwater, used in agricultural-production; and, can further quantify the expected MR from water-harvesting-structures. Thereby, the simulations assist in assessing the role of IRWHS to reduce contribution from the other blue-water reservoirs (such as, lakes, rivers and ground-water sources) along with decreasing the demand of energy used for irrigation. Additional details of the methodology, model and study area are given in the Section 2.</p><p>Further, to make this assessment relevant to water-scarce regions, the quantitative model (SFD) is calibrated using regional-data of a water stressed country, namely, South Africa (SA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Furthermore, to perform the regional assessment, it is assumed that the current food production practices would continue in the region (Free State, SA, the selected region), along with the requirements of land and water would be met. Thus, the model simulates monetary return (MR) on the inputs (water, land and energy) used, for various crops grown in the Free State (namely, maize, wheat and potato), using crop-specific water-requirements and quantity-produced, among other inputs.</p><p>To facilitate the presentation of this article, it is organized in various sections. The following section 2, provides details of the methodology employed, the model developed and the data-used for calibration. The limitations of the developed model are also discussed in this section. The subsequent section 3 first discusses evaluation of the model and simulated forecasts against available data, and later, interpret the results of both, with and without rainwater-harvesting-systems. The last section 4 offers discussion and potential for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Methodology</head><p>System dynamics (SD) methodology (SDM) is a system-simulation technique pioneered by Prof. Jay F. Forrester for analyzing behavior of complex systems using control-systems theory and was initially applied to industrial problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. SDM allows analyzing of causality and quantitative simulation by capturing feedback between parts of a system, that generate non-linear response over time. With the ability to capture causality and assess dynamics of a system using mathematical-simulation, SDM can elucidate results of policies that are totally counterintuitive. Thus, SDM has been widely used to simulate complex systems in social, industrial and environmental sphere or having interconnections between them such as, agriculture. SDM has been used for both, agricultural assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> and rainwater-harvesting <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Application of SDM in SA includes SAGEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> for evaluation of energy scenarios and decision making in irrigated-systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. SDM was used to assess crop production of Egypt incorporating concepts of water-footprint and virtual-water-flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. For additional details of SDM methodology, tools and their application for this analysis, refer to the Supporting Information (SI), Section S.1.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modeling the agricultural system: Causal loop and stock &amp; flow diagrams</head><p>This section describes the qualitative model, developed using Vensim PLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>  Referring to the causal loop diagram (CLD) given in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, connections are highlighted in blue and pink color. Wherein, the first color indicates the simulated-links marked with the alphabet 'S', whereas, the latter color represent the connections pertaining to the external environment marked with alphabet 'E'. The variables with the pink color are not simulated in the current quantitative model. Further, the words 'link' and 'connector' means feedback/s between the variables. Furthermore, polarity is also indicated with the links. The positive polarity implies that, if the explanatory variable increases, then the dependent variable will also increase. Whereas, the negative polarity means, that if the explanatory variable increases, dependent variable will decrease.</p><p>To explain the causality and workings of the conceptualized, qualitative-model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), we start with the variable, 'Production'. This variable represents the quantity-produced from both, 'Rainfed area' (shown via link S1) and 'Irrigated area' (represented by connector S2), for the considered crop. It is connected to the variables, 'Productivity-Rainfed Area (Yield)' and 'Productivity-Irrigated Area (Yield)', wherein, both have positive polarity (as shown via the connectors S3 and S4, respectively). The 'Rainfed Area' and 'Irrigated Area', are constituents of the arable-area, as shown via S5 and S6 respectively. It is assumed that as the 'Rainfed area' increases, 'Green water use' increases as well (indicated by S7) and increase in 'Irrigated Area' increases 'Blue water use-Irrigation' (highlighted by S8).</p><p>The 'Blue water use-Irrigation' is assumed to be dependent on available 'Energy for Irrigation', that suggests as energy for irrigation increases, more water is pumped for irrigation, captured by S9. The 'Blue water use-Irrigation' is further expected to enhance 'Productivity-Irrigated Area (Yield)', suggested by S10. 'Chemical Use' implying application of Fertilizers and other chemicals is also positively connected to 'Productivity-Irrigated Area(Yield)' and 'Productivity-Rainfed Area(Yield)', however it is not simulated in the current model since production of such inputs is not on-site and, forms part of an extended network, as indicated by E1 and E2, respectively.</p><p>The variable, 'Energy for Irrigation', has an inverse relationship to the variable, 'Price of Energy-Irrigation' (indicated by S11), and is captured in the quantitative model. Further, it is positively linked with the variable, 'Energy Supply' (indicated by S12). Furthermore, it is assumed that both, 'Energy Supply' and 'Water Supply for Domestic &amp; Industry' variables, have positive correlation (economic) with the variable, 'Revenue from Industry &amp; Services' (as indicated by E10 and E9, respectively).</p><p>The energy and price variables mentioned above are part of a larger economic-network that is not simulated in the current model. However, the economic-network is a crucial part of the complete agricultural system. Hence, it is described as a separate sub-system altogether. It is assumed, that the variable, 'Energy Supply', is affected by both, the available ecological input resource, (that is, 'Water for Energy generation', highlighted via E29) and the human built economic resource (that is, 'Infrastructure for energy', indicated by E27). The variable, 'Energy Supply' affects 'Energy Use' with positive polarity, indicating that if more supply is available, more energy is used in the economy (indicated by E28). Further, since 'Energy Supply' cannot increase at will (being constrained by infrastructure and fuel), and is a precious resource, the higher 'Energy Use' is expected to increase 'Price of Energy-Irrigation', shown via positive connector E30.</p><p>To indicate how the resource-use in one sector of the economy can affect allocation for other sectors, it is shown via link E31 that if, increased 'Chemical Use' (that encompasses agriculture related fertilizer-manufacturing as well) decreases the 'Energy Use' in irrigation, then, it can have an effect on energy-prices, as indicated via the link, E30. Further, 'Energy Use' is assumed to have a positive relationship (indicated by E32) with the variable,'GDP' indicating 'Gross Domestic Product' of the economy. The 'GDP' is further linked to the variable, 'Infrastructure for energy' (indicated by E26). Furthermore, 'GDP' is also affected by the revenue-generation in the economy, that originates from the variable, 'Revenue from Industry &amp; Services', and, is captured with positive polarity via the link, E24.</p><p>The 'GDP' has an extended network wherein all the variables, 'Investment' E23, 'Savings' E22, 'Income' E20 and 'Labor Use' E18, have a positive polarity to 'GDP'. Further, the variable, 'Labor Use', is positively connected to both, 'Production' (from agriculture), indicated via E17 and, 'Production-Other sectors', via E33. The reason for indicating a positive polarity from 'Production' to 'Labor Use' is, that, even if, direct-labor is replaced via machines, indirect-labor (technology-savvy) would still be required to operate such systems. That is, agriculture is still not considered fully automated. Further, the variable 'Income' plays a critical role to generate 'Food demand', indicated via E19. Further, 'Food demand' is positively linked to 'Food Prices' via E21. Further, 'Food Prices' is considered to be positively affected by the variable, 'Selection of crops offering maximum returns', indicated via E25. The variable, 'Food demand' positively affects 'Demand for Arable land' via E14, that determines the 'Arable land' used for each crop i.e. E15, and, it ('Arable land') is assumed to be negatively related to the variable, 'Land for other uses-Forest Area etc' via E16. The non-simulated ecological input is indicated by 'Rainfall', which The role of IRWHS's is captured via the variable, 'Investment in IRwHS', that is assumed to positively affect both, 'Conversion from rainfall to irrigated' and 'Productivity-Rainfed Area(Yield)', via S14 and S15, respectively. Further, it is assumed that the decrease in 'Blue water Availability' has an inverse relationship to the variable,'Investment in IRwHS', shown via E34. Furthermore, 'Conversion from rainfall to irrigated' is expected to increase the proportion of 'Irrigated Area', as indicated by E35.</p><p>Thus, this section outlined the assumptions forming the background of the proposed agricultural-system. Further, it explained the linkages in the designed-system, which are necessary to understand the functioning of the system. Thereby, the outlined structure (connections between the variables) and the defined rules (relationship between the variables), assists in understanding the behavior emanating from the developed quantitative model i.e. SFD (which is explained in the SI, Section 2.2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Study Area &amp; Data</head><p>The Free State (FS) is the third largest province in South Africa (SA), with a total cropped area of nearly 3 million hectares <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. The state contributes nearly 35% to national agricultural production <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. Further, though only 10% of area is irrigated in the FS <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, nearly 35% of wheat and maize production is contributed from irrigated fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. For additional details of FS'agriculture, refer to SI, Section S.1.1. Further, Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.1 in the SI, indicates the data that was used for simulating the results of, wheat and other crops. Also, the same table reports the data-sources, including agricultural statistics of the FS <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr">54,</ref><ref type="bibr">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">56]</ref>.</p><p>The data obtained from these sources is used for estimation of control-parameters in the simulated model. The evaluated parameters include fractions of the areas, yields and, production from both, rain-fed and irrigated, areas.</p><p>For each crop, the average-yield is estimated as a median value and, is obtained from available production statistics (rain-fed and irrigated, separately); whereas, the maximum-yield is considered equal to the highest reported in production statistics and/or available literature. Irrigated (blue) and rain-fed (green) water requirements are obtained from Water Footprint Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[57]</ref> for a unit of quantity produced, that is, a tonne. Further, proxy for water-use in the irrigated-systems in the FS is considered equal to the fraction produced by the state, of the total water-withdrawn for irrigation in SA <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[58]</ref>. That is, 0.25 (62 % of total water-withdrawn for irrigation and 40% of the production obtained from the FS). This value of irrigation (water and electricity consumed) in agriculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref> is used for estimation of energy consumption per unit of pumped-water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Limitations</head><p>Since the objective of this study is to ascertain the environmental-economic parameters (for sustainable cropping) using a system-analysis tool, only those tools of SDM methodology are employed that can be validated by some measure in this work. Thus, time-delays (used in SDM applications) and feedback from the environment (both, natural and social, such as, temporal variations in the weather, change in diets etc.), that can affect production are not included in this work. That is, this model is not comprehensive enough, to provide assessment about the regional hydro-logical feasibility or the consumption-behavior. Further, it does not incorporate information about competing uses of water <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>. Reason being, neither the data, nor the complete information, about the quantitative-systemic rules of the broader environment is available. Thus, though this model is using SDM technique, systems'behavioral indicators are mostly capturing production related feedback/s. Additional details of limitations of the developed model are given in the SI Section, S.2.6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Model's structure &amp; results evaluation</head><p>The model was tested for both, structure and data. Structure was tested for extreme conditions for the input parameters, dimensional consistency and behavioral sensitivity, as suggested by proposed validity tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref>. Further, the testing of this model for four different crops with distinct parameters explicitly assesses the sensitivity as well as behavioral response from the proposed model. Similarly, extended model with IRWHS (capturing a technical intervention) represents a policy intervention in the production-site. Simulated-results for input parameters results were statistically analyzed (against the observed values) using regression techniques, and, the results are presented in SI Figures S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref>  </p></div>

The detailed results, of the other crops, are given in the SI, Section S.3.2. The results of maize-y are presented in the Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, in a modified form. These results illustrate the change in the cropped-area (a), expected productivity (b), production (c), water used (d), energy used for irrigation (e), monetary return (MR) on the water (f), price increases in future (g) and, expected revenues from the produce (h). <ref type="table">S</ref>.1 in the SI, area under maize-y is expected to decline with a rate of nearly 0.5% per year. However, irrigated-area is expected to increase with a rate of 0.4%. Simulating this trend in the model, the results, Figure <ref type="figure">3 (a)</ref>, indicate that the total area under crop is expected to decrease over time due to decline in rain-fed area, though the fraction of irrigated area is expected to increase. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (b) represents productivity of both, rain-fed and irrigated areas, which tends to stagnate over time. Figure <ref type="figure">3 (c)</ref> represents production. Combining Figures <ref type="figure">3 (a</ref>) and (b), one can infer that the production (Figure <ref type="figure">3 (c)</ref>) from irrigated-area is expected to be larger in future, due to increase in irrigated-area (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (a)) along with higher productivity from the same (irrigated-area). compared to the total-water used in the irrigated-area, is going to decrease. Further, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (e) reports energyuse associated with irrigation (blue-water). Using the commodity prices indicated in the Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (g), Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (f) indicates the expected MR per unit of water-consumed. This figure (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (f)) suggests that irrigation increases the MR of blue-water considerably. However, MR on rainwater is still higher in rain-fed area than the total-water used in the irrigated area, which in turn highlights the importance of timely irrigation for maize-y. Furthermore, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> (h) represents the total revenue generated from the total production. Further, the results of maize-y presented in the Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.3 (obtained from CWR for maize in Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.1) in the SI, suggests that the demand of blue-water is expected to increase from 61 million cubic meters (MCM) in 2010 to 335 MCM in 2035. This indicates a five-fold increase in blue-water used. However, total-water used in the irrigated-area is expected to increase nearly eight-fold. Further, since the rain-fed area under maize-y is expected to decline over time, thereby, the demand of green-water is also expected to decrease. This decline in the use of green-water represents nearly 33% of water-used (green-water) in 2010 (that is, approximately 1231 MCM in 2035). Thus, aggregating the water-use of maize-yellow in 2035 from both, rain-fed and irrigated areas, it is expected that the total-water-use would increase by approximately 50% compared to 2010 (that is, nearly 2275 MCM in 2010).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>With the input data indicated in the Table</head><p>Assuming that the rise in prices follows the suggested trend, results indicated, in the SI, Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.3 and the Figure S.15, suggest that MR on blue-water used in the irrigated-area would increase nearly 6 to 7 times per m 3 in 2035 compared to MR on blue-water used in 2010 (8 Rand per m 3 ). Further, MR on the total-water-used in the irrigated-area indicates an approximate 8-fold increase (SI Figure S.17). However, this increase would be slightly lesser than the water-used in the rain-fed area (equaling nearly 9 times, SI figure S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>). This suggests a slightly higher rate of increase in MR for the water-used in rain-fed-area compared to the irrigated-area. However, MR on blue-water in absolute terms, in 2035, would be nearly 6 times than that on green-water. Further, though energy-used for irrigation is expected to increase nearly 5 to 6 folds in 2035 compared to 2010, however, increase to the revenue from per unit of electricity used is expected to be twice only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Results of the other crops</head><p>This section briefly discusses the results of the other crops, with the details provided in the SI, Section S.3.2. The total-area under maize-white (maize-w) is expected to increase to nearly 2-times (compared to 2010) in 2035.</p><p>Further, though nearly a 3-fold increase is expected in the irrigated-area of maize-w, however the rain-fed-area is expected to remain the same. Furthermore, total-water-use would increase nearly 3-fold in 2035 (compared to 2010), with the blue-water from irrigation is expected to create an additional demand of nearly 11 to 12-folds.MR on blue-water used is anticipated around 53 Rand per m 3 in 2035, in comparison with 8 Rand per m 3 (reported for green and total water used) in 2010. Thus, multiple of increase in MR in 2035 would be about 7 times for blue-water and, for rainwater (green-water), it would nearly 9 times, in comparison with 2010. Energy used for irrigation would increase nearly 12-times in 2035, versus that in 2010. Results of potato indicate that, though, it had a far less area under cropping to start with, it would still offer the highest absolute MR on both, green and blue water. However, the rate of increase in MR (of potato) would be one-third compared to maize. Results of wheat indicate, the rate of decrease in the area is about 8.5% over time. Thus, wheat is expected to have negligible area under cropping in 2035, and, most of it would be irrigated. Thus, though wheat offers twice the MR on green-water used in maize in 2010, however, in 2035, it (wheat) would offer the lowest absolute MR on water-used.</p><p>From the results presented in the SI Figures S.15, S.16 and S.17, it can be further inferred that green-water on the rain-fed-area offers lower MR in comparison with total water used in the irrigated-area. Reason being bluewater (timely irrigation) leads to higher productivity and thereby, increased production. This provides substantial evidence that irrigation increases MR of water-used. Further, since there is an energy cost associated with irrigation, these results indicate that maize-white (the primary grain-crop) would need a substantial amount of energy for irrigation in the future, compared to wheat or other crops. However, revenue on per unit of electricityused, would be the highest for potato, since its CWR is lower compared to other grain crops (reference to Figure S.14 in the SI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results -with IRWHS</head><p>The main-model is extended to explore the role of rainwater-harvesting-structures (hereafter referred as Infield Rainwater Harvesting Structures (IRWHS)) starting from the year 2011. Section S.2.4 in the SI reports equations related to IRWHS. Results related to IRWHS-implementation for all crops, are based on two assumptions: (i) cost of IRWHS per unit yield-increase is 2000 Rands per tonne and (ii) rate of conversion, from rain-fed to IRWHSland, is 5%. Further, it is assumed that over time irrigated-area decreases due to increase in the productivity (and thereby, production) from IRWHS-area. This in turn implies change in water-use. Detailed results are presented in the SI Tables, S.2 and S.4. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> indicates the results of maize-yellow, whereas, SI Section, S.  Although, other studies exploring rainwater-harvesting systems, indicate that water-harvesting has both, monetary <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref> and productivity benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>, this simulation clearly shows that crop-wise-benefits are not equal. Such an insight allows us to assess which type of water (rainwater versus ground or surface) should be used for food and non-food requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref>. Further, if the price of bio-fuels becomes higher than food-commodities, waterallocation towards non-food crops may increase. The implication of such a result, is that the cascading effects would be felt in the form of global food-trade and thereby, virtual-water <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which in turn, implies effect would be felt on the food-prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>. Thus, though this model does not explicitly capture global food-pricing systems, it does offer a fertile ground to conjecture the global effects of local systems' breakdown. If MR (of all local inputs) is expected to increase in future (due to increasing scarcity per person), global prices of outputs would also increase. Such results are also forecast by global-macro-agricultural models <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>.</p><p>However, food being an integral part of human life and, a large population is involved in its production in the low-income and populated nations. Thus, it is imperative for water-stressed and developing countries with rising populations, such as, South Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">69]</ref>, India and, others, to increase the yields in low input rain-fed systems. Increased yields in both, irrigated &amp; rain-fed, farms could also lead to more productivity per unit of scarce-water. And, increased regional production may control global food prices. Additionally, since food-demand is different from nutritional requirements, wheat cannot be substituted for vegetables or meat. This implies, that since input-requirements of crops vary, environmental footprint (such as, water) also differ. Thus estimation of site-specific environmental-impacts can assist in choosing cropping-patterns that have optimal dependence on both, renewable resources.</p><p>As stated earlier, this developed model is generic in mature. Thus, it can offer site-specific insight to the decision-makers about the amount of water, energy &amp; land that would be required by the agricultural systems.</p><p>Further, though this model focuses on water, energy and the related MR, however, other environmental-impacts such as, annual nitrogen-loading in a region's freshwater bodies can also be estimated (based on yearly application of fertilizers) by extending the models' structure. However, simulation of such environmental-impacts would require ecological (crop type, phenological) knowledge and would definitely increase the data-requirements for calibrating and testing such models, however, would assist in designing sustainable agricultural systems. Further, principles of agro-ecology could guide in designing sustainable agricultural-farms <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>. Thus, further improvisations of this SDM model could be explored in varied dimensions. Hence, as a future course of research, the developed model could be explored for designing sustainable agricultural system using regional sustainability indexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>. Further, the model could be explored as a multi-objective (monetary valuation and total regional production), multi-constraint (available ecological resources), optimization-problem (for optimal allocation of land, water and energy).</p><p>Last, it is formally acknowledged, that, though this model may be inadequate in using many SDM concepts (feedbacks, delays, non-linearity) quantitatively. However, the case of use of excessive tools for quantification in SDM is not advocated either <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>. Further, though Winz et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref> concluded that SDM is not well-suited for operational problems pertaining to integrated water-resources management, this model is presenting an operational view. Thus, this research highlights how SDM can be employed for operational performance while being parsimonious with model parameters, along with exploring the ecological aspect of sustainability. Hence, it is stated, that this developed model might still be useful to analyze complex workings of regional, agricultural-production systems, if the assumptions and the data hold <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Agriculture System: The Network</figDesc></figure>

The quantitative model representing the stocks &amp; flows of wheat-production (or, stock &amp; flow diagram (SFD)), is reported as Figure S.3 in the SI.

Thus, the model elucidates how an intervention like water harvesting could impact associated inputs, required for different crops. Simulated-results of different crops, ascertains both, the sensitivity and the behavior of the developed model. Further, the regression results substantiate the efficacy of the model's simulated-results with actual data. Additionally, being a generic, it is suggested that the model can be adapted to any region.Results of the Free State (Section 3 &amp; SI Section S.3 and Tables S.2, S.3 &amp; S.4) indicate, that if the historical trends continue, requirements of inputs for agricultural activities would increase substantially. Since most of the ecological-resources (water, land for cultivation) are finite in given space &amp; time, pricing of outputs (final crop produce) is going to escalate. Further, the results indicate variability on MR of both, water and electricity, for different crops. That is, the biggest revelation of this study is that the crops using different quantities of water and land, offer unequal MR on inputs-used. Further, wheat-crop, which is showing declining trends in area under cultivation, is expected to increase production as well as offer the highest MR on water-use with water-harvesting.Whereas, potato, that has least CWR among the considered crops, offers the highest MR on electricity and blue-water. That is, the crop with least CWR offers the best MR on irrigation. Coincidentally, potato is also the most perishable crop (vegetable) among the considered crops.</figDesc><table /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>IRWHS-costs, as represented by the Figure <ref type="figure">4 (b)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(c) presents a comparison between irrigated and total areas, with and without IRWHS. Further, this figure indicates that with IRWHS, total-area is expected to be lower than that under normal trend. Furthermore, fraction of irrigated-area is expected to decline substantially due to increase in productivity from both, rain-fed &amp; IRWHS, areas (which are likely to replace production from the irrigated-area). Also, the total-production is expected to be lower without IRWHS, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(d). Since irrigatedarea (&amp; respective contribution from the same) is expected to decline, total-water used for maize-yellow, reported in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(e), would be equal to green-water used in both, rain-fed &amp; IRWHS, areas. With the implementation of IRWHS, the blue-water use (from energy-based irrigation) in 2035 is expected to be only 10% of the amount reported without IRWHS (that is, 335 MCM, reported for the original simulation in Table <ref type="table">S</ref>.2 in the SI). Use of green-water is expected to be nearly 2.5 times more in case of IRWHS in 2035. Though, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(f) indicates that MR on blue-water used in irrigated-area would be significantly higher than MR of water-used in both, rain-fed &amp; IRWHS areas, however, energy used for irrigation is expected to fall since the contribution of blue-water would decline. For details of other crops, refer to SI Section S.3.2.2.</p><p>These results indicate that if the production and price trends continued, water-requirements would be higher without IRWHS. Also, it is expected that production would be lower with IRWHS for all the crops (SI Table <ref type="table">S</ref> . Further, the irrigated-area is expected to decline due to implementation of IRWHS. Reason being, it is assumed that due to the energy-costs associated with irrigation, irrigated-area would be converted to IRWHS-irrigated area. Thus, blue and total water used on irrigated lands is expected to fall. However, it is anticipated, the use of green-water would increase due to IRWHS. Additionally, the highest beneficiary of IRWHS is expected to be wheat, since wheat's area indicates an increase under waterharvesting, SI Figure S.29 (c). Furthermore, as indicated in the Figures <ref type="figure">4,</ref><ref type="figure">S</ref>.27, S.28, and S.29, total-water used along with total production for all crops is less with IRWHS except for wheat. Additionally, the less water intensive crop (potato) would offer the highest MR on both types of water, total-water used in rain-fed &amp; irrigated farms and, electricity used for irrigation. Although, the results of both, with and without IRWHS, suggest that MR (on all inputs) is expected to increase, however, effective MR on blue-water used in irrigation is going to remain the same under IRWHS (SI Figure S.22). Further, MR on green-water used for the considered crops may not increase, except for wheat (SI Figure S.24), wherein the irrigated-area (of wheat) gets converted to IRWH-area. Additionally, MR of green-water equals the total-water used in the production of wheat. Thus, the MR on green water is expected to be less for all crops under IRWHS and energy use would fall maximum for wheat and maize-yellow (SI Figures S.5, S.7, S.9 &amp; S.11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Total water used and annual available rainwater</head><p>Tables S.12 and S.21 indicate total water used for the 4 crops considered in the FS. Using area and rainfall statistics of FS, it is estimated that the total available rainwater (renewable) is between 26-91 billion cubic meters (BCM) (200-700 mm multiplied with 12.98 million hectares). Similarly, rainwater available on cropped land (3 million hectares) is between 6-21 BCM. Using median-value of 13.5 BCM and assuming that all the rainwater can be used by the crops, results suggest that the available rainwater would be adequate for growing these crops till 2029 (assuming no negative impacts on rainfall due to climate change, and only these four crops are grown). Further, rainwater available in the non-farming area of FS would be around 20-70 BCM. With a per capita freshwater use of 36.5 m 3 per year (assuming 100 liters per day), FS required nearly 0.1 BCM for satisfying domestic water requirements of its 2.8 million inhabitants <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref> in 2014. These numbers, clearly suggests, that adequate rainwater is available in the FS and, it is the designing and management of water in both, agricultural and non-agricultural, systems that needs attention for meeting socio-economic objectives.</p></div>
