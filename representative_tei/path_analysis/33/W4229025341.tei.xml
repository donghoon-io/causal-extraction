			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Videogames can satisfy people's basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This may lead them to develop a passion for the activity, which can be harmonious or obsessive. These different types of passions are associated with different wellbeing outcomes: harmonious passion (HP) is associated with positive effects such as satisfaction with life, obsessive passion (OP) is associated with adverse effects such as psychological distress. While time spent playing videogames has sometimes been found to be a predictor of poor wellbeing, there is a lack of understanding in its role in explaining the relationship between passion and wellbeing compared to other factors. Self-regulation is an important factor in predicting habits, including videogame play. In this cross-sectional study (N = 182), we investigated whether self-regulation or play time better mediated the associations between different passion orientations and wellbeing (i.e., satisfaction with life, global subjective wellbeing, psychological distress) among videogame players. A path analysis revealed that people with higher HP for videogames reported higher levels of selfregulation and those with higher OP for videogames reported lower levels of self-regulation.</p><p>Our findings also indicate that self-regulation provides a more comprehensive explanation for the relationship between passion and wellbeing. Overall, this study provides further support for the importance of self-regulation as a determinant of wellbeing in videogame players rather than more arguably surface level metrics such as time spent playing. These findings have implications for game developers and clinicians who design interventions for individuals who may experience unregulated videogame play.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Playing videogames is among the most popular leisure activities, with an estimated 3.0 billion players worldwide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Games are designed to satisfy people's basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> which can lead players to develop a passion for videogaming. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Such passion can be harmonious and/or obsessive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Harmonious passion (HP) for gaming has been associated with positive outcomes, such as social capital and life satisfaction; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> however, obsessive passion (OP) for gaming has been associated with negative outcomes, such as loneliness and psychological distress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Because people invest considerable time and effort in their passions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> previous research has mostly focused on negative wellbeing outcomes in relation to time spent playing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> yet other evidence suggests that how people engage with videogames might better explain the relationship between passion and wellbeing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Using the theoretical frameworks of Dualistic Model of Passion and self-regulation, the current research sought to advance our understanding of how passion for gaming is associated with wellbeing by examining the mediating roles of self-regulation ability and time spent gaming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dualistic Model of Passion</head><p>Passion is a strong inclination towards activities in which people find value and enjoyment and as a result are willing to invest time and effort. <ref type="bibr">8 2, 3</ref> HP arises from autonomous internalisation of an enjoyable activity, engaged in willingly in balance with other life activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Need satisfaction within a target activity and in daily life has been found to predict greater HP for an activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> HP predicts greater levels of subjective vitality and life satisfaction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> greater work-related satisfaction and performance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and decreased burnout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> HP for gaming has been associated with positive affect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> fewer negative physical symptoms resulting from excessive time spent playing videogames, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> skill development, motivation to relax and recreate, post-play energy, increased social capital, reduced loneliness, and improved life-satisfaction and mental health. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> OP arises when an individual experiences a controlled internalisation of an activity into their personal identity, whereby intrapersonal or interpersonal contingencies compel them to engage in the activity for social acceptance, self-esteem, or due to uncontrollable excitement from engagement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Greater OP for an activity is associated with need frustration and absence of need satisfaction in daily life, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and higher levels of need satisfaction with the activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> OP for an activity is thought to be a compensatory strategy to combat failures in satisfying basic needs in other areas of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> OP is associated with adverse outcomes including increased interpersonal conflicts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> tension resulting from work/life balance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> negative affect and rumination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> OP for gaming is associated with dissociation motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and illbeing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Time Spent Gaming Passion for gaming could influence wellbeing through time spent gaming. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Excessive amounts of time spent playing videogames has been shown to predict decreased levels of offline social support and increased levels of depressive and anxious symptoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Kirby et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> similarly found time spent gaming to negatively predict psychological wellbeing; however, this relationship was fully mediated when accounting for problematic play and immersion.</p><p>Przybylski and Weinstein <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> suggested that patterns of engagement may be more important than the amount of time spent on screen-based activities. In fact, time spent on videogaming is more strongly associated with HP than OP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> did not significantly predict problematic gaming when accounting for OP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and time spent playing videogames may improve affective wellbeing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> As such, it is important to look beyond time spent playing videogames and consider how players are able to regulate themselves in order to fit videogame play in with their other activities. 10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Regulation</head><p>Self-regulation is an important trait for affective wellbeing and predicting success in life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> It involves setting goals, observing and evaluating actions in comparison to internal and external standards, and altering behaviours using self-reactive incentives and reflective processes to control impulses and attain goals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> Prior studies found self-regulation was an important factor in predicting videogame engagement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> People with low levels of self-regulation tend to exhibit more problematic videogaming behaviours including rigid habits of gaming. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Previous research has also established that OP is associated with greater impulsivity and activity addiction, and low selfregulatory capacity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> which supports the idea that low levels of self-regulation could account for a negative association between OP for videogames and wellbeing.</p><p>In contrast, HP has been found to be positively associated with self-regulation and knowledge management in the context of e-learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> Thus, greater self-regulation could account for the positive association between HP for videogames and wellbeing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>This study investigates the potential wellbeing costs and benefits of OP and HP for gaming by examining the potential mediating roles of self-regulation and time spent playing videogames. Based on the literature overview presented above, we expected self-regulation to play a stronger mediating role, but thought it was important to establish this while controlling for play time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Participants were asked to indicate their age, gender, and estimated hours of weekly videogame play. They filled out the 12-item Passion Scale 21 (HP α=0.71; OP α=0.80), the 31item Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> (SSRQ, α=0.93), the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale 42 (α=0.89), the 15-item Wellbeing Profile-Medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> which assesses Global Subjective Wellbeing (GSWB) (α=0.90), and the 5-item Satisfaction with Life (SWL) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> (α=0.89). See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for example items and response scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We defined and tested a path model in which HP and OP were predictors, selfregulation and play time were parallel mediators, and the wellbeing measures were outcomes a Supplementary analyses confirmed that our reported pattern of results did not change when accounting for age (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S1</ref>-S3).</p><p>(see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We assessed total effects to confirm previous findings. Then, we investigated indirect effects of HP and OP on wellbeing outcomes through self-regulation and play time to evaluate potential mediation effects. Path analysis was conducted in JASP Version 0.14.1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>All of the total effects were significant (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). OP was negatively associated with GSWB and SWL, and positively associated with psychological distress. Conversely, HP was positively associated with GSWB and SWL, and negatively associated with psychological distress.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the indirect effects from OP and HP on the wellbeing measures through self-regulation and play time. The indirect effects of HP on wellbeing were significant and consistently linked HP with better wellbeing through greater self-regulation.</p><p>The indirect effects of OP on wellbeing were significant and consistently linked OP with worse wellbeing through lower self-regulation. Conversely, only one of the indirect effects through play time reached significance, i.e., a negative indirect effect of OP on GSWB through more play time.</p><p>The analysis of direct effects (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) showed that after controlling for the mediators, OP was positively associated with psychological distress, while the associations with GSWB and SWL were not significant. The direct effect of HP on psychological distress did not reach significance, but effects on GSWB and SWL were significant and positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study analysed whether self-regulation or play time mediated the associations between different passion orientations and wellbeing among videogamers. Path analysis of total effects revealed the expected associations between HP and better wellbeing outcomes and between OP and worse wellbeing outcomes. Examination of the indirect effects revealed significant mediation of the associations between HP and all wellbeing outcomes through greater self-regulation, supporting H1, and between OP and all wellbeing outcomes through lower self-regulation, supporting H2. In relation to the RQ, there was limited support for time spent gaming as a mediator. It mediated the negative association between OP and GSWB, but none of the other indirect effects were significant. After controlling for the mediators, there remained direct effects of OP on psychological distress and of HP on GSWB and SWL, suggesting the operation of additional mechanisms. These total effect findings are consistent with past research, which found that HP for gaming was associated with more favourable physical and psychological outcomes; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> OP for screen based activities was associated with worse wellbeing outcomes; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and OP for gaming was associated with physical symptoms from extended gaming. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Our mediation analysis extends previous research and suggests that self-regulation may be a key mechanism that accounts for the positive association of HP for gaming and wellbeing and the negative association of OP for gaming and wellbeing.</p><p>The positive association between HP and self-regulation is consistent with the view that those with HP engage in activities in harmony with other responsibilities by setting goals and monitoring their behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> The negative association between OP and self-regulation is consistent with the idea that those with OP feel a "need" to engage in an activity and struggle to balance involvement with other responsibilities, surrendering to their impulses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Our findings support previous research on the benefits of HP over OP for self-regulation in an elearning context <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> and negative implications of OP for future self-regulatory efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> and activity addiction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Time spent gaming accounted for some of the association between OP and GSWB, indicating the potential costs of spending too much time on videogames. This could be due to opportunity costs, or the associated rumination and negative affect about neglected responsibilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> This indirect effect was small and did not extend to the other wellbeing outcomes.</p><p>Comparing the mediating roles of self-regulation and time spent gaming indicates that self-regulation provides a more comprehensive explanation for the relationship between passion and wellbeing. Similarly, previous research found that time spent gaming fails to significantly contribute to poor outcomes when other factors such as problematic gaming are taken into account. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Given the links between low observed self-regulation and problematic gaming, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> our findings provide further support for the importance of self-regulation as a determinant of wellbeing in videogamers. With the growing popularity of videogame streaming and competitive/professional play, a significant time investment may become increasingly normalised much as in traditional sports. We suggest being able to regulate when one plays may be more important for wellbeing than simply how much someone plays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study had limitations. First, the cross-sectional, correlational design limits our ability to draw causal inferences. Second, the accuracy of self-reported time spent gaming may not correspond with objectively-measured play-time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> Third, the sample consisted of predominantly men (73%). However, supplementary analyses (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S4</ref>) revealed that gender was not associated with any of our variables. Fourth, our analyses treat HP and OP independently; future research could usefully consider the quadripartite model of passion (allowing for situations in which a person exhibits high levels of OP and HP). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Finally, this study did not investigate different self-regulatory mechanisms (e.g., executive functioning and cognitive flexibility) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> which limits our explanation of which mechanisms might be most important in mediating the relationship between passion and wellbeing outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions and Implications</head><p>Our findings indicate that the negative relationship between OP and wellbeing is partly explained by lower levels of self-regulation. This suggests that targeting self-regulation directly could be effective in minimising the negative impacts of OP. For example, prompting players to take regular breaks (e.g., between levels) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> may create a design friction <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> that facilitates self-regulation. Alternatively, teaching younger videogame players basic selfregulation skills may prove effective.</p><p>Alternatively, developing higher levels of HP could help improve self-regulation and wellbeing. Passion has been shown to be susceptible to experimental manipulation through behavioural priming. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Finding ways to prime videogame players to think of times when they engaged with videogames harmoniously may induce more balanced gameplay behaviours.</p><p>Shedding light on underlying mechanisms could assist health professionals treating those suffering distress from unregulated videogaming behaviours by informing useful intervention methodologies.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Hypothesis 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>H1): HP will have a positive indirect effect on wellbeing outcomes (greater life satisfaction and wellbeing, and less psychological distress) via greater self-regulation. Hypothesis 2 (H2): OP will have a negative indirect effect on wellbeing outcomes (lower life satisfaction and wellbeing, and greater psychological distress) via lower self-regulation. Research Question (RQ): Does time spent gaming mediate the positive relationship between HP and wellbeing or the negative relationship between OP and wellbeing? Method Participants We recruited 182 participants (133 males, 45 females, 4 other), aged 17 to 69 (M=29.56, SD=8.59), a on videogaming related Facebook groups. Participants were 17 years or older, provided informed consent, and had an interest and active participation in videogames (they reported playing videogames 2-96 hours/week, M=23.85, SD=17.78). They could win one of three $40USD Amazon gift cards. Only completed questionnaires were used in the analyses.</figDesc></figure>
