<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Accurate and precise motion tracking of limbs and human subjects has technological importance in various healthcare applications. The use of Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology due its inherent properties is of recent interest for high accuracy localisation. This paper presents experimental investigations and analysis of indoor human body localisation and tracking of limb movements in 3D based on IR-UWB technology using compact and cost-effective body worn antennas. The body-centric wireless channel characterisation has been analysed in detail using parameters such as path loss magnitude, number of multipath components, RMS delay spread, signal amplitude and Kurtosis with the main focus to differentiate between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations. Fidelity of the received signal is also calculated for different activities and antenna positions to study the pulse preserving nature of the UWB antenna when it is placed on the human body. The results reported in this paper have high localisation accuracy with 90 % in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 cm using simple and cost-effective techniques which is comparable to the results obtained by the standard optical motion capture system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I</head><p>In this paper, indoor localisation of human body and tracking of limb movements is studied and analysed using wearable compact UWB antennas placed on different locations/joints of the body. UWB channel characterisation is studied in detail for various activities and the information obtained is used to minimise the error obtained in the range and localisation results, hence enabling accurate localisation and motion tracking of the wearable nodes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, very limited work is presented in the open literature in the field of limb movement localisation of human subjects using UWB technology.</p><p>The main objective of the work is to accurately determine and track a person's position and motion activity in an indoor environment using UWB channel characterisation information and time of arrival positioning techniques. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The localisation measurement set up and scenarios are presented in section II. Section III and IV briefly describes the localisation techniques applied and detailed channel characterisation for the various activities considered related to path loss analysis, multipath and NLOS scenarios, RMS delay spread, and Kurtosis for different antenna locations and body worn antenna orientation. The results and findings are discussed in section V. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section VI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MEASUREMENT SET-UP</head><p>Measurements were performed in the motion capture studio at the University of Kent, UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>. A human test subject 1.68 m tall and of average male build with a BMI of 21.3 was chosen for localising antennas on the body (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a)). The antenna locations chosen for limb movement analysis are the three joints, (shoulder, elbow and wrist) for the arm and (thigh, knee and ankle) for the leg. The arm movement was measured in nine different positions (0 ᵒ , 15 ᵒ , 30 ᵒ , 45 ᵒ , 60 ᵒ , 75 ᵒ , 90 ᵒ , 105 ᵒ , 120 ᵒ ) with intervals of 15 ᵒ forward and sideways. The leg was moved in six different positions (-30 ᵒ , -15 ᵒ , 0 ᵒ , +15 ᵒ , +30 ᵒ , +45 ᵒ ) in total (forward and backward) by 15 ᵒ intervals during the motion capture measurements. A digital protractor was used to measure the angles with respect to the shoulder/thigh joint which is considered as reference for the arm/leg movement. The localisation of the whole body is performed using 21 antenna positions placed on the (arms and legs) limbs and torso when the subject is standing at the centre of the localisation area. For upper limb forward movement, rotation axis is the x axis and motion is taking place in y-z plane for upper limb forward movement. For the upper limb movement sideways motion, rotation axis is the y-axis and motion is taking place in x-z plane. For the lower limb forward and backward movement rotation axis is the x-axis (motion taking place in y-z plane).</p><p>The four base stations (BS) with BS1 as reference zero coordinate (𝑥 0 , 𝑦 0 , 𝑧 0 ) are positioned near the vertices of the cuboid in an area of 1.8  1.8 m 2 to obtain high accuracy positioning in three dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Compact and low cost tapered slot co-planar waveguide fed UWB antennas (TSA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (b), <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>) were used as transmitters placed on the body and also as receivers in the base stations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. The TSA antenna has dimensions of 27 mm × 16 mm and offers a return loss below -10 dB with good radiation performance and relatively constant gain across the UWB band when off, or on a human body <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. The antennas were mounted on plastic frames with 3 reflective markers on each (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) to provide benchmark 3D position information through a VICON motion capture system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. The 8 cameras motion capture system which gives high accuracy results (better than 1 cm) was used to compare with the UWB localisation results and also to obtain reference coordinates of the base stations (receiver antennas).</p><p>Frequency domain measurements were performed in the 3 to 10 GHz band using a 4-port vector network analyzer (VNA R&amp;S ZVA-50) to capture S21 (channel transfer function) parameters between each transmitter antenna location on the body and the BS (receiver) antenna. For each BS and mobile station (MS) antenna position, the channel impulse response was obtained from the S21 collected from the VNA set to 6400 data samples, which is adequate to obtain the required channel information. For the case of limb movement tracking, measurements were taken for each of the wearable antenna location and the data is further combined together to get the overall limb localisation in three dimensions. The subject is made to hold to a particular position before proceeding to the next position with the VNA scanning time of around 800 msec to mimic the limb motion, hence obtaining a pseudo-dynamic motion for the limbs. For the case of the whole body, the antenna is positioned at different locations and readings are taken from the VNA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. BODY-WORN ANTENNA LOCALISATION TECHNIQUES</head><p>The time of arrival (TOA) positioning techniques are used due to the fine time resolution/high bandwidth of the UWB signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the proposed localisation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> for dealing with multipath and non-line of sight NLOS situations mainly developed for human body localisation and limb movement tracking. The algorithm is based on Channel Impulse Response (CIR) characterisation and time of arrival peak detection and data fusion techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>. Firstly, the CIR and the received signal are obtained between each MS and BS pair. In order to obtain the CIR, an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) is applied to the measured S21. The CIR is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ℎ(𝜏, 𝑡) = ∑ 𝑎 𝑘 (𝑡)𝛿( 𝐾 𝑘=1</formula><p>𝜏 -𝜏 𝑘 )𝑒 𝑗𝜃 𝑘 (𝑡)  (1) As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, first total line of sight (LOS) links are distinguished (with more than 95 % accuracy) from the non-line of sight (NLOS) or partial NLOS using the measured channel data obtained for each MS-BS link. The values obtained for each channel parameter is compared with the predefined parameter threshold values. The thresholds have been chosen by considering prior statistical information regarding the channel behaviour through initial measurement data. If the channel parameter value is lesser or equal to the predefined parameter values such as path loss, (PLLOS); RMS delay spread, (𝜏 𝑟𝑚𝑠(LOS) ); multipath components, (MPCLOS); and greater than the CIR parameter values: received signal amplitude, (ALOS) and Kurtosis, (𝜅LOS); LOS scenario is identified. The thresholds chosen have been optimised for the particular scenario and will vary with the change in environment. For example, for the current measurements, PL values in the range of 50 to 60 dB are considered as total LOS situation, RMS delay spread values lower than 5 nsec at -20 dB threshold of the power delay profile (PDP), and CIR having Kurtosis values higher than 45 is considered as LOS situation which are based on the maximum dimensions within the measurement area and understanding of the environment. Detailed analysis of each parameter with respect to the wearable antenna location and BS position is given in the next section.</p><p>Once, total LOS scenarios are distinguished, the remaining NLOS or partial NLOS/LOS links, are further classified with 95 % accuracy using two parameters: RMS delay spread and Kurtosis . The RMS Delay spread is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝜏 𝑟𝑚𝑠 = √ ∑ (𝜏 𝑘 -𝜏 𝑚 ) 2 . |ℎ(𝜏 𝑘 ; 𝑑)| 2 𝑘 ∑ |ℎ(𝜏 𝑘 ; 𝑑)| 2 𝑘 (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where 𝜏 𝑘 are the multipath delays relative to the first arriving multipath component and d is the separating distance between the Tx and Rx. This parameter helps to distinguish between LOS and NLOS links as the RMS values for NLOS scenarios are much larger. Due the dense multipath components, NLOS CIR has a wider distribution in comparison to LOS, which has a clearly distinguishable maximum peak with multipath components of very low magnitude. The Kurtosis is a statistical parameter that indicates the fourth order moment of the received signal amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. Kurtosis 𝜅 is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝜅(𝑥) = 1 𝜎 4 ∑ (𝑥 𝑖 -𝑥̅ ) 4 𝑖 𝑁 (3)</formula><p>where 𝜎 is the standard deviation of the variable 𝑥 and 𝑥 ̅ is the mean value of 𝑥. 𝑁 is the number of samples of 𝑥. The Kurtosis index 𝜅 is supposed to be much lower for NLOS scenarios in comparison to LOS.</p><p>RMS delay spread values higher than predefined 𝜏 𝑟𝑚𝑠(NLOS) (e.g. 8 nsec) and Kurtosis values lower than 𝜅NLOS (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25)</ref> are considered as NLOS situations. Intermediate values between (5-8 nsec 𝜏 𝑟𝑚𝑠(𝑃𝑁𝐿𝑂𝑆) and 25-45 𝜅PNLOS) help to further classify NLOS and partial NLOS/LOS situations. The maximum peak detection algorithm provides an estimate of the time of arrival of the UWB signal between Tx and Rx for line-of-sight (LOS) situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>. The strongest peak of the CIR is considered an estimate of TOA and gives accurate results for scenarios with low multipath components and interference levels. In NLOS situations, the direct signal between Tx and Rx is significantly attenuated due to presence of obstructions. The strongest path in such scenarios does not give the direct path estimate, leading to large ranging errors. In addition, the human body acts like an obstacle, hence causing NLOS and high multipath situations. In order to mitigate NLOS errors and accurately estimate the range, threshold based algorithms are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. Threshold-based search algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>  information <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>. For total NLOS scenarios, threshold based leading edge detection algorithms can be used with selected threshold generally around 10-20 % of the peak CIR amplitude depending on the magnitude of the CIR peaks prior to the peak value. Search back technique can be used to estimate the range for partial LOS/NLOS scenarios that fall under the intermediate channel classification parameter values. The search back method first finds the strongest path (SP), and then looks for a peak arriving before the strongest path, which has greater power than a detection threshold level. A few iterations are required in order to obtain the peak value nearest the expected one or within the localisation range based on the selected threshold level.</p><p>After acquiring accurate range estimates for each MS-BS link, TOA-based mobile location algorithm is applied based on trilateration and least square solution in order to determine the unknown position of the antenna <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>. The distances 𝑟 1 , 𝑟 2 , 𝑟 3 and 𝑟 4 are used to estimate the position of the target (𝑥 𝑠 , 𝑦 𝑠 , 𝑧 𝑠 ) by solving the following set of equations using least square solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑟 𝑖 2 = (𝑥 𝑖 -𝑥 𝑠 ) 2 + (𝑦 𝑖 -𝑦 𝑠 ) 2 + (𝑧 𝑖 -𝑧 𝑠 ) 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where i =1,2,3,4 and ri represents the range measurements obtained from the distance between the MS and BS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Path loss analysis</head><p>One of the most important aspects of statistical characterisation is describing the fluctuations of the received signal with respect to the distance. The path loss model signifies the local average received signal power (Pr) relative to the transmit power (Pt) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref> and is directly calculated from the measured data by averaging the measured frequency transfers at each frequency point <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Limbs Motion Tracking: The path loss magnitude for various positions of the arm is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> with respect to BS1 and BS4 during sideways arm movement activity. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref> clearly shows the increase in path loss for the body worn antennas placed on the wrist as the arm moves from 0 ᵒ to 120 ᵒ . The variation in PL is maximum for the wrist (e.g. BS1: 55 to 70 dB) and ankle (e.g. BS2: 60 to 70 dB) as larger displacement is taking place during limb motion in comparison to the elbow/shoulder and knee/thigh location respectively. Over all for BS1 more links are in LOS situation having lower path loss magnitude and for BS4 NLOS situation is observed with higher magnitude of path loss leading to more attenuation. For BS2 and BS3, the magnitude of PL is high (e.g. for BS3: 70 dB) for 0 ᵒ position and decreases as the arm moves to 120 ᵒ position (e.g. for BS3: 55 dB) as the distance will reduce between the BS and MS. Similarly the magnitude of PL is more for BS2 right leg motion for -30 ᵒ in comparison to + 45 °and vice versa for BS3-MS link.</p><p>Human Body Localisation: The path loss magnitude for BS1-BS4 for various antenna nodes location on the body is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. From the graph, it can be observed that BS1,3 and BS1,2 have lower magnitude of PL as LOS links are formed for right limbs (S1-S6) and torso region (S16-S18) respectively. The overall variation in PL values obtained with respect to BS1 and BS4 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. It is observed that, for BS1, the right limbs and torso have a PL magnitude ranging from 50 to 55 dB  whereas the left limbs have PL from 63 to 70 dB. The PL magnitude for the left shoulder is highest for BS1 case as it is at maximum distance from BS1 showing distance dependency. For BS4 higher magnitude of path loss is obtained for right limbs and torso in comparison to the left limbs. Hence more attenuation of the received signal is observed for the NLOS situations. From the measured data it can be concluded that path loss magnitude generally in the range of 50-60 depicts LOS situations and for 60 to 70 NLOS situations occur. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Amplitude of Received Signal</head><p>Different levels of magnitude are observed for each wearable antenna position that is dependent on the distance between the MS-BS link, the channel type i.e. (LOS or NLOS) and orientation of the antenna with respect to each other. Limbs Motion Tracking: BS1 is generally in LOS situation for nearly all antenna positions with highest signal amplitude in comparison to BS4, which is in NLOS situation due to shadowing by the human subject. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> demonstrates the variation in normalised amplitude value for the forward wrist motion. For BS1, the signal magnitude decreases from 30 to 120 degrees as MS-BS distance is increasing. It can be observed that the magnitude is generally lower for 0 to 60 ᵒ orientations and then rises from 75 to 120 degrees for BS2 and BS3. There is a drastic reduction in magnitude for BS4 as it is in NLOS situation with maximum percentage decrease as high as 90 % of the magnitude level of BS1. Substantial amplitude variations are observed for antennas placed on the wrist/ankle due to higher displacements of positions caused by the arm/leg movements. Human Body Localisation: The amplitude of the received signal is higher for BS2-left elbow and shoulder link as there is least distance between the BS and the antennas and is also in direct LOS situation. Lowest values of amplitude are observed for BS4 when the antenna is placed on the torso region in comparison to BS1. Lower values are observed for BS3,4 as they are generally in NLOS situation leading to distortion of the signal. The human subject is facing BS1 and BS2, hence high levels of signal amplitude is observed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the variation in signal amplitude for wearable antenna locations with respect to different base stations. For wrist motion, BS1,2,3 are generally in LOS situation showing linear dependence with distance and BS4 in NLOS which can be clearly depicted in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 (a)</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 (b)</ref>, two large clusters can be observed of high and low amplitude at approximately 0.3 normalised signal amplitude for whole body localisation. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> (a) only one wearable antenna location is considered positioning itself at different angles, hence the trend is more distinct in comparison to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 (b)</ref> where different wearable antenna locations are considered. This phenomenon is very complex, as there are several parameters that effect the received signal amplitude, it is more justified to say for LOS situations that the signal strength decreases linearly with MS-BS distance. As for NLOS the type of obstacle (physical dimensions, material) causing obstruction will make a huge difference in signal amplitude leading to non-linear relationship. For the wrist movement, the correlation coefficient considering a linear relationship is 0.8, 0.98, 0.85, 0.5 for BS1, BS2, BS3 and BS4 respectively. For whole body localisation, the correlation coefficient considering a linear relationship is 0.88, 0.85, 0.60, 0.75 for BS1, BS2, BS3 and BS4 respectively. The received signal amplitude does not seem to decrease purely as a function of MS-BS distance but also depends on the base station location. For instance as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8 (b</ref>) the exponential decay with respect to distance seems more evident for BS3 and BS4 (more NLOS links) than for BS1 and BS2 (more LOS links) which shows more linear trend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Number of Multipath Components</head><p>Number of multipath components (MPC) are computed for different thresholds levels (-10, -20 and -30 dB) of the normalised power delay profile (PDP). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9 (a)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(b)</ref> presents LOS and NLOS scenario of the PDP respectively. Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. and II. presents the results for various BSs and wearable antenna links. Total NLOS links are highlighted in red. Limbs Motion Tracking: As seen in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>., for sideways limb motion BS1 and BS3 mostly form LOS links and have similar number of multipath components. For BS2, there is an increase in number of MPCs in comparison to BS1 and BS3. For the forward limb motion of the right arm less MPC's are present for BS1,2 in comparison to BS3. As seen from Table <ref type="table">I</ref>., the leg motion results also have a similar trend with BS1,3. BS2 is in NLOS situation and show higher range of MPC's in comparison to the values for the arm movement. For BS4 maximum MPC's are observed for all the cases for the right limb movement due to occurrence of NLOS links. For LOS situations the percentage increase in MPCs is generally more in comparison to NLOS situations with decrease in PDP threshold. Highest number of MPCs are observed for the shoulder and thigh region as they are totally obstructed due to the torso of the body. Human Body Localisation: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> shows an example of the MPC's for different locations on the body for -20 dB threshold level. As observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> and also in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>., for the torso region, BS1 and BS2 have lower MPCs as LOS links are formed. For BS3 and BS4 NLOS links are formed as the body is obstructing the path leading to more multipath components. As seen in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, maximum multipath are for the BS4 link for all the three thresholds considered. As observed from Table <ref type="table">II</ref>., for left/right limbs BS2,4/BS1,3 links are in LOS scenario with lower range of MPCs in comparison to BS1,3/BS2,4 links which are generally in NLOS situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE II. WHOLE BODY: NUMBER OF MULTIPATH COMPONENTS</head><p>Overall it is observed that -20/-30 dB threshold can easily distinguish between LOS and NLOS links. For -20 dB threshold of the power delay profile MPC below 10 can be considered as LOS link and MPC's above 30 indicate a NLOS link.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. RMS Delay Spread</head><p>Limbs Localisation: Low RMS delay spread values in the range of 0.5 to 3 nsec are obtained for BS1 when the arm is moved sideways for 0 ᵒ to 75 ᵒ orientation and the values increase up to 9 nsec for 90 ᵒ to 120 ᵒ . For BS2, higher RMS delay spread values are obtained for arm motion (0 ᵒ to 45 ᵒ ) and leg motion as the body-worn antenna is not in direct line of sight. Lower values of RMS delay spread are obtained for arm positions 90 ᵒ to 120 ᵒ as the antenna is clearly in direct line of sight with BS2,3 and the distance between the antenna and BS also reduces as the arm moves in the upward direction. Highest RMS delay values are obtained for the antennas placed on the leg with values reaching up to 20 nsec clearly demonstrating dense multipath and NLOS links between the antenna and BS4. Human Body Localisation: For the whole body localisation measurements, higher RMS delay spread (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>) is observed for the torso as both BS3 and BS4 (12 to 17 nsec) at the back are in NLOS situation causing interference and high multipath scenarios. Generally lower RMS spread values in the range of 0.1 to 5 nsec (75 % of the total values) are observed as BS1,2 are in direct line of sight situation with the wearable antennas. Considering BS3 for the right limbs, the trend observed is the increase in RMS delay spread from the antenna placed on the shoulder to the antenna placed on the wrist as there is increase in the distance between the wearable node and BS. Hence, it can be seen that RMS delay spread is a good indicator to characterise the channel and classify the MS-BS links.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Kurtosis Limbs Localisation:</head><p>The Kurtosis values are in the range of 45 to 60 for BS1,2,3 showing higher probability of direct path and low multipath situation between the antenna and BS. For BS4, most of the antennas locations are in NLOS with the receiver, hence low Kurtosis index values (8-20) are observed. Highest values are observed for antennas placed on the wrist with respect to BS1 during sideways movements. Lowest Kurtosis values are observed for the legs especially for the thigh region, as maximum shadowing from the human body occurs for this region as BS4 is placed behind the subject.  with 0.8 to 1.3 cm standard deviation and illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">14</ref>. Various positions taken by the arms and legs are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref> respectively along with the tracking results obtained by the approach proposed. The average displacement error between subsequent limb motion captures is around 1 to 2 cm with standard deviation in the range of 0.9 to 1.4 cm. The detailed results obtained for the 3D displacement error (x, y and z) of the human body during limb movement activities is listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>. The results obtained show high accuracy in capturing the position of the limbs showing the suitability of the UWB technology for localisation and tracking. Results for the localisation of the body worn antennas for the whole body localisation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref>. The detailed results obtained for different locations of the human body are listed in Table V with a standard deviation of 0.7 to 1.3 cm. 3D localisation error obtained is in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 cm for overall positioning of the body worn antennas. Localisation accuracy results are best for the antennas placed on the arm in comparison to antennas placed on the legs as units placed on the legs incur more NLOS situations due to greater diameter than that of the arms. The average localisation accuracy for directional azimuth and elevation angles with respect to BS1 is approximately 1 to 2 degrees.     Localisation accuracy depending on number of BS has also been explored leading to the conclusion that 8 BS can give slightly better accuracy in comparison to 4 BS but can increase the installation complexity, cost and time. Three BS will be able to provide 2D localisation and if used in L shape configuration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> can obtain 3D localisation with some deterioration in the accuracy (1 to 2 cm). Two BSs will not be able to give 2D or 3D localisation as it will be a limitation for the trilateration algorithm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Pulse Fidelity</head><p>The fidelity calculated shows good performance for different limb motion activities undertaken and overall body localisation by the TSA antennas, in preserving the shape of the received pulse at various angular orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42]</ref>. Fidelity factor is calculated between the transmitted and received signal using a sine modulated UWB pulse as source pulse.  For the arm motion (sideways and forward) very high fidelity results are observed for BS1,2,3 and for BS4 which generally incurs NLOS situations, there is more variation in fidelity with few values in the 0.70-0.80 range. In case of the right leg motion, for BS1,2,3; 90 % of the values are in the range of 0.95 and for the BS4 (NLOS scenario) 80 % of the values have fidelity factor greater than 0.85. Regarding the fidelity analysis of the whole body localisation, BS1,2 are having 80% fidelity values above 0.95 as the BSs form maximum LOS links with the werable antennas. For BS3,4 50 % values are above 0.95 as the occurrence of NLOS link is much higher. The complete fidelity analysis concludes that most of the measurements give a fidelity above 0.9. The high fidelity values makes TSA antenna as a potential candidate for body-centric wireless networks for localisation and tracking purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>Accurate 3D limb movement tracking and whole body localisation has been obtained using compact, and costeffective body-worn antennas in an indoor environment. High accuracy is obtained in the centimetre range (1 to 3 cm) suitable for human motion tracking, patient monitoring, physical rehabilitation and motion-capture applications. Average localisation accuracy as small as 0.5-2.5 cm has been achieved for 90 % of the scenarios, which is comparable to common commercial optical systems. Simple and robust localisation scheme has been proposed for motion tracking and localisation applications taking into account NLOS mitigation and identification techniques. In-depth analysis of various wireless channel parameters has been carried out such as path loss magnitude, number of multipath components, received signal amplitude, RMS delay spread and Kurtosis. The work carried out gives an insight into propagation characteristics when antennas are placed on various body locations and the factors affecting the accuracy achieved while localising/tracking the antennas worn by the user in a potential wireless body sensor networks setup within body/personal area networks. The use of Kalman filter to improve tracking performance will be considered as possible future work for the body centric tracking and localisation research. Further experimental investigations and analysis will be undertaken by using a compact UWB transceiver chipset for body worn sensor localisation considering more dynamic movements and application specific environments to be deployed in real life healthcare applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

MS-BS distance and Peak Signal Amplitude: Knowledge of the magnitude of the received signals, gives an indication of which antennas are in LOS or NLOS situation and also an idea of the distance between Tx and Rx. Considering the highest signal amplitude among the measured data as reference, the signals are normalized with respect to the reference signal. For values above 30 % of the highest signal amplitude LOS situations are present and for below 20-30 % of the highest signal amplitude more chances of NLOS situations are present.For wrist motion, BS1,2,3 are generally in LOS situation showing linear dependence with distance and BS4 in NLOS which can be clearly depicted in the Fig.8 (a). In Fig.8 (b), two large clusters can be observed of high and low amplitude at approximately 0.3 normalised signal amplitude for whole body localisation. In Fig.8(a) only one wearable antenna location is considered positioning itself at different angles, hence the trend is more distinct in comparison to Fig.8 (b)where different wearable antenna locations are considered. This phenomenon is very complex, as there are several parameters that effect the received signal amplitude, it is more justified to say for LOS</figDesc><graphic coords="5,313.20,336.73,251.99,127.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Human Body Localisation: Kurtosis index values in the range of 5 to 25 are observed for the antennas placed on the torso for BS3,4 as observed in Fig. 12. The highest Kurtosis values are observed for the base stations facing the limbs, e.g. for antennas placed on the right/left limb BS1,3/BS2,4 show higher Kurtosis index values. The thigh region shows low index values for BS4 and BS3 as these are mainly directed towards the back of the human subject. Very high Kurtosis index values (45 to 65) are observed for BS1 and BS3 for antennas (S1-S6) and for antennas (S7-S12) BS2 and BS4 show high Kurtosis values, the magnitude of the values vary depending upon the location of the antenna with respect to the BS. Results and analysis show that Kurtosis parameter is quite suitable to classify the radio channel and identify partial NLOS scenarios.V. LOCALISATION ACCURACY ANALYSISA. Localisation Results for Various ActivitiesHigh centimetre range accuracy is obtained using time of arrival UWB localisation techniques. The localisation accuracy depends on various factors such as base station configuration, propagation environment, signal to noise ratio, presence of objects and obstacles specifically dynamic ones such as the human body, location of the antennas with respect to the base station, accuracy of the localisation algorithm and sampling precision of the received impulse responses of IR UWB system.The captured and analysed location estimation results are compared with the results obtained by a standard optical motion capture system, which is used as a reference.
