<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Identifying the impact path of climate and soil factors on soil δ 15 N is very crucial for better understanding the N turnover in soils and the integrated information about ecosystem N cycling. Many studies have showed that climate and soil variables influence the change of soil δ 15 N. However, most of the existing studies focused on the overall impact of factor on soil δ 15 N, without distinguishing between the direct and indirect effect. Although scholars have studied the relationships among temperature, precipitation, soil N, soil pH, and soil δ 15 N rather than estimating all the causal relationships simultaneously. To answer the above-mentioned questions, a regional-scale soil collection was conducted across a temperate grassland in northern China. Meanwhile, a PLS-PATH analysis was utilized to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of various factors on soil δ 15 N and to explore the causal relationships among variables. The results showed that along the transect, mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) directly and significantly reduced soil δ 15 N, and indirectly affected soil δ 15 N through their effects on soil pH, soil clay, soil N and soil C/N. Soil C/N ratio has a significant direct impact on soil δ 15 N with a negative correlation. Soil clay, soil N content, and soil pH have a total positive effect on soil δ 15 N, but the total positive impact of soil pH is very weak because it has a negative indirect impact on soil δ 15 N by affecting soil clay, soil N and soil C/N ratio. The total influence is, in order, MAP &gt; MAT &gt; soil C/N &gt; soil clay &gt; soil N &gt; soil pH (in absolute value). The above results will provide valuable information about ecosystem N cycle in temperate grassland of northern China.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>With the rapid development of isotope measurement technology, the analysis of soil nitrogen isotope (expressed as soil δ 15 N) has become an effective tool to explore the nitrogen (N) dynamics and soil development. Soil δ 15 N can potentially provide valuable information about N cycle in soil ecosystem, because it is mainly based on overall isotopic fractionation during microbial degradation and transformation or the preferential decomposition of the substrates depleted in 15 N <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In general, compared with the substrate with lower decomposition, the older soil with higher microbial treatment is enriched in 15 N <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Since 14 N is preferentially lost from the ecosystem, resulting in the enrichment of soil 15 N in the ecosystem with high N cycle openness, soil δ 15 N can be used as a valid indicator of ecosystem N cycle openness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Generally, the N cycle in arid areas is more open than that in humid areas because soil δ 15 N value is often negatively correlated with precipitation on different spatial scales. Additionally, without considering the inputs of anthropogenic N and the influence of plant residues, the variation in soil δ 15 N in natural ecosystems is largely controlled by climate and soil factors during microbial decomposition and nitrogen turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Therefore, the signature of 15 N in soil integrates a variety of information about the ecosystem N cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Unfortunately, the influential mechanism that drive the relationships between climatic and edaphic variables and soil δ 15 N values in terrestrial ecosystem has not yet been fully understood, which affects the interpretation of global or regional patterns of N-cycling.</p><p>To understand the driving factors controlling soil δ 15 N along natural environment gradients, numerous scholars have conducted extensive research at regional and global scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Most results have revealed that climatic and edaphic factors, including mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), soil pH, soil C and N content and soil texture, can affect soil δ 15 N values by affecting N transformation and release <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. For instance, on a global scale, climatic variables can control soil δ 15 N, with values increasing in response to decreasing MAP and increasing MAT, which will enhance the process leading to N loss of but discriminate against 15 N loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Recent studies indicated that climate factors control about 50% of the variation of soil δ 15 N across temperate grassland in northern China. It was found that soil δ 15 N decreased with the increase of MAP and MAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Further studies exhibited that drought can nonlinearly shape soil δ 15 N in arid and semiarid grassland <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Therefore, on a certain spatial scale, soil δ 15 N values across climate gradient can mirror the relationship between N losses and turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Besides climatic factors, soil factors have been demonstrated to affect the pattern of soil δ 15 N <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. For example, soil δ 15 N values are negatively related to soil organic carbon and positively associated with soil N contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Soil pH may affect soil N availability via its influences on microbial nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation in terrestrial ecosystems, thus controlling the δ 15 N values in soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Similarly, soil texture can also impact soil N turnover by its indirect impact on other soil physicochemical properties (e.g., soil water, oxygen concentration and soil N content), thus driving changes in isotope values Similarly, soil texture can also indirectly affect other soil physical and chemical properties (such as soil moisture, oxygen concentration and soil nitrogen content) to affect soil nitrogen turnover, so as to promote the change of isotopic value <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. On the whole, these studies regarding the pattern of δ 15 N values have greatly increased our understanding of ecosystem N-cycling.</p><p>Nonetheless, we still know little about how co-varying climatic and edaphic variables independently affect soil δ 15 N values along environmental gradients due to the following two reasons. First, because nitrogen cycle and the factors affecting soil δ 15 N values are very complex, the climate and soil variables determining the patterns of soil δ 15 N probably involve direct and indirect influence paths on a regional scale. For instance, low δ 15 N values usually occur in ecosystems with high precipitation and high carbon contents, but with low temperature and low N concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. In other words, all the influences among the climate and soil factors will form a network, and a path analysis can disclose how these factors interact to affect soil δ 15 N values. However, most of the existing studies focused on the overall impact of single factor on soil nitrogen isotope without distinguishing the direct and indirect effects or failed to estimate the causal relationships among the variables. Second, most of the existing studies primarily used bivariate linear regression or multiple regressions to determine how climatic and edaphic variables influence soil δ 15 N values at different spatial scales. Such methods cannot evaluate the interplay of environmental factors on soil δ 15 N, and also fail to determine the extent to which variables explain the δ 15 N values owing to the covariation of environmental factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. This may also be one of the reasons for the relatively low reliability of explaining ecosystem nitrogen cycle through δ 15 N signal in the existing studies.</p><p>Temperate grasslands in northern China account for approximately 12% of global grassland area and provide crucial ecosystem services. In particular, grassland soils have great potential to regulate biogeochemical cycle under the background of global climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the impact mechanisms of environmental factors on soil δ 15 N along temperate grassland for elucidating soil N-cycling on regional scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. In this study, we use a path analysis based on partial least squares regression (PLS-PATH) to assess the direct and indirect impact of environment factors on soil δ 15 N values in the temperate grasslands in northern China and causal relationships among the variables. The research strives to answer the following three questions. First, what are the direct and latent indirect influences of the climate and soil variables on variance of soil δ 15 N value? Second, how do the causal path relationships between driving factors? Third, what is the order of all variables' influences on soil δ 15 N with respect to their influential intensity?</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study transect and field sampling</head><p>The study was conducted along a 1200 km transect across the temperate grasslands of northern China. The east-west transect covered longitudes from 112˚53 0 to 121˚98 0 E and latitudes from 42˚12 0 to 43˚98 0 N, with elevations between 158 and 1406m. The transect was characterized predominantly by a temperate continental monsoon climate, with a MAT gradient from 1.71 to 7.10#x00B0;CC and a MAP gradient from 154 to 446 mm, respectively.</p><p>Along the transect from east to west, the main vegetation types are temperate meadow grassland, typical temperate grassland and temperate desert <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The soils related to these three grassland types were chernozem, chestnut soil and aeolian sand soil, respectively, which were the same substrate age <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The soil pH values of the 0~20cm layer varied between 6.2 and 8.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. With such climatic and edaphic gradients, this transect provides an ideal place for examining the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on soil δ 15 N and the interrelationships between driving factors.</p><p>Our studies were approved by the Forestry and Grassland Bureau of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and by the Institute of Grassland Research of CAAS. During the period from July to August in 2017, a total of 40 undisturbed sites were chosen to collect soil samples along this transect. At every site, five 1 m ×1 m plots within an area of 10 m × 10 m were established for soil sampling. Within each plot, five soil cores with a diameter of 2.5 cm were randomly taken at 0 to 20cm depth. A total of 25 soil cores were obtained from each site and fully mixed as a composite sample. After removing fine roots and other coarse materials in soils, each composite sample was sieved by a 2.0 mm screen and then divided into two parts: one was stored in an incubator (at 4˚C) for determining the physicochemical properties of the soil (e.g., soil C and N contents, soil clay and pH), and the other was airdried and ground to uniformity with a ball mill (NM200, Retsch, Hann, Germany) for measurement of soil δ 15 N value. Additionally, the altitude, longitude and latitude of sampling sites were determined by Global Positioning System. The MAT and MAP of each sampling site were obtained from Data Center for Resource and Environment Science in China (<ref type="url" target="https://www.resdc.cn/Default.aspx">https://www.resdc.cn/Default.aspx</ref>), China Meteorological Data Service Centre (<ref type="url" target="http://data.cma.cn">http:// data.cma.cn</ref>), and from local weather stations. Further detailed information about the sampling sites was summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The general information of the sampled sites in the study area. MAT and MAP in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are the abbreviations of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, respectively (the same below).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample sites</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements of soil δ 15 N and soil properties</head><p>The δ 15 N value of soil sample was measured by a Finnigan Delta Plus XP (Thermo scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) coupled with an automatic elemental analyzer (Flash EA1112, Thermo Finnigan). The isotope result of soil N was calculated with the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">δ 15 N (‰) = (R sample /R standard -1)×1000</formula><p>, where R sample and R standard represent the ratios of 15 N/ 14 N in the sample standard. The standard of δ 15 N is atmospheric N 2 . The standard deviation of above isotopic repeated measurements was ±0.15‰.</p><p>Soil pH value was determined using a pH meter (HI-9125, Hanna Instruments Inc, Woonsocket, RI) with a dry soil-water ratio of 1:2.5. Total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) concentrations of soil samples were measured by a TOC/TN analyzer (Multi N/C 3100CLD, Jena, Germany). Soil C/N ratio was expressed by the quotient of TOC and TN content. Another subsample was separated into clay (&lt;2μm) by ultrasonic energy method. The result of particle size analysis was expressed as a percentage of the weight of oven-dried soil. The values of all the above observed variables, which includes the MAP and MAT of sampling locations, soil N, soil pH, soil C: N, soil clay and soil δ 15 N, were listed in S1 Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLS-PATH analyses</head><p>Before PLS-PATH analyses, all data were tested for normality and standardized to eliminate the influence caused by different variable units. The potential relationship between various variables (MAP, MAT, soil N, soil C/N, pH and soil clay) and soil δ 15 N was analyzed by bivariate correlations and linear regressions. The normality test results of the variables showed that the absolute values of critical ratios were greater than 0.05, indicating that the kurtosis (or skewness) coefficients of all variables were significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). This also meant that it was suitable for using path analysis in our study. Moreover, the correlation analysis results showed that there was obvious collinearity among some independent variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), which means that the indirect impact is also the driver of the soil δ 15 N in ecosystem. To eliminate collinearity issues among the variables and address how climatic and edaphic variables interactively affect soil δ 15 N, a PLS-PATH analysis was used to explore the direct and indirect influence of each environmental variable on soil δ 15 N values and prospective causal relationships among variables at the regional scale. PLS-PATH analysis is considered as a special form of PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Because of the lax requirements of data distribution and small sample size, it has become one of the most popular approaches for estimating complex path relationships. In the PLS-PATH analyses, the direct influence of variables on soil δ 15 N as well as indirect and total impacts of variables on soil δ 15 N can be expressed by direct, indirect and total path coefficients, respectively. At the same time, the causal relationship between variables can be shown by vectors in the path diagram. On the whole, PLS-PATH analysis is more comprehensive and accurate compared with simple regression analysis. The basic idea of PLS-PATH analysis is as follows: first of all, assume that the explained variable y has several explanatory variables x i (i = 1, 2, 3,. . ., n), and the relationship between each explanatory variable x i and y is linear. Second, PLS regression is used to establish the optimal regression equation between explanatory variables and explained variable. Thereupon, the path coefficient P x i ;y of the explanatory variable x i to the explained variable y in the PLS regression equation can be decomposed into direct path coefficient (denoted as DP x i ;y ) and indirect path coefficient (namely, the action coefficient of explanatory variable x i to explained variable y through explanatory variable x j , denoted as IP x i ;x j ;y ). The calculation formulas of direct action coefficient, indirect action coefficient and total action coefficient of independent variable on dependent variable are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P x i ;y ¼ r x i ;y � ðS x i =S y Þ<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">IP x i ;x j ;y ¼ r x i ;x j � r x i ;y � ðS x i =S y Þ<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">P x i ;y ¼ DP x i ;y þ P nÀ 1 j6 ¼i IP x i ;x j ;y<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>Where r x i ;y represent the partial correlation coefficient of x i and y; r x i ;x j denotes the simple correlation coefficient of x i and x j ; S xi and S y are the standard deviations of the explanatory variable x i and the explained variable y, respectively. Basic statistics of the data was conducted with SPSS 18.0, and path coefficients were estimated via the maximum likelihood method using SmartPLS V3.2.8 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path coefficients and decomposition results of climatic and edaphic variables on soil δ 15 N values</head><p>A path diagram that displays the variable relationships was established based on the PLS-PATH analysis.  decomposition results of the total action coefficient of each variable (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), MAP, MAT and soil C/N ratio had a total negative effect (direct and indirect) on soil δ 15 N values, and the standardized total effect of these variables on soil δ 15 N values was -0.677, -0.229 and -0.209  correspondingly; while soil N, soil clay and soil pH had positive total effects on soil δ 15 N values, and the standardized total effect of them was 0.114, 0.198 and 0.072, respectively. This showed that soil δ 15 N displayed a large increase with soil N, soil clay and pH across temperate grassland in northern China. Additionally, their total effects (expressed in absolute value, the same below) were, in proper order, MAP &gt; MAT &gt; soil C/N &gt; soil clay &gt; soil N &gt; soil pH. Meanwhile, the MAP, MAT and soil C/N had a direct negative influence on soil δ 15 N, and their standardized direct effects were -0.337, -0.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). The soil C/N ratio had no indirect effect on soil δ 15 N (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). The increase of soil C/N directly leaded to significant decrease of soil δ 15 N. When the soil C/N ratio increased by soil N had a positive direct impact on soil δ 15 N with influence strength of 0.091. However, the indirect impact of soil N on soil δ 15 N through soil C/N was quit small (0.023).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence mechanism of climatic and edaphic variables on soil δ 15 N values</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussions</head><p>Many scholars have studied how climate and soil factors influence on soil δ 15 N. The study used the PLS-PATH method to estimate the direct and indirect impact of various factors on soil δ 15 N and their causal relationships. Some of our results confirmed previous conclusions. On the whole, climatic factors had stronger effects than those of edaphic factors on soil δ 15 N values (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). The total impact strength of climate factors on soil δ 15 N was 0.90 (in absolute value); whereas the total impact intensity of edaphic factors on soil δ 15 N was 0.574 (in absolute value). This indicated that the soil δ 15 N value was more susceptible to changes of climatic factors than to those of edaphic factors. The following was an analysis of how various climatic and edaphic factors control soil δ 15 N.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Climatic controls on soil δ 15 N</head><p>Many scholars generally think that the change of soil δ 15 N is mainly determined by the isotopic values of input N and output N. Since the δ 15 N of input N is close to zero and usually lower than that of soil, the N output process may leave more 15 N in soil compared with the input <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. In our study, soil δ 15 N decreased significantly with increasing MAP along the transect (Fig 3A ), which is in accordance with the results obtained by other scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. The strong negative effect of MAP on soil δ 15 N in temperate grassland of northern China may be caused by the following two reasons. First, the openness of nitrogen cycle is determined by precipitation and decreases with precipitation. Thus, the more open N-cycle in arid environment compared to that in wet environment would likely lead to disproportionate loss of inorganic N through NH 3 volatilization (the N loss caused by leaching and denitrification is generally very small due to the low soil moisture content in our study area) during nitrification process, which causes a greater 15 N-enrichment in soil organic N and an increase of soil δ 15 N <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Second, precipitation is one of the most critical determinants of N cycle in arid and semi-arid areas. The N utilizing efficiency by plants may increase with MAP increasing when soil water content is unsaturated and remains aerobic, which results in more 15 N-depleted in the soil pool. Meanwhile, as precipitation increase, the incomplete decomposition of plant residue may bring more enriched 14 N organic matter to soil N pool, thus causing soil δ 15 N values to be lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Besides that, MAP can indirectly affect soil δ 15 N through its effects on other factors (Fig 2A ). For example, when the MAP increases by 1 standard deviation, the soil N will decrease by 0.598 standard deviation, which leads to a reduction of soil δ 15 N owing to the positive correlation between soil δ 15 N and soil N (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref>). For another instance, precipitation usually affects the leaching of alkaline cations in soil, so as to affect the soil pH value. Since soil pH value is negatively correlated with MAP across the transect (Fig 3C ), the relatively high soil pH in the dry sites is easy to accelerate the volatilization of NH 3 , resulting in positive soil δ 15 N values <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. But, remarkably, the indirect effect strength of MAP on soil δ 15 N values is different because of different relative importance of driving factors.</p><p>Most studies show that soil δ 15 N values usually increase with MAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. However, the relation between soil δ 15 N and MAT in temperate grassland of northern China was clearly inconsistent with those obtained from other regions and globally. We argued that the negative soil δ 15 N-MAT relationship (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3D</ref>) may be owing to these two reasons. First, such a pattern was possibly related to the narrow temperature range (MAT: 1.71 to 7.10#x00B0;CC) along the study transect. As is known to all, the shift in N cycling from organic or ammonium-dominated status to nitrate-dominated status is usually considered as the potential control of soil δ 15 N <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Accordingly, compared to the wide temperature range obtained from global and other regional scales, the narrow range of MAT across our study area was insufficient to cause a large impact on the N-cycling process and, thus, on affecting soil δ 15 N values <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Second, the negative correlation of soil δ 15 N with temperature may also be due to simultaneous effect of rain and heat. In our study area, approximately 60% to 80% of annual precipitation occurs in summer season <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Although increasing temperature can accelerate the rates of soil organic N mineralization and NH 3 volatilization, resulting in accelerated 14 N loss and positive soil δ 15 N values, due to the synchronization of rain and heat at the eastern part of the transect (Fig 3E <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3F</ref>), increasing precipitation can contribute more negative soil δ 15 N values in this region, thus masking the positive correlation between soil δ 15 N and MAT to a certain extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This result was supported by the indirect effect of MAP on soil δ 15 N through MAT (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2A</ref>). To examine whether there is a positive relation between soil δ 15 N and MAT, we extracted 19 sites data at the western part of the transect, and found that soil δ 15 N of these sites increased significantly with the increase of MAT (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3G</ref>). Furthermore, PATH analyses showed that MAT indirectly influenced soil δ 15 N through edaphic factors (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2B</ref>). For instance, the standardized indirect influence of MAT on soil δ 15 N through soil N is -0.039, demonstrating that temperature also has an indirect negative effect on soil δ 15 N. This result confirms the view that the soil N retention rate is lower in high-temperature environments than in low-temperature regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and also reflects the apparent temperature-dependence of soil N cycle processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Edaphic controls on soil δ 15 N</head><p>Besides climate, our PATH analyses also showed that edaphic factors play important roles in controlling soil δ 15 N values. In the current study, soil δ 15 N values exhibited a significant increase with soil clay across temperate grasslands in northern China (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3H</ref>). The positive correlation between soil δ 15 N and clay may be directly driven by a larger proportion of discriminating gaseous N (N 2 O and NO) losses from soil with high clay concentrations. As a result, the large amount of gaseous N loss may bring about higher δ 15 N values in fine-textured soils because they have a great potential impact on 15 N/ 14 N fractionation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Despite all this, the increase of soil δ 15 N with clay content is also inseparable from the indirect effect of soil clay (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2C</ref>). That is because soil clay can influence soil N concentration and soil C: N ratio through its fixing more 15 N-enriched soil organic matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Due to the greater decomposition of organic matter in soil with high clay concentration, the soils in warm and /or dry environments may contain soil organic matter with high δ 15 N because mineral-associated organic matter contains a greater proportion of N.</p><p>In our study area, soil δ 15 N exhibits a significant upward trend with soil pH values along the transect (Fig 3I ), suggesting that soil pH has an important impact on ecosystem N cycle. The increase of soil δ 15 N with soil pH value might be caused by the increase of NH 3 volatilization under alkaline conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Some experimental evidences show that soil pH can influence internal N cycle by affecting microbial nitrification and denitrification, and also control gaseous N loss via NH 3 volatilization because at high pH, the ammonium-ammonia equilibrium is inclined to the gaseous form, which enriches soil N with 15 N <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Moreover, soil pH indirectly influences soil δ 15 N through influencing soil C: N ratio, soil clay, and soil N (Fig 2D ). The total indirect effect strength of soil pH on soil δ 15 N is -0.136, indicating that soil pH is also a main indirect driver of nitrogen isotope fractionation. In our regional scale, soil δ 15 N decreased significantly with the increase of soil C/N ratio along the transect (Fig 3J ), and this total effect of soil C/N was all from its direct effect (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2E</ref>).</p><p>There are reports that soil C: N ratio can greatly influence the operation of N cycle process at regional scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Therefore, the reduction of soil δ 15 N with soil C: N ratio may be due to its impacts on soil gaseous N losses. It was reported that soil N 2 O emissions exhibited an exponential decline as soil C/N ratio increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The significant negative correlation of soil δ 15 N and C: N ratio indicates that a lower C: N ratio will enhance soil gaseous losses in the process of soil mineralization, nitrification and denitrification, and thus cause larger soil 15 N enrichment. And it also means that the loss of gaseous N can regulate soil δ 15 N in temperate grassland of northern China.</p><p>Besides, some scholars found that soil δ 15 N increased or decreased as soil N contents increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, but we observed a significant positive correlation between soil δ 15 N and soil N across the transect (Fig 3B ), which was consistent with the results previously reported by Shan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The positive relationship between soil δ 15 N and soil N might result from the increase in the fractionation of 15 N with the increase of soil N reserves. Normally, the 15 N abundance of N input is close to zero and lowers than soil 15 N. Therefore, N outputs and the fractionation of microbial activities in soils may have great influence on soil δ 15 N <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. In this study, with the reduction of MAP and MAT from east to west along the transect (Fig 3E <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3F</ref>), warm and dry sites may have led to increase in microbial activity relative to cold and wet sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. In the case of high soil N content, isotope depleted 14 N is preferentially lost from the soil through NH 3 volatilization and microbial denitrification, resulting in the enrichment of 15 N in soil pool and subsequent increases in soil δ 15 N. Furthermore, soil N indirectly affected soil δ 15 N by affecting soil C/N, but the influence intensity is small (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2F</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In short, a regional-scale soil samples were collected along an environmental gradient in temperate grassland of northern China. Four conclusions emanate from PLS-PATH analysis conducted herein, which will provide valuable information for the response of ecosystem N cycle to climatic and edaphic changes.</p><p>(1) Soil N, soil pH, and soil clay have positive total effect on soil δ 15 N, whereas MAP, MAT, and soil C/N ratio have negative total effect on soil δ 15 N. The total influence is, in order, MAP &gt; MAT &gt; soil C: N ratio &gt; soil clay &gt; soil N &gt; soil pH (in absolute value). Among them, soil pH, soil clay, and soil N have a positive direct effect on soil δ 15 N. In addition, the indirect impact of all factors on soil δ 15 N is, in order, MAP &gt; soil pH &gt; soil clay &gt; soil N &gt; MAT &gt; soil C/N. (2) Across the transect, MAP exerted the first-order controls on soil δ 15 N with negative correlation, and directly or indirectly influenced soil δ 15 N value through affecting MAT, soil clay, soil pH, soil N and C/N ratio. Soil δ 15 N values significantly decreased as MAT increased. The negative soil δ 15 N-MAT relationship, which is in contrast with previous research, may be due to the narrow temperature range and simultaneous effect of rain and heat in the study area. (3) Soil C: N ratio imposed a significant negative direct effect on soil δ 15 N. This result indicates that in temperate grassland, soil C/N ratio can regulate soil δ 15 N values by gaseous N loss processes. Soil clay, soil N content, and soil pH have a total positive effect on soil δ 15 N. However, soil pH has a significant negative indirect influence on soil δ 15 N through its effects on soil clay, soil N and C: N ratio. Consequently, the total positive impact of soil pH on soil δ 15 N is weak. (4) These results suggest that climatic and edaphic factors are to some extent coupled in controlling soil 15 N abundance. It should be noted that the current research did not consider plant species and microbial activities as the factors affecting soil δ 15 N.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig 1 showed that, along the transect in temperate grassland of northern China, climatic and edaphic variables explained 64.8% of the total variance in soil δ 15 N values. MAP and MAT together with soil C/N directly determined soil δ 15 N values, and the three had a significant negative effect on soil δ 15 N values. On the contrary, soil clay, soil pH and soil N content had a positive effect. PLS-PATH analyses further indicated that among all independent variables, MAP, MAT and soil pH could significantly and directly alter other climate and/ or soil variables (soil N, soil clay and soil C/N) (Fig 1).
