<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose</head><p>This study was intended to explore the relationship of employment anxiety with student nurse interns' social support and job-seeking e cacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method:</head><p>This was a cross-sectional study conducted from three tertiary hospitals in Hunan Province, China.Student nurse interns were recruited conveniently from March to May 2020, to complete a questionnaire, which included demographic information, occupation anxiety of college students, jobseeking e cacy of college students, and social support scale. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics, while Pearson's correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship speci ed in the purpose of this study. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine factors that in uenced employment anxiety of student nurse interns, and then these factors were included in a path analysis model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A total of 560 student nurse interns were issued questionnaires but only 534 questionnaires were completed. Finally, 494 valid questionnaires were included for analysis. The average ± SD total score of employment anxiety was 71.49±17.28, where SD denotes standard deviation. Job-seeking e cacy, social support, priority factors for nding a job and having received employment training had both direct and indirect impact on employment anxiety. Social support and having received employment training imposed indirect in uence on employment anxiety by the intermediate variable of job-seeking e cacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The results showed that student nurse interns had a higher level of employment anxiety, which was mostly in uenced by job-seeking e cacy followed by social support, and then priority factors for nding a job. Therefore, these results may suggest that nurse educators and managers should consider in strengthening the provision of social and psychological support to student nurse interns, in order to improve their job-seeking e cacy so as to alleviate their employment anxiety.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Clinical practicum experiences prepare student nurses for a smooth transition into professional nursing roles in that they translate classroom nursing skills, knowledge and judgment into clinical work <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> Numerous studies have reported that nursing students regard the practicum experience as one of the most anxiety-inducing aspects in the nursing curriculum <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> because it requires them not only to manage social and personal challenges related to attending university, but also to deal with additional demands associated with clinical practicums <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.As they come closer to the end of the nursing practice, the prospects of nding employment become one of the particular sources contributing to anxiety. In recent years, the number of quali ed nurses has been increasing rapidly due to the in ux of nursing colleges in China, In 2020, novel Coronavirus epidemic hit local economies hard, and the employment pressure of graduates in all countries increased dramatically,hence increasing the prevalence of unemployment among nursing graduates in China, which has in uenced many of them to be constantly looking for employment elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Finding a job is generally a stressful and challenging process, associated with discouragement, frustration and anxiety. Employment anxiety can lead to ineffective learning, performance, and unhealth outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.In addition, previous studies showed that job self-e cacy was a predictor of employment anxiety.among graduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Also, higher levels of job-seeking self-e cacy have been found to be positively associated with lower anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>However, there has been no study on the relationship between employment anxiety and job seeking e cacy among student nurse interns. Another variable widely studied is social support. Social support has been identi ed as a protective factor for mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>,</p><p>and is known to regulate the effects of stress on anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>There were over 4 million registered nurses in China by 2018, with more than 70% of them having bachelor's degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The number of nursing graduates in China is increasing by about 150,000 every year. Therefore, the job market for quali ed nurses in China is correspondingly becoming highly competitive <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.thus leading to the growing prevalence of employment anxiety, which is an adverse emotion produced in the face of employment problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Alternatively, employment anxiety is a kind of nervous, uneasy, intense and lasting emotional experience, which is triggered psychologically and causes corresponding changes in cognition, physiology and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The prevalence of employment anxiety among student nurse interns ranged between 31.0% and 40.7% <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Numerous studies have demonstrated that unemployment exerted a negative impact on mental health. Young job seekers are exposed to considerable stress and vulnerable to mental disorders. However, few studies have examined the mental health status of young job seekers despite anxiety found to be a prominent issue among the Student Nurse Interns <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Previous studies have shown that mental health problems of nursing students were associated with self-esteem, stress and coping e cacy, and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For instance, positive selfesteem enables students to cope with problems more effectively and is effective in the protection of their mental health.</p><p>In addition, job-seeking e cacy, also known as career decision-making self-e cacy, refers to the selfassessment and con dence of individuals in their ability to successfully complete various behavioral processes and achieve behavioral goals in the process of career choice s <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. It was put forward after the self-e cacy theory was developed, and it was related to the job-seeking behavior process <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Jobseeking is a self-regulatory process in uenced by several variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.Among these variables, jobseeking e cacy has a principal role. A research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> has shown that trait anxiety and positive in uence were important predictors of career decision-making self-e cacy. In the eld of nursing, most domestic researchers mainly focus on the curren situation and in uencing factors of job-seeking e cacy, and few studies focus on job -seeking e cacy and employment anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Furthermore, social support has a positive effect on coping with stress and thus, safeguards mental health <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Employment involves both personal and social factors; hence lack of social support could leave young job seekers in a state of crisis simply because this group stands at the crossroads of independence and were vulnerable to deviance and loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.Most studies have shown that social support can improve an individual's poor state of mental health due to stress, and can act as an intermediary factor between psychological stress and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>The main sources of social support for nursing students were their families, schools, practice units, parents and friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. A growing number of studies have showed that lower levels of social support were negatively related to anxiety, whereas higher levels of social support could reduce anxiety among job seekers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>.</p><p>In summary, although some studies have recorded the characteristics of nursing students' anxiety, employment e cacy and social support, little was known about the employment anxiety of Student Nurse Interns and its relationship with job-seeking e cacy and social support in the context of China.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate employment anxiety and its association with social support and job-seeking e cacy among Student Nurse Interns in China. Additionally, a path analysis was used to explore the direct and indirect associations between risk factors and employment anxiety among the study subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Theoretical Framework</head><p>Jiang put forward the stress reaction theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>in 2014 In this theory,interaction of various stressors can lead to physical, psychological and behavioral reaction. Various situations faced by nursing students in the process of employment included employment pressure, frustration and dilemma. The variables mediated by stress included social support, coping style, cognitive evaluation and personality characteristics of nursing students, and employment anxiety <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. Based on this theory, this study made the following assumptions: employment anxiety was a psychological stress reaction under the mediating effect of job-seeking e ciency and social support. That is, when nursing students faced the stress of jobseeking, mediating variables affected their level of employment anxiety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Design, Sample and Procedure</head><p>This was a cross-sectional study conducted from March to May 2020, Convenient sampling was used to recruit subjects from three tertiary hospitals. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) full-time training nursing students; 2) Student Nurse Interns in hospital; 3) nursing students in the nal year of educational system; and 4) nursing students preparing for job-seeking at the time of the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) nursing students unwilling to work; 2) nursing students preparing for postgraduate school or study abroad; and 3) not nursing students. All participants were given an informed consent to participate in the study, and they anonymously completed the questionnaires during the intensive training.</p><p>The reported prevalence of employment anxiety among nursing students was about 0.47 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Therefore, the following sample size formula for cross-sectional studies was used to estimate a required sample size for this study: N=([µ_(α⁄ )]^2 π(1-π)) /δ^2, where parameters were assigned the following values: α was 0.05; detection π was 0.47; and allowable error, δ, was 0.05[] ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li Zheng, 2016)</ref>. In this regard, minimum sample size was 375. Considering 20% of sample turnover, the nal sample size was determined as no less than 450 cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Instruments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Demographic information</head><p>Measured demographic information included age, gender, permanent residence, type of degree, priority factors for choosing a career, whether employment training was received or not and GPA (grade point average).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Employment Anxiety Questionnaire</head><p>Employment anxiety was measured using the Employment Anxiety Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. developed by Yu in 2009. The questionnaire comprises 26 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The 26-items form 4 subscales: pressure of employment competition (7 items), lack of employment support (6 items), lack of self-con dence (7 items), and worry about the employment prospects (6 items). The total score is calculated as the sum of points yielded by all the 26 items and this total score ranges between 26 and 130. Higher total scores indicate greater levels of employment anxiety. This questionnaire has shown good reliability. For example, the reliability and internal consistency coe cient of the questionnaire were 0.79 and 0.92, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Job-seeking e cacy scale</head><p>The Chinese version of job-seeking e cacy scale short form (CDMSE-SF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> was used to measure jobseeking e cacy. This scale has 25 items and ve dimensions: self -assessment (5 items), information collecting (5 items), target selection (5 items), planning (5 items) and problem solving (5 items). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ("0 = no con dence" to "5 = fully con dent"). The total score ranges from 25-125, and higher scores indicate greater levels of job-seeking e cacy. The reliability of the scale was 0.851, and the homogeneity was 0.895.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Social support scale</head><p>Social support scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>(Shui-yuan Xiao,1994) consists of three subscales with 10 items: objective support (3 items), subjective support (4 items) and the utilization degree of social support (3 items). Each item is scored from 1 to 4 points with total scores ranging from 11 to 53. The higher the score, the higher the degree of social support people have. The scale has been widely used in China. Cronbach's alpha coe cients of the total scale and three subscales were 0.770, 0.650, 0.680 and 0.710, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Data analysis</head><p>SPSS 21.0 software(IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA) was used for data analysis. Double entry was used to establish database, and the data were checked again before processing. Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the general characteristics of the sample. Correlation analysis was performed to examine relationships between job-seeking e cacy, employment anxiety and social support. In addition, multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine factors that in uenced employment anxiety of the subjects, and then these factors were included in a path analysis model. The reported con dence intervals (CIs) were calculated at the 95% level and statistical signi cance was twosided and set at the 5% level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Sample Characteristics</head><p>Sample characteristics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A total of 560 student nurse interns were issued questionnaires, but only 534 questionnaires were completed, representing a recovery rate of 95.4%. Nevertheless, 40 of the 534 questionnaires had considerable missing data and they were excluded; hence 494 valid questionnaires were included for analysis. Of the 494 subjects, 85.8% were female. Besides, mean age was 20.3 ± 2.12 years (range from 18 to 24). Also, majority of the subjects had a college degree (56.7%), followed by a bachelor's degree (41.7%). The common job intention was to engage in clinical nursing (81.6%). Location of workplace was the priority considered in job-seeking. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">The relationship of job-seeking e cacy and social with employment anxiety</head><p>Pearson correlation analysis results showed that employment anxiety was negatively correlated with jobseeking e cacy and social support, which was statistically signi cant. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref>. in uence on employment anxiety by the intermediate variable of job-seeking e cacy. Altogether, in the nal path model, these variables explained 22.6% of the total variance (R 2 = 0.22.6), had an adjusting goodness of t index (AGFI) of 0.93, a normed t index (NFI) of 0.93, a comparative t index (CFI) of 1.00, and a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.03. All the four t indices indicated that the nal path model adequately represented the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Both existing nurses and nal year nursing students who will soon be on the job market are important human resources for health in the long term. There has been a greater demand from health institutions for nurses, especially for nurses with higher educational levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>,Judging from the growth rate of nurses in the past 10 years, the importance of nurse supplement has attracted the attention of the national government in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the status of employment anxiety, job-hunting e ciency and social support among nursing students of their internship during the new Coronavera and analyze the relationship between them.The results of this study showed that the average total score of employment anxiety of student nurse interns was 71.49±17.28, suggesting that student nurse interns were generally in the state of anxiety. As regards the average scores of the four dimensions, it could be seen that the main cause of employment anxiety of student nurse interns was the lack of employment support, followed by the lack of self-con dence, worry about the employment prospects and employment competition pressure. Moreover, lack of employment support was the main source of employment pressure. These results are consistent with those of most studies conducted on nursing students. Employment anxiety is not a particular phenomenon for nursing students. Actually, it is very common among the Chinese graduates in general. For example, recent research results showed that some college graduates form incorrect employment perceptions, resulting in excessive anxiety experience in nding a job <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.This study found that job-seeking e cacy had the greatest effect and direct impact on employment anxiety. This result is comparable with those of previous studies, which indicated that job-seeking e cacy could reduce employment anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">36]</ref> .Students with high self-e cacy tend to be more con dent. That is, they are con dent in choosing the target and collecting information related to the process of job hunting. They can also solve problems during the employment process more easily and make better career plans for themselves. Therefore, this explains why lower job-seeking e cacy was associated with high anxiety in this study. The factors associated with job-seeking e cacy were previously found to be the specialty identity degree and employment prospects <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> Those ndings implied that there is need for interventions targeting at improving specialty identity degree so as to decrease employment anxiety <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. Furthermore, this study showed that social support had both direct and indirect impact on employment anxiety with a signi cant weak negative linear correlation. Similarly, previous studies found that low levels of social support were associated with high levels of anxiety, stress, and depression in college students. Besides, Glozah <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> reported that perceived social support could protect students from suffering mental health problems. Additionally, social support was not only signi cantly related to college students' psychological wellbeing but also their overall academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. Thus, these ndings suggest that overall social support of students is signi cantly negatively associated with their levels of depression, anxiety and stress. The mechanism of social support on anxiety is not clear. Liu's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> showed that the sources and ways of social support were different, and there were signi cant differences in the degree of anxiety among college students. Some studies suggested that social support could enhance people's stress levels and play an important role in alleviating anxiety. In this regard, low social support given to nursing students may be related to their lack of social experience as well as low ability to seek for social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.Therefore, nursing students should also be taught social support seeking skills so that they would not lose out on the needed social support.</p><p>Additionally, priority factors for nding job and received employment training were inversely associated with employment anxiety in this study. Nursing students have their priority factors when nding jobs, such as salary, workplace location etc. However, the ideal employment was in con ict with serious employment situation, which could lead to anxiety <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. Student nurse interns who had received adequate employment training had lower anxiety. Employment training programs have been offered to students in many colleges in China to reduce job-seeking anxiety in college graduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. These programs aim to give students an employment overview, and help them to analyze situations in employment, which would cultivate student's ability to conduct a process of nding jobs successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>In China, with the increasing number of nursing students and the gradual saturation of nursing posts, employment anxiety has become an important mental health problem during the later period of nursing practice <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Therefore, interventions targeted at reducing employment anxiety among nursing graduates should include awareness campaigns for nursing educators to make them aware of the prevalence of employment anxiety among Student Nurse Interns, its implications and associated factors, because this would help the nursing educators to effectively implement technological and educational interventions for reducing this problem. In addition, this study found that job-seeking e cacy was predictive of employment anxiety, implying that paying attention to the improvement of students' self-e cacy would have positive signi cance to students' active employment. Social support also has a signi cant weakening, and relieving effect on psychological problems. For example, support from family, school and society can improve the self-e cacy of nursing students and further relieve their employment anxiety. Accordingly, it is suggested that nursing students should improve their job-seeking e ciency by learning about the employment situation and needs, participating in internships, serving as class cadres and participating in extracurricular activities. Moreover, teachers in schools and hospitals should strengthen employment guidance, such as vocational guidance and psychological counseling in order to relieve the employment anxiety of nursing students and improve their enthusiasm in nursing work.</p><p>There were some limitations in this study. The sample was drawn from three hospitals. The results may limit generalizability to other settings. Sample selection using convenience sampling method and the use of a self-reported data collection tool are among the limitations of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The level of employment anxiety of nursing students is high,,Job-seeking e cacy was found to have the greatest effect on employment anxiety among the student nurse interns, followed by social support and then priority factors for nding a job. The impact of social support and having received employment training on employment anxiety were mediated by job-seeking e cacy. These ndings implied a need to develop policies for early interventions Strengthen psychosocial support, improve the e ciency of job selection to improve e cacy, and combining those policies with a long-term social support network, so as to prevent employment anxiety among the student nurse interns in China.</p></div>
