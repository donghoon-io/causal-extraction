<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen extensive application across various domains, including energy and power engineering, where it holds significant promise for enhancing efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. Within the field of numerical computation, AI techniques have been effectively utilized to partly replace conventional numerical methods across a wide range of energy systems, aiding in the design and optimization of critical processes, such as structural strength and heat transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Similarly, in power equipment signal analysis and fault diagnosis, AI algorithms have facilitated anomaly detection and predictive maintenance, thereby reducing downtime and enhancing operational efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Despite these successes, conventional AI tools often lack the theoretical foundation necessary to comprehensively address the complexities of energy systems. The black-box nature of many AI models hinders their interpretability, raising concerns regarding their trustworthiness and accountability in critical energy infrastructure applications.</p><p>Recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, LLaMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and GLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> has revolutionized artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). These models excel in generating human-like text, understanding context, and performing complex tasks. Concurrently, enhancement methods such as retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, agent with tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and advanced prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Tree-of-Thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have been proposed. These advancements address some issues of hallucinations and unexplainability in LLMs, making them more robust and trustworthy for practical applications.</p><p>In this context, we explored the feasibility of integrating LLMs into a domain-specific application scenarios, i.e. energy and power science and engineering, by focusing on a classic issue in gas turbine operation and maintenance: gas path analysis. Our method involved crafting specific prompts and a dual-agent tool-calling process to guide LLMs in parsing tool parameters. We defined energy equations as tools for each component and employed ReAct chain thinking prompts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to guide LLM reasoning and solve performance parameters. Testing across different LLMs provided insights into their capabilities for understanding, thinking, and reasoning, offering valuable perspectives for further research and applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Large Language Models</head><p>Large language models (LLMs) epitomize a notable stride in artificial intelligence, particularly within the realm of natural language processing, hinging on neural networks and the transformer architecture for text processing and generation. Neural networks, intricate arrangements of interconnected neurons, adeptly transform input data through learned weights, thereby enabling multifaceted representations. A seminal advancement in LLMs is the integration of attention mechanisms, pivotal for discerning specific elements within input data, capturing extensive contextual dependencies. Central to LLMs, the transformer architecture comprises encoder and decoder layers, with the former processing input text and the latter generating output, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to gauge word relevance and contextual nuances. Beyond their fundamental architecture, LLMs offer distinct advantages over traditional AI methods, including their aptitude for coherent text generation and proficiency in reasoning tasks, bolstered by extensive training data. Techniques such as attention visualization enhance interpretability, shedding light on the model's underlying processing mechanisms.</p><p>Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of LLM implementations, each characterized by unique architectural nuances, training datasets, and methodologies, engendering discernible disparities in their natural language comprehension and logical reasoning proficiencies. Our research evaluates multiple large language models from various organizations, elucidating their nuanced capabilities in parsing prompts and executing logical reasoning tasks for fundamental thermodynamics engineering problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">LLM agent and ReAct prompts</head><p>The outputs of large language models are probabilistic estimations of human language, inherently subject to error and potential inaccuracies. These models may exhibit hallucinatory tendencies, particularly when confronted with scenarios beyond their training data, posing challenges for accurate response generation. Complex tasks often surpass the capabilities of single-shot language responses from large language models. Consequently, integrating these models with memory, planning, and tool-based capabilities emerges as a viable strategy for addressing intricate problems, leveraging their strengths while mitigating inherent limitations.</p><p>Large language model agents, enriched with callable tools and guided by ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) strategies, constitute an advanced framework for tackling intricate reasoning tasks. ReAct prompts facilitate systematic problem decomposition, addressing common LLM issues like hallucinations and unexplainability by providing structured reasoning pathways. Integrated callable tools serve as domain-specific functions, encapsulating expert knowledge and computational methodologies. In our experiment, a gas turbine component solution process, aligned with thermodynamic principles, guides LLMs to adhere to scientific laws. By synergizing LLMs' language comprehension and contextual processing prowess with human-defined tools, these agents achieve a balance between certainty and adaptability in problem-solving. This approach enhances the reliability and interpretability of LLM agents, catering to the nuanced demands of fields like energy and power engineering, characterized by complex, context-dependent challenges.</p><p>Compressor: T 1 , p Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Schema of gas path analysis for gas turbines</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Gas turbine components and test data</head><p>The gas turbine, operating on the Brayton cycle, converts gaseous fuel into mechanical energy efficiently through compression, heating, and expansion stages. Its components, including the compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and nozzle, play vital roles in this thermodynamic process. The compressor elevates air pressure through adiabatic compression, crucial for overall turbine performance. In the combustion chamber, fuel-air mixture combustion significantly increases temperature and pressure, while the turbine extracts energy from the resulting gas flow to produce mechanical work. The nozzle accelerates exhaust gases, enhancing turbine efficiency.</p><p>Calculating compressor and turbine adiabatic efficiency involves determining enthalpy changes across these components under adiabatic assumptions and comparing actual to theoretical enthalpy changes to gauge performance. Test conditions typically measure temperatures, pressures, and fuel flow rates, while complexities often exclude parameters such as combustion chamber outlet (turbine inlet) and air/gas flow rates. Consequently, calculating turbine isentropic efficiency requires solving multiple components: determining gas flow rate through the nozzle, calculating turbine inlet temperature and pressure via enthalpy conservation in the combustion chamber, and finally computing the turbine's isentropic efficiency. This process is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. This article aims to enable the large language model to comprehend and execute this calculation process.</p><p>3 Methods</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">LLMs models</head><p>Given the varying capabilities of different large language models, we selected models from various institutions to enable the calculation of gas turbine performance parameters and assess their application potential in energy and power engineering. The details of these models are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.  Due to the commercial sensitivity of data in the energy and power engineering industry, we focused on testing multiple large language models that can be locally executed on consumer-grade graphics cards. The models listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> were deployed on a platform equipped with two NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs (totaling 48 GB of video memory), with quantization applied to meet the memory constraints. Additionally, we tested the process described in this article using business models accessed through APIs to facilitate a comparative analysis of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dual-agent tool-calling process</head><p>Given that the aforementioned large language models do not all natively support tool calling, this article employs a general dual-agent tool-calling process to construct a unified large language model agent. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the first agent, prompted by the ReAct framework, outputs "Thought, Action, Action input" logically, enabling it to select and plan subsequent actions. When tool usage is required, the Action and Action input content generated by the first agent are submitted to the second agent. The second agent is tasked with qualifying the tool and extracting specific information in JSON format. This JSON information is then parsed into Python variables, and the preset tool code is executed to complete the calculation. The result from the second tool is returned as an "Observation" content to the first agent, which continues the "Thought, Action, Action input" process until it outputs the "Thought, Final Answer". Additionally, the first agent's prompt includes several sentences on the fundamentals of gas turbines. The prompt words for both agents are provided in the appendix A.1 at the end of this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Gas path analysis solver tools</head><p>To ensure the outputs generated by the LLMs adhere to the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and to assist the agents in calculating the isentropic efficiency of the gas turbine compressor and turbine, we have predefined parameters and developed four tools for the gas turbine's compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and nozzle. These tools operate according to the following principles:</p><p>• Compressor</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">η comp = ∆H ideal ∆H real ≈ Pout Pin γ-1 γ -1</formula><p>Tout Tin -1 • Combustion Chamber ṁin h in,air + ṁfuel q fuel = ṁout h out,gas ⇒ T out ≈ T in + q fuel ṁfuel c p,air ṁout</p><p>• Turbine</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η turb = ∆H real ∆H ideal ≈ 1 -Tout Tin 1 -Pout Pin γ-1 γ • Nozzle Machout = min      Pin Pout γ-1 γ -1   • 2 γ -1 , 1    ⇒ ṁout ≈ PinAthroat γ R • Tin Machout • 1 + γ -1 2 Mach 2 out -γ+1 2(γ-1)</formula><p>To streamline the calculation process, various approximations were made, particularly concerning gas thermophysical properties and flow conservation. Since the internal calculations of these tools are not visible to the large language model, these simplifications do not impact the experimental evaluation of the model's agent capabilities. In practical engineering applications, these tools can be substituted with any calculation process necessary to meet modeling accuracy requirements. The functions defining these four calculation tools are detailed in the appendix A.2 at the end of this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and discussion</head><p>In the initial phase, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in calculating single component without embedded tools. Detailed questions, can be found in the appendix A.3, were posed to the models. The results, summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, revealed that locally deployed models (LLama3 and Qwen1.5) could only engage in text-based reasoning and preliminary calculations, resulting in incorrect outcomes. This highlights their limitation in performing accurate technical calculations through text alone. Conversely, web-accessed models (ChatGPT4o and ChatGLM4) demonstrated better performance. They engaged in conceptual reasoning, made reasonable assumptions (e.g., ideal gas properties, fuel calorific value, etc.), and generated and executed Python code. ChatGPT4o accurately calculated all gas turbine components, while ChatGLM4 correctly calculated the combustion chamber and turbine but erred with the nozzle and compressor.</p><p>These results indicate that while LLMs have a foundational understanding of gas turbine concepts, their reasoning and calculation accuracy varies. Web-accessed models, which support Python script execution, can handle complex tasks better than locally deployed models, which are limited to text-based reasoning. Most LLMs lack sufficient native knowledge of gas turbine components and cannot perform reasoning and calculations independently. To address this, we built a dual-agent system with predefined gas turbine calculation tools. After construction, we tested single-component calculation questions, summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. For the small model LLama3-8B, agent1 correctly generated "Thought, Action, Action input" response, but agent2 incorrectly produced tool call results in JSON when more than three tools were available. The Qwen1.5 models' agent1 functioned normally, but agent2's JSON strings had subtle errors, like added spaces in parameter names. Conversely, LLama3-70B, GPT3.5 and GLM4 accurately completed tool calls for all four components and generated user-friendly replies, demonstrating its superior capabilities. Detailed responses from some agents are provided in the appendix A.4.</p><p>After integrating multi-component calculation tools, the three LLM agents could reason and make tool call decisions based on user queries. We tested them on a more complex task: calculating the adiabatic efficiency of both the gas turbine's compressor and turbine using typical test data. Detailed questions are provided in the appendix A.3. To solve this, the LLM agent needed to sequentially call the tools according to the logic in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, selecting correct parameters from the input and output data. Initially, all three agents correctly used the measured inlet and outlet data of the compressor. However, they incorrectly used unmeasured turbine inlet temperature and pressure parameters, leading to wrong turbine efficiency results. This indicates the LLMs struggled with complex reasoning chains and lacked a deep understanding of gas turbine specifics. With hints provided for solving sequence, GLM4 and GPT3.5 adjusted their order correctly but still selected incorrect tool parameters for the nozzle, resulting in errors. In contrast, LLama3-70B correctly executed the entire chain solution. Responses from LLM agents are included in the appendix A.4. The above results show that different LLMs exhibit varying capabilities. The state-of-the-art GPT4o model can independently generate and execute correct Python scripts for simple thermodynamic problems, such as gas turbine component calculations, highlighting the potential of tool-embedded LLM agents for scientific and engineering applications.</p><p>Our dual-agent tool-calling process enables tool use across various LLMs, regardless of native support, reducing illusion phenomena and integrating human knowledge and complex models. However, LLMs vary in tool selection and parameter extraction accuracy. Generally, larger, more recent models perform better. Despite advancements, current LLMs struggle with complex, multi-component gas turbine problems. With human knowledge planning, LLMs may eventually handle these challenges successfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Our study investigated the application of large language models (LLMs) with callable tools in the specialized domain of energy and power engineering, focusing specifically on gas turbine gas path analysis. We implemented a dual-agent tool-calling process designed to enhance LLM capabilities by integrating human knowledge, predefined tools, and LLM reasoning. This process was tested on several mainstream LLMs, including LLama3, Qwen1.5, and GPT, to evaluate their proficiency in tool parameter extraction, knowledge understanding, and reasoning. Smaller and older models such as LLama3-8B and Qwen1.5 exhibited limitations in effectively utilizing tools and extracting parameters, underscoring their struggles with complex, multi-component problems. In contrast, more advanced models like GPT4o and LLama3-70B demonstrated superior capabilities, showing promise in handling intricate engineering tasks. Despite these advancements, current LLMs still face challenges with highly complex, multi-component problems. However, LLM agents with tool calling ability, combined with human expertise, show significant potential for improving LLM performance in these intricate tasks. Continued development, fine-tuning, and advanced prompt engineering are likely to enhance their accuracy and effectiveness, enabling more sophisticated problem-solving in specialized domains.</p><p>Based on the test results of these models, we can reasonably anticipate that with fine-tuning using professional knowledge and advanced prompting design, LLMs with nearly 100 billion parameters could meet the reasoning requirements of professional scenarios. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research and development in the application of LLMs in specialized engineering fields, paving the way for more robust and capable AI-driven solutions.</p></div>
