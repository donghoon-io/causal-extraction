<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Genotypes and fruit samples of Sechium were randomly collected for fruit traits such as length (FL), width (FW), circumference/girth (FC), and the number of ridges (FR) from the various parts of village Kigwema of Kohima district, Nagaland at a mean value of latitude (25.60690 N), longitude (94.34250 E) and altitude (1538 masl) for the purpose. Genotypes and fruit samples collection for trait study normally distributed in histogram plot and normality test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) estimated significant differences in fruit sample traits. The phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) was greater than the genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) for all the traits. The phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variation was recorded maximum for trait fruit length, while maximum heritability was recorded for trait fruit circumference. High heritability and high genetic advance estimates for fruit circumference suggest that it could be considered for further improvement through various breeding programs. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed that fruit length and fruit ridges numbers are responsible for most of the variations observed in the fruit morphology and could be considered for its improvement. Fruit width recorded maximum for correlation coefficient direct value indicated towards effect on the fruit circumference and direct selection of the trait for its improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Nature fulfills every need of human beings and grows various plants with economic importance. Most of the plants in nature are unexplored and gathering information on nature and its variation is an important criterion to select a genotype with desirable traits for a successful plant breeding program <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dyulgerova and Valcheva, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ipek and Balta, 2020)</ref>. Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw., Cucurbitaceae, is a nutritious crop, mostly uses matured fruit as vegetables and boiled salads. The demands of various cucurbitaceous vegetables by the people in the society caused to increase the production of such important crops. Therefore to achieve the target, information on genetic variability, heritability, the genetic advance of yield, and associated traits is essentially important.</p><p>Regression is an estimation of the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Vrbik, 2018)</ref>. Also, it is a test method to observe data is approximately normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dimitrova et al., 2020)</ref>. Plotting a histogram of the variables of interest indicated the shape of normally distributed data, and test of normality is performed and confirmed through Q-Q plots and Kolmogorove-Smirnov and <ref type="bibr">Shapiro-Wilk's W test in SPSS ver. 16 (Kolmogorove, 1933;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Smirnov, 1948;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shapiro and Wilk, 1965)</ref>.</p><p>Analysis of variance (anova) is generally used to ensure whether the means of two or more groups of samples are significantly differ or not from each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Turkheimer, 2015)</ref>. Heritability and agronomic characteristics are important traits that may be utilized to estimate and improve the yield of crops successfully. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Falconer and Mackey (1996)</ref> defined heritability as the measure of correspondence between breeding values and phenotypic values. Heritability plays a predictive role in breeding and expresss its dependability on phenotype, which guides its breeding value <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wray and Visscher, 2008)</ref>. Genetic advance is a direct relationship between heritability and response to selection. High genetic advance with high heritability estimates the most effective condition for selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moore and Shenk, 2017)</ref>. Heritability is, therefore important, and its application increases when a genetic advance is calculated as it indicates the gain in character obtained under particular selection pressure. Therefore, genetic advance is an important selection parameter that helps in the selection breeding program.</p><p>The correlation procedure calculates the correlation between variables and measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. The knowledge of the relationship between genetic and phenotypic data is important and valuable when the traits are considered for selection.</p><p>Path coefficient analysis allows an effective means of partitioning correlation coefficients into the unidirectional pathway and alternative pathways. This analysis permits a critical examination of specific factors that produce a given correlation and can be successfully employed in formulating an effective strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Okuyama et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical procedure to transform, possibly a large number of correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables, usually known as principal components <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chatfield and Collis, 1980)</ref>. The first principal component (PC1) accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component (PC2, PC3, PC4 etc.) accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible. The objective of the PCA is to discover or reduce the dimensionality of the data set and to identify new meaningful causal variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jolliffe, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of cluster analysis is to discover a system of organizing observations where members of the group share specific properties in common. Cluster analysis is a class of techniques that classifies cases into groups that are relatively homogeneous within themselves and relatively heterogeneous between each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yim and Ramdeen, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>So, the purpose of the present study is to generate some basic information, using standard statistical methods such as analysis of variation, correlation, regression, path correlation coefficient analysis, principal component analysis, cluster, and factor analysis to differentiate and assess the variations, heritability (broad sense), genetic advance, yield and contribution through direct and indirect effects of some important traits on the total variation of genotypes for the further genetic improvement of the crop.</p></div>

Shapiro-Wilk test is more sensitive towards outliers and smaller data samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shore, 2012 and</ref><ref type="bibr">2011)</ref>. Therefore, normality could be assumed for the data; as a result, any other test assumptions may be satisfied, and finally, an appropriate parametric test can be used (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for the quantitative traits of Sechium genotypes fruit traits, and mean value was recorded high for FC (21.7±0.32) followed by FL (11.5±0.31), Fwd (8.51±0.15), and FR (4.73±0.11) respectively are significantly differs from each other at the probability level of p≤0.05 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).   The estimates of the phenotypic and genotypic variances showed similar trend as of the mean value from ANOVA (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Pearson's correlation of quantitative traits of fruit samples is significant at the level of probability of significance p≤0.01 (2-tailed), and all traits are positively associated with each other (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). For the estimation of the partial regression coefficients or direct path coefficients, fruit trait, FC was considered as a dependent (resultant) and FL, Fwd, and FR independent (causal) variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>). Correlation coefficients into its direct and indirect component parts and path analysis and contributions of related components towards fruit sample trait, FC were estimated. Pearson correlation values are the combination of direct and indirect components of the variable relationship. The direct or indirect relationship of variables is separated out and used to draw a direction of the path and their contributions to the overall growth of the crop (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).    <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Also, in order to whether the present data are suitable for principle component analysis/factor analysis or not, anti image correlation, as well as Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's test, was performed. anti-image correlation suggested the value more than 0.600 a (diagonal value) and suitable for the measure of sample adequacy. Similarly, results are obtained in KMO and Bartlett's test (0.718 and p-value=0.000) for the measure of sample adequacy (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref>).</p><p>The principal component is an important multivariate analysis technique used to examine the association between characters and measures genetic diversity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8-9</ref> and<ref type="table">Figure</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Hierarchical cluster dendrogram using ward method for fruit characters were estimated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Data are normally distributed and could be assumed for an appropriate parametric test as revealed from the normality test (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The significant differences among and between the traits from ANOVA suggest the presence of genetic variation and provide an opportunity for the consideration of fruit samples in plant breeding improvement programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gelman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dag et al., 2018)</ref>. The maximum phenotypic (Vp) and genotypic (Vg) variances was estimated for FC (Vp=6.25; Vg=6.11) followed by <ref type="bibr">FL (Vp=5.56;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vg=5.39),</ref><ref type="bibr">Fwd (Vp=1.32;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vg=1.27)</ref> and FR (Vp=0.63; Vg=0.59) respectively. The minimum Vp was recorded for the trait FR. As expected, the phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) was greater than the genotypic coefficient variation (GCV) for all the traits. A larger difference between PCV and GCV values suggests the greater environmental effects on the traits. The PCV and GCV estimate the nature and magnitude of variation explain the variation either due to genetic or environmental causes. It was estimated maximum for FL (pcv%=20.50; gcv%=20.18) followed by <ref type="bibr">FR (pcv%=16.78;</ref><ref type="bibr">gcv%=16.23),</ref><ref type="bibr">Fwd (pcv%=13.50;</ref><ref type="bibr">gcv%=13.24)</ref> and FC (pcv%=11.52; gcv%=11.39) respectively. All the traits showed smaller differences, and minimum PCV and GCV value was estimated for FC. Heritability is the proportion of genetic variance in phenotypic variance that gives information about the inheritance of traits. Traits with high heritability are easy to improve through selection, and it is recorded high for all traits in the study. The highest heritability was estimated for FC (97%), followed by FL (96%), Fwd (96%), and FR (93%), respectively. Similar results have been reported in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Turkheimer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tester and Langridge, 2010)</ref>. It is also considered that high heritability does not indicate high genetic gain always. Therefore, both heritability and genetic advance are considered together for prediction and their final effects on traits for selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Luby et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Johnson et al., 2011)</ref>. Fruit circumference, FC showed high heritability coupled with high genetic advance. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance suggests the additive effects on the control of the particular trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hartung and Schiemann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lipi et al., 2020)</ref>. On the other hand, high heritability with low genetic advance indicates the non-additive effects on the control of a particular trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Heckerman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ning et al., 2020)</ref>. High heritability and high genetic advance for FC suggest a good trait to consider for selection and improvement in plant breeding programs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</p><p>Quantitative traits of fruit samples are significant at the level of probability of significance p≤0.01 (2-tailed), and all traits are positively associated with each other and indicate towards possible contribution in trait improvement. The dependent variable and independent variables in the correlation matrix for fruit sample traits are represented as Y and X1, X2, and X3, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mahdavi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Székely et al., 2007)</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</p><p>For the estimation of the partial regression coefficients, fruit sample trait, FC was considered as a dependent (resultant) and FL, Fwd, and FR independent (causal) variables. FL showed a small but negative (-0.048) and negligible direct effect on the FC. The indirect effect on FC through Fwd and FR is positive, where the Fwd effect is in considerable magnitude than FR. The total sum value of the correlation (0.550) is positive and significant at p≤0.01, which suggests that indirect selection of the trait through Fwd could be useful. Fwd showed the highest and positive (0.927) direct effect on FC. The indirect effects are negative (-0.031) through FL and positive (0.051) for FR. Both the indirect effects are small and negligible in magnitude. The total sum value of correlation (0.947) is positive and highly significant at p≤0.01, which suggests that direct selection of the trait could be useful. FR showed a positive (0.087) but small and negligible direct effect on the FC. The indirect effect is positive (0.547) and negative (-0.026) through Fwd and FL, respectively. The indirect effect through Fwd is considerable magnitude than FL. The total sum value of correlation (0.521) is positive and significant at p≤0.01, which suggests that indirect selection of the trait could be useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tarka, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bentler and Chih-Ping, 2016)</ref>. The partial regression coefficients or direct path coefficients, direct and indirect component parts are presented in Table 5-6 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>The principal component is an important multivariate analysis technique used to examine the association between characters and measures the genotype/varieties genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Esposito et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Muradoglu et al., 2021)</ref>. The result of PCA for the fruit traits of Sechium genotypes showed that the first two components explained 74.76% and 87.66% of the cumulative variation for fruit populations, respectively. The first component (PC1) accounts for 74.76% of total variation and is positively and highly associated with all the traits in the study called the fruit component. The second component (PC2) explained 12.90% of total variation and was positively associated with FL and FR while negatively associated with FC and Fwd (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref>). The genetic variation of quantitative traits based on multivariate analysis using PCA suggests that FL and FR as the most important trait for explaining variability in the fruits of Sechium genotypes followed by FC and Fwd. The contribution of FL and FR was observed high in the principal component axes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). The observation suggests that FL and FR are the major traits that explain the total variation in the fruit morphology of the Sechium genotypes and may be considered for further improvement. Similar results were reported in other crops by various authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rosso and Pagano, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chandran and Padya, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Hierarchical Cluster or dendrogram analysis of the fruit traits using ward method measured the interval with squared euclidean distance showed traits classified into 2 groups suggest the contribution towards other groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</p></div>
