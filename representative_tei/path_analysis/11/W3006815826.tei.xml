<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AQ4</head><p>-HF study. Patients were 18 years or older, with a diagnosis of HF in New York Heart Association classes II to IV, who had insufficient self-care and did not have severe cognitive impairment. Patients' informal caregivers were those people inside or outside the family who gave most of the informal care to the patients. We used the Caregiver Preparedness Scale and the Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care of HF Index. We tested a path analysis model and the indirect effects. Results: Caregivers (n = 323) were 55 (SD, 15) years old on average and predominantly female (77%). The path analysis showed that higher scores in caregiver preparedness were associated with higher scores in caregiver confidence. In turn, higher caregiver confidence was associated with higher CC to self-care maintenance and management. Caregiver confidence mediated the association between caregiver preparedness and CC to self-care maintenance and management. Conclusions: Caregiver confidence may play a role in CC to self-care. Interventions to improve CC to HF self-care not only should be focused on improving caregiver preparedness but also may consider the role of caregiver confidence.</p><p>KEY WORDS: caregiver preparedness, caregiver confidence, caregivers, heart failure, self-care</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H eart failure</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AQ5</head><p>(HF) is a chronic illness with an increasing prevalence due to the aging population and the improved survival rates after myocardial infarction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Heart failure is characterized by high mortality rates, up to 58% 5 years after diagnosis, 2 and high hospitalization rates, with 44% of patients hospitalized within 12 months after a previous hospitalization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Patients can mitigate the poor outcomes associated with HF by adopting adequate self-care, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> which consists of those behaviors aimed at maintaining the illness' stability-for example, by taking medications as prescribed (self-care maintenance) and responding to signs and symptoms of exacerbation as soon as they appear (self-care management). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> However, self-care is not simple, and most patients find it difficult to perform, especially if they are older, are affected by comorbid conditions, and have cognitive impairment and lower self-care confidence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Given the previously mentioned issues, patients' informal caregivers (eg, patients' family members or friends) play an important role in contributing to HF patient self-care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Heart failure caregivers give concrete and emotional support to their patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> improve medication adherence, and play a key role in navigating the healthcare system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> In addition, caregiver contributions (CC) to HF self-care maintenance can reduce patients' clinical event risks (ie, hospitalizations, use of emergency services, and mortality). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> The Situation-Specific Theory of Caregiver Contributions to Heart Failure Self-Care defines CC to HF self-care as the process by which an informal caregiver recommends or performs for the patients those activities that help the patient to maintain HF stability (CC to self-care maintenance), facilitates the perception of the signs and symptoms of HF (CC to symptom monitoring and perception), and responds to the signs and symptoms of HF decompensation (CC to self-care management). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> These 3 components of CC to HF self-care are hypothesized to influence each other without a specific sequence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> However, they occur in sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> in patients, and Chen and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> have found that CC to self-care maintenance influence CC to self-care management. In the theory, CC to HF self-care are influenced by several factors at the caregiver, patient, and dyadic levels. Caregiver sociodemographic factors (eg, gender, age, job, caregiving hours, and education) have been theorized as variables influencing CC to self-care, as well as patient sociodemographic and clinical factors (eg, gender, age, education, New York Heart Association class, months of illness, comorbidities, and cognition). In the theory, all these factors can be mediated by caregiver confidence-that is, the caregiver's feeling of being able to contribute effectively to the improvement of HF patient self-care. Caregiver confidence was found to explain most of the variance in CC to HF self-care maintenance and management. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> A caregiver-level factor that might improve CC to HF self-care is caregiver preparedness, which was defined as the ability to take care of both the physical and emotional needs of the care recipient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Preparedness was shown to improve several caregiver outcomes in dementia and cancer, such as hope, mental quality of life, anxiety, depression, and strain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Although caregiver preparedness is associated with positive outcomes in caregivers, few studies have been conducted on HF caregiver preparedness. Authors of these studies found that HF caregivers complained about the lack of preparation in caregiving <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and that higher caregiver preparedness was associated with lower caregiver depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and higher self-gain. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Because caregiver preparedness is associated with positive outcomes in other caregiver populations and can be modified with interventions, it is worth investigating whether caregiver preparedness influences CC to HF self-care. Because patients with HF struggle to perform self-care and HF self-care was found to be associated with good outcomes in patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> it is worth investigating ways to improve CC to self-care. In the Situation-Specific Theory of CC to HF Self-care, preparedness could be a caregiver-level factor influencing CC to HF self-care through the mediation of caregiver confidence. However, so far, no author has tested this relationship. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that (1) caregiver preparedness influences caregiver confidence, (2) caregiver confidence influences CC to self-care maintenance and management, (3) CC to selfcare maintenance influence CC to self-care management, and (4) caregiver confidence mediates the relationship between preparedness and CC to self-care maintenance and management (  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>This is a secondary analysis from the baseline data of the MOTIVATE-HF study, 24 a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effect of motivational interviewing in improving self-care in patients with HF and caregivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The participants of the MOTIVATE-HF study included patient and caregiver dyads enrolled in several cardiology settings in central and southern Italy. The inclusion/ exclusion criteria for patients and caregivers have been published elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Briefly, patients were included in this study if they were 18 years or older, with a diagnosis of HF in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes II to IV; had insufficient self-care (defined as a score of 0, 1, or 2 in at least 2 items of the self-care maintenance or self-care management scales of the Self-Care Heart Failure Index v.6.2 [SCHFI v.6.2]) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">26</ref> ; were willing to participate in the study and sign the informed consent form; and did not have severe cognitive impairment, defined as a score of 0 to 4 on the six-item screener. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">27</ref> We also enrolled patients' informal caregivers in the study, defined as those people inside or outside the family who gave most of the informal care to the patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>Data were collected by research assistants who were all nurses trained in the study protocol. These research assistants recruited caregivers and patients in the described settings. All participants, after signing the informed consent form, completed the MOTIVATE-HF study instrument battery, including instruments for patients (the Self-Care of HF Index, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">26</ref> HF Somatic Perception Scale, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29</ref> Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">30</ref> and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">31</ref> ), instruments for caregivers (the Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care of HF Index [CC-SCHFI], <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Caregiver Preparedness Scale, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">32</ref> and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">33</ref> ), and instruments for both (the Short Form 12, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">34</ref> Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">35</ref> Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">36</ref> and Mutuality Scale 37 ). However, for the purposes of this study, we considered the measures discussed hereinafter.</p><p>The Caregiver Preparedness Scale (CPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> is an instrument evaluating the preparedness of caregivers who assist patients with chronic conditions. It is an 8-item instrument that uses a 5-point Likert scale for responses ranging from 0 ("not at all prepared") to 4 ("very well prepared"). Items of the CPS investigate the extent to which a caregiver feels prepared to take care of both the physical and emotional needs of a patient. The total score ranges from 0 to 4, with a higher score meaning higher preparedness. The validity and reliability of the CPS have been tested in caregivers of patients with HF, showing supportive fit indices at confirmatory factor analysis (eg, Comparative Fit Index [CFI], 0.97; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA], 0.065) and supportive reliability (Cronbach α = .91). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">38</ref> The CC-SCHFI 9 is a 22-item instrument that measures the contributions of an informal caregiver to patient HF self-care. It is divided into 3 separate scales measuring CC to self-care maintenance (eg, recommending the patient assess their ankles for swelling), CC to self-care management (eg, helping the patient to identify signs or symptoms of exacerbations), and caregiver confidence (eg, confidence in helping the patient to perform self-care). The CC to self-care management scale can be administered only when caregivers have reported their patients to have had symptoms in the last month. In this version of the CC-SCHFI, which was developed before the Situation-Specific Theory of HF Caregiver Contributions to HF Self-Care, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> the self-care monitoring dimension is embedded in the self-care maintenance scale. The CC-SCHFI uses a 4-point Likert scale for responses, with a total standardized score from 0 to 100 for each scale. A higher score in each scale indicates a better contribution to patient self-care. The 3 CC-SCHFI scales were each tested for validity and reliability and showed supportive fit indices at confirmatory factorial analysis (CFI from 0.96 to 0.99, RMSEA from 0.03 to 0.06) and at the factor score determinacy coefficient (ranging from 0.65 to 0.84), which measures reliability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Because, in the theory guiding the study, CC to HF self-care are influenced by several caregiver and patient factors, we considered the following sociodemographic variables in caregivers: gender, age, job, caregiving hours, and education; in patients, we considered the following sociodemographic and clinical variables: gender, age, education, NYHA class, months of illness, comorbidities, and cognition. To evaluate patient comorbidities and cognition, we used the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the MoCA, respectively. The CCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">39</ref> is used extensively, including in patients with HF, to assess comorbidities. Each of the 19 comorbidities in the CCI have a possible score from 1 (eg, HF) to 6 (eg, cancer with metastasis), with a total score between 1 and 36. A higher score means worse comorbid conditions. The validity of the CCI was demonstrated by its ability to predict 10-year mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">39</ref> The MoCA 31 is a 30-item screening instrument for evaluating cognitive function by considering 7 cognitive domains: visuospatial/executive, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. The MoCA was tested for concurrent validity with the Mini Mental State Examination and test-retest and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach α = .83). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">31</ref> The possible score ranges between 0 and 30, with a higher score indicating better cognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical Considerations</head><p>The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Rome Tor Vergata (letter n. 121/13). Caregivers and patients were fully informed about the aims of the study, had to sign the informed consent form, and were informed that they could leave the study at any moment. In addition, caregivers and patients were assured that all collected data would be kept confidential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, frequencies, and percentages) were used to describe caregivers' sociodemographic characteristics and patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The scores of the CPS and CC-SCHFI were calculated as mean and SD. The scores Caregiver Confidence</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AQ1</head><p>in CC to Self-care 3</p><p>of the CPS and CC-SCHFI were also evaluated for skewness and kurtosis to evaluate the normality of the data. Correlations among the studied variables were computed using Pearson or Spearman correlations as appropriate.</p><p>To test the first 3 hypotheses guiding the study, we implemented a model of path analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">40</ref> as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Because the hypotheses to be tested implied the use of the scores of the CC to self-care management scale, our statistical analysis considered only those caregivers (n = 323) who reported that their patients had HF symptoms during the last month. A preliminary check of missing data on these 323 caregivers showed that 96.9% of this subsample had no missing data and the remaining 3.1% had only 1 variable missing. The Little test, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">41</ref> which was used to evaluate whether missing data were missing completely at random, resulted to be not significant (P = .234). Consequently, the data were considered missing completely at random, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">42</ref> and the full information maximum likelihood estimation in Mplus was selected to conduct the path analysis model.</p><p>The scores of the CPS, CC to self-care maintenance and management, and caregiver confidence were normally distributed; consequently, we chose the maximum likelihood estimator to test the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">43</ref> The model fit was evaluated using the following indices: the CFI and Tucker-Lewis Index, with values greater than 0.95 indicating an excellent fit; the standardized root mean square residual, with values of 0.08 or less indicating a good fit; and the RMSEA, with values less than 0.06 indicating a good fit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">44</ref> χ 2 Statistics were also reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">43</ref> In the path analysis, we also included the variables that were found to be significantly correlated with the CPS, CC to self-care maintenance and management, and caregiver confidence (covariates).</p><p>To test the fourth hypothesis, whether caregiver confidence mediates between caregiver preparedness and CC to self-care maintenance and management, we tested the indirect effects through caregiver confidence, from the CPS scores to CC to self-care maintenance scores and from the CPS scores to CC to self-care management scores. We performed this mediation analysis by estimating the indirect effects with a bootstrapping method, using 5000 replications of the original sample. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">45</ref> P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22 and Mplus version 7 (Muthén and Muthén, Los Angeles, California).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants' Characteristics</head><p>A total sample of 494 caregiver-and-patient dyads was available for data analysis, but only 323 caregivers (65.4%) reported that their patients had HF symptoms in the last month and could complete the self-care management scale of the CC-SCHFI. Caregivers considered in the present analysis were not different in terms of age (P = .165), gender (P = .179), and CPS (P = .465), CC to self-care maintenance (P = .507), and caregiver confidence (P = .279) scores compared with those who were excluded for the previously mentioned reasons, but they cared for patients with HF who were older (mean [SD], 74.46 [11.06] vs 68.29 [13.52]; P &lt; .001) and more frequently female (45.8% vs 33.9%; P = .011). In addition, caregivers included in our analysis cared for patients who were more often in NYHA classes III to IV than those who were excluded (50.5% vs 14.7%; P &lt; .001), but they cared for patients who were comparable in terms of CCI scores (P = .208) in reference to patients excluded from the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T1</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers. These caregivers were 54.63 (SD, 15.16) years old on average and were mainly female (77.4%). Most of them had a partner (71.2%), were unemployed (52.1%), and were educated at the high school level or lower (79.4%). Caregivers were most often the patient's child (42.7%) or spouse (33.5%) and lived with the patient (61.3%). They had been caring for their patients for more than 9 hours per day.</p><p>Patients were 74.46 (SD, 11.06) years old on average and mainly male (54.2%) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Most of them had a partner (59.4%), were retired (87.3%), and were educated at less than a high school level (67.5%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T2</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the clinical characteristics of the patients. Patients had a median illness duration of 3 years and were mainly in NYHA class II (49.5%), with a CCI mean (SD) score of 3.12 (2.08). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (73.4%), diabetes (40.2%), and atrial fibrillation (33.9%). The patients' mean (SD) score on the MoCA was 22.48 (6.10), indicating mild cognitive impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scales' Scores and Correlation Analysis</head><p>Caregivers reported a moderate level of preparedness at CPS (mean [SD], 2.11 [0.76]). The scores of the CC to self-care maintenance and management and caregiver confidence were 51.78, 51.18, and 57.24, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). As illustrated in T3 Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, CPS scores were significantly correlated with CC to self-care maintenance and management and caregiver confidence; CC to selfcare maintenance scores were significantly correlated with patient age, education, CCI scores, MoCA scores, and CPS scores; CC to self-care management scores were significantly correlated with patient age, patient months of illness, caregiver job, caregiver education, CPS scores, and CC to self-care and caregiver confidence was correlated with patient months of illness, CCI scores, caregiver job, caregiver education, CPS scores, and CC to self-care maintenance and management (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Testing</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F2</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the tested path analysis model that resulted with the following excellent fit indices: χ2 = 4.29 (9), P = .89; CFI, 1.00; Tucker-Lewis Index, 1.03; and RMSEA, 0.00 (90% confidence interval, 0.00-0.03); standardized root mean square residual, 0.01. In line with our hypotheses, higher CPS scores were associated with higher self-care confidence scores and higher CC to self-care maintenance scores, higher caregiver confidence scores were associated with higher CC to selfcare maintenance and management scores, and higher CC to self-care maintenance scores were associated with higher CC to self-care management scores. The tested model also showed significant relationships with the covariates that were specified in the model because of significant correlations with CC to self-care maintenance and management and caregiver confidence. Caregiver contributions to self-care maintenance were significantly influenced by CCI scores, CC to self-care management were significantly associated with months of illness, and, finally, caregiver confidence was significantly influenced by caregiver education and months of illness. All tested models explained 44% of the variance in caregiver confidence, 22% of the variance in CC to self-care maintenance, and 42% of the variance in CC to self-care management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Analysis</head><p>The mediation analysis is reported in T4 Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The total indirect effect of CPS to CC to self-care maintenance through caregiver confidence was positive and significant. This is evidence of a mediation of caregiver confidence between CPS and CC to self-care maintenance. The total indirect effect from CPS to CC to self-care management through caregiver confidence and CC to self-care maintenance was positive and significant as well. However, looking at the specific indirect effects, the only significant indirect effect was the one between CPS and CC to self-care management through caregiver confidence. The effect of CPS on CC to self-care management through CC to self-care maintenance and the effect of CPS through caregiver confidence and CC to self-care maintenance were not statistically significant. This is evidence of a meditation of caregiver confidence between CPS and CC to self-care management and that, despite CC to self-care maintenance influencing CC to self-care management, CC to self-care maintenance do Caregiver Confidence in CC to Self-care 5  not mediate between CPS, caregiver confidence, and CC to self-care management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we found that caregiver preparedness influenced CC to HF self-care maintenance and management, and this influence was mediated by caregiver confidence. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing these relationships, and these new findings may have important clinical and theoretical implications.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that caregiver preparedness is associated with better caregiver outcomes in other caregivers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">46</ref> but preparedness has received little attention in HF, despite an earlier qualitative work that we conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> showing that a lack of preparedness was an issue in this population. What the current study adds is that caregivers who felt more prepared also felt more confident in providing care. In turn, greater confidence was associated with greater self-care contributions. Interestingly, the mediation analysis evidenced that caregiver preparedness has both a direct and an indirect influence on CC to self-care maintenance but only an indirect influence on CC to self-care management. These findings might suggest that, in the case of CC to self-care maintenance, the more caregivers feel prepared, the more they believe to contribute to patient self-care maintenance both directly and through the effect of increased caregiver confidence. In the case of CC to self-care management, caregiver preparedness might improve CC to self-care management mainly through its positive effect on caregiver confidence.</p><p>It has been established over multiple studies that confidence predicts self-care behaviors (maintenance and management) in patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">47</ref> caregivers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and patient/ caregiver dyads. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">48</ref> Equally well established is the mediating role of self-care confidence between social support, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">49</ref> cognition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">50</ref> and comorbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">51</ref> and patient self-care. However, to our knowledge, authors of only 1 previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> found that caregiver confidence mediated the relationship between a predictor (HF knowledge, in this case) and CC to HF self-care. Here in our study, we suggest  that caregiver confidence mediates the relationship between preparedness and CC to self-care, suggesting that improving caregivers' preparedness, for example, through targeted education, could actually improve their behaviors in maintaining stable HF and dealing with symptoms also because it might create a feeling of confidence in contributing to patient self-care in caregivers. This finding is also meaningful from a motivational perspective, as caregiver preparedness is mainly cognitive, based on the caregiver's knowledge and skills regarding managing the patient with HF, whereas caregiver confidence is based on the caregiver's feelings about being able to manage the patient with HF. In this way, our findings indicate that knowledge and skills are not enough to foster confidence. Further research should deepen the motivational factors to promote confidence in caregivers and to empower them to care for patients with HF. However, although we found that caregiver confidence was a mediator between caregiver preparedness and CC to HF self-care, as argued by Hayes and Rockwood, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">52</ref> other variables could also affect the relationship between caregiver preparedness and CC to self-care. Thus, further research is needed.</p><p>In the path analysis model that we tested, CC to selfcare maintenance had a significant and direct effect on CC to self-care management. When we developed the Situation-Specific Theory of CC to HF Self-care, we hypothesized a relationship between the previously mentioned 2 dimensions, but we did not know in which direction. In this study, considering the self-care theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">53</ref> and the empirical evidence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">54</ref> we specified and found that CC to self-care maintenance influenced CC to selfcare management. This result strengthens the evidence that, for caregivers, as for patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> activities related to the maintenance of HF stability precede activities to deal with HF symptoms. However, considering the cross-sectional nature of our data, this finding should be considered with caution. Further longitudinal studies are needed to better investigate whether CC to selfcare maintenance influence CC to self-care management.</p><p>With all the limitations given by the cross-sectional nature of our data and the possible confounding of covariates with one another, our analysis showed interesting relationships with the covariates of the tested model. We found that CC to self-care maintenance were higher when the patient had more comorbidities. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing this relationship. This could be explained by the fact that more comorbidities in the patient could stimulate the caregiver to give more recommendations to the patient, because he or she experiences more conditions requiring attention. In addition, we found that better CC to self-care management were associated with more months of illness. There is no other evidence on this relationship in the literature, and our interpretation is that more months of illness could create more skills in caregivers on how to deal with patient symptoms. Finally, we found that caregiver confidence was better if caregivers were better educated and cared for patients affected by HF for more months. No authors of previous studies of HF have found a relationship between caregiver confidence and caregiver education, but authors of previous studies performed in other caregiver populations found that caregiver education influenced caregiver confidence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">56</ref> It could be that patients who have had HF for a longer duration have created, in the caregivers, a feeling of being more able to manage the self-care process.</p><p>This study has important clinical, theoretical, and research implications. The clinical implication is that, if we improve the preparedness and confidence of HF caregivers, they could contribute more effectively to HF self-care. Research on the outcomes of CC to HF selfcare is still scarce, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">57</ref> but in a previous study that we conducted, we showed that higher CC to self-care maintenance were a predictor of fewer patient clinical events (ie, hospitalizations, use of emergency services, and death). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> However, in the same study, we showed that higher CC to self-care management were associated with more clinical events, maybe because caregivers with higher scores in CC to self-care management deal with symptomatic patients who have worse conditions. More research is needed in this area, as CC to HF selfcare seem not to be burdensome for caregivers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">58</ref> and the Situation-Specific Theory of CC to HF Self-care can drive future research.</p><p>Another important implication of this study is in terms of theory development. In this study, we identified for the first time another caregiver-level factor influencing CC to HF self-care (ie, preparedness) and, for the second time, that caregiver confidence is a mediator in the process and that CC to self-care maintenance influence CC to self-care management. In terms of future research, through this study, we could inform future interventions aimed at improving CC to HF self-care. Because CC to HF self-care have great importanceespecially when the patient is unable to care for himself or herself-it is important to improve caregiver preparedness. However, in this study, we have also given evidence that caregiver preparedness could be useless if not associated with an intervention aimed at improving caregiver confidence.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, we used cross-sectional data that limit the causality among the variables and preclude the assessment of the temporal precedence that is implied by mediation. Second, we performed a secondary analysis with data collected on a convenience sample that was enrolled only in Italy. Third, because the CC to self-care management scale can be completed only if the caregiver reports that the patient had symptoms during the last month, our findings should be generalized with caution to caregivers reporting that their patients had no symptoms. Fourth, acquiescence response bias due to all positively worded items could have contributed to inflate correlations. Finally, in accordance with the MOTIVATE-HF research protocol, we enrolled only patients in NYHA classes II to IV. Consequently, generalization of our findings should be done with caution on patients in NYHA class I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, the initial hypotheses of our study were confirmed. Caregiver confidence may play a key role in CC self-care, as we found that it mediates the relationship between caregiver preparedness and CC to HF self-care maintenance and management. This new knowledge has important clinical, scientific, and theoretical implications in shaping the future of HF patient self-care and in supporting caregivers. Because caregivers have an important role in HF care, further studies on this population are important to safeguard their conditions and improve patient outcomes. What's New and Important?</p><p>▪ Informal caregivers of patients with HF who are more prepared to take care of their patients could be more confident to contribute to the self-care of patients with HF.</p><p>▪ Informal caregivers of patients with HF who have better confidence could contribute more to HF patient self-care maintenance (to maintain HF stability) and self-care management (to manage HF signs and symptoms of decompensation).</p><p>▪ Interventions to improve CC to HF self-care could be more effective if they improve also caregiver confidence.</p><p>Caregiver Confidence in CC to Self-care 9</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F1</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
