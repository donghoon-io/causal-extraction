<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Employee safety citizenship behaviors (SCBs) are crucial to risk management in safety-critical industries, and identifying ways to encourage them is a priority. This study examines i) whether SCBs are a product of social exchanges between employees and organizations, and ii) the organizational exchanges (i.e. actual activities to support employees) that underlie this relationship. We studied this in the offshore oil and gas industry, and investigated whether organizational activities for supporting workforce health are a signal to employees that the organization supports them, and an antecedent to SCBs. Using questionnaires, we collected data from employees (n=820) and medics (n=30) on 22 offshore installations. Multilevel path analysis found that where activities to support workforce health were greater, offshore employees were more likely to perceive their organization to support them, and in-turn report more commitment to the organization and SCBs. This indicates SCBs are a product of social exchange, and provides insight on how organizations can influence employee engagement in them. It also suggests social exchange theory as a useful framework for investigating how organizational safety is influenced by workforce relations. We contributed to the social exchange literature through conceptualizing and demonstrating how organizational exchanges lead to reciprocal employee citizenship behaviors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Safety citizenship behaviors (SCBs) refer to discretionary employee activities essential for managing risk in 'safety-critical' industries (where organizational performance depends upon safe operations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Didla et al., 2009)</ref>. Despite their importance, employee engagement in SCBs is inconsistent, and identifying ways to encourage them is a priority. Improving organizationalemployee relations is proposed as a potential solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Didla et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">DeJoy et al., 2010)</ref>, with social exchange research showing that employees who believe their organization to support them are more likely to engage in discretionary, extra-role, and unrewarded organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wayne et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002)</ref>. Such observations have led to questions on i) whether employee SCBs are also a product of social exchanges between organizations and employees (where they enter into voluntary, tacit, and ongoing reciprocation of resources), and if so ii) what types of organizational exchange (the resources shared by an organization with its employees) lead to reciprocal employee SCBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(DeJoy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mearns et al., 2010)</ref>? This latter question is fundamental to conceptualizing safety citizenship behavior as a product of social exchange, and highlights a research gap within the social exchange literature. Specifically, whilst social exchange research has shown OCBs to be a reciprocal response to employee perceptions of organizational support, little work has examined the concrete organizational exchanges that underlie this relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>This study investigates whether organizational activities to support workforce health in the offshore oil and gas industry are associated with employee engagement in SCBs. We conceptualize that, due to the risky and physically demanding nature of offshore work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(HSE, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">CAA, 2014)</ref>, organizational activities to support workforce health will constitute a form of 'organizational exchange' and will signal to employees that the organization supports them, leading to reciprocal SCBs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical framework</head><p>SCBs are discretionary and prosocial safety activities (e.g. reporting unsafe behavior, suggesting safety improvements) essential to safety management due to their importance for managing risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Conchie and Donald, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hoffman et al., 2003)</ref>. Safety-critical organizations have typically relied on safety messaging to encourage employee participation in SCBs (e.g. emphasizing their importance). Yet, due to SCBs being discretionary and often unrewarded, such methods can be ineffective in motivating sustained employee engagement in them (e.g. staff can become weary of messaging). Instead, and drawing on social exchange theory, it is proposed that SCBs may be a reciprocal response to feeling cared for by an organization, and that improving organizational-workforce relations is a way to motivate employee engagement in SCBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(DeJoy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Didla et al., 2009)</ref>. This resonates with a growing literature theorizing employee safety activities to be a product of organizational practices indirectly related to safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hollnagel, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Turner and Gray, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Probst et al., 2013)</ref>. From this perspective, organizational practices on workforce relations and human resource management (e.g. job security, reward systems) are intertwined with safety management through shaping employee' attitudes towards the organization (i.e. on their treatment), and their consequent motivation to engage in safety behaviors. To examine this in the current study, we conceptualize SCBs as a product of social exchange, and do this through reflecting on the social exchange and OCB literature.</p><p>Social exchange theory has been extensively used to understand workplace behavior, and draws on a diverse range of disciplines, including social psychology, anthropology, sociology, and economics. Social exchange relationships are described as ongoing reciprocal exchanges of resources (e.g. services, care, money) between two parties, with exchanges being inter-dependent and generative of future obligations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Foa and Foa, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blau, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Homans, 1958)</ref>. Social exchange relationships do not involve explicit bargaining or a priori specification, and instead encompass discretionary cooperative behaviors that lead to the development of trusting and committed long-term relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Molm, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Social exchange theory has been applied extensively to explain why employees undertake organizational citizenship behaviors, from which the concept of safety citizenship derives.</p><p>Research shows that employees who have positive "perceived organizational support" are more likely to feel committed to their organization, and engage in OCBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wayne et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Loi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Podsakoff et al., 2000)</ref>. This is explained as a reciprocal response by employees to organizational activities for improving their organizational environment (e.g. fairness, resources) and social context (e.g. leadership, trust) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zagenczyk et al., 2010)</ref>. Yet, studies have tended to only examine OCBs as a reciprocal response to employee beliefs about exchange relationships with organizations (e.g. perceived organizational support, or assessments of organizational policies), and not the actual 'organizational exchanges' (i.e. resources shared with employees) that underlie beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eisenberger et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Butts et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005)</ref>. Demonstrating that organizational exchange activities lead to citizenship behavior is fundamental to the notion that OCBs and SCBs are a product of social exchange, and is important for operationalizing how organizations might motivate employee SCBs.</p><p>To achieve this, further consideration is required of how 'organizational exchanges' lead to reciprocal employee citizenship behaviors. Because employee OCBs are a form of pro-social behavior that cannot be contracted or negotiated, they are conceptualized as being a response to social (e.g. providing services, care and support) rather than economical exchanges (e.g. pay) by an organization towards its workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005)</ref>. This draws on a 'signaling' perspective <ref type="bibr">(Spence, 1973)</ref>, where employees interpret organizational activities that support workers (e.g. training, workplace conditions, enabling performance) as a signal of the values and motives of the organization towards them (e.g. long-term commitment), which leads to positive perceived organizational support and reciprocal acts of citizenship <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Suazo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Coyle-Shapiro and Conway, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eisenberger et al., 2004)</ref>. In particular, organizational context is likely an important factor for determining the types of organizational activities that 'signal' organizational support. For example, organizational activities that address the specific challenges faced by workers in a given industry (e.g. work-life balance, information needs, trust in management) clearly demonstrate the organization's (e.g. management) attitude and responsiveness to the concerns of employees, and thus are likely to increase perceived organizational support and reciprocal citizenship behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bergeron et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McNall and Roch, 2009)</ref>. Research supports this perspective, for example studies in the creative industries show that employee perceptions of organizational acts to support creativity (e.g. ensuring access to information, treating new ideas openly) underlie perceived organizational support and willingness to engage in citizenship behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Khazanchi and Masterson, 2011)</ref>. Thus, for an organizational exchange to influence employee perceived organizational support (and lead to reciprocal commitment and SCBs), it must concretely address the needs of employees, and these needs are likely shaped by the context (e.g. industry) of work.</p><p>The current study examines this proposition in the safety-critical offshore oil and gas industry. Because work is physically challenging in this industry, we hypothesize that organizational activities to support workforce health will 'signal' to employees that their organization cares for them, and lead to reciprocal employee commitment to the organization and SCBs. The purpose of exploring this is to advance both the occupational safety and social exchange literatures. On the former, we test whether SCBs are a product of social exchange between employees and organizations. The aim is to provide insight on how organizations can motivate employee engagement in behaviors critical for risk management, with social exchange theory being proposed as a framework through which to conceptualize how organizational practices on workforce relations and human resource management influence safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Parker et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nahrgang et al., 2011)</ref>. In terms of the social exchange literature, by showing SCBs and OCBs to be a consequence of organizational exchanges, we conceptualize and demonstrate how organizational exchanges influence employee citizenship behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety citizenship behavior as a product of social exchange</head><p>Below we outline our hypotheses and conceptual model for examining whether SCBs are an outcome of social exchange relationships (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE</head><p>Initially, for organizational exchanges to lead to SCBs through a social exchange model, they must first be interpreted as a signal by employees that the organization supports them. In identifying which activities might achieve this, understanding the context of work appears critical.</p><p>As discussed in the previous section, the organizational exchanges that are likely to influence perceived organizational support are intertwined with the challenges facing a workforce, and the extent to which organizational activities address these. This likely depends on the characteristics of an industry and workforce, and, in specifying the organizational exchanges that might enhance perceptions of organizational support (and influence SCBs), it is important to identify pressing employee needs that the organization can address. For example, in the current study, we focus on the offshore oil and gas industry. This is a sector where employees are generally well-paid, educated, and have relatively high job-security, and thus can be argued to have quite good working conditions. Nonetheless, challenges remain. In particular, employees live on remote 'installations', and declining workforce health (e.g. aging workforce, increasing obesity, occupational illnesses due to long service) has become a major concern to employees and employers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(HSE, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">CAA, 2014)</ref>. Organizational activities to support and improve workforce health -for example health screening or providing healthy food -are voluntary (i.e. not regulated or mandated), and have little immediate or direct benefit to organizations, and thus might be conceptualized as a form of exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(HSE, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mearns and Hope, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Hypotheses H1a and H1b test this, and examine whether employees working on offshore oil rigs acknowledge and positively perceive the influence of organizational activities to support their health. The purpose of such activities is to improve the physical and mental well-being of employees, and we focus on these because in the context of offshore oil and gas they address a need of employees (and signal the care of the organization for its employees) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mearns and Hope, 2005)</ref>. Hypothesis 1a examines whether employee assessments of health-support facilities are more positive on offshore oil and gas platforms (installations) that engage in greater activities to support workforce health (e.g. stress management, supplying healthy food). Hypothesis 1b examines whether employee assessments of health-support facilities are associated with perceived organizational support for health, thus indicating employees to perceive such activities as a signal that the organization cares for their well-being (H1b). We hypothesize:</p><p>Hypothesis 1a: Organizational activities to support workforce health will be positively associated with employee assessments of health-support facilities.</p><p>Hypothesis 1b: Employee assessments of health-support facilities will be positively associated with employee perceived organizational support for health.</p><p>Hypothesis 2a-2f examine whether perceived organizational support for health is antecedent to SCBs.</p><p>Hypotheses 2a and 2b examine a direct relationship between employee perceived organizational support for health and employee citizenship, with the literature suggesting perceived organizational support for health is associated with employee safety attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Basen-Engquist et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ribisl and Reischl, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Colley et al., 2013)</ref>. The mechanisms linking perceptions of organizational support for health and SCBs are somewhat basic, and relate to a direct form of reciprocation whereby perceived organizational support for health results in reciprocal employee citizenship activities. Thus, we explore a direct relationship between perceived organizational support for health and safety citizenship behaviors (H2a). Furthermore, because employees who perceive an organization to care for their health also tend to show enhanced work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jones et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wilson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Browne, 2000)</ref>, it is expected that perceived organizational support for health is also associated with OCBs (H2b), which has not been examined within the literature. We hypothesize: Hypothesis 2a: Employee perceived organizational support for health will be positively associated with engagement in safety citizenship behavior. Hypothesis 2b: Employee perceived organizational support for health will be positively associated with engagement in organizational citizenship behavior.</p><p>Next, and utilizing the social exchange mechanism commonly used to predict OCBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Loi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Organ and Ryan, 1995)</ref>, hypotheses 2c-2f test an indirect relationship between organizational support for health and employee SCBs. To do this, it is first necessary to show that perceived organizational support for health leads to positive perceived organizational support (from herein indicated by '(general)'). As previously discussed, research shows perceived organizational support (general) to be shaped by employee assessments of organizational activities for supporting the workforce (e.g. work-life balance), with such activities being a signal to employees that the organization supports them. Thus, it might be expected that perceived organizational support for health is positively associated with perceived organizational support (general) (H2c). Furthermore, and replicating previous research on social exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Organ et al., 2006)</ref>, we expect employee perceived organizational support (general) to subsequently be positively associated with commitment to the organization (H2d). Finally, and to complete the social exchange model, we examine whether high employee commitment to the organization is associated with greater engagement in SCBs.</p><p>(H2e). In order to test whether organizational exchanges are also an antecedent to OCBs, we aim to replicate the finding that organizational commitment and OCBs are associated (H2f). Thus we hypothesize:</p><p>Hypothesis 2c: Employee perceived organizational support for health will be positively associated with perceived organizational support (general). Hypothesis 2d. Employee perceived organizational support (general) will be positively associated with commitment to the organization. Hypothesis 2e. Employee commitment to the organization will be positively associated with safety citizenship behavior. Hypothesis 2f. Employee commitment to the organization will be positively associated with organizational citizenship behavior.</p><p>The final set of hypotheses (H3a-H3c) relate to the influence of organizational activities to support workforce health upon actual employee health, and the potential influence of this upon SCBs. Organizational practices for supporting employee health have been shown to influence the well-being of employees and in-turn productivity, absenteeism, lawsuits, and staff turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aldana, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grawitch et al., 2006)</ref>. Thus, organizational activities to support workforce health might be expected to be positively associated with actual employee health (H3a). Furthermore, good employee health is shown to influence the mental well-being of workers (e.g. happiness, motivation), and workers' ability to manage job demands, willingness to engage in citizenshiplike activities, involvement in safety incidents, and attitudes towards safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goetzel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nahrgang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clarke, 2010</ref>). An explanation for this relationship between employee health and job performance is that employee health influences the motivation and ability of workers to cope with the physical and cognitive demands of safety-critical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sparks et al., 2001)</ref>. Therefore, it might be expected that good employee health is associated with greater engagement in SCBs and OCBs (H3b-H3c). We hypothesize: Hypothesis 3a. Organizational activities to support workforce health will be positively associated with employee health Hypothesis 3b. Employee health will be positively associated with engagement in safety citizenship behavior. Hypothesis 3c. Employee health will be positively associated with engagement in organizational citizenship behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and procedure</head><p>Data were collected from employees on 22 installations (Fixed Production platforms, drilling rigs, floating production storage and offloading vessels) in the UK North Sea. Hard-copy questionnaires were distributed to permanent operational staff on participating installations over an 8-week period. The questionnaires were distributed by installation medics (responsible for the health of offshore staff), who received a survey pack (with questionnaires, instructions, promotional materials) and training on introducing and disseminating the surveys to crew members. Independent data on organizational investment in health was collected through a second questionnaire that was completed by the medics on each installation.</p><p>In total 820 offshore employees responded from 22 installations. Installations varied in size in terms of employees working on them (from 100 to 350), and the mean response rate was 28.5% (with an average of 35 respondents per installations), but varied considerably (10.3% to 94%). In terms of medics, 30 responded to the survey (as there are two medics on each installation), with an overall response rate of 68%. The response patterns to the survey were not untypical for research in offshore locations, where workers have unusual operating patterns (e.g. rotations, night shifts). Of the operating staff, at least 75% had an operational role (e.g. drilling or maintenance crews), and 81% of crew had worked on their installation for more than one year. Ten percent of crew were aged 20-31, 27% were 31-40, 37% were 41-50, and 26% were over 50. Data on gender were not collected, as female staff are a small minority of offshore crew, and thus identifiable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Two surveys were utilized in this study, one for installation employees and one for medics. For installation medics, it was necessary to develop a new survey scale (as there was no existing measure) of organizational activities to support workforce health on offshore installations (please see Appendix 1 for this and the other newly developed scales). For installations where two medic questionnaires were returned, the final score was their average for this scale. For installation employees, a new set of survey scales were developed to measure how and whether employees perceived organizational activities to support their health. The 'employee assessments of health-support facilities' scale focused on employee beliefs about the facilities for supporting their health on their installation. Furthermore, measures of 'perceived organizational support for health' and 'employee health' were developed. All new scales were developed using a bottom-up process (i.e. with the HSE, installation medics, safety managers), and were informed by existing survey scales on health climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Basen-Engquist et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eisenberger et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Golaszewksi and Fisher, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ribisl and Reischl, 1993)</ref>. All other survey scales (perceived organizational support (general); commitment to the organization; safety citizenship behavior; organizational citizenship behavior) were based on reliable and valid existing measures, and source references are reported in table 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 1 HERE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>In order to conduct the multilevel analysis, a hierarchical data set was created by matching the medics' answers describing the facilities for supporting employee health at an installation to the employees' answers from that installation. We then examined the association between the facilities available for supporting employee health, and the employee assessment of those facilities (and organizational support for health) alongside their responses to the other psychometric dimensions measured in the questionnaire.</p><p>The analysis was carried out in two steps. First, an observed variable was calculated for each of the constructs in the model. For organizational activities to support workforce health (which was measured in the medics survey) and for employee health this variable was a sumscore index, as explained in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and Appendix 1. For the rest of the constructs, the factorial structure of the scales used to measure them in the workforce questionnaire was inspected separately for each scale, using initially Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) for new scales and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for existing scales. Factor scores from the final measurement models were then derived for each of the variables to serve as data in the next step of the analysis. Second, using these variables, all hypotheses were tested simultaneously in a multilevel path analysis model to examine both within-and between-installation relationships.</p><p>The analyses were carried out using the MPlus 7.3.1 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Muthén and Muthén, 2012)</ref>. Prior to conducting these analyses we examined the potential associations of age with the variables of the model, and found all of them to be uncorrelated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>i) Establishing measurement models</head><p>For the employee assessment of health-support facilities scale, EFA was performed in order to examine whether particular items grouped together due to underlying common factors.</p><p>An EFA with maximum likelihood and orthogonal rotation method revealed a three-factor model that explained 44.5% of the initial variance, with six items being removed due to low factor loadings (&lt; .40). The scales were thematically labelled i) managing personal health (3 items; For the other scales in the questionnaire, we tested one-factor models using CFA. For each of the scales used in the study, we report below on the CFA data, the χ2 test statistic of overall goodness of fit and its p-value, RMSEA, and CFI (all adjusted for clustering of individuals within installations, as explained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Muthén and Satorra 1995)</ref>, as well as the scale internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha). Means and standard deviations (SD) are also reported.</p><p>Conventional guidelines for these statistics suggest that a model fits well if Comparative Fit Index (CFI) exceeds .93 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne, 1994)</ref> and RMSEA is less than .08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Browne and Cudeck, 1993)</ref> and ideally less than .05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Steiger, 1990)</ref>. For Cronbach's Alpha, the widely accepted cutoff point for good scale reliability is .70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. Assessment of the measurement models revealed a moderate to good fit for each of the scales, with some variation depending on which statistic we focus on (with the fit being typically more satisfactory according to CFI and Cronbach's Alpha than RMSEA). The statistics for the perceived organizational support (general) scale were: Alpha=.93; χ2( <ref type="formula">104</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> (the latter including also the measures of organizational support and employee health, which were defined as number of positive responses to a set of items, rather than from factor analyses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 2 HERE</head><p>The factor analyses examined the measurement properties by using full-information maximum likelihood estimation, using all observed items for a given scale for each respondent. The factor scores derived from the analyses were then defined unless a respondent answered none of the questions for a scale. All the scores were thus calculated for 809 of the 820 individual respondents. However, because data from the medic questionnaire was not obtained from 2 installations, the 41 individuals from these installations were omitted from the next stage of the analysis, leaving data from 768 individuals from 20 installations (mean=38, SD=19).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ii) Multi-level path analysis</head><p>A multi-level path analysis model was fitted to estimate the model outlined in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>All study hypotheses were tested within this model, and the results for them are reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The model consisted of a cumulative sequence of multilevel (random intercepts) linear models for the variables shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, in the order of the blocks of the variables shown there (with employee health included in the same block as the three measures of employee assessment of health-support facilities, and these four conditional on organizational activities to support workforce health and conditionally associated with each other). In the model for each response variable, all variables in all preceding blocks were included as explanatory variables, and only those coefficients that corresponded to the research hypotheses are shown explicitly in the Figures and Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The random effects (random intercepts) of the multilevel models are included in order to allow for possible residual correlations resulting from clustering of individuals within installations. The random effects for the three measures of employee assessment of health-support facilities were allowed to correlate, while all other correlations between the random effects were clearly nonsignificant and were omitted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We discuss the implications of the study findings in the sections below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social exchange and occupational safety</head><p>For the first time, safety citizenship behaviors are shown to be an outcome of social exchange, with organizational activities to support workforce health being an antecedent to this relationship. Although our findings are associative, they contribute to a body of research showing that employee safety practices are associated with aspects of human resource management and workforce relations (e.g. use of temporary workers, lean production, job security, communication quality, employee satisfaction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fabiano et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Longoni et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Parker et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Probst et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nahrgang et al., 2011)</ref>. Such effects have been explained variously, for example, job insecurity reduces knowledge and motivation for reporting safety incidents. Crucially, through utilizing social exchange theory and evidencing organizational support for workforce health to be antecedent to safety citizenship, we suggest a framework through which to conceptualize how organizational practices on workforce relations influence safety. This builds on work arguing that organizational safety is intertwined with seemingly unrelated aspects of organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hollnagel, 2014)</ref>. It implies that workforce relations and human resources strategies are integral to effective safety management, with employee safety behaviors being a response to beliefs about treatment by their organization.</p><p>Extending this perspective, we can explore how other aspects of workforce management (e.g. training opportunities, procedural justice, fair reward systems) influence SCBs (i.e. through influencing employee perceived organizational support). Conversely, practices that do not signal perceived organizational support to employees (e.g. short-term contracts, job insecurity, poor support for well-being), might be expected to negatively influence safety behaviors.</p><p>Furthermore, where organizations are engaging in good practices to support their workforce, ensuring their employees are aware of this is crucial to influence SCBs.</p><p>Finally, this study draws novel associations between the concepts of occupational 'health' and 'safety'. Traditionally, interactions between the two have focused on how employee health is influenced by safety management. For example, the administration of personal protective equipment (e.g. hard hats to avoid personal injury), development of safety protocols (e.g. to avoid accidents during maintenance routines), and design of safe equipment (e.g. to reduce occupational illnesses) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Zanko and Dawson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mearns and Hope, 2005)</ref>. As an alternative, we examined whether employee health influences safety, and a relationship was found between employee health and safety citizenship (but not organizational activities to support health). This relationship might be explained by the influence of employee health (i.e. physical and mental well-being) upon performance through its effect on the cognitive (i.e. motivation, satisfaction) and physical (i.e. energy) abilities of employees. To examine these relationships, a number of new measures were developed, and they might be utilized to conduct further research within this domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social exchange and employee citizenship</head><p>Alongside indicating SCBs as a product of social exchange between organizations and employees, the current study addresses a research gap within the social exchange literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Molm, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005)</ref>. It does this by testing a more comprehensive social exchange model, whereby the influence of actual organizational exchanges upon employee citizenship behaviors was examined. Specifically, based on social exchange research, organizational exchanges were conceptualized as social (e.g. care and support, training) that lead to various forms of reciprocal behaviors from employees. This has not previously been shown, and we tested this through examining the influence upon SCBs and OCBs of activities for supporting workforce health within the offshore oil and gas sector. Through adopting a multilevel design, we found that where organizations engage in more activities to support workforce health (e.g. investing in a high-quality diet), their employees are more likely to engage in SCBs and OCBs. This augments research showing that OCBs are a reciprocal response to perceived organizational support, and indicates concrete organizational exchanges to underlie this relationship. The multilevel path analysis found the social exchange mechanism to account almost entirely for the influence of organizational exchanges upon SCBs and OCBs. Yet, whilst the general reciprocity mechanism that underlies employee OCBs and SCBs might remain constant (i.e. perceived organizational support and reciprocal employee organizational commitment and OCBs: <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wayne et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002)</ref>, the organizational exchanges that drive this are likely to be specific to the needs of organization and employees. For example, in the offshore environment, health is issue of concern for many employees, who rely considerably upon the installation for supporting their well-being (e.g. providing healthy and high-quality meals, managing stress). Future research may wish to further investigate how the organizational activities that underpin such exchanges are influenced by the characteristics of an industry (e.g. knowledge industries, academia), and the needs of employees within that domain (e.g. job security, recognition of work). This reflects calls to better understand how organizations elicit and sustain reciprocal exchanges with employees, and also the multidimensionality of citizenship behaviors and their antecedents <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marinova et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>It also leads to a key practical implication from the study. In the context of offshore oil and gas, supporting employee health appears a potentially fruitful approach for developing positive perceived organizational support and reciprocal SCBs. This is due to the health challenges faced by employees, the importance of health for good performance, the ability of organizations to concretely address this issue, and the relatively good working conditions of offshore employees (e.g. employees are already well-paid). In some safety-critical industries, for example aviation (where fatigue is a major issue), activities to support employee health may also lead to improved employee perceptions of organizational support and SCB. However, in other domains (e.g. healthcare), investing in employee health may not have the same impact as in offshore environments (as it is perhaps not such a key issue to employees, and harder for organizations to influence), and employees may have differing challenges that have greater priority (e.g. work-life balance). Ensuring that organizational activities to improve workforce relations address issues that have both symbolic and instrumental value (i.e. that an issue of importance is addressed in a way that is useful) to employees is critical if they are to be successful, and this can only be achieved through considering the organizational context.</p><p>Practically, this involves a level of 'diagnosis' to understand the challenges and needs facing employees within a given industry, the ability of the organization to address them, and the likely short and long-term impact upon employee attitudes towards the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>A number of study limitations require consideration.</p><p>First, although the relationship between organizational safety outcomes and investment in workplace health has been explored previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mearns et al., 2010)</ref>, objective safety data was not collected. Furthermore, we could not assess whether organizational activities to support workforce health predicted safety citizenship, and a longitudinal design is required to do this.</p><p>Second, the relationship between organizational activities to support workforce health was only significant for one of the employee assessment of health-support facilities scales. This may be because employees do not perceive the organizational activities to support health, or have pre-existing high expectations on the services provided by the organization (e.g. providing a gym). In addition, no direct relationship was found between perceived organizational support for health and OCBs and SCBs, with the relationship being explained only by the social exchange mechanism. Also, organizational activities to support workforce health and employee health were not associated, and this may be due to limitations in the sensitivity of our measures (e.g. on health, which focused on crude measures such as BMI).</p><p>Third, whilst the data was multi-level in nature (collected from both offshore workers and medics), it was cross-sectional. Data were collected and matched from two independent sources, and standard psychometric scales were applied, alongside new measurements. Yet, these measures were self-report, which created the possibility for social desirability effects and common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. In particular, the measurement of organizational exchange relied on installation medics reporting on organizational health support activities, and these were not validated.</p><p>Finally, the multi-level path analysis was performed on a relatively low number of analytical units <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Maas and Hox, 2005)</ref>. On the level of installations, having data only from 20 of them reduces the statistical power for testing those hypotheses which concern installation-level variables, so increasing the number of installations represented should be a priority in future research. On the level of individuals, response rates were low in some locations, and this might be accounted for by various reasons (e.g. lack of organizational commitment to supporting the research). Nonetheless a successful measurement model was established through CFA. Future research may wish to use alternative data collection methods, such as employee performance data and objective safety data, or real-time metrics of health behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study demonstrated that organizational activities to support workforce health are antecedents to employee safety citizenship behaviors, and this was explained by a social exchange theory. This contributes to the occupational safety literature by demonstrating and providing a framework through which to understand how organizational practices related to workforce management impact upon safety. In addition, we contributed to the social exchange literature through conceptualizing and illustrating how organizational exchanges influence reciprocal employee OCBs and SCBs, with the types of organizational exchanges likely to encourage citizenship being specific to the industry and needs of a workforce.    To ascertain the level of health support provided by offshore installations to their employees, installation medics indicated no (0) or yes (1) as to whether the following had been provided in the past 12 months, or were currently in place.</p><p>The scale was developed with the HSE and installation medics, and scores were calculated through adding up the number of positive responses to each question.
