<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Influence paths and transboundary impacts of green finance on sustainable development goals across China: a mediating effect and spatial econometric analysis Abstract: Sustainable development is a global consensus, and green finance is considered to have important impact on the sustainable development. However, there is limited research exploring the influence paths and transboundary impacts of green finance on the sustainable development. In this study, we developed an assessment system for green finance (GF) and sustainable development goals (SDGs) and used China's provincial panel data over the period 2008-2020. We utilized the panel data model, mediating effect model, and spatial Durbin model to examine the effect, influence paths, and transboundary impacts of green finance on the SDGs. Our findings reveal that GF has a significantly positive influence on the SDGs. GF promotes the SDGs by adjusting the industrial structure, promoting green innovation, and reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Notably, the positive effect of GF on the SDGs has prominent differences in eastern, central and western China, and the establishment of a green finance system significantly strengthens the effect. Furthermore, we found that the synergistic effect of GF in peripheral provinces contribute to SDGs progress of local provinces, especially in eastern region and the period over 2016-2020. This study provides valuable insights for the world to develop green finance and achieve sustainable development.</p></div>

The accompanying rapid consumption of various resources and air pollution have increased pressure on sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Razzaq et al., 2021)</ref>. Challenges such as overpopulation, industrial development, urbanization, and climate changes are faced by countries worldwide. For instance, the rise in global temperatures has caused profound changes to the humankind and natural system, including the extreme weathers such as drought and flood, rise in sea level, and biodiversity loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(D'Orazio, 2022)</ref>. Therefore, addressing environmental problems and achieving sustainable development have become urgent global issues. At the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, 193 member countries of the UN officially proposed 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) aimed at adopting systematic and comprehensive approaches to address and solve the developmental issues in society, economy, and environment from 2015 to 2030 as well as augment economy and society to embark on a sustainable development path. Achieving these 169 goals by 2030 is essential for sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pizzi et al., 2020)</ref> . Since then, global sustainable development governance has entered a new chapter.</p><p>The global community recognizes the importance of developing green finance (GF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Afzal A et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ronaldo and Suryanto, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wang et al., 2022a)</ref>, climate financing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bertilsson, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zhang et al., 2019)</ref>, and green funds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ghoul and Karoui, 2021)</ref> to promote sustainable development. GF is very important to promote the sustainable development, which is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on financing the green economy and the combination of financial and environmental protection industries, involving various stakeholders <ref type="bibr">(Cowan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wang and Zhi, 2016)</ref>. Unlike the traditional financial activities, GF prioritizes the ecological environment and environmental protection industry's benefits. Green finance has gained widespread attention and popularity as a crucial tool for achieving the SDGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Afzal et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ronaldo and Suryanto, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wang et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Yang et al.,2023b)</ref>. Paris held the first "One Planet Summit" in 2017. It received support from central banks worldwide and the global financial industry to promote the adoption of ecological financing products. The Green Climate Fund, which supports green projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is crucial for funding such initiatives. Initiated by the UN, the World Bank, and France, the Summit has been held four times and has focused on global climate and environmental governance. To help underdeveloped countries cope with climate changes, the Spanish government would increase half of its donation to the Green Climate Fund in 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wang et al., 2022a)</ref>. The key of GF is the balance of economic activities and the natural environment, which is essential for achieving SDGs. This is achieved by allocating idle capital to kinds of industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yuan and Gallagher, 2018)</ref>, which reflects the "greenness" of GF.</p><p>Numerous studies have extensively investigated the influence of GF on single aspect of SDGs, such as protecting environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Scholtens, 2006)</ref>, promoting energy transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Orzechowski and Bombol, 2022)</ref>, reducing carbon emission and climate changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Xing et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhang et al., 2022b)</ref>, or alleviating poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jiang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wang et al., 2022b)</ref>, education <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ma, 2022)</ref>. Green finance can mitigate energy poverty and boost sustainable energy development <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hou et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Orzechowski and Bombol, 2022)</ref>. Additionally, green finance can indirectly influence sustainable development goals by impacting the industrial structure <ref type="bibr">(Ip et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ning, 2019)</ref>, boosting the green innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Zhang et al., 2022b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xiong and Dai, 2023)</ref>, reducing the consumption scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cui et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu and Tang, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2022)</ref> and carbon dioxide emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lin et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Xu and Zhu, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Su et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hassan et al., 2022)</ref>. Meanwhile, previous studies focused on the spillover effect of green finance on the environment, energy and economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Khan et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li and Gan, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhang and Mei, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zhou and Tang, 2022)</ref>. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the effect of green finance on the SDGs, as well as the influence paths and transboundary impacts of GF on the SDGs.</p><p>To address these knowledge gap, we utilized the panel data model, mediating effect model and spatial Durbin model to investigate the impact of green finance on the SDGs and its transboundary impacts across China. We propose a research framework of this study, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the positive effect of GF on the SDGs, which can inform governmental policies aimed at strengthening sub-goals with a higher impact and finding appropriate solutions for sub-goals with a weaker impact. Additionally, by evaluating the transboundary impacts, we can well understand how green finance impacts the SDG progress of adjacent regions. This information is crucial for both China's sustainable development path and the global development of green finance. (<ref type="url" target="https://thenounproject.com">https://thenounproject.com</ref>). Seventeen SDG icons are from <ref type="url" target="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment">https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment</ref>. China has a high speed growth in economy since 1978 (reform and opening up policy), making it the world's second-largest economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Li et al., 2016)</ref>. However, this economic growth has come at a cost: China is now the largest energy-consuming and carbon-emitting country in this planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Xu, 2018)</ref>, with over 50% of energy consumption coming from coal. The burning of coal results in the emission of harmful pollutants, such as SO2 and nitric oxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bi et al., 2014)</ref>, which would pollute the environment and damage to public health <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wei et al., 2014)</ref>. Finding ways to achieve sustainable development while continuing to promote economic growth has been one of China's biggest challenges. To this end, China has implemented a series of policies to promote sustainable development. Chinese green finance system was established in 2005, and in 2016, a green finance policy system was put in place. China is the global leader in the development of green finance now. In 2021, the balance of green loans in local and foreign currencies in China was 15.9 trillion yuan, making it the largest in the world. Analyzing the impact of China's GF on the SDGs can provide valuable reference for other countries to develop their own sustainable finance systems.</p><p>This study aims to address the following research questions: (1) Does green finance in China promote the SDGs progress? (2) Does the impact of green finance on sustainable development vary across different periods and regions? (3) What are the influence paths of green finance on sustainable development? (4) Does green finance exhibit spatial spillover effects? To answer these questions, we collected data from 30 provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) of China between 2008 and 2020 and calculate the sustainable development and green finance indices of each province by entropy method. Subsequently, we used a panel data model to analyze the impact of green finance on the SDGs, and explored the differences in impact across various time periods and regions. We used the stepwise test regression coefficient method and Sobel test to identify the influence paths of green finance on the SDGs. We also employed a spatial Durbin model to evaluate the spatial spillover effect of green finance on the SDGs.</p><p>The contributions to the literature on the GF and SDGs are manifold. First, we construct a panel data model and conduct a comprehensive assessment of the effects of GF on the SDGs. Second, we utilize the meditating effect model to explore the influence paths of green finance on the SDGs, and extend the literature on influence paths of GF on the SDGs (i.e. how does GF impact the SDGs). Finally, we build a spatial econometric model to analyze the spillover effect of GF on the SDGs, and discuss the transboundary impacts of GF on the SDGs and then decomposed the direct and indirect effects of GF on the SDGs.</p><p>The rest of the article is arranged as follows. Section 2 presents the models and data, including the model setting, variables selection, and data. Section 3 presents the results, including the baseline regression result analysis, robustness test, heterogeneity analysis, mediating effect analysis, and spatial spillover effect analysis. Section 4 presents the discussions. Section 5 presents the conclusions and policy suggestions. </p></div>

Specifically, for the SDGs integrated from 17 subgoals (n = 390), the influence coefficient is 0.9398 (P＜0.01), indicating a significant positive influence of GF on the SDGs. The coefficients of RD (0.0061, P＜0.01), TECH (0.1992, P＜0.05), FDI (0.8791, P＜0.01), UBR (5.4215, P＜0.01) are all positive, which means that the more human capital, scientific investment, foreign investment and higher urbanization, the better for the increase of sustainable development. However, the coefficient of MRC (-0.6770, P＜0.1) is negative, which means less macro control can make better SDGs. The positive effect of PGDP on SDGs is not significant. </p></div>

After introducing the variable of industrial structure, the green finance coefficient decreases from 0.9398 to 0.7017, with a significance level of 1%, indicating that green finance affects sustainable development through industrial structure via an indirect pathway. The influence coefficient of this mediation effect is 0.2381 (0.1371*1.7367), with an explanatory power of 25.34% (0.2381/0.9398). After introducing the variable of green innovation, the green finance coefficient decreases from 0.9398 to 0.8415, with a significance level of 1%, indicating an indirect pathway for green finance to influence sustainable development through green innovation. The influence of this mediation effect is 0.0983 (1316.0744*0.0001), with an explanatory power of 10.46% (0.0983/0.9398). After the variable of energy consumption scale is introduced, the green finance coefficient reduces from 0.9398 to 0.8606, with a significance level of 1%. This suggests an indirect pathway for green finance to impact sustainable development through the energy consumption scale, with an influence coefficient of this mediating effect 0.0792 (-1.5782*(-0.0502)). The proportion of indirect effect in direct effect is 8.43% (0.0792/0.9398). After the variable of CO2 emission is introduced, the green finance coefficient reduces from 0.9398 to 0.7305, with a significance level of 1%. The indirect effect of CO2 emission is 0.2093 (-60.7964*(-0.0034)). The proportion of indirect effect in direct effect is 22.27% (0.2093/0.9398). In addition, we conducted a Sobel test to accurately identify the mediating effect of the variables and confirmed that the P value of statistics is smaller than 0.05, consistent with the conclusion reached in the stepwise test of regression coefficients. (1) Spatial model specification Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> displays the results of Moran's index analysis on the relationship between GF and the SDGs from 2008 to 2020. The results show that Moran's I index for GF and the majority of the SDGs are significantly positive, implying a strong spatial autocorrelation. During this period, the Moran's I index of the SDGs exhibited an increasing trend, while the Moran's I index for GF continued to decline. This suggests that the spatial spillover effect of the SDGs continued to increase while that of GF continued to decrease.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> shows the results of LM, Wald, LR and Hausman tests. Except the Hausman test, all results were significant at a level at least 10%, implying that the SDM with a random effect is suitable for studying the transboundary impacts. (2) Impact of transboundary interactions on SDG progress The interactions between the provinces across China generate synergistic effects to promote each other's SDG progress (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The spatial autocorrelation parameter for total samples is 0.1941 and statistically significant at 1% level, which suggests that at 10% increase in the SDG progress in adjacent provinces can cause 1.941% increase in focal provinces. The SDG progress is not only influenced by the focal province but also by the adjacent provinces. If the parameter is negative, it means that the peripheral provinces generate trade-off effects which decrease the SDGs progress of focal province. However, our results show that China's sustainable development is a multi-win process, and the significant synergistic effect leading to a good cooperation on the way toward sustainable development.</p><p>(3) Transboundary impacts of GF on SDG progress The green finance in peripheral provinces can effectively boost the development of SDGs in local province at 1% significant level (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). In total samples, a 10% increase of GF in peripheral provinces can contribute to 1.055% progress of SDGs in focal province. The indirect effect (0.1055, P &lt; 0.01) is higher than direct effect (0.0402, P &lt; 0.05). So, the development of GF in peripheral areas is more important than that in local area in promoting the local SDG progress, and the stronger the adjacent GF is, the better the focal SDG progress will be.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> Parameter estimation results of spatial Durbin model  The green finance in peripheral provinces has significant synergistic effects on the SDGs progress in local province, and the synergistic effects show heterogeneity by regions and periods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). Indirect effects have different significance in eastern, central and western regions. Eastern region (ρ = 0.1135) has the largest synergistic effect at 1% statistically significance level, which is 0.0618 (119.54%) and 0.0804 (242.90%) higher than that of central (ρ = 0.0517, P &gt; 0.10) and western regions (ρ = 0.0331, P &gt; 0.10). The indirect effects are higher than direct effect in eastern region, but lower than direct effects in central and western regions. The results show that the transboundary interactions of GF on SDG progress are obvious in economically developed area, but not obvious in economically undeveloped areas, which suggests the synergistic effect is limited by economic level. The economic developed provinces are densely populated region. There are three economic circles in eastern region: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta. Each economic circle is the demonstration in various aspects, including optimizing regional development, exploring effective paths for ecological civilization and the promotion of the balance in natural and economic resources. Chinese government has already emphasized the synergistic development of economic circle regions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Variable (1)<label>(2) (3) (4) (5) (6)</label></formula><p>In the period over 2008-2015, green finance has neither significant direct effect or indirect effect on SDGs. However, the direct and indirect effects are 0.2203 and 0.0731 at 1% significance level in the period over 2016-2020, which are 0.0392 (178.18%) and 0.1080(211.35%) higher than Before samples. The foundation of a more comprehensive green financial system leads to a better coordination of GF and SDGs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The definition of green finance in China overlaps highly with SDG6-7, SDG12-15, which are focused on improving environment, efficiency of resources and mitigating climate change response. It focuses on the sustainable rather than fast development. China's rapid development in the past has come at the expense of part of the environment. However, it must be unsustainable. The transform of environment can lead to human health and living directly (SDG3, SDG11). Implementation of green finance need technology and knowledge, it can provide more jobs and income and attract highly educated people (SDG5, SDG8-9). Indirectly, female leaders focus more on green issues, it may promote the status of women in the background of environmental protection and help gender equality (SDG4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kroeber, 2022)</ref>. Green finance has already become global consensus, the construction of it can strengthen global partnership and cooperation (SDG10, SDG17).</p><p>The development of green finance is an effective way to promote sustainable development by restructuring industries, promoting green innovation, and reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The development of green finance will reduce the scale of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. By constantly guiding enterprises towards cleaner and more environmentally friendly practices, green finance policies are driving the transformation of the industry, leading to the gradual elimination and replacement of polluting factories, increased energy use efficiency, and overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ning, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu and Tang, 2022)</ref>. Additionally, green finance is promoting industrial structure adjustment and the growth of green innovation, contributing to China's transition from a manufacturing power to a creative power <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>While this article explores the impact pathways of green finance, it is important to note that these pathways may differ significantly across regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pradhan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yonehara et al., 2017)</ref>, which can limit our comprehension of the impact mechanism of GF on SDGs. In addition, while this article highlights the key mediating role played by industrial structure, green innovation, energy consumption scale and CO2 emissions in the implementation of GF, it is not necessarily the case that other variables cannot also play a mediating role in SDGs. Therefore, this study should be considered in the policy's specific context, and with caution when generalizing to other settings.</p><p>Local governments should consider their unique circumstances when implementing green finance policies and designing development plans to take a deep understanding about which are appropriate for their own regions. The impact of GF on SDGs varies significantly across the three regions in China due to differences in regional and income heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Yang et al., 2023)</ref>. The central region has the lowest SDGs index and the highest GF index, making it the most effective in promoting sustainable development goals. The eastern region has the highest SDGs index but a relatively low GF index. Its weaker green finance performance may be attributed to its stronger economic development, science and technology, and talent resources, which make the contribution of GF to SDGs less apparent. Most of the western regions are sparsely populated and economically undeveloped, resulting in the lowest green finance index. However, their relatively better environmental protection and development needs make their sustainability index higher than that of the central region. As a result, GF has a more significant impact on SDGs of the western regions.</p><p>Improving the construction of green financial system is crucial for achieving SDGs. In China, the contribution of GF to SDGs has increased significantly between the periods of 2016-2020 compared to 2008-2015. This suggests that the effectiveness of GF has been greatly enhanced since the establishment of a more comprehensive green financial system. A well-developed system is essential in elevating the overall development level of GF, which can further promote the achievement of SDGs. Since 2016, China has released series of green finance policies that have effectively promoted its development. These policies have provided strong supports for the greater promotion effect of GF post-2015.</p><p>Our study focuses on the positive spatial spillover effects of GF on SDGs, which are often overlooked in traditional research and policy making <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Liu et al., 2018)</ref>. Ignoring spillover effects could lead to serious environmental consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dou et al., 2018)</ref>. Our findings show that green financial growth significantly contributes to the SDGs of provinces, and has a significant synergistic effect. It means that GF in the provinces can improve SDGs of the adjacent areas. Over the past decades, China's economy has grown rapidly but in a relatively extensive and environmentally damaging way due to its backward industrial structure and technology. This has led to the pollution of environment, which in turn has promoted the development of GF to improve it. With the facilitation of the government and the active involvement of society, GF has made significant progress in China. The inflow of capital into energy saving and environment protection fields has effectively facilitated the fulfillment of the SDGs. This spillover effect is not only a reference for Chinese provincial governments in formulating and implementing green financial policies, but also has implications for the development of green finance in other countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Policy Suggestions</head><p>Using the data of 30 provinces in China over 2008-2020, we assessed the impact of GF on the SDGs by using a panel regression model. We also explored the path and underlying mechanism for the impact of GF on the SDGs through a mediating effect model and then conducted tests by time sections and performed a heterogeneity analysis. Our results show that GF significantly promotes the SDGs, with the promoting effect being strongest in the central region and weakest in the Eastern region. The robustness analysis indicates that the promoting effect has been strengthened after the establishment of green financial policy system in 2016. GF promotes the SDGs by optimizing the industrial structure, promoting green innovation, and reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission. Furthermore, GF exhibits a positive spatial spillover effect on the SDGs, especially in eastern region and 2016-2021 period.</p><p>In accordance with the aforementioned conclusions, we propose the following policy suggestions. First, the Chinese government should continue to enhance the green finance system, address the current system's structural weaknesses, and encourage green financial products and markets. In addition, as the underdeveloped financial sector and capital market could hinder green financial growth, the government should also deepen their work of financial sector and promote the construction of capital market while developing green finance.</p><p>Second, while advancing local green finance to facilitate the SDGs, each province should take into account their unique circumstances rather than blindly copying the policies and measures from provinces with more advanced green finance systems.</p><p>Third, we recommend that governments provide guidance to local enterprises to adjust, transform, and optimize the industrial structure, and offer preferential policies to encourage green innovation. The Environment Protection Department should increase supervision of environmental protection and strictly limit energy consumption and CO2 emissions from enterprises. By promoting the fulfillment of the SDGs through optimizing the industrial structure, developing green innovation, and reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, they can further enhance the impact of GF.</p><p>Fourth, governments should consider the inter-regional linkage when developing green finance policies and investing in green finance resources. It is important for the government to develop a green finance development plan by region, according to the specific needs and demands of each region, in order to avoid the wastage of resources.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 Impact Mechanisms of Green Finance on Sustainable Development Goals.
