<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this study, the mediating role of self-compassion and cognitive flexibility in the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being was investigated. A total of 587 university students participated in the study. Participants completed the Differentiation of Self Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, Positive and Negative Emotion Scale, and Life Satisfaction Scale. The role of selfcompassion and cognitive flexibility in explaining the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being was examined using path analysis. Research findings showed that self-compassion and cognitive flexibility play a full mediating role in the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective wellbeing. The findings were discussed in the light of the literature and recommendations were presented.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>University life is a very important period for students in terms of developmental tasks and sources of stress <ref type="bibr">(Özbay et al., 2012)</ref>. The need to move away from home, form new relationships and groups, deal with different learning methods, and expect increased autonomy in life and work are among the potential stressors faced by university students who have important academic, social, and professional problems <ref type="bibr">(Clear et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gizir, 2005)</ref>. In this process, students are often forced to move away from their family and culture physically and psychologically and face personal, economic, social, and academic difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Zhou &amp; Yu, 2006)</ref>. The research results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ikiz and Otlu (2015)</ref> showed that the vast majority of university students feel lonely, have disagreements within the group they are in, and have complaints such as sleep and eating disorders. In another study, it was found that first-year mental health status and first-year adjustment problems, including factors such as somatization, anxiety, depression, and self-humiliation, predicted internet addiction, and students had difficulty using social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Yao et al., 2013)</ref>. It is argued that the rate of students who experience their student life mentally stressful is also increasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Nedregård &amp; Olsen, 2014)</ref>. These stressful experiences lead to various mental health problems that may result in poor academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Grøtan et al., 2019)</ref> and may negatively affect subjective well-being <ref type="bibr">(Özbay et al., 2012)</ref>. In this respect, it is important to understand the factors that affect students' subjective well-being.</p><p>Subjective well-being means that people experience more positive emotions and less negative emotions and that their life satisfaction is high <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Diener, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Myers &amp; Diener, 1995)</ref>. Subjective wellbeing, which is used synonymously with the concept of happiness in the literature, represents both positive and negative evaluations of people's lives. The affective dimension of this assessment is formed by positive and negative affectivity, while the cognitive dimension is formed by the concept of life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Diener, 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diener, , 2006))</ref>. As one of the emotional components of subjective well-being, positive affect refers to the frequency of an individual's positive emotions (for example, proud, concerned), while negative affect refers to the frequency of negative emotions (for example, distressed, hostile) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Myers &amp; Diener, 1995)</ref>. There are benefits of both positive emotions and negative emotions. The evolutionary theory asserts that both emotions are necessary for the continuation of human life <ref type="bibr">(Diener &amp; Ryan, 2009)</ref>. Positive emotions expand people's instant thought-action repertoires. For example, joy encourages playful behavior. These expanded thought-action repertoires strengthen all personal resources, including an individual's intellectual (such as improving problem-solving skills for the future, learning new information), physical (such as developing coordination, strength, and cardiovascular health), social (such as strengthening and forging bonds), and psychological resources (such as resilience and developing optimism, developing a sense of identity, and goal orientation) <ref type="bibr">(Fredrickson, 2003)</ref>. Experiments have shown that positive emotions produce particularly unusual, flexible, creative thought patterns <ref type="bibr">(Isen, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">as cited in Fredrickson &amp; Joiner, 2002)</ref>. At the same time, positive emotions improve the characteristics of people, such as openness to new ideas, tolerance, creativity, and establishing good relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carr, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Life satisfaction, one of the cognitive components of subjective well-being, is a person's cognitive assessment of whether his life is going well or badly <ref type="bibr">(Diener, 2004)</ref>. The concept of life satisfaction expresses the general judgment of the person about his life and his satisfaction with important life areas (marriage, work, health, success, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Diener, 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diener, , 2006</ref>). People's judgments about how much satisfaction they get from life depend on the comparison of their current life with the (not externally imposed) standards that the person has set for himself <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Diener et al., 1985)</ref>. The fact that positive evaluations of a person's life are high compared to negative evaluations means that the quality of life is also high <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Myers &amp; Diener, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lyubomirsky et al. (2005)</ref> suggested in their research that the factors that determine subjective wellbeing consist of 3 main groups. According to the happiness model they present, 50% of subjective wellbeing is due to genetic factors and personality traits, 40% is due to purposeful/intentional activities, and 10% is due to life circumstances. It is observed that individuals with high subjective well-being are successful in many areas of life, such as marriage, friendship, income, job performance, and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lyubomirsky et al., 2005)</ref>. At the same time, it is seen that these individuals are more social and creative, more productive in their business life, better citizens, and they have high marital satisfaction and, cope with stress better, fulfill their roles and responsibilities properly <ref type="bibr">(Diener &amp; Seligman 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lyubomirsky, King, et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lyubomirsk, Sheldon et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Based on these explanations indicating the importance of subjective well-being, it is thought that investigating the effect of important factors such as differentiation of self, cognitive flexibility and selfcompassion, the effects of which on university students' subjective well-being levels were also determined by previous studies in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Skowron et al., 2009)</ref> and their relations with each other will contribute to the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differentiation of Self</head><p>The concept of differentiation of self, developed by Murray <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bowen (1976)</ref>, is expressed as balancing emotional and intellectual functioning at the intrapsychic level, the ability to be guided by one's mind or to choose between one's emotions; In terms of interpersonal characteristics, and the ability to balance closeness and autonomy in relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kerr &amp; Bowen 1988)</ref>.</p><p>The concept of differentiation of self classifies people according to the degree of fusion or differentiation between their emotional and intellectual functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. At the fusion end of the spectrum, people with weak differentiation have the emotional and intellectual functions so fused that the automatic emotional system dominates their lives. People tend to be more emotionally reactive, and their lives are determined by what "feels right". The mind exists as an extension of the emotional system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988)</ref>. Bowen does not treat emotions negatively, nor does he mean that emotional processes are unimportant. He states that emotions cause more automatic reactions, while thinking provides self-control and the ability to make choices <ref type="bibr">(Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988, pp. 125)</ref>.</p><p>Self-differentiation consists of four sub-dimensions regarding one's inner life and relations with others. Among these sub-dimensions, "me position" and "emotional reactivity" are related to the inner life of the person, while "dependency on others" and "emotional disconnection" are the sub-dimensions of the individual's relationship with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Skowron &amp; Friedlander, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Skowron &amp; Schmitt, 2003)</ref>. In the meposition dimension of self-differentiation, individuals can maintain a clearly defined sense of self and adhere to their own personal beliefs even under pressure from others. People with a high level of selfdifferentiation are capable of taking a "me" position in their relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978)</ref>. These people can freely participate in the emotional sphere without worrying about merging too much with those around them. While they can maintain a degree of autonomy in their intimate relationships, they can function equally on the emotional and rational levels. At the same time, they may be less relationshiporiented and pursue more of their independent living goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Skowron &amp; Friedlander 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The sub-dimension of emotional reactivity describes a person's inability to distinguish feelings and thoughts from each other, preventing differentiation as a result of emotions suppressing thoughts. A lower level of emotional reactivity allows a person to respond calmly in stressful environments and react more positively with less emotional intensity. The person can stay emotionally connected to stressful, challenging, anxious situations without giving automatic emotional reactions or withdrawing himself. He is aware of the events around him and their effects on him and can evaluate them objectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988)</ref>. Again, even if these individuals experience strong emotions, they can produce alternative ways of thinking and existing without being consumed by them <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Tuason &amp; Friedlander, 2000)</ref>. The emotionally reactive person reacts automatically, with little thought about his own behavior and its effect on others <ref type="bibr">(Papero 2014)</ref>. As the level of emotional reactivity, which expresses the tendency of the individual to react to environmental stimuli with autonomic emotional reactions, emotional overflow, and hypersensitivity, increases, the level of differentiation of self decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Skowron &amp; Friedlander, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>In the dimension of emotional disconnection, it is important to adjust the emotional distance in one's close relationships and to maintain the balance between autonomy and togetherness. People who have difficulty in maintaining this balance may deny the importance of intimacy by withdrawing emotionally and staying away from others in stressful situations. Emotional disconnect means emotional distance in relationships. The person may avoid communicating with his or her family by maintaining a physical distance and avoiding meeting or by keeping an emotional distance from communicating on important issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988)</ref>. The healthy nature of the separation process requires the individual to have an independent self without being differentiated from family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988)</ref>. As the degree of emotional disconnection decreases, the person will be able to cope better with stressful situations and will be less emotionally withdrawn. As the level of emotional disconnection decreases, the level of differentiation of self will increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, , 1978;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Skowron &amp; Friedlander, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>In nesting dimension, the person cannot stay away from his immediate surroundings and sees this situation as a threatening element. These people, who experience a high level of cohesion in their close relationships, cannot express themselves individually. These people are in search of approval and acceptance and cannot keep themselves away from harmful relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, , 1978;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988)</ref>. At the same time, these people do not have clear boundaries with their family members, cannot tolerate differences of opinion, and have difficulty in making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Skowron &amp; Schmitt, 2003)</ref>. For this reason, they completely accept the beliefs and values of others they deem important and show excessive conformity <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Skowron &amp; Schmitt, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>People with low levels of differentiation of self have lower levels of flexibility and adaptability and are more emotionally dependent on those around them. Since they are easily exposed to dysfunction and difficult to recover from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>, they show more psychological and physical symptoms (for example, anxiety, somatization, depression, alcoholism, and psychoticism) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988)</ref>. A low level of differentiation causes the individual to distance himself from his real self and develop a false self. These people are completely relationship oriented. Their life energy is directed more towards what others think and winning friends and approval than towards goal-oriented activities. Their self-esteem depends on others <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>.</p><p>At higher levels of differentiation of self, the function of the emotional and intellectual systems can be more clearly distinguished. These individuals, who can maintain the relative autonomy of intellectual functions in times of stress, are more flexible, more adaptable, cope better with stress, and have a more regular and successful life <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. At the same time, these people have more flexibility of response and can exhibit more internal, principle-based, and goal-oriented behavior. They are more reliable in their beliefs and principles and are not fixed in their thoughts. They can evaluate the opinions and perceptions of others and replace old beliefs with new ones. They are more freely present in family relationships, away from the limitations of emotional reactivity. They are able to reflect and maintain their own beliefs in their behavior while in contact with important people. Their lives seem more orderly than those of less differentiated people. They can be productive when alone or in relationships <ref type="bibr">(Papero, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lampis et al. (2019)</ref> investigated the structures of differentiation of the intercultural self in their study. They stated that more studies are needed between different cultural groups in order to have more detailed information about the concept of differentiation of self. While Bowen has argued for the universality of differentiation of self, it is important to consider the ways in which this construct is measured in different cultural contexts and to recognize that the characteristics Bowen ascribes to different levels of differentiation may function differently in different cultures, including those considered more differentiated or healthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Manzi et al., 2006)</ref>. Individualist societies such as the United States of America, Canada, Germany, and England are built on cultures of differentiation, and it is very important to achieve individualism, independence, and personal autonomy in these societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Erdem &amp; Safy, 2018)</ref>. Collectivist societies such as China, India, Korea, and Arab and African countries are built on cultures of kinship and interdependence, and in-group membership and harmony are highly valued in these societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Triandis, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Studies conducted in Western countries have revealed that well-differentiated individuals have good physical and psychological health and less anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Skowron et al.,2009)</ref>. However, in collectivist countries, these connections may be different <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lampis et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chun and Macdermid (1997)</ref> found that Korean adolescents, although they scored higher in individuation, reported lower self-esteem, while those who scored higher on commitment reported higher self-esteem. However, other studies conducted in collectivist societies such as Korea and Taiwan found that being high in commitment and low in separation is not necessarily associated with dysfunctional family processes such as fusion, cutting, or triangulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chung &amp; Gale, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Neff et al., 2008)</ref>. In another study conducted in Turkey, it was found that high commitment and high differentiation, which are associated with healthy functioning, can coexist <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kağıtçıbaşı &amp; Ataca, 2005)</ref>. For Filipinos, differentiation means not separating from the collective but finding a personal identity and voice within the family and the wider community <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Tuason &amp; Friedlander, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Ross and Murdock (2014)</ref> found that differentiation of self was positively related to independent selfconstrual and negatively related to dependent self-construal. They also emphasized that independent self-construal has a mediating role between differentiation of self and subjective well-being. Therefore, it was thought that a high level of independent self-construal acts as a buffer against psychological symptoms for those with a low level of differentiation of self. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hocaoğlu and Işık (2021)</ref>, in their research with emerging adults, found that self-construal has a mediating role in the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differentiation of the Self and Subjective Well-Being</head><p>Many studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between differentiation of self and wellbeing and a negative relationship between differentiation of self and distress indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gubbins et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Peleg &amp; Grandi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Peleg &amp; Popko, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Peleg &amp; Yitzhak 2012)</ref>. Higher differentiation of self (i.e., low emotional reactivity, emotional disconnection and fusion with others, and high self-position) predicts higher well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Peleg &amp; Zoabi, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>It has been determined that students who have a low level of differentiation of self, in other words, who are emotionally reactive to others, who can take the least "me" position in their relationships, and who are emotionally disconnected or fused from others, have more severe interpersonal problems. At the same time, emotional disconnection and self-position, which are among the sub-dimensions of selfdifferentiation, were found to be the most important predictors of the well-being of these students <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Skowron et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Murdock and Gore (2004)</ref> found that a low level of self-differentiation is a strong predictor of psychological distress. It was found that students with a low level of differentiation of self showed a high level of social anxiety and physiological symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Peleg &amp; Popko, 2002)</ref>, and differentiation of self predicted trait anxiety <ref type="bibr">(Işık &amp; Bulduk, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Peleg &amp; Grandi, 2019)</ref>. In their research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chung and Gale (2006)</ref> found that the self-differentiation dimension of self-position predicted the level of psychological well-being as measured by self-esteem and depressed mood. Another study has shown that stress, depression, and anxiety are negatively related to the self-position position sub-dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hanımoğlu &amp; Akbaş, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>It has been reported that individuals with a high level of differentiation of self are able to use coping techniques more and experience psychological distress less than individuals with a low level of differentiation who experience similar stress levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Murdock &amp; Gore, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Skowron &amp; Friedlander, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Tuason &amp; Friedlander, 2000)</ref>. As a result of the research, the differentiation of self is in positive correlation with psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Erdem &amp; Kabasakal, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Karababa et al.,2018)</ref>, autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kluwer et al., 2020)</ref>, adaptation to university life <ref type="bibr">(Mert &amp; Çetiner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Skowron et al., 2004)</ref>, psychological development <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jenkins et al., 2005)</ref>, positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Sandage &amp; Jankowski, 2010)</ref> and in negative correlation with perceived psychological and interpersonal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Skowron et al., 2009)</ref>. In addition, it has been found that many factors, such as emotional support, perceived stress, and stressful life events, may play a role in the relationship between differentiation of self and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Krycak et al., 2012)</ref>. The abovementioned research results indicate that differentiation of self increases subjective well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Mediating Role of Self-Compassion</head><p>The concept of self-compassion, which is another variable that is the subject of the research, was defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neff (2003b)</ref> as a concept consisting of three main elements: self-compassion, a sense of common sharing, and mindfulness. Self-compassion refers to the tendency to be compassionate and understanding towards oneself rather than being harshly critical or judgmental, facilitating self-calming in times of pain and offering comfort. Sense of common sharing involves recognizing that all people can fail, make mistakes, and feel somehow inadequate, that these experiences are not unique to one's own self. Thus, by creating a sense of connection with others, it enables the understanding that setbacks are part of the common human experience rather than a sense of isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2011)</ref>. Mindfulness is a state of balanced awareness in which thoughts and feelings are observed as they are, without avoiding or changing thoughts and feelings, without exaggeration or judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Neff, et al., 2005)</ref>. Thus, the person is protected from over-identification and sees and accepts the mental and emotional phenomena that occur without disconnecting from their experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a)</ref>.</p><p>Research shows that self-compassion is an important trait that supports well-being. "Self-compassion is associated with well-being because it helps people feel safe" <ref type="bibr">(Neff, 2011, pp. 7)</ref>. Self-compassion supports subjective well-being by increasing life satisfaction and positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baer et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Zessin et al. (2015)</ref> reported a positive (r = .47) general effect size between self-compassion and well-being in their meta-analysis study, in which 79 studies were examined. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Marsh et al. (2018)</ref> analyzed 19 studies using the meta-analysis method and found that there was a large negative effect size (r= -.55) between self-compassion and depression, anxiety, and stress.</p><p>It is thought that the differentiation of self is important in people's self-compassion. It can be expected that it will be easier for individuals with a high level of self-differentiation to be self-compassionate and tolerant rather than harshly criticizing themselves when experiencing pain or failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a)</ref>. At the same time, considering that self-compassion facilitates adjustment and psychological functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Neff et al., 2007)</ref> by reducing self-criticism, self-doubt, isolation, and excessive identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Neff et al., 2005)</ref>, it can be thought that it has a positive relationship with differentiation of self because individuals with a high level of differentiation of self can maintain their sense of self even in stressful situations. They can evaluate themselves more accurately in relation to others without false postures that cause them to overestimate or underestimate themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. People with a low level of differentiation of self are stuck in the emotional world. They do not have enough ability to balance closeness and autonomy in their intimate relationships. They may develop emotional disconnection in response to the anxiety they experience in their relationship. Or, while trying to gain emotional intimacy, they may mingle and intertwine with others, which may increase their alienation from themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. In line with this information, it can be thought that the self-compassion level of people with low self-differentiation levels will also be low.</p><p>Some studies in the literature show a positive relationship between differentiation of self and selfcompassion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Farshchiyan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mohammadi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Nikmanesh et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Jetha (2020)</ref> investigated the relationships between self-differentiation, self-compassion, attachment styles, and early maladaptive schemas and found that differentiation of self and self-compassion mediated the relationship between schemas and attachment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Foye (2017)</ref> investigated the relationship between self-differentiation, self-compassion, moral injury, and anxiety in war veterans.

There are also some studies examining the relationships between the differentiation of the self and the mindfulness dimension of self-compassion.

In this context, it can be thought that individuals with a high level of differentiation of self have a high level of awareness and can make healthy cognitive evaluations without being under the pressure of emotions and without over-identifying with their emotions. When the studies in the literature are examined holistically, the role of self-compassion in the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being is worth investigation</p></div>

Individuals actually have choices about how to act in each situation. However, it is important that they become aware of these options and alternatives that exist before deciding how to act. Those who are aware of possible alternatives (behaviors, solutions, etc.) to a situation are more cognitively flexible than those who only see the right behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Martin et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Martin &amp; Rubin, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dennis and Vander Wal (2010)</ref> emphasized that being prone to perceiving difficult situations as controllable, the ability to perceive multiple alternative explanations for life events and people's behavior, and the ability to produce multiple alternative solutions in difficult situations are required for cognitive flexibility. In this regard, individuals with cognitive flexibility can react more harmoniously to difficult life experiences, while cognitively inflexible individuals who lack these skills are more prone to pathological reactions.</p><p>Cognitively flexible individuals can be expected to have a better level of differentiation. Individuals with a high level of differentiation can produce alternative ways of thinking and exist without being consumed by them, even if they experience strong emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Tuason &amp; Friedlander, 2000)</ref>. Differentiation of the self is related to adequate basic differentiation between emotional and intellectual systems. In situations of increased anxiety, the intellectual system can operate autonomously without being dominated by the emotional system. It uses logical reasoning to develop the beliefs, principles, and convictions necessary to override the emotional system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. As the level of emotional reactivity, which expresses the individual's tendency to react to environmental stimuli with autonomic emotional reactions, emotional overflow, and hypersensitivity, increases, the level of differentiation of self decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Skowron &amp; Friedlander, 1998)</ref>. Cognitive flexibility requires being aware of possible alternatives to a situation before making a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Martin &amp; Rubin, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dong et al. (2016)</ref> reported that there is a relationship between low cognitive flexibility and decision-making based on impulsive intuition. From this point of view, it can be thought that there may be a relationship between the differentiation of self and cognitive flexibility, and that the person's emotionally reactive behavior may prevent cognitive flexibility.</p><p>Cognitive flexibility is seen as an important predictor of subjective well-being. In the research, it was found that cognitive flexibility is positively related to self-efficacy and mental well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Demirtaş, 2020)</ref>, contributes positively to life satisfaction, self-esteem, and mental well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Jen et al., 2019)</ref>, has a mediating role in the relationship between family communication and well-being in young adults, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Koesten et al., 2009)</ref> and mediates the relationship between parenting strategies and subjective wellbeing of young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Wu et al., 2020)</ref>. In line with this information in the literature, it is thought that differentiation of self increases cognitive flexibility, and an increase in cognitive flexibility increases subjective well-being.

This study makes an important contribution to the understanding of which factors play an important role in the subjective well-being of university students. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to investigate the mediating role of self-compassion and cognitive flexibility in the relationship between university students' levels of selfdifferentiation and subjective well-being.

The steps that <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> suggested, which should be examined before the analysis of the path model, were tested in the study. For acceptable model-data fit in the path analysis model, the following values were taken as criteria; χ 2 &gt; .05, Comparative Fit Index [CFI] &gt;.95, Tucker-Lewis Index [TLI] &gt; .95, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation [RMSEA] = .06, and Standardized] Root Mean Square Residual [SRMR] = .08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kline, 2015)</ref>. The significance of the indirect effects in the hypothesis model to be tested in the research was tested by bootstrapping.

According to the results of the analysis, it was found that there is a significant positive moderate relationship between differentiation of self and cognitive flexibility (r= .46; p&lt; .01), self-compassion (r= .57; p&lt; .01), and subjective well-being (r= .39; p&lt; .01). In addition, a moderately positive and significant relationship was found between cognitive flexibility and self-compassion (r= .59; p&lt; .01) and subjective well-being (r= .42; p&lt; .01). Finally, a moderately positive and significant relationship was determined between self-compassion and subjective well-being (r= .58; p&lt; .01).

In this context, it has been seen that cognitive flexibility and self-compassion can mediate the differentiation of the self</p><p>Step 4: When the mediator variable enters the model, the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable decreases or becomes meaningless. After controlling for the mediating variables cognitive flexibility and self-compassion for full mediation, the relationship between differentiation of self and self-compassion was examined. According to the findings, after controlling for mediator variables, there was no significant relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being (r= .07, p= .075&gt; .050). Therefore, when the mediating variables are included in the model, the entire effect from differentiation of the self to subjective well-being goes through mediator variables. This shows that there is no direct effect from differentiation of the self to subjective well-being and that the mediating variables in the model are fully mediated. Therefore, in the hypothesized model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, after the direct effect from differentiation of self to subjective well-being was removed from the model, path analysis was performed. The image of the analyzed model is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.

Direct, Indirect, Total Effects and Bootstrapping Results of the Final Model Examining the Mediating Role of Self-Compassion and Cognitive Flexibility in the Relationship Between Self-Differentiation and Subjective Well-being</head><p>According to the findings given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, there are significant effects from differentiation of self to self-compassion (β= .04, p&lt; .05), from differentiation of self to cognitive flexibility (β= .04, p&lt; .05), and from differentiation of self to subjective well-being (β= .03, p&lt; .05).</p><p>From differentiation of the self to self-compassion and cognitive flexibility, the effects of .04 are direct effects. Therefore, differentiation of self significantly predicts self-compassion and cognitive flexibility in other words, as the level of differentiation of the self increases, the level of self-compassion and cognitive flexibility also increases. According to the model, there is a significant effect of .51 from self-compassion to subjective well-being. All of this effect is a direct effect, and it is seen that self-compassion predicts subjective well-being at a meaningful level. As the level of self-compassion increases, the level of subjective well-being also increases. According to the model, there is a significant .12 level effect from cognitive flexibility to subjective well-being. This effect is a direct effect and shows that cognitive flexibility significantly predicts subjective well-being. As the level of cognitive flexibility and self-compassion increases, the level of subjective well-being also increases. All of the .03 effects from differentiation of self to subjective well-being are indirect effects, and when the mediator variables are controlled, there is no direct effect from differentiation of self to subjective well-being. Therefore, differentiation of self does not significantly predict subjective well-being. 90% C.I. When we look at Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, it can be seen that all the effects in the model are significant. In the findings of this study, the lower and upper limits of the bootstrapping confidence intervals of both direct and indirect effects do not include the zero point. Therefore, it can be said that bootstrapping supports the results that the differentiation of self affects subjective well-being through self-compassion, as well as subjective well-being through cognitive flexibility. However, it can also be stated that it supports the conclusion that differentiation of self affects subjective well-being through cognitive flexibility and selfcompassion.</p></div>

As a result of this research, it was found that self-compassion has a full mediating role in the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being. Since all of the effects of the independent variable (differentiation of self) on the dependent variable (subjective well-being) go through the mediating variable (self-compassion) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>, it can be said that differentiation of the self increases self-compassion and selfcompassion increases subjective well-being.</p><p>There are some studies showing a positive relationship between differentiation of self and selfcompassion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Farshchiyan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Foye, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Jetha, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Nikmanesh et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mohammadi et al., 2021)</ref>.

It can be thought that this situation contributes to the mindfulness component of self-compassion <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Neff et al., 2005)</ref>, which is defined as a state of balanced awareness in which thoughts and emotions are observed as they are without avoiding or changing them, without exaggerating, that is, without judgment.

At the same time, since the high level of differentiation of the self enables less emotional reactive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978)</ref>, this feature facilitates self-compassion <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Neff, 2003b)</ref>, which means that people are compassionate and understanding towards themselves rather than harshly self-criticizing themselves in case of pain or failure. This information, which suggests that the differentiation of the self contributes to self-compassion, is also supported by the current research result, and according to the result of this research, differentiation of the self increases self-compassion.</p><p>Many studies have found that there is a positive relationship between self-compassion and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bluth &amp; Blanton, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Booker &amp; Dunsmore, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Deniz et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Neff et al., 2007)</ref>, and selfcompassion predict happiness, optimism, positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Neff &amp; Vonk, 2009)</ref>. Self-compassion supports subjective well-being by providing the emotional security needed to see oneself more clearly and by regulating their reactions to negative events <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Neff, , 2011))</ref>. In support of the results of this research, it was found in this study that self-compassion increased subjective well-being. It is thought that self-compassion increases subjective well-being by making students treat themselves more compassionately, not feeling lonely in difficult situations, and by increasing their awareness.</p><p>As another result of this study, it was determined that cognitive flexibility has a full mediating effect in the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being. According to this result, differentiation of self increases cognitive flexibility, and cognitive flexibility increases subjective wellbeing. Differentiation of the self is concerned with adequate basic differentiation between the emotional and intellectual systems. The individual with a high level of differentiation of self is free to use calm and logical reasoning for the decisions that govern his life <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. In this case, a high level of differentiation of the self can be expected to increase cognitive flexibility, which refers to the ability to be aware of possible alternatives to a situation, adapt to the current situation and be flexible, and have selfefficacy in being flexible before making a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Martin &amp; Rubin, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Vaziri n et al., (2021)</ref>, in their study with high school students, revealed that differentiation of the self has a direct and significant relationship with cognitive flexibility. As the level of differentiation of the self decreases, the level of emotional reactivity increases, and the individual reacts to environmental stimuli with autonomic emotional reactions, emotional overflow, and hypersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Skowron &amp; Friedlander, 1998)</ref>. In this context, it can be thought that as the level of differentiation of the self decreases, the level of cognitive flexibility will also decrease. In parallel, a previous study reported that there is a relationship between low cognitive flexibility and impulsive decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dong et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>There are some studies that show that cognitive flexibility increases subjective well-being. It has been found in previous studies that cognitive flexibility contributes positively to life satisfaction, self-esteem, and mental well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Jen et al., 2019)</ref> and is positively associated with better psychological health, including a reduction in depression, anxiety, and distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kato, 2012)</ref>. These explanations, which are based on the literature, are supported by our research results, and according to our findings, differentiation of the self increases cognitive flexibility, and cognitive flexibility increases subjective wellbeing.</p><p>Finally, in this study, an indirect effect from differentiation of self to subjective well-being was found in a third way. Accordingly, differentiation of self significantly predicts subjective well-being through cognitive flexibility and self-compassion. People with cognitive flexibility have a tendency to perceive difficult conditions as controllable, the ability to perceive multiple alternative explanations for events in life and people's behavior, and the ability to produce multiple alternative solutions in difficult situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dennis &amp; Vander Wal, 2010)</ref>. In this context, it can be expected that these characteristics affect the level of self-compassion of people. Those who are willing to believe that options are available are also willing to believe that people deserve forgiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Martin et al., 2011)</ref>. The ability to perceive difficult conditions as controllable and to realize alternatives can lead to an increase in self-compassion, which is defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Neff (2003a)</ref> as being compassionate and understanding rather than being self-critical, accepting that negative experiences are not unique to one's own self and having mindfulness.</p><p>Considering that individuals with high cognitive flexibility tend to face negative experiences instead of avoiding, controlling, or changing them <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hayes et al., 2006)</ref>, and they tend to restructure cognitively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen &amp; Leary, 2010)</ref>, and it facilitates adjustment and psychological functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Neff et al., 2007)</ref> by reducing self-criticism, self-doubt, isolation, and over-identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Neff et al., 2005)</ref>, cognitive flexibility can be expected to have a significant impact on self-compassion. There are studies that support this idea and show that there is a significant relationship between cognitive flexibility and self-compassion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deniz &amp; Gündüz, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Martin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yelpaze, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Zessin et al., 2015)</ref>. According to all these explanations, it can be concluded that cognitive flexibility contributes to self-compassion.</p><p>Although the universality of the concept of differentiation of the self has been suggested, it is important to recognize that features attributed to different levels of differentiation may function differently in different cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Manzi et al., 2006)</ref>. In some studies, the relationships between differentiation and well-being have been investigated in cultures considered to be collectivist. It has been suggested that the effect of differentiation of self on well-being is weaker in collectivist cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chung &amp; Gale, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Neff et al., 2008)</ref>. It has been argued that for individuals who see the self as closely related to others (who have a highly interdependent self-construal), the relationship between self-differentiation and well-being may not be so strong <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chung &amp; Gale, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Ross and Murdock (2014)</ref> concluded in their research that the relationship between differentiation of self and well-being is stronger for individuals residing in individualistic cultures (and thus typically having higher levels of independent self-construal) than those residing in collectivist cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hocaoğlu and Işık (2021)</ref>, in their research with adults, found that self-construal has a mediating role in the relationship between differentiation of the self and subjective well-being According to the results of the research, while independent self-construal and cohesion-seeking interdependent self-construal mediated the relationship between self-differentiation and subjective well-being, avoidance of rejection did not mediate significantly between selfdifferentiation and subjective well-being. That is, higher self-differentiation was associated with higher independent self-construal, and higher independent self-construal was associated with higher subjective well-being. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kağıtçıbaşı (2005)</ref> states that in Turkish society, both individualistic and collectivist qualities are seen together, and autonomous-relational self-structure is dominant. In the autonomous relational self, the individual has both autonomous and relational self-characteristics. In this self-structure, being independent is at the forefront, and at the same time, it is important to be close with others emotionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kağıtçıbaşı, 2005)</ref>. Özdemir (2012) conducted a study on adolescents, and he determined that relational and autonomous-relational self-construal had an effect on positive emotions and life satisfaction, and autonomous self-construal had an effect on negative emotions. In another study, it was observed that high commitment and high differentiation, which are associated with healthy functionality, can coexist <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kağıtçıbaşı &amp; Ataca, 2005)</ref>. From this point of view, the positive effects of the coexistence of autonomy and relatability in Turkish society can be mentioned. In this context, it can be thought that the differentiation of the self is an individual structure that is more suitable for societies that value independence more. For future research, it may be suggested to consider the effects of self-construals while investigating the effect of differentiation of self in determining well-being in Turkish society.</p><p>There are several limitations of this study that should be noted. Firstly, although there are many different variables that can affect the model of the study, it is not possible to include all variables in such a model. For this reason, it is limited to the variables that we find important in the literature. Second, the self-report measures used may have negatively affected the reliability of the results due to social desirability. Another limitation of the study is that the sample is a sample of Turkish university students, the gender ratio cannot be balanced, and the age and educational status do not vary. All these limitations reduce the generalizability of the results obtained.</p><p>University life is a very important period for students in terms of developmental tasks and stress sources <ref type="bibr">(Özbay et al., 2012)</ref>, and students are expected to act autonomously in more areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cleary et al., 2011)</ref>. This affects their subjective well-being, namely their satisfaction with their living spaces, their positive self-evaluation, and more positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Diener, 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diener, , 2006))</ref>. In this study, the effects of important factors such as the level of differentiation of the self, cognitive flexibility, and self-compassion on the subjective well-being levels of university students and their interrelationships were investigated. This study is the first to propose a quantitative model describing the relationship between these four concepts in university students. The result of this research showed that self-compassion and cognitive flexibility have a full mediating effect in the relationship between differentiation of self and subjective well-being. For this reason, professionals who can develop intervention programs that will affect the wellbeing of university students should consider cognitive flexibility and self-compassion and increase the well-being of students with low self-differentiation levels. In addition, longitudinal studies can be conducted to investigate changes in differentiation of self, cognitive flexibility and self-compassion, and subjective well-being levels.</p></div>

Yelpazenin kaynaşma (fusion) ucunda bulunan ayrımlaşmanın zayıf olduğu kişilerde, duygusal ve entelektüel işlevler o kadar kaynaşmıştır ki, yaşamlarında otomatik duygusal sistem baskındır.

Duygusal tepkisellik düzeyinin daha düşük olması, kişinin stresli ortamlarda sakin bir şekilde yanıt verebilmesini, daha az duygusal yoğunluk ile daha olumlu tepki vermesini sağlamaktadır. Kişi stresli, zorlayıcı, kaygılı durumlarla duygusal otomatik tepkiler vermeden veya kendini geri çekmeden duygusal olarak bağlantıda kalabilir, çevresindeki olayların ve bunların kendi üzerindeki etkilerinin farkında olup, bunları objektif bir şekilde değerlendirebilir <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kerr &amp; Bowen, 1988)</ref>.

Öz şefkat, kendine sert bir şekilde eleştirel veya yargılayıcı olmak yerine, kendine karşı şefkatli ve anlayışlı olma eğilimini ifade eder, acı zamanlarında kendini sakinleştirmeyi kolaylaştırır ve rahatlık sunar. Ortak paydaşım duygusu, tüm insanların başarısız olabileceğini, hata yapabileceklerini ve bir şekilde kendilerini yetersiz hissedebileceklerini, bu deneyimlerin sadece kişinin kendi benliğine özgü olmadığını kabul etmeyi içerir. Böylece başkalarıyla bağlantı duygusu oluşturarak aksiliklerin bir tecrit duygusundan ziyade ortak insanlık deneyiminin bir parçası olduğunun anlaşılmasını sağlar <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Neff, , 2011))</ref>. Bilinçli farkındalık, düşünceler ve duygulardan kaçınmadan veya onları değiştirmeden, aynı zamanda düşünce ve duyguların abartılmadan ve yargılanmadan olduğu gibi gözlemlendiği dengeli bir farkında olma durumudur <ref type="bibr">(Neff vd., 2005)</ref>. Böylece kişi aşırı özdeşleşmeden korunmakta ve deneyimleriyle bağlantısı kesilmeden ortaya çıkan zihinsel ve duygusal fenomenleri görüp kabul etmektedir <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a)</ref>.</p><p>Araştırmalar, öz-anlayışın iyi oluşu destekleyen önemli bir özellik olduğunu göstermektedir. "Özanlayış, iyi oluş ile ilişkilidir çünkü insanların kendilerini güvende hissetmelerine yardımcı olur" <ref type="bibr">(Neff, 2011, s. 7</ref>). Öz-anlayış, yaşam doyumunu ve olumlu duyguları arttırıp, olumsuz duyguları azaltarak öznel iyi oluşu destekler <ref type="bibr">(Baer vd., 2012)</ref>. Zessin ve diğerleri (2015) yetmişdokuz araştırmanın incelendiği meta analiz çalışmalarında öz-anlayış ile iyi oluş arasında pozitif yönde (r= .47) genel etki büyüklüğü rapor etmişlerdir. Marsh ve diğerleri (2018) meta analiz yöntemiyle 19 çalışmayı incelendikleri araştırmalarında öz anlayış ile depresyon, anksiyete ve stres arasında negatif yönde büyük bir etki büyüklüğü (r= -.55) olduğunu bulmuşlardır.</p><p>Benliğin ayrımlaşmasının kişilerin kendine öz anlayış göstermesinde önemli olduğu düşünülmektedir.

Aynı zamanda öz anlayışın öz-eleştiri, kendinden şüphe, soyutlanma ve aşırı şekilde özdeşleşmeyi azaltarak <ref type="bibr">(Neff vd., 2005)</ref>, uyum ve psikolojik fonksiyonelliği kolaylaştırdığı <ref type="bibr">(Neff vd., 2007)</ref> düşünüldüğünde, benliğin ayrımlaşması ile olumlu bir ilişkisi olduğu düşünülebilir. Çünkü benliğin ayrımlaşma düzeyi yüksek olan bireyler stresli durumlarda bile benlik duygusunu sürdürebilirler.

Benliğin ayrımlaşmasının düşük düzeyde olduğu kişilerse, duygu dünyasının içinde sıkışıp kalırlar. Yakın ilişkilerinde yakınlık ve özerkliği dengeleyebilme becerisine yeterince sahip değildirler. İlişkilerinde yaşadıkları kaygıya tepki olarak duygusal kopukluk geliştirebilirler.

Üniversite öğrencilerinde benliğin ayrımlaşması düzeyleri ile öznel iyi oluşları arasındaki ilişkide özanlayış ve bilişsel esnekliğin aracılık etkisini belirlemek için yol analizi kullanılmıştır.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tartışma ve Sonuç</head><p>Bu çalışmada, üniversite öğrencilerinin benliğin ayrımlaşması, öz-anlayış, bilişsel esneklik düzeyleri ve öznel iyi oluşları arasındaki ilişkiler araştırılmıştır. Bu araştırmanın sonucunda benliğin ayrımlaşmasıyla öznel iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkide öz-anlayışın tam aracılık rolü olduğu bulunmuştur. Tam aracılık söz konusuyken bağımsız değişkenin (benliğin ayrımlaşmasının) bağımlı değişken (öznel iyi oluş) üzerindeki etkisinin tümü aracı değişken (öz-anlayış) üzerinden gittiğinden <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>, benliğin ayrımlaşmasının öz-anlayışı, öz-anlayışın da öznel iyi oluşu arttırdığı söylenebilir.</p><p>Benliğin ayrımlaşması ile öz anlayış arasında pozitif bir ilişki olduğunu gösteren bazı çalışmalar bulunmaktadır <ref type="bibr">(Farshchiyan vd., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Foye, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Jetha, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mohammadi vd., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nikmanesh vd., 2020)</ref>. Ayrıca benliğin ayrımlaşması ile öz anlayışın bilinçli farkındalık boyutu arasındaki ilişkileri inceleyen bazı çalışmalar da bulunmaktadır. Araştırmalar bilinçli farkındalık düzeyi yüksek olan kişilerin öz anlayış düzeylerinin de yüksek olduğunu doğrulamıştır <ref type="bibr">(Nedeljkovic vd., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shapiro vd., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Benliğin ayrımlaşması, kişinin düşünsel ve duygusal süreçleri ayırt edebilmesi, duygusal tepkisel davranmayıp, bu düşünce ve duygulara yönelik tepkilerini bilinçli olarak seçme yeteneğini içermektedir <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978)</ref>. Bu durumun, düşünceler ve duygulardan kaçınmadan veya onları değiştirmeden, aynı zamanda abartmadan yani yargılamadan olduğu gibi gözlemlendiği dengeli bir farkında olma durumu olarak tanımlanan <ref type="bibr">(Neff vd., 2005)</ref> öz anlayışın bilinçli farkındalık bileşenine katkı sağladığı düşünülebilir. Bilinçli farkındalık sayesinde kişi olumsuz duygularıyla aşırı özdeşleşmekten korunmakta ve deneyimleriyle bağlantısı kesilmeden ortaya çıkan zihinsel ve duygusal fenomenleri görüp kabul etmektedir <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a)</ref>. Ayrımlaşma düzeyinin yüksek olması; kişinin duygu dünyasının içinde sıkışıp kalmamasını, yakın ilişkilerinde yakınlık ve özerkliği dengeleyebilmesini, diğerleriyle kaynaşıp iç içe geçmemesini ve kendine yabancılaşmamasını ve stresli durumlarda bile benlik duygusunu sürdürebilmesini sağlamaktadır <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. Bu durum olumsuz deneyimlerin kişinin kendine özgü olmadığı, başkalarıyla bağlantı duygusu oluşturarak aksiliklerin bir tecrit duygusundan ziyade ortak insanlık deneyiminin bir parçası olduğunun ifadesi olan ortak paydaşım duygusunu <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Neff, , 2011) )</ref> arttırarak öz anlayış düzeyinin artmasına neden olabilir. Böylece kişiler kendileri hakkında olumlu ve gerçekçi görüşlere sahip olabilirler <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Neff &amp; Vonk, 2009)</ref>. Aynı zamanda benliğin ayrımlaşma düzeyinin yüksek olması, daha az duygusal tepkisel davranmayı sağladığından <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bowen, 1978)</ref>, bu özelliğin kişilerin acı veya başarısızlık durumlarında kendilerini sert bir şekilde kendini eleştirmekten ziyade kendine karşı şefkatli ve anlayışlı olması anlamına gelen öz şefkati <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Neff, 2003b)</ref> kolaylaştırdığı düşünülebilir. Benliğin ayrımlaşmasının öz anlayışa bir katkısının olduğunu düşündüren bu bilgiler mevcut araştırma sonucuyla da desteklenmekte, bu araştırmanın sonucuna göre benliğin ayrımlaşması öz-anlayışı arttırmaktadır.</p><p>Birçok araştırma öz-anlayış ile iyi oluş arasında pozitif bir ilişki olduğunu <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Booker &amp; Dunsmore, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bluth &amp; Blanton, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Deniz vd., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neff vd., 2007)</ref>, öz anlayışın mutluluk, iyimserlik ve olumlu duyguları yordadığını <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Neff &amp; Vonk, 2009)</ref> göstermiştir. Öz anlayış, kişinin kendini daha net bir şekilde görebilmesi için gereken duygusal güvenliği sağlayarak ve olumsuz olaylara tepkilerini düzenleyerek <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Neff, 2003a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Neff, , 2011) )</ref> öznel iyi oluşu desteklemektedir. Bu araştırma sonuçlarını destekleyecek biçimde bu araştırmada da öz-anlayışın öznel iyi oluşu arttırdığı bulunmuştur. Öz anlayışın, öğrencilerin kendilerine daha şefkatli davranmalarını, zor durumlarda yalnız hissetmemelerini sağlayarak ve farkındalıklarını arttırarak da öznel iyi oluşu arttırdığı düşünülmektedir.</p><p>Bu çalışmanın diğer bir sonucunda benliğin ayrımlaşması ve öznel iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkide bilişsel esnekliğin tam aracılık etkisi olduğu saptanmıştır. Bu sonuca göre benliğin ayrımlaşması bilişsel esnekliği, bilişsel esneklikse öznel iyi oluşu arttırmaktadır. Benliğin ayrımlaşması, duygusal ve entelektüel sistemler arasında yeterli temel farklılaşmayla ilgilidir. Ayrımlaşma düzeyi yüksek olan birey, hayatını yöneten kararlar için sakin, mantıklı muhakemeye geçmekte özgürdür <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bowen, 1976)</ref>. Bu durumda benliğin ayrımlaşması düzeyinin yüksek olmasının, karar vermeden önce bir durumun olası alternatiflerinin farkında olma, bulunulan duruma uyum sağlayabilme ve esnek olabilme, esnek olmada öz yeterliğe sahip olma yeteneğini ifade eden bilişsel esnekliği arttırması beklenebilir <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Martin &amp; Rubin, 1995)</ref>. Vaziri ve diğerleri (2021) lise öğrencileriyle yürüttüğü araştırmasında benliğin ayrımlaşmasının bilişsel esneklik ile doğrudan ve anlamlı bir ilişkisi olduğunu ortaya koymuşlardır. Benliğin ayrımlaşması düzeyi azaldıkça duygusal tepkisellik düzeyi artmakta, birey çevresel uyaranlara otonomik duygusal tepkiler, duygusal taşma ve aşırı duyarlılık ile tepki vermektedir <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Skowron &amp; Friedlander, 1998)</ref>. Bu bağlamda benliğin ayrımlaşması düzeyi azaldıkça, bilişsel esneklik düzeyinin de düşük olacağı düşünülebilir. Buna paralel olarak daha önceki bir araştırmada bilişsel esneklik düzeyinin düşük olması ile dürtüsel sezgiye dayalı karar verme arasında bir ilişki olduğu bildirilmiştir <ref type="bibr">(Dong vd., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Bilişsel esnekliğin, öznel iyi oluşu arttırdığını gösteren bazı çalışmalar bulunmaktadır. Önceki çalışmalarda bilişsel esnekliğin; yaşam doyumuna, öz saygıya ve zihinsel esenliğe olumlu katkıda bulunduğu <ref type="bibr">(Jen vd., 2019)</ref>, depresyon, kaygı ve sıkıntıda azalmayı içeren daha iyi psikolojik sağlık ile pozitif olarak ilişkili olduğu bulunmuştur <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kato, 2012)</ref>. Literatüre dayandırılan bu açıklamalar bizim araştırma sonucumuzca desteklenmekte bulgularımıza göre benliğin ayrımlaşması bilişsel esnekliği, bilişsel esneklikse öznel iyi oluşu arttırmaktadır.</p><p>Bu araştırmada son olarak benliğin ayrımlaşmasından öznel iyi oluşa üçüncü bir yoldan dolaylı etki bulunmuştur. Buna göre benliğin ayrımlaşması bilişsel esneklik ve öz-anlayış aracılığıyla öznel iyi oluşu anlamlı bir düzeyde yordamaktadır. Bilişsel esnekliğe sahip kişiler, zor koşulları kontrol edilebilir olarak algılama eğilimine, yaşamdaki olaylar ve insanların davranışları için birden çok alternatif açıklamayı algılama yeteneğine ve zor durumlar karşısında birden çok alternatif çözüm üretme yeteneğine sahiptirler <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dennis &amp; Vander Wal, 2010)</ref>. Bu bağlamda bu özelliklerin kişilerin öz-anlayış düzeylerini etkilemesi beklenebilir. Seçeneklerin mevcut olduğuna inanmaya istekli olanlar, aynı zamanda kişilerin affedilmeyi hak ettiğine inanmaya da isteklidir <ref type="bibr">(Martin vd., 2011)</ref>. Zor koşulları kontrol edilebilir olarak algılama, alternatiflerin farkına varma becerisi, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Neff (2003a)</ref> tarafından kişilerin kendine karşı eleştirel olmaktansa, şefkatli ve anlayışlı olmasını, olumsuz deneyimlerin sadece kendi benliğine özgü olmadığını kabul etmek ve bilinçli farkındalığa sahip olmak olarak tanımlanan öz anlayışın artmasına neden olabilir.</p><p>Bilişsel esnekliği yüksek olan bireylerin, olumsuz deneyimlerinden kaçınmak, onları kontrol etmek veya değiştirmek yerine onlarla yüzleşmeye eğilimli olmaları <ref type="bibr">(Hayes vd., 2006)</ref>, bilişsel olarak yeniden yapılandırmaya eğilimli oldukları <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen &amp; Leary, 2010)</ref>, öz anlayışın öz-eleştiri, kendinden şüphe, izolasyon ve aşırı özdeşleşmeyi azaltarak <ref type="bibr">(Neff vd., 2005)</ref>, uyum sağlama ve psikolojik işlevselliği kolaylaştırdığı <ref type="bibr">(Neff vd., 2007)</ref> düşünüldüğünde, bilişsel esnekliğin öz anlayış üzerinde önemli bir etkisi olabileceği beklenebilir. Bu düşünceyi destekleyen, bilişsel esneklik ve öz-anlayış arasında anlamlı ilişki olduğunu gösteren araştırmalar bulunmaktadır <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deniz &amp; Gündüz, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martin, vd., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yelpaze, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zessin vd., 2015)</ref>. Tüm bu açıklamalara göre bilişsel esnekliğin öz-anlayışa katkı sağladığı sonucuna ulaşılabilir.</p><p>Benliğin ayrımlaşması kavramının evrenselliği ileri sürülmüş olsa da farklı ayrımlaşma düzeylerine atfedilen özelliklerin farklı kültürlerde farklı işlev görebileceğini kabul etmek önemlidir <ref type="bibr">(Manzi vd., 2006)</ref>. Bazı çalışmalarda ayrımlaşma ve iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkiler kolektivist olduğu düşünülen kültürlerde araştırılmış, benliğin ayrımlaşmasının iyi oluş üzerindeki etkisinin kolektivist kültürlerde daha zayıf olduğu ileri sürülmüştür <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chung &amp; Gale, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neff vd., 2008)</ref>. Benliği başkalarıyla yakından bağlantılı olarak gören (yüksek düzeyde karşılıklı bağımlı benlik kurgusuna sahip olanlar) bireyler için, benliğin ayrımlaşması ile iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkinin o kadar güçlü olmayabileceğini iddia edilmiştir <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chung &amp; Gale, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ross ve Murdock (2014)</ref> araştırmalarında benliğin farklılaşması ve iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkinin, bireyci kültürlerde ikamet eden (dolayısıyla tipik olarak daha yüksek bağımsız benlik kurgusu seviyelerine sahip olan) bireyler için kolektivist kültürlerde ikamet edenlere oranla daha güçlü olduğu sonucuna varmıştır. <ref type="bibr">Hocaoğlu ve Işık (2021)</ref>, beliren yetişkinlerle yürüttükleri araştırmalarında benliğin ayrımlaşması ve öznel iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkide benlik kurgusunun aracı rolü olduğunu bulmuşlardır. Araştırmanın sonuçlarına göre bağımsız benlik kurgusu ve uyum arayan birbirine bağımlı benlik kurgusu, benliğin ayrımlaşması ile öznel iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkiye aracılık ederken, reddedilmekten kaçınma, benliğin ayrımlaşması ile öznel iyi oluş arasında anlamlı bir aracılık yapmamıştır. Yani, daha yüksek benliğin ayrımlaşması, daha yüksek bağımsız benlik kurgusu ile ve daha yüksek bağımsız benlik kurgusu, daha yüksek öznel iyi oluş ile ilişkilendirilmiştir. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kağıtçıbaşı (2005)</ref> Türk toplumunda hem bireyci hem toplulukçu niteliklerin birlikte görüldüğünü ve özerk-ilişkisel benlik yapısının egemen olduğunu ifade etmektedir. Özerk ilişkisel benlikte, bireyde hem özerk hem ilişkisel benlik özellikleri bir arada bulunmaktadır. Bu benlik yapısında bağımsız olmak ön planda olup aynı zamanda duygusal açıdan diğerleri ile yakın olmak önemlidir <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kağıtçıbaşı, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Özdemir (2012)</ref> ergenler üzerinde yürüttüğü araştırmasında ilişkisel ve özerk-ilişkisel benlik kurgusunun olumlu duygular ile yaşam doyumu üzerinde; özerk benlik kurgusunun ise olumsuz duygular üzerinde etkisi bulunduğunu saptamıştır. Bir başka çalışmada da sağlıklı işlevsellik ile ilişkili olan yüksek bağlılık ve yüksek ayrılığın bir arada bulunabileceği görülmüştür <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kağıtçıbaşı &amp; Ataca, 2005)</ref>. Bu açıdan bakıldığında, Türk toplumunda özerklik ve ilişkiselliğin birlikte olmasının pozitif etkilerinden bahsedilebilir. Bu bağlamda benliğin ayrımlaşmasının bağımsızlığa daha çok değer veren toplumlar için daha uygun olan bireysel bir yapı olduğu düşünülebilir. Bundan sonraki araştırmalar için Türk toplumunda benliğin ayrımlaşmasının iyi oluşu belirlemedeki etkisi araştırılırken, benlik kurgularının etkilerinin de göz önünde bulundurulması önerilebilir.</p><p>Bu çalışmanın dikkat edilmesi gereken birkaç sınırlılığı vardır. İlk olarak, çalışmanın modelini etkileyebilecek birçok farklı değişken olmakla birlikte tüm değişkenleri böyle bir modele dâhil etmek mümkün değildir. O nedenle literatürce önemli bulduğumuz değişkenlerle sınırlandırılmıştır. İkincisi, kullanılan öz bildirim ölçütleri sosyal istenirlik nedeniyle sonuçların güvenilirliğini olumsuz etkilemiş olabilir. Örneklemin Türk üniversite öğrencileri örneklemi olması, cinsiyet oranının dengelenememiş olması, yaş ve eğitim durumlarının çeşitlilik göstermemesi araştırmanın diğer bir sınırlılığıdır. Tüm bu sınırlılıklar ulaşılan sonuçların genellenebilirliğini azaltmaktadır.</p><p>Üniversite hayatı gelişimsel görevler ve stres kaynakları bakımından öğrenciler için oldukça önemli bir dönem olup <ref type="bibr">(Özbay vd., 2012)</ref>, onlardan daha çok alanda özerk davranmaları beklenmektedir <ref type="bibr">(Cleary vd., 2011)</ref>.

Bu çalışmada benliğin ayrımlaşma düzeyi, bilişsel esneklik ve öz anlayış gibi önemli faktörlerin üniversite öğrencilerinin öznel iyi oluş düzeylerindeki etkisi ve birbiriyle ilişkileri araştırılmıştır. Bu çalışma, üniversite öğrencilerinde bu dört kavram arasındaki ilişkiyi tanımlayan nicel bir model öneren ilk çalışmadır. Bu araştırmanın sonucu, benliğin ayrımlaşması ve öznel iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkide öz-anlayış ve bilişsel esnekliğin tam aracılık etkisi olduğunu göstermiştir. Bu nedenle, üniversite öğrencilerinin iyi oluşunu etkileyecek müdahale programları geliştirebilecek olan profesyonellerin, bilişsel esnekliği ve öz anlayışı da göz önünde bulundurmaları, benliğin ayrımlaşma düzeyi düşük olan öğrencilerin de iyi oluşlarının arttırmasını sağlayabilir. Ayrıca benliğin ayrımlaşması, bilişsel esneklik ve öz anlayış ve öznel iyi oluş seviyelerindeki değişimlerin araştırıldığı boylamsal çalışmalar yapılabilir.</p></div>

These effects, respectively, are; a) Between differentiation of self, self-compassion, subjective well-being (β= .017, p&lt; .05); accordingly, differentiation of self predicts subjective well-being at a significant level through self-compassion. According to the model, there is a full mediating role of self-compassion between differentiation of self and subjective well-being. b) Between differentiation of self, cognitive flexibility, and subjective well-being (β= .004, p&lt; .05); Accordingly, differentiation of self predicts subjective well-being at a significant level through cognitive flexibility. According to the model, cognitive flexibility has a full mediating role between differentiation of self and subjective well-being. c) Between differentiation of the self, cognitive flexibility, self-compassion, and subjective well-being (β= .009, p&lt; .05). Accordingly, differentiation of self significantly predicts subjective well-being through cognitive flexibility and self-compassion. When indirect effects are examined, it is seen that selfcompassion mediates better between differentiation of self and subjective well-being.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Lowe</cell><cell>Uppe</cell></row><row><cell>Effect</cell><cell>B</cell><cell>β</cell><cell>t</cell><cell>r</cell><cell>r</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>limit</cell><cell>limit</cell></row><row><cell>differentiation of the Self→ Self-Compassion</cell><cell>.51</cell><cell>.04*</cell><cell>11.0</cell><cell>.03</cell><cell>.05</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Differentiation of the Self→ Cognitive Flexibility</cell><cell>.43</cell><cell>.04*</cell><cell>13.3</cell><cell>.03</cell><cell>.05</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Differentiation of the Self→ Subjective Well-Being</cell><cell>--</cell><cell>--</cell><cell></cell><cell>--</cell><cell>--</cell></row><row><cell>Cognitive Flexibility → Self-Compassion</cell><cell>.60</cell><cell>.42*</cell><cell>12.72</cell><cell>.34</cell><cell>.51</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Cognitive Flexibility → Subjective Well-Being</cell><cell>.17</cell><cell>.12*</cell><cell>2.79</cell><cell>.04</cell><cell>.19</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Self-Compassion→ Subjective Well-Being</cell><cell>.52</cell><cell>.51*</cell><cell>12.71</cell><cell>.45</cell><cell>.62</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Lowe</cell><cell>Uppe</cell></row><row><cell>Indirect Effects</cell><cell>B</cell><cell>β</cell><cell>t</cell><cell>r</cell><cell>r</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>limit</cell><cell>limit</cell></row><row><cell>Differentiation of the Self→ Self-Compassion→ Subjective</cell><cell>.26</cell><cell>.017*</cell><cell>8.5</cell><cell>.014</cell><cell>.020</cell></row><row><cell>Well-Being</cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Differentiation of the Self→ Cognitive Flexibility →</cell><cell>.08</cell><cell>.005*</cell><cell>2.5</cell><cell>.002</cell><cell>.008</cell></row><row><cell>Subjective Well-Being</cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Differentiation of the Self→ Cognitive Flexibility → Self-</cell><cell>.13</cell><cell>.009*</cell><cell>9.0</cell><cell>.007</cell><cell>.011</cell></row><row><cell>Compassion → Subjective Well-being</cell><cell>*</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>The total effect from the differentiation of the self to</cell><cell cols="2">47* .030*</cell><cell>15.0</cell><cell>.026</cell><cell>.034</cell></row><row><cell>subjective well-being</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note><p>Note.

Orijinal ölçek formu için iç tutarlık değerleri ölçeğin tamamı ve alt boyutları için .81 ve .92 arasında bulunmuştur. Ölçme aracı altılı Likert tipindeki 20 maddeden oluşmaktadır. BAÖ; duygusal tepkisellik, ben pozisyonu, duygusal kopma ve başkalarına bağımlılık olmak üzere dört farklı boyuttan oluşmaktadır. Bu dört boyuttan alınan puanların yüksek olması, benliğin ayrımlaşması düzeyinin yüksek olduğunu gösterir. Ölçeğin Türkçeye uyarlama çalışmalarıIşık ve Bulduk (2015)  tarafından Türkçe'ye uyarlama çalışmasında iç tutarlılığın bir göstergesi olarak Cronbach alfa değerleri; duygusal tepkisellik için .78, ben pozisyonu için .75, duygusal kopma için .77, başkalarına bağımlılık için .74 ve tüm ölçek için .81 olarak bulunmuştur. Ölçeğin test-tekrar test güvenirlik katsayısı ise .74 olarak bulunmuştur(Işık &amp; Bulduk, 2014). Bu çalışmada sadece ölçekten alınan toplam puan kullanılmış olup, ölçeğin bütünü için Cronbach alfa iç tutarlılık katsayısı .75 olarak bulunmuştur.Öz-Anlayış Ölçeği (ÖAÖ):<ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Neff (2003b)</ref> tarafından geliştirilen Öz-anlayış Ölçeğinin orijinal versiyonu beşli Likert tipinde 26 madde içermekte ve altı boyuttan oluşmaktadır. Bu boyutlar; öz sevecenlik, öz yargılama, paylaşımların bilincinde olma, izolasyon, bilinçlilik, aşırı özdeşleşmedir. Cronbach alfa katsayısı ölçeğin geneli için .92 olarak hesaplanırken, alt boyutlar için ise sırasıyla .78, .77, .80, .79, .75, .81 olarak bulunmuştur. Test tekrar test güvenirlik katsayısı tüm ölçek için .93, alt ölçekler için ise sırasıyla .88, .88, .80, .85, .85, .88 olarak hesaplanmıştır</figDesc><table><row><cell>gerçekleştirilmiştir.</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Öz Anlayış</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Benliğin Ayrımlaşması</cell><cell>Öznel İyi Oluş</cell></row><row><cell>Bilişsel Esneklik</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
