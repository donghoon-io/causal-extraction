<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A hypothesis is proposed for five visual fear signaling pathways in humans, based on an analysis of anatomical connectivity from primate studies and human functional connectvity and tractography from brain imaging studies. Earlier work has identified possible subcortical and cortical fear pathways known as the "low road" and "high road," which arrive at the amygdala independently. In addition to a subcortical pathway, we propose four cortical signaling pathways in humans along the visual ventral stream. All four of these traverse through the LGN to the visual cortex (VC) and branching off at the inferior temporal area, with one projection directly to the amygdala; another traversing the orbitofrontal cortex; and two others passing through the parietal and then prefrontal cortex, one excitatory pathway via the ventral-medial area and one regulatory pathway via the ventral-lateral area. These pathways have progressively longer propagation latencies and may have progressively evolved with brain development to take advantage of higher-level processing. Using the anatomical path lengths and latency estimates for each of these five pathways, predictions are made for the relative processing times at selective ROIs and arrival at the amygdala, based on the presentation of a fear-relevant visual stimulus. Partial verification of the temporal dynamics of this hypothesis might be accomplished using experimental MEG analysis. Possible experimental protocols are suggested.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Understanding the neurological basis of human emotional processing is a challenging problem, not only because observed neural correlates span cortical and subcortical structures, but also because experimental data may come from many different sources, including anatomical studies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and electrophysiology. Of emotional behaviors and the underlying emotional circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(LeDoux, 2000)</ref>, visual fear processing and the underlying signaling is an interesting system to investigate because it is well-studied across several animal models and produces relatively high contrasts in human imaging studies. Integrating data across experimental modalities can provide the constraints necessary for more detailed and computational models. This study was initiated to help determine these spatial and temporal constraints. Furthermore, a well-defined model of visual fear signaling can serve as a scaffolding to be extended into other emotional states. Additionally, progress on mapping of fear signaling pathways and recurrent loops could enable new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.</p><p>Fear is considered by some a basic emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ekman, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Vytal and Hamann, 2010)</ref>, which may have evolved over time at least partially in response to perceived threats from predators or dominating individuals in social orders <ref type="bibr">(Öhman, 1986)</ref>. Fear processing can encompass conscious awareness, conscious perception, pre-conscious perception, subliminal processing, or a combination of them. This investigation focused on visual fear signaling and perception, although fear processing through awareness can occur without this, for example though situational reasoning or while dreaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Robert and Zadra, 2014)</ref>. Conscious visual perception suggests that the subject can recognize and identify a particular presentation stimulus. Pre-conscious visual perception suggests that the subject has a relatively strong neural response to the presentation across the visual cortex, but either is not yet consciously aware of it, or will miss it due to the absence of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Dehaene et al., 2006)</ref>. If a pre-conscious percept never becomes conscious during a presentation trial, then the perception was also unconscious or non-conscious. Should there be no conscious perception while activation in the visual cortex was relatively weaker, the perception would be subliminal, as well as unconscious or nonconscious. If there was no conscious recognition nor neural correlates for pre-conscious or subliminal perception, then there was no perception or awareness of the stimulus. Experimental paradigms such as backward masking and attentional blink explore the differences between subliminal or pre-conscious and conscious perception, with and without emotional salience. While the neural correlates of consciousness are much debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chica and Bartolomeo, 2012)</ref>, in the case of humans it appears to at least require participation of particular cortical regions, including visual and parietal cortex for conscious visual perception, in addition to parieto-frontal activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Dehaene et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Many cortical and subcortical brain areas are believed to be involved in visual fear processing. On the subcortical side, they include the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN), pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, superior colliculus (SC), amygdala, periaqueductal gray (PAG), locus coeruleus (LC), and hypothalamus. On the cortical side, they include the hippocampus, visual cortex (VC), parietal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), insula and anterior cingulate cortex <ref type="bibr">(ACC)</ref>. In this study, the emotion of fear is assumed to be highly correlated with amygdala activation. Thus, the visual signaling of fear is assumed to occur along direct and indirect neural pathways to the amygdala, which once activated, generates further responses. Evolution likely optimized the primate response time on perceived threats to be as fast as possible, to improve survivability. Because fear and threat appraisal has neural correlates and activations across the brain, the long-range signaling likely propagates along the whitematter fasciculi, because these myelinated fibers have the fastest propagation speeds.</p><p>Fear processing has been hypothesized to have parallel "low road" and "high road" pathways, from fear conditioning and lesion studies on rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(LeDoux, 1996)</ref>. The low road is thought to be fastest and completely subcortical, while also unconscious <ref type="bibr">(Öhman et al., 2007)</ref>, although there is debate on this <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Pessoa et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010)</ref>. The high road traverses sensory and higher cortices, and can encompass conscious perception. Regarding the low road, evidence exists from blindsight patients that perceptual signaling travels from the retina to the SC and back to the pulvinar nucleus, before arriving at the lateral nucleus of the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Morris et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Morris et al., , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Pegna et al., 2005)</ref>. Anatomical evidence from tract tracing and electron microscopy in the tree shew shows projections from the SC to the lateral amygdala via the dorsal pulvinar <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Day-Brown et al., 2010)</ref>. In humans, projections were found between the SC and amygdala via the pulvinar in vivo, using DTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">(Tamietto et al., 2012)</ref>. Along this pathway, the SC is capable of image detection of fear-relevant stimuli at low spatial frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">(Vuilleumier et al., 2003)</ref>. A recent study found that neurons in the macaque pulvinar can respond selectively to snakes in 55 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Van Le et al., 2013)</ref>, which is likely too short for a cortical route. It has also been found that the amygdala can be activated with low latencies from a fear-relevant stimulus in about 40-120 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Luo et al., 2010)</ref>, perhaps along the low road.</p><p>While dual pathways were initially observed in rats, there is functional evidence this applies to primates and specifically humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Rudrauf et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Garrido et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Garvert et al., 2014)</ref> as well. Connectivity from anterograde and retrograde tracing studies in primates and diffusion tractography in humans appear to indicate multiple possible high-road pathways through multiple sensory cortices, as well as multi-area recurrence. An overview of some of this connectivity is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For vision in macaque monkeys, part of the visual stimulus travels from the LGN though the VC, along the ventral "what" pathway to the inferior temporal cortex (IT), where it directly projects to the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Webster et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baizer et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cheng et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Stefanacci and Amaral, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Freese and Amaral, 2005)</ref>. IT also projects to the OFC, parietal cortex and PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Webster et al., 1994)</ref>. In addition, emotional pathways to the amygdala in macaque monkeys have been anatomically identified from the OFC and PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Carmichael and Price, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Barbas et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barbas, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cho et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, there is evidence for several different parallel pathways from IT to the amygdala, each of which may have different correlated behavioral characteristics and propagation times. Indeed, a "multiple-waves model" was proposed which reflects this connectivity between visual areas and areas involved in emotional processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010)</ref>. The present investigation seeks to further identify fear signaling pathways by first identifying functional evidence on relevant brain regions for fear, followed by identifying the evidence for connectivity between these regions which converge on the amygdala and then proposing information processing, signaling and latencies across this connectivity for behavioral differentiation. Finally, experiments are proposed to test and potentially modify this signaling hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brain Areas of Fear Processing</head><p>There is ongoing debate on what constitutes functional emotional processing in general in the primate and human brain. One approach considers basic emotions and the correlated locations of activity during these emotional behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Phan et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Murphy et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Vytal and Hamann, 2010)</ref>. Another FIGURE 1 | Overview of some brain regions involved in fear processing and some of the connectivity between them. Abbreviations are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The "low road" pathway is shown in red.</p><p>approach investigates networks and groups of activity across a construction of emotional dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Barrett and Wager, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Kober et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Lindquist et al., 2012)</ref>. Still another view considers an evolutionary stratification into instinctual, learned and thought-related processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Panksepp and Watt, 2011)</ref>. The approach taken here considers the basic emotion of fear as activity across a distributed network of brain areas, but does not assume these areas are unique to fear. Further, this distributed activity may correspond with evolutionary stratification of instinctual, learned and thought-related signaling pathways, with progressively longer latencies. Of brain areas activated in functional imaging studies that include fear, those considered for visual signaling pathways are described.</p><p>The amygdala complex is conserved across vertebrates and particularly mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Moreno and Gonzalez, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">LeDoux, 2012)</ref>. It appears to be necessary for fear processing in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(LeDoux, 1996)</ref> and in primates, considering that damage may result in fearlessness, as was observed early in Rhesus monkeys with Klüver-Bucy syndrome, which entails bilateral lesions of the anterior temporal lobe <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[Klüver and</ref><ref type="bibr">Bucy, 1939, republished Klüver and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Bucy (1997)</ref>]. A patient S.M. with bilateral amygdala lesions that occurred sometime after the age of 10, has had no fear experiences after this time while still exhibiting other emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Feinstein et al., 2011)</ref>. Some studies of epileptic patients have shown that direct stimulation of the amygdala with electrodes can induce fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chapman et al., 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Lanteaume et al., 2007)</ref>. While the amydgala can be activated during functional imaging experiments when a subject views happy faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd, 2004)</ref>, angry faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Whalen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Pichon et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Pichon et al., , 2009) )</ref> and others, the effects of fearful faces are strongest <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Whalen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Costafreda et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Mattavelli et al., 2014)</ref>. Functional meta-analysis of PET and fMRI emotional studies showed that fear-relevant stimuli specifically engaged the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Phan et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Murphy et al., 2003)</ref>. In addition, a study of nine human subjects with partial or complete bilateral amygdala damage showed significant impairment on recognizing fearful expressions, but not happy ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adolphs et al., 1999)</ref>. However, at least one study of two human subjects did not find impaired recognition of fearful faces with complete bilateral amygdala lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Hamann and Adolphs, 1999)</ref>. Still, recognizing fearful faces may not constitute experiencing fear.</p><p>The primate amygdala has both cortical and subcortical afferents and efferents and is composed of about 13 interconnected nuclei which can be divided into two major groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aggleton, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Price et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">McDonald, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Sah et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Freese and Amaral, 2009)</ref>. The evolutionarily older central (Ce) and medial (M) nuclei consist mostly of inhibitory medium spiny neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Martina et al., 1999)</ref>, while the evolutionarily newer cortical-like nuclei are grouped as the basolateral complex (BLA) and a superficial nuclear group consist of pyramidal cells and interneurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hall, 1972)</ref>. The nuclei in the BLA include the lateral (LA), basal (B), and accessory basal (AB) nuclei. The B and AB are also called the basolateral and basomedial nucleus, respectively. The BLA nuclei receive input and context from different cortical areas and the hippocampus, which appear to collectively compute possible danger and emotional salience, outputting via cortical efferents as well as through the Ce and M nuclei. The Ce projects to the hypothalamus <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002)</ref> and may activate it for release of stress hormones, as well as the PAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Rizvi et al., 1991)</ref> for antinociceptive activity. Evidence exists in rats that severing connections between the BLA and Ce remove conditioned fear responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Jimenez and Maren, 2009)</ref>. Between some nuclei are the intercalated cell masses (ITC), which inhibit excitatory projections between the BLA and the Ce <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Royer et al., 1999)</ref>, lowering amygdala output activity. The amygdala has many reciprocal neocortical afferents and efferents and once activated, influences perception <ref type="bibr">(Öhman et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>While IT projects to the amygdala, the amygdala projects back to the VC along the ventral stream from primary visual cortex (V1) to IT area TE <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Carmichael and Price, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Stefanacci and Amaral, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Freese and</ref><ref type="bibr">Amaral, 2005, 2006)</ref> and can heighten visual awareness during activation, potentially assisting a pre-conscious fear-relevant stimulus in becoming consciously perceived <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Vuilleumier and Driver, 2007)</ref>. The B and AB nuclei also project to the ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cho et al., 2013)</ref>. The primate VC is composed of some 32 regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Felleman and Van Essen, 1991)</ref>, which have been grouped into a ventral "what" stream and a dorsal "where" stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">(Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982)</ref> or "what" and "how" streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Goodale and Milner, 1992)</ref>, all of which generally begin at V1. The focus of this investigation is on the ventral stream [V1↔(V2,V3)↔V4↔IT(TEO,TE)], where some aspects of fearrelevant stimuli can be pre-consciously perceived. In addition to serial and hierarchical processing of visual attributes, ventral visual areas also have complex connectivity, including substantial feedback projections and connections to and from subcortical areas. For example, V1 projects to V3, V4 and MT as well as V2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Kravitz et al., 2013)</ref>. Visual inputs from the retinas are delivered largely to V1 via the LGN, and propagate up to IT areas where object-level recognition can occur, and feedback from V1 to the LGN occurs as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Briggs and Usrey, 2011)</ref>. There is evidence the LGN also lightly projects directly to IT <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Webster et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Hernández-González et al., 1994)</ref> as well as V2, V4, and MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bullier and Kennedy, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Sincich et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gattass et al., 2014)</ref>. From IT, the ventral visual stream splits and propagates to several regions, including the parietal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Distler et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Webster et al., 1994)</ref>, the LA and B nuclei of the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Webster et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baizer et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cheng et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Stefanacci and Amaral, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Freese and Amaral, 2005)</ref>, the lateral OFC (lOFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Webster et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Kondo et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barbas, 2007)</ref> and the frontal eye fields (FEF) in the PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Webster et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Schall et al., 1995)</ref>. TE and to a lesser extent TEO also projects to vlPFC, although the function is not yet clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Webster et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Saleem et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Gerbella et al., 2010)</ref> and may involve auditory processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Medalla and Barbas, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The OFC is a highly interconnected region in the primate brain, with connections between sensory and prefrontal cortices as well as limbic structures, including bidirectional connections with the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Carmichael and Price, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Rolls, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barbas, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Price, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cho et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Timbie and Barbas, 2014)</ref>. While the amygdala learns about emotional and fearful stimuli, the OFC does this as well, while also computing a punishment or reward value <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Rolls, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Dolan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Rolls and Grabenhorst, 2008)</ref>. The OFC is often divided into lateral/medial and anterior/posterior divisions. The lOFC receives visual stimuli from IT and other sensory areas, with the strongest visual projections from TE <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Webster et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Kondo et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barbas, 2007)</ref>, likely over the uncinate fasciculus (UF). The lOFC is believed to be more active when processing aversive stimuli, while the medial OFC (mOFC) is more active when processing reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(O'Doherty et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004)</ref>. Learned punishments (or fears) and rewards are conditioned responses or secondary reinforcers from unconditioned stimuli or primary reinforcers <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(LeDoux, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Rolls, 2005)</ref>. The mOFC projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and likely stimulates it on expected reward. Along the anterior/posterior axis, simpler reinforcers are represented in the posterior area and become progressively more complex toward the anterior <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Kringelbach, 2005)</ref>. The posterior OFC (pOFC) has the strongest connections with the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barbas, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Barbas et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Timbie and Barbas, 2014)</ref>, with unidirectional projections from the pOFC to the ITC and bidirectional projections between the pOFC and the B and AB nuclei. The pOFC also receives inputs from sensory and olfactory cortices. While anatomical studies show strong pOFC connectivity, functional imaging studies typically have distinguished only between lOFC and mOFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Kahnt et al., 2012)</ref>, so it is assumed that pOFC and mOFC functional activity are blended together. Projections from other areas of the OFC also innervate the basal, AB, Ce, LA nuclei and ITC in the amygdala, while projections back to OFC originate in the basal, AB and LA nuclei.</p><p>The PFC is a large cortical area attributed to many functions in executive control. Along the medial-lateral axis, processing is self-referential to situational, along the ventral-dorsal axis, processing is emotional to cognitive and along the posterioranterior axis, processing is more visceral to abstract. The PFC is typically divided into several regions, three of which will be focused on here. These are the medial PFC (mPFC), dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and the ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC). Activity in the mPFC has been correlated with self-referential processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Gusnard et al., 2001)</ref> and extinction, while situational processing is more lateral <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Ochsner et al., 2004)</ref>.

Along the dorsalventral axis, the dlPFC has been implicated for abstract reasoning and working memory, while the vlPFC appears more focused on emotional regulation and self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Cohen et al., 2013)</ref>. Internally, the mPFC, dlPFC, and vlPFC are all interconnected, and each also has varying connectivity to the OFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">(Yeterian et al., 2011)</ref>. The vlPFC in particular has strong connections to the lOFC, is adjacent to it, and sometimes considered overlapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Petrides and Pandya, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Cohen et al., 2013)</ref>. The mPFC also has projections to the NAcc in the ventral striatum.

Projections from the mPFC are excitatory, and there are two hypotheses on how they may also have an inhibitory effect on amygdala activity. The first suggests that since both the B and AB are cortical-like with pyramidal cells and interneurons, the interneurons may be directly targeted to inhibit the pyramidal cells disynaptically, while the second suggests that ITC cells could be targeted, inhibiting BLA to central nucleus projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">(Quirk et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2004)</ref>.

Tract II may be most relevant for spatial awareness, passing visual information on to mPFC and working memory in the dlPFC, as well as more laterally to the vlPFC. Anatomically, the parietal cortex does not appear to project to the amygdala directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Stefanacci and Amaral, 2002)</ref>, but is part of other pathways to the amygdala. The posterior parietal does project to the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Kravitz et al., 2011)</ref>, which is adjacent to the amygdala.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Multiple High Road Hypothesis</head><p>Among the many emotional pathways in the human brain, several appear to be utilized in fear signaling. These may not be unique to fear and may also be used in other emotional behaviors. In addition, some emotional pathways may inhibit others, while some might have mixed activity. For example, fear and anger have overlapping pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Pichon et al., 2009)</ref> and may coexist while fear and happiness are less likely to do so. Macaque anatomical and human tractography data indicate several different pathways from the visual sensory system to the amygdala, including the low and high roads. These are likely emotional pathways which might be utilized in fear processing. Functional connectivity from imaging studies can help validate this. However, even among fear pathways, activation may depend on the type of stimulus and response, and vary across different experimental protocols. In human imaging studies, pictures of fearful, emotional, and neural faces are often used <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ekman and Friesen, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Fusar-Poli et al., 2009)</ref>, although this may entail the perception of fear, and not necessarily the actual experience of fear. Some stimuli might be conditioned to produce a fear response while other unconditioned stimuli may produce a cognitive or situationally driven fear response. An ongoing challenge is to determine what stimulus and response corresponds to activation in what pathways.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows a detailed subset of known connectivity between brain regions involved in fear processing, as well as the hypothesized fear signaling pathways for vision, all of which exhibited experimental evidence for both functional and direct anatomical connectivity. However, in addition to the pathways illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, others likely exist. Connections with the adjacent hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Saunders et al., 1988)</ref> were not considered, which are known to play a role in fear conditioning, based on spatial cues and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(LeDoux, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alvarez et al., 2008)</ref>. A fearful place for example, might trigger a visual signal via the posterior parietal to the hippocampus and on to the amygdala, but there is not yet functional evidence for this in primates. The FEF is bidirectionally connected to the VC, IT and parietal cortex, and projects to the PFC as well. In addition to saccade control, the FEF is known to modulate attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chica et al., 2014)</ref>, but does not project to the amygdala directly. Hypothesized magnocellular projections to the mOFC have been suggested to preferably transfer low spatial frequency features before IT might see it <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bar et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Kveraga et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chaumon et al., 2014)</ref>, but the anatomical evidence is still uncertain. While IT and particularly TE strongly projects to OFC, weak projections were found from the IPS area of the posterior parietal to the lOFC in monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Morecraft et al., 1992)</ref>, along with projections to the FEF from the superior temporal sulcus <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Schall et al., 1995)</ref>. Still, in humans, the inferior fronto-occipital fasiculus (IFOF) appears to project from the parietal dorsal stream to the lateral and basal OFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Martino et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Sarubbo et al., 2013)</ref>. A sub-cortical route to OFC is possible through the amygdala or pulvinar, although the amygdala is not likely to transfer details in low spatial frequency features. It is also possible for the signal to arrive at the mOFC rapidly via IT, which can be activated in 80-110 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Rolls et al., 2005)</ref>, possibly along the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) or even directly via the LGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Webster et al., 1993)</ref>, followed by traversing the UF to the OFC. A pathway to the amygdala through the insula is also possible, since both the OFC and PFC project to it directly. Movement can induce fear as well. Visual-vestibular input can induce fear when falling, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Coelho and Balaban, 2015)</ref>. There also exists evidence of a vestibular pathway to the amygdala. The vestibular nuclei have been found to project to the parabrachial nucleus in primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Balaban et al., 2002)</ref>, which in turn have direct bi-directional connections to the amygdala Ce, as well as indirect connections via the hypothalamus and OFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balaban and Thayer, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the low-road pathway described earlier (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> in red; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, pathway p1), four additional cortical high-road pathways (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, p2-5) for visual fear signaling were identified. All the cortical pathways include part of the ventral stream, traversing through the LGN to V1 and propagating up the visual hierarchy to IT. From IT, they branch off and traverse different brain areas before arriving at the amygdala. Elements of the dorsal stream were not included, except for LIP/IPS. The pathways were also confined to a single hemisphere for simplicity, not including cross-overs to the contralateral side. While the low road has evidence of being  unconscious, some cortical pathways may be unconscious as well. As seen in hemineglect and attentional studies, conscious visual perception likely requires gating through the frontoparietal network <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Dehaene et al., 2006)</ref>. The shortest cortical pathway (p2) projects from IT, directly to the LA and B nuclei of the amygdala, and is excitatory. There are two possible variations of this, because anatomical projections from IT to the amygdala exist through both TEO and TE. In the case of presented face stimulation, the fusiform face area (FFA) is proximal to TEO, so this is one possible route for emotional faces, and likely the most salient one. The next shortest cortical pathway (p3) projects from IT to OFC, and then to the amygdala. TE projects strongly to lOFC, in addition to pOFC and mOFC. TEO projects to lOFC as well. While lOFC projects to the amygdala directly, an additional possible route is traversing through the pOFC to both the BLA and ITC masses in the amygdala. This can enable or inhibit amygdala activation generally, depending on conditioning and any extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">(Sotres-Bayon et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Li et al., 2009)</ref>. Both the p2 and p3 pathways are postulated to encompass pre-conscious perception, though they may engender a feeling when activated. Damage to the p2 and p3 pathways are hypothesized to cause Capgras syndrome, where patients lose the emotional response to seeing family members, and think they are impostors <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">(Young et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Hirstein and Ramachandran, 1997)</ref>. Previous experiments disrupting IT processing suggest p2 and p3 pathways are also disrupted. In a binocular rivalry experiment, a suppressed image was either a fearful face or chair. When contrasted, the fearful face showed activation along the low road, but no differential activity in the FFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Pasley et al., 2004)</ref>. In a subsequent experiment where conscious perception was suppressed with a combination of binocular rivalry and motion flash suppression while contrasting fearful faces and houses, differential activity was seen in the VC and FFA, along with the FEF, IPL, and insula <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Troiani et al., 2014)</ref>. These experiments show neural correlates corresponding to pathway p2, assuming the observed insula activation was via an amygdala efferent. The other two hypothesized signaling pathways to the amygdala both project from IT to LIP in the parietal cortex and through the frontoparietal gateway to the PFC. The mPFC is known to be bidirectionally connected to the amygdala BLA, with stronger unidirectional connections from the ACC to BLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Ghashghaei et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Signaling pathway p4 innervates the mPFC on route to the amygdala and is believed to be partially responsible for fear learning and extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Phelps et al., 2004)</ref>. However, the mPFC may receive a fear-relevant visual stimulus stream from IT via both the frontoparietal network and through the OFC (branching from pathway p3), which can propagate up an expected aversive or appetitive value. If visual awareness from the frontoparietal stream does not meet expectations (i.e., a threat is not real), then to achieve extinction, the mPFC may down-regulate the amygdala and signal the OFC to reduce the encoded value. Amygdala BLA to mPFC signaling may also up-regulate attention when a fear-relevant stimulus is present. The anticipation of an unpredictable and unlearned pain stimulus has been found to increase activity in the ACC, vmPFC and PAG, while an expected learned pain stimulus showed reduced ACC and vmPFC activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Hsieh et al., 1999)</ref>. Some disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can show resistance to extinction and lower activity levels in the mPFC during extinction recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Koenigs and Grafman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Milad et al., 2009)</ref>. vmPFC lesions have also been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders, where patients exhibited higher amygdala responses to adverse images. This indicates that the vmPFC may be important for some fear regulation, particularly, with regards to self <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Heatherton, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Motzkin et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The final pathway (p5) enables inhibitory cortical control of fear from fear-relevant visual stimuli. From the frontoparietal network, it traverses the dlPFC to the vlPFC, then projecting down to the lOFC and through the pOFC to ITC masses of the amygdala, for inhibition. This pathway might also provide excitatory cortical control of fear via projections from pOFC to the B and AB nuclei, but there is not yet experimental evidence for this. Higher vlPFC and lOFC activity are correlated with emotional control <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Phan et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hooker and Knight, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Cohen et al., 2013)</ref> and damage to these areas can result in a loss of inhibitory emotional control. The vlPFC has been found to be negatively correlated with activation of the amygdala and mOFC during reappraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Ochsner et al., 2002)</ref>. Activity in the lOFC has also been correlated with reappraisal of negative stimuli, while activity in the dlPFC was active more generally during reappraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Golkar et al., 2012)</ref>. Emotional regulation has been found to be both willful and automatic, and data shows that willful regulation has higher activity in lateral PFC (lPFC) and automatic regulation has higher activity in the mPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Etkin and Wager, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Phillips et al., 2008)</ref>. Dysregulation may also occur with this pathway. For example, it was found that phobic subjects showed hypoactivity in the dlPFC and lOFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Carlsson et al., 2004)</ref> as well as mPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Hermann et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Hermann et al., , 2009))</ref>. However, in addition to activation of the vlPFC and down-regulation of the amygdala during some effortful regulation tasks with negative emotional stimuli, some studies have found possible mediation via the vmPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Urry et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Johnstone et al., 2007)</ref>. While this may be similar to pathway p4, it does not explain lOFC activity in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Phillips et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Carlsson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Wager et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Golkar et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>All five of these pathways as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> have different lengths and latencies, so fear-relevant signals will arrive at the amygdala at different times. As this is happening, projections away from the amygdala will also have a behavioral effect, releasing norepinephrine via the LC for alertness, upregulating attention and boosting activity in recurrent loops. Amygdala efferents to PFC can also initiate reappraisal, which can either reduce or increase the fear response, depending on the perceived danger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicted Fear Signaling Pathway Latencies</head><p>Given the hypothesized fear signaling pathways, signal propagation latencies between regions of interest (ROI) along these pathways were predicted, as well as the total arrival times at the amygdala. To achieve this, coordinates of anatomical structures relevant to the pathways were represented with selective ROIs from the brain imaging literature. These ROIs are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. However, coordinates for these anatomical regions can vary considerably from study to study, depending on individual differences, experimental contrasts and analysis techniques. Thus, they are meant as approximations. ROIs along the pathways are connected with either fiber tract fasciculi or long-range projections. These projections are generally FIGURE 3 | View of five visual fear signaling pathways to the amygdala. Abbreviations are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Pathways p1 is red, p2 is orange, p3 is orange to yellow at V4, p4 is orange to green at TEO, and p5 is orange to green at TEO, then blue at LIP. Projections between ROIs are shown as straight for simplicity, but these represented white matter fibers are typically curved with slightly longer lengths. Some ROI positions were slightly altered for clarity. curved in and around anatomical areas and are not typically completely straight. While DTI techniques render and trace some of these fibers, the curvature lengths between ROIs have yet to be determined. Thus, as a first approximation of fiber tract lengths between ROIs, Euclidian distance was used, although the actual lengths would typically be at least slightly longer. Length estimates between ROIs can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. Given a length estimate of each pathway edge, the total length of each pathway can be estimated, starting from the LGN or SC and ending at the amygdala. With simplifying assumptions that the neural propagation speed along the fasciculi is relatively uniform, and the synaptic integration time at each ROI is similar, a rough estimate can be made for the total latency of each fear pathway. Evidence exists that neural signaling propagation speeds in human cortical fibers may be around 2 m/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Reed et al., 2004)</ref>, although this is uncertain. In macaques, feedforward and feedback conduction velocities between areas V1 and V2 have been found to be about 3.5 m/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Girard et al., 2001)</ref>. Neural integration time has previously been assumed to be about 5-10 ms within areas of primate VC <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Nowak and Bullier, 1997)</ref>. 10 ms was used here, although cortical and subcortical neurons may behave differently in this respect. The signal propagation time of visual stimuli from retina to LGN has been found to be about 40 ms in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Krolak-Salmon et al., 2003)</ref> and comparable to macaques, which have been measured faster at 33 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000)</ref>. Adding this latency to the estimated pathway latencies can predict actual latencies for signal arrival at the amygdala, which can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. By using these assumptions for neural propagation speed and integration time, it is possible to estimate the temporal signal progression of each of the pathways, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have put forward a hypothesis of a multiple pathway model for fear processing and suggest that this multiplicity has evolved as part of the evolutionary drive to process and regulate fear reactions in a sophisticated manner and thereby move away from the reflex automata.

Such latencies may indicate pathway p1 or p2 activation, because the other signaling pathways have longer estimated propagation times. Attentional gating is believed to occur later in the visual processing stream, after IT activation but between the parietal cortex and PFC. Attentional blink can happen when two expected visual targets, T1 followed by T2, are presented between 200 and 500 ms apart. Emotionally salient targets have been shown to modulate the attentional blink <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Trippe et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ciesielski et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Schwabe et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Qian et al., 2012)</ref>. An emotionally salient T1 has been found to increase the blink while an emotionally salient T2 has been shown to reduce it <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Schwabe et al., 2011)</ref>. In addition, a electrophysiology study showed a P300 event-related potential (ERP) was present when detecting T2 and was stronger when T2 was fear-relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Trippe et al., 2007)</ref>. These studies seem to indicate that emotional stimuli are more likely to grab attention. Another ERP study showed that when contrasting a seen-absent T2, the ventral VC is fully active at 96 ms (P1 ERP), the parietal lobe is active at 180 ms (N1 ERP) and the PFC is active at 276 ms (N2 ERP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Sergent et al., 2005)</ref>. To contrast attentional pathway activations via pathway p4, recognition and non-recognition of T2 can be contrasted when T2 is fear-relevant and not. If the pathway hypothesis is correct, recognition of the fear-relevant target should show higher activity in pathway p4 than a neutral target would. Backward masking of a fear-relevant T2 may show higher activity in IT when the SOA is high enough for T2 to be perceived. Contrasting this with seen vs. unseen may also show differential activity along pathway p2 or p3 when comparing a masked fear-relevant T2 with an unmasked but missed (unseen) T2. However, higher neocortical activations might also occur from arousal and norepinephrine release via projections from the LC, which were activated earlier by lower subcortical pathways.</p><p>Other ways to separate activation of these pathways include using protocols for fear conditioning on the OFC pathway (pathway p3), reasoned fear (pathway p4), or fear regulation and suppression (pathway p5). Reasoned fear might occur when an unconditioned stimulus presents a situation where danger or a threat might occur and is recognized as such from visuospatial reasoning. Fear regulation and suppression may occur when the subject is told to actively try to suppress fear. Voluntary suppression of negative affect in an fMRI study showed higher activity in the PFC including the lateral areas and attenuated activity in limbic areas including the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Phan et al., 2005)</ref>. The absence of regulation can also be contrasted between phobics and controls when presented with fear-relevant phobic stimuli.</p><p>Possible experimental protocols for testing these pathways are described in the Appendix. fMRI can provide spatial localization of ROIs and MEG can provide temporal and causal information. Ideally, if protocols for backward masking, attentional blink, fear conditioning, reasoned fear, and fear regulation could be performed on the same subjects, it may be easier to discriminate between different pathway activities. While it is unlikely that MEG can see signal propagation along axonal fibers, it can identify activity in ROIs along a pathway. However, ROIs and dipoles detected with MEG cannot be resolved if closer than 1 cm apart.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>There is ongoing debate on whether MEG dipoles can be detected at the amygdala or not, but some experimental evidence exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Cornwell et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Luo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Balderston et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Dumas et al., 2013)</ref>. While the evolutionarily older Ce and M nuclei are composed of inhibitory neural populations, the newer nuclei of the BLA consist of pyramidal and stellate cells that may produce dipoles, although perhaps too deep and weak to be reliably detected. However, a recent MEG study found enhanced amygdala activity at 130-170 ms and later at 310-350 ms after visual presentation when contrasting the response to fearful and neutral faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Dumas et al., 2013)</ref>. Another MEG study of human responses to fearful and neutral faces found an amygdala response 40-140 ms unaffected by attentional load while a response 280-410 ms was modulated by attentional load <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Luo et al., 2010)</ref>. Intracranial EEGs are another technique which has shown some success in measuring amygdala activity. One intracranial ERP study found higher amygdala gamma-band activity at 50-150 ms, peaking at 135 ms when comparing the response to fearful and neutral facial expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Sato et al., 2011)</ref>, while another intracranial study of emotional faces showed a fear response in the amygdala after 200 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Krolak-Salmon et al., 2004)</ref>. These responses may be due to selective activations of the proposed pathways. Fearful facial expressions may activate pre-consciously along pathway p2 and perhaps the sub-cortical pathway p1 on some occasions, perhaps from the eyes. The later peaks may be the result of signal propagation across the SLF (frontoparietal gateway) and may show activation of pathways p4 and p5. While the predicted latencies for pathways p4 and p5 is a little shorter than what was observed for attended fear responses, this may be due to actual longer fiber lengths in the SLF, longer neural integration time in the PFC and signal switching to the contralateral side.</p><p>If the approximate timing of the separate signal arrivals at the amygdala can be predicted, they may be easier to find in temporal space. If it is not possible to detect the signal arrival at the amygdala, it could be approximated as a hidden node, with activation of the central nucleus validated by the skin conductance response (SCR) or other correlates. However, the SCR response is too slow to validate timing. Afferent fear signals that arrive at the amygdala first will propagate out through efferents such as the LC or VC, which may interfere with resolving other afferents. In addition, other pathways may have loops and recurrence, such as through the OFC. However, if the latencies between ROIs are resolvable, these effects could be isolated. On longer timescales, reappraisals can occur, producing even more signaling. Another possible experimental technique is to use transcranial magnetic stimulation to knock out ROI nodes along a signaling pathway, to see if the downstream signal propagation was interrupted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix Proposed Multi-pathway Experiments</head><p>The purpose of these proposed experiments is to explore signaling, cortical processing, and regulation of visually induced human fear and to determine if this processing corresponds to the proposed fear signaling pathways. It can encompass five different experiments which may validate these individual signaling pathways or combinations of them. However, if the experiments for each of these pathways can be performed on the same subjects, it may be easier in the analysis to discriminate between the different pathway activations. Combining experiments could also reduce the amount of any needed pain stimulation. While these experiments could be performed on MEG alone, duplicating the experiments on fMRI would provide higher spatial resolution as well. If the fear signaling pathways prove to be false, these data would provide enough spatial and temporal constraints to suggest alternatives. For example, if fear signaling is significantly gated through the pulvinar <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010)</ref>, or along the dorsal visual stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chaumon et al., 2014)</ref>, differing signaling latencies with functional activity may provide a signature for discrimination.</p><p>Experiments are proposed for backward masking, fearrelevant attentional blink, fear conditioning, reasoned fear and fear regulation, each of which should show differential activity. For example, it is hypothesized that responses to a conditioned fear stimulus will show higher activation of a pathway from IT via the OFC to the amygdala and responses to reasoning-based fear will show higher activation of a pathway from IT via the parietial cortex, PFC and OFC to the amygdala. Because the reasoningbased pathway is longer, activation of the amygdala should have a longer latency than for conditioned fear responses. Parallel activation of signaling pathways may produce multiple pulses of amygdala activation at different time points. The SCR could be measured on all experiments to provide additional validation of amygdala activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1-Fear Conditioning</head><p>Fear conditioning experiments are often done using emotional and neutral faces. However, this may make it difficult to mix differently conditioned stimuli in subsequent protocols. Instead of faces, the subject can be presented with a 10 × 10 matrix of colored pixels which are set at random between trials (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">A1A</ref>). Every second (for signal detection in fMRI), the color will be flipped on some pixels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">A1B</ref>) for transitioning until a recognizable pattern forms (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">A1C-E</ref>). Some completed patterns will be associated with pain, others with reward and the remaining will not have salient associations. It is assumed that the anticipation of pain will usually generate some fear response. Pain can be inflicted with a thumb press, electric shock, or either at random. Uncertainty of the pain source may provide a better fear response. A reward might be a picture of a bank note that the subject can keep, or some percentage of it. Reward stimuli may provide a stronger contrast to fear (anticipated pain) than just the absence of pain would, because there may be competitive neural circuits. The SCR can be measured to determine if the pain and reward stimulus has been conditioned. It is hypothesized that a conditioned fear response from the icons would activate pathway p3. The response to icons can also be contrasted with emotional or conditioned faces, which may show higher activation through pathway p2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2-Backward Masking</head><p>The low road (pathway p1) has been previously hypothesized to recognize simpler fear-relevant visual stimuli such as eyes, spiders and snakes via the pulvinar and SC. The FFA has been previously found to recognize facial features and may encompass pathway p2. Complex images may be recognized at TE as well as TEO/FFA and may encompass pathway p3. A backward masking protocol can investigate any differences in activations of these pathways with fear-relevant simple images (eyes, spiders, snakes), emotional faces and more complex conditioned images, when contrasting an SOA of around 20 ms with 100 ms. The fear conditioned icons from the previous experiment can be used if the experiments are done together. If amygdala activity can be detected with MEG, with intracranial EEG or with electrodes, any differences in latency alone may provide differentiation between pathways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3-Fear-relevant Attentional Blink</head><p>Contrasting fear-relevant target detection with non-detection in an attentional blink paradigm can help indicate where and when attentional gating occurs along pathway p4. Given a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream of numbers and targets every 100 ms (or lag), targets can be randomly selected to be neutral or fear-relevant. The subject must know a target to expect and indicate after a trial what was seen, with a button press or otherwise. Different categories of targets can be used, such as fearful and neutral faces or fear-conditioned and neutral icons from the fear conditioning experiment described earlier.</p><p>It is expected that pathways p2 (for faces) or p3 (for icons) would activate on fear-relevant targets regardless of if they were consciously seen or not, and would typically generate an amygdala response. However, a second amygdala response should occur via p4 if a fear-relevant target is seen, with the longer predicted latency. Thus, contrasting neutral unseen targets with fear-relevant unseen targets might show pathway p2 or p3 activation and contrasting neutral seen with fear-relevant seen targets might show additional pathway p4 activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4-Reasoned Fear</head><p>For the reasoned fear protocol (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">A2</ref>), pairs of painassociated and reward-associated patterns from the fear conditioning protocol can be combined into composites. These composites can emerge from an initial random pattern and either complete as the full composite or transition to the pain or reward associated pattern. At some point, the subject should recognize the pattern shift through visuospatial analysis, which should evoke a response. In the first trial set, the subject can only observe the transitions, which can lead to reward, pain or no extra stimulation. In the second trial set, if the subject decides that the pain-associated pattern is emerging, the subject may press a button to stop the expected pain. But, if the subject is wrong, the pain will be administered regardless. This prevents just pushing the button to avoid the pain. The timing of the button press also helps mark the decision point in time, after a motor delay. At the realization of expected pain and near the decision point of pressing the button to avoid pain, pathway p4 should activate. Contrasting the first and second trial set may indicate activity from intended motor action.</p><p>Experiment 5-Fear Regulation</p><p>The protocol for fear regulation (Figure <ref type="figure">A3</ref>) is similar to reasoned fear. The subjects are again presented randomly with the fear-conditioned or neutral stimuli, but without a button press. The subjects are told that if they can suppress their fear or anxiety, painful stimuli will not occur when pain-associated patterns are presented. They will be told that this can be determined by the SCR measurements. However, whether pain is administered or not will actually be determined randomly, in the case of multiple trials. The suppression of fear should show higher activation along pathway p5. If some phobic subjects are used, phobic images can also be presented randomly along with the pain and neutral stimuli. The response to phobic images can be contrasted with the neutral and fear-relevant stimuli. It is expected that active fear suppression would have stronger contrasts between fear-relevant and neutral stimuli as compared with phobic dysregulation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 2 |</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIGURE 2 | Primate network diagram showing a subset of relevant brain areas and projections for visual fear signaling.
