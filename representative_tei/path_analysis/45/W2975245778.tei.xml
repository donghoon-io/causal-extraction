Bank Pembangunan Daerah (BPD) Head Office and Main Branch, Padang. This study uses quantitative descriptive method with primary and secondary data obtained through observation, interviews, and questionnaires to 195 employees as respondents. The data analyzed by Path Analysis using SPSS software. The result shows that emotional intelligence and work life balance has a significant effect on career development. Moreover, career development, emotional intelligence, and work life balance also have significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior. Few studies have discussed on direct effect of single variable (e.g. emotional intelligence, work life balance, career development) on organizational citizenship behavior. However, this is the first study to investigate career development as mediating variables that play the effect of emotional intelligence and work life balance on organizational citizenship behavior. Emotional intelligence and work life balance are treated as independent variables and organizational citizenship behavior as the dependent variable and career development as mediating variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Organizations have various kinds of resources as 'inputs' to be transformed to 'output' in the form of goods or services. These resources include capital or money, technology to support the production process, methods or strategies used to operate, humans and so on. Among these resources, human resource is the most important elements. Organizational citizenship behavior is the role of employees beyond their job description in order to support the effectiveness of organizational activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Robbins (2007)</ref> suggests that organizational citizenship behavior is a choice behavior that is not part of an employee's formal work obligations, but supports the organization's function effectively. A person with a high organizational citizenship behavior demonstrates helping behavior towards others although it is not their duties and obligations. Jobs that are dealing directly with community requires employees who have high organizational behavior as at times they will need to provide services that are beyond their formal obligations but necessary to ensure achievement of organization's goals. Employees who have voluntary behavior and good mutual help tend to have good performance. Employees who work above the standards set by the company and never show complaints in work are also indicators of organizational citizenship behavior .</p><p>Career development is planning and management process to improve the career path of employees so that they have the ability to work and play an important role in the organization. More career development translates to employees always try to do positive and beneficial things for the company that will support the creation of organizational citizenship behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Duffy (2007)</ref> defines career development as a job title that slowly rises with the promotion or call from the company for a higher position.</p><p>This statement is supported by research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erika (2018)</ref> stating that there is a Career Development that has a significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior), with the level of sig. smaller than the Alpha value (0,000 &lt;0,05) and t count&gt; t table <ref type="bibr">(4,679&gt; 1,989)</ref>.

Emotional Intelligence can determine organizational citizenship behavior on employees. Employees who can understand, control and use their emotions effectively, are able to create positive behaviors that can increase organizational citizenship behavior.</p><p>This statement supported by research conducted by Mojtaba <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Rafiei (2017)</ref>shows that Emotional Intelligence has an effect on organizational behavior of hospital staff.

Work life balance is a condition for creating a balance between one's working life and personal life. The more balanced work life and personal life of a person will make a person's life to be controlled and qualified so that it can create organizational citizenship behavior. This is in line with the research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rabindra (2016)</ref> which states that significant effects of work life occur balancing organizational citizenship behavior. In this case, the level of organizational citizenship behavior is effected by the balance of work life balance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature and Hypotheses Emotional Intelligence on Career Development</head><p>According to Daniel <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Goleman (2001)</ref>, Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognize our own feelings and other people's feelings, the ability to motivate theirself and the ability to manage emotions very well in ourselves and in relationships with others. Hadizadeh <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Moghadam, A. and Farajeeyan (2008)</ref> states that Emotional Intelligence is considered as the ability to understand and manage people in human relations Daniel <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Goleman (2001)</ref> suggests that there are five indicators that can measure the level of one's Emotional Intelligence, Self Awareness, Self-Mastery, Motivation, Recognizing other people's emotions (empathy) and Social Skills. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Duffy (2007)</ref> defines career development as a job title that slowly rises with the promotion or call from the company for a higher position. Career Development Indicators that will be looked into is in terms of career planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Siagian, 2012)</ref>. In this case, the indicators used consist of five points, namely fair treatment in a career, concern for direct supervisors, information about various promotional opportunities, interests to be promoted and levels of satisfaction.</p><p>Emotional Intelligence affects career development. An employee who has good Emotional Intelligence will be able to understand and manage the emotions of himself and others. Therefore in carrying out the duties and responsibilities assigned by the company, he will be able to choose, sort and control his emotions and other colleagues'. Employees who have high emotional intelligence will try to do their tasks and responsibilities as well as possible, In turn, it will support the his/her career development .</p><p>Evidence of research shows that by creating an emotionally intelligent workplace, organizations have been able to truly drive performance and careers in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Carmeli, A., &amp; Josman, 2006)</ref>. As a result, organizations have begun to redefine norms to deal with employee careers and promotions. In addition, research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kunnanatt (2008)</ref> found that people who get along like those with high emotional Intelligence tend to have an advantage over those who have lower Emotional Intelligence levels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Life Balance on Career Development</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lockwood, (2003)</ref> work life balance is a balanced state in two demands where the work and life of an individual are the same. Where work-life balance in the employee's view is the choice to manage work and personal obligations or responsibilities to the family. <ref type="bibr">Greenhaus et.al (2003)</ref> state that work-life balance is the degree to which an individual is bound together in work and family, and is equally satisfied with the role in work and role in his family. In line with that, according to <ref type="bibr">Weckstein (2008)</ref> Work life balance is a concept of balance that involves ambition or career with happiness, leisure, family, and spiritual development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hudson (2005)</ref> states that work life balance has three components of balance namely time balance, balance of engagement, and balance of satisfaction. Not infrequently employees have now realized how important work life balance is so they want a type of work that is more flexible in terms of time so that they can work without ignoring his personal life. The balance between life in work (work life balance) is an important factor that needs to be considered by companies in making a policy so that work productivity is maintained. Work life balance can affect one's career development. The more balanced work life and personal life of a person will make the person comfortable in doing work that will create good relationships and involvement. So that with the intensity of the relationship and good involvement, the greater the career opportunity increases. The above statement is supported by the results of research conducted by Caroline <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Straub (2007)</ref> stating that there is a positive effect between work life balance and career development especially among women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: Work life balance has a significant effect on career development Career Development on Organizational Citizenship Behavior</head><p>Robbins (2007) argues that organizational citizenship behavior is a choice behavior that is not part of an employee's formal work obligations, but supports the organization's functions effectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Robbins &amp; Judge (2008)</ref> re-launches a book on Organizational citizenship behavior which defines organizational citizenship behavior as a choice behavior that is not part of an employee's formal work obligations, but supports the functioning of the organization effectively.</p><p>According <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Organ (2006)</ref> organizational citizenship behavior consists of five dimensions as follows. Altruism, that is, behavior helps alleviate the work shown to other individuals in an organization, such as helping unhealthy coworkers. Courtesy, namely helping work colleagues prevent problems related to their work by giving consultation and information and respecting their needs, or understanding and empathizing even when criticized. Sportsmanship, namely tolerance to situations that are not ideal in the workplace without complaining, for example taking part in the failure of the project team might succeed by following the advice of members.Civic virtue, which is involved in organizational activities and concerned with the survival of the organization, for example, is willing to represent the company for a joint program. Conscientiousness, which is doing things that benefit the organization, for example by complying with regulations in the organization and being willing to overtime projects.</p><p>Career development is planning and management process to improve the career path of employees so that they have the ability to work and play an important role in the organization More career development translates to employees always try to do positive and beneficial things for the company that will support the creation of organizational citizenship behavior. This is supported by research conducted by by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erika (2018)</ref>stating that there is a career development that has a significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior), with the level of sig. smaller than the Alpha value (0,000 &lt;0,05) and t count&gt; t table <ref type="table">(4,</ref><ref type="table">679&gt; 1,</ref><ref type="table">989</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Work Life Balance (X2) on Career Development (X3)</head><p>Work life balance can be seen in conditions where a person can carry out his personal life and work life in a balanced manner. Personal life here is very broad in context as well as in the world of work employees can enjoy time with family such as holidays and gather family, friends, carry out interests and hobbies and carry out other social activities.</p><p>By fulfilling this balance, it will have an impact on the performance of someone who will be the main point in the development of his career. Lack of balance of time, involvement and satisfaction will cause a person not motivated at work and unable to complete the job properly. In fact, this proves how important the effect of work life balance is on employee career development.</p><p>The results of this study are in line with the research conducted by Caroline <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Straub (2007)</ref> stating that there is a positive effect between Work Life Balance and Career Development especially among women. If work life balance is achieved, it will affect the career development of employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Emotional Intelligence (X1) on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (Y) and The Effect of Emotional Intelligence (X1) on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (Y) with Career Development as Mediating Variable(X3).</head><p>The better a person's emotional intelligence, the higher the employee's organizational citizenship behavior, because emotional intelligence is the ability to control emotions of oneself and others in order to distinguish between them, and to use information to guide thoughts and actions, then from the higher a person's emotional intelligence, the higher the level of organizational citizenship behavior.</p><p>After testing 195 employees of PT. Bank Pembangunan Daerah (BPD) Head Office and Main Branch, Padang. The results show that the direct effect of emotional intelligence (X1) on organizational citizenship behavior (Y) is greater than the effect of emotional intelligence (X1) on organizational citizenship behavior (Y) with career development as mediating variable (X3). In other words, in this study career development mediation has no effect on the relationship of emotional intelligence with employee organizational citizenship behavior that has been built on a conceptual framework. This means that career development does not have an important role in strengthening the relationship of emotional intelligence with Organizational Citizenship Behavior at PT. Bank Pembangunan Daerah (BPD) Head Office and Main Branch, Padang.</p><p>This study found that career development cannot be used as a mediating variable so the indirect effects proposed do not need to be examined in subsequent studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Work Life Balance (X2) on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (Y) and The Effect of Work Life Balance (X2) on Organizational Citizenship Behavior(Y) with Career Development as Mediating Variable (X3).</head><p>A person who has a good Work Life Balance is a productive and high-performing worker. In addition, he is also happier and more creative because the outside office environment such as home and friendship and social life outside of work supports his growth. Conversely, if someone does not have a good Work Life Balance, their performance tends to decline and can damage other areas of life. Most of this is due to the high demands of today's work.</p><p>After testing 195 employees of PT. Bank Pembangunan Daerah (BPD)Head Office and Main Branch, Padang. The result shows that the direct effect of work life balance (X2) on organizational citizenship behavior (Y) is greater than the effect of work life balance (X2) on organizational citizenship behavior (Y) with career development as mediating variable (X3).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Career Development (X3) on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (Y).</head><p>Career is all work carried out by an employee during the period of his work or assignment that provides continuity, order and value for the life of a person or employee. The more a person's career develops, he will always try to do positive and beneficial things for the company that will support the creation of employee organizational citizenship behavior. In this case, career development is seen specifically in career planning, the better employee career planning, the better the behavior of organizational citizenship behavior. This is supported by the results of research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Erika (2018)</ref> stating that there is Career Development that has a significant effect on Organizational Citizenship Behavior. Research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sutton (2005)</ref> also found that career development has a relationship with Organizational Citizenship Behavior.</p><p>Based on the above opinion, it can be concluded that employees who have a developing career will increase the creation of organizational citizenship behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The result of this study can be seen as follow:</p><p>First,Emotional intelligence has significant effect on career development, this case shows that the better employee's emotional intelligence, the higher employee'scareer development.</p><p>Second, Work life balance has significant effect on career development, this suggests that the better work life balance of employees, the higher employee's career development.</p><p>Third, Career development hassignificant effect on organizational citizenship behavior, this shows that the better career development, the higher organizational citizenship behavior of employees.</p><p>Fourth, Emotional intelligence has significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior, which suggests that the better the emotional intelligence, the higher organizational citizenship behavior of employees.</p><p>Fifth, Work life balance has significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior, which suggests that the better Work life balance, the higher organizational citizenship behavior of employees.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1 Path Structure of The effect of Emotional Intelligence and Work Life Balance on Organizational Citizenship Behavior with Career Development as a Mediation Variable</figDesc></figure>
