<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The professionalism of teachers in their work will determine the smoothness of tasks at school. Teacher professionalism demands expertise, responsibility and loyalty to work. Teachers who have professionalism will easily adapt to advances in information technology and educational changes that occur and are able to face every challenge that exists. Teachers will also be easy and able to accept changes and be able to face the challenges that exist with full responsibility and high dedication. On the other hand, teachers who have low professionalism will find it difficult to adapt to the changes and work challenges they face. The facts show that based on the results of initial observations at the school where the author works, it was found that there are still some teachers who have not been fully able to develop teaching materials according to the characteristics of their students, teachers lack creativity in carrying out tasks so that teachers are less able to find new ideas in carrying out teaching assignments. , some teachers rarely use varied learning methods and models, some teachers lack knowledge of what assessment tools are used in conducting assessments and follow-up for participants, teachers are less able to create and use learning media that pleases students. The phenomenon as stated above indicates that teachers have not been fully able to develop their professionalism. In fact, teachers should be professionals who have very important functions, roles and positions in achieving the vision of education, namely creating intelligent and competitive Indonesian people. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baedhowi (2009)</ref> suggests that teachers are professional educators who have important duties, functions, and roles in the intellectual life of the nation. Professional teachers are expected to be able to participate in national development to realize Indonesian people who fear God Almighty, excel in science and technology, have an aesthetic, ethical, virtuous character, and personality. Teacher professionalism is determined by many factors. One of them is Principal Leadership. Aslamiah. (2019) stated that: Principals are responsible for fostering teachers in their schools so that they can play a professional role in carrying out their duties as teachers. Principals have an important role in developing schools, providing services to teachers through continuous coaching, providing learning facilities, encouraging teacher professional careers, managing differences of opinion, inspiring teachers to carry out their duties and responsibilities and providing opportunities for teachers to develop themselves according to their abilities. . Another factor that is predicted to determine teacher professionalism is professional development. According to the opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Syafaruddin (2015)</ref> that: to obtain professional teachers/employees must start from the procurement and coaching/empowerment process. Teachers as educators and employees must try to take advantage of opportunities to develop their professional careers. Another factor that is also predicted to determine teacher professionalism is competence. Competence is an observable activity that includes aspects of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and the stages of its implementation as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mulyasa, 2009)</ref>. Teacher competence is a combination of personal, scientific, technological, social, and spiritual abilities which directly form the standard competence of the teaching profession, which includes mastery of the material, understanding of students, educational learning, personal development and professionalism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHOD</head><p>This research is research with a quantitative approach. The population of this study was 166 teachers. The research sample was 117 teachers who were selected by proportional random sampling determined by Cronbach's alpha. The sampling technique in this study used proportional random sampling. Data was collected using an instrument consisting of 27 items of principal transformational leadership (ideal effect, individual sensitivity, intellectual stimulation, and inspiration), 38 items of teacher professional development (continuous professional development, MGMP empowerment program, educational supervision program), teacher competence 32 items (personality, social, pedagogic, professional) and teacher professionalism 28 items (dedication to the teaching profession, social obligations, independence, belief in professional regulations, relationships with colleagues) which have been tested for validity and reliability. Research data were analyzed using analysis track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The results of multiple linear regression analysis show the model of the effect of the principal transformational leadership (X1), professional development (X2) and competence (Z) on teacher professionalism (Y) as presented in the following description:   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the rejection of the hypothesis in this study can be seen in Tables <ref type="table">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 4. Summary of Hypothesis Testing Decisions H 1 H 2 H 3 H 4 H 5 Hypothesis P Decision H 1</head><p>There is a direct effect of the principal transformational leadership on teacher competence  The results of the path analysis as can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> are used to answer the seven research hypotheses that have been formulated whose decisions are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> is a summary of decisions H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 with a significance value criterion of less than 0.05, then the hypothesis is accepted. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> is a summary of the decisions for testing the H6 and H7 hypotheses provided that if the direct effect coefficient is smaller than the indirect effect coefficient, then the hypothesis is rejected. Based on the results of the analysis in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Muliardi (2019)</ref> which found that: The leadership of the madrasah principal has a positive and significant effect on teacher competence at Madrasah Aliyah Negeri in Riau Province. The sig value was obtained for the Principal Transformational Leadership variable, the sig value was 0.007. This sig value is smaller than the significance level of 0.05, or the value of 0.007 &lt;0.05. The Principal Transformational Leadership variable obtained a tcount of 2.736, which was greater than the ttable at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (117 -1) of 1.980, so Ho was rejected. This means that there is a direct effect of Principal Transformational Leadership on teacher competence. A positive t value indicates that the principal Transformational Leadership variable has a direct relationship with teacher competence. Banani (2017) also found that there was an effect of principal leadership on teacher competence to realize learning effectiveness at SMK Plus Qurrota A'yun Samarang". One of the important roles of the principal is to formulate consensus as a collective agreement in achieving certain goals. Therefore, if the principal is able to apply transformational leadership well, the teacher will have good competence as well. Suriansyah (2015) emphasized, "the principal in implementing leadership making ethics and values guiding inspiration to do good and avoid actions that are less good." Principals in carrying out leadership make ethics and values that inspire to do good and avoid actions that are not good.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The direct effect of professional development on the competence of State Junior High School teachers in Balangan Regency</head><p>The results of this study indicate that the sig value for the professional coaching variable obtained a sig value of 0.015. This sig value is smaller than the 0.05 significance level, or the value 0.015 &lt;0.05. The variable of professional development has a tcount of 2.482, which is greater than ttable at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (117 -1) of 1.980, so Ho is rejected and Ha is accepted. This means that there is a direct effect of professional development on teacher competence. A positive t value indicates that the variable of professional development has a direct relationship with teacher competence. The findings in this study support research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Syafaruddin, 2015)</ref> that teacher development is related to strengthening the teaching profession, so that teachers are able to adapt to new knowledge and skills related to the competence of their teaching tasks so that school functions can run effectively". Meanwhile <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Imron, 2005)</ref> also revealed that: "To improve the competence and professional ability of teachers in improving learning processes and outcomes, this is done through the provision of assistance, which is primarily professional in the form of services to teachers". Research (Sinaga, 2017) also found that: "Education and Training has a significant effect on Educator Competence". The findings of this study indicate that professional development through professional development activities in the form of seminars on teacher working group activities and training education is very important in order to improve teacher competence. This is in line with research (Ana M, Morais, 2005) which found that: "The teacher training process is closely related to the increasing competence of sociology studies teachers in elementary schools". The guidance and development provided to teachers is expected to improve teacher competence and teaching quality so that the quality of education can be achieved properly. Teachers will always create and maintain relationships with fellow teachers, create and maintain a spirit of kinship and social solidarity in the work environment and outside the work environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The direct effect of the principal transformational leadership on the professionalism of state junior high school teachers in Balangan Regency</head><p>The results of this study indicate that the sig value for the Principal Transformational Leadership variable obtained a sig value of 0.035. This sig value is smaller than the 0.05 significance level, or the value 0.035 &lt;0.05. The Principal Transformational Leadership variable obtained a tcount of 2.140, which was greater than the t-table at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (117 -1) of 1.980, so Ho was rejected. This means that there is a direct effect of Principal Transformational Leadership on teacher professionalism. A positive t-value indicates that the principal Transformational Leadership variable has a direct relationship with teacher professionalism. The findings in this study are in line with research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kafrawi, 2019)</ref> showing that: "There is a direct relationship between Principal Transformational Leadership and the professionalism of the teachers of State Madrasah Tsanawiyah in Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency". The results of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Lestari, 2019)</ref> also show that: "There is a significant effect of principal leadership on teacher professionalism in carrying out learning". Likewise, research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kimani, 2021</ref>) also found that an effective leader has a responsibility to provide guidance and knowledge to employees and direct them to have good performance and make employees have quality skills. A leader has a big responsibility. Leaders are able to display clear leadership standards and promote mature values, employee roles and responsibilities. Principals who are able to lead schools well will be able to plan, organize, effect teachers and be able to create good cooperation between teachers, so teachers will have confidence, loyalty and enthusiasm to work well for the betterment of their school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The direct effect of professional development on the professionalism of state junior high school teachers in Balangan Regency</head><p>The results of this study indicate that the sig value for the professional coaching variable obtained a sig value of 0.039. This sig value is smaller than the 0.05 significance level, or the value 0.039 &lt;0.05. The professional development variable obtained a tcount of 2,093 which was greater than ttable at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (117 -1) of 1,980, so Ho was rejected. This means that there is a direct effect of professional development on teacher professionalism. A positive t-value indicates that the variable of professional development has a direct relationship with teacher professionalism. The findings in this study are in line with research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pasaribu, 2016)</ref> which also shows that: "The dominant factors influencing the professionalism of State Elementary School teachers in Kapuk Village, Cengkareng District, are only Education and Training factors". The results of the study (R.Sass, 2011) also explain that "training has a positive and significant effect on professionalism". The findings of this study indicate that professional development is very important in order to improve teacher competence and professionalism. Therefore, teachers need to obtain and have the opportunity to develop themselves, obtain guidance, especially in the education and training pathways through development activities. In addition, teachers also need to train themselves to conduct scientific research in an effort to find new and innovative methods and ways of implementing learning in the classroom. Teacher coaching that is done well will increase mastery of scientific substance, mastery of competency standards and basic competencies of the subjects being taught, as well as creative development of subject matter, so teachers will have high professionalism. These results are in line with research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Natas, 2010)</ref> which found that: "Teacher education as the basis for determining teacher competence". On the other hand, if the teacher does not get good coaching in his profession, then professionalism will decrease as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The direct effect of competence on the professionalism of state junior high school teachers in Balangan Regency</head><p>The results of this study indicate that the sig value for the teacher competence variable obtained a sig value of 0.040. This sig value is smaller than the 0.05 significance level, or the value 0.040 &lt;0.05. The competency variable obtained a tcount of 2.081 which was greater than the ttable at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (117 -1) of 1.980, so Ho was rejected. This means that there is a direct effect of competence on teacher professionalism. A positive t value indicates that the competence variable has a direct relationship with teacher professionalism. The findings in this study are in line with research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ariyanto, 2021)</ref> which shows that there is a positive and significant effect between teacher competence on teacher performance. This means that teachers who have sufficient quality are those who are able to carry out their obligations, are responsible and proper. Teachers are also required to develop their competencies so that they can improve their professionalism in carrying out their functional duties. Teachers who have competence always display openness and do not feel rivaled by their colleagues, but instead they are willing to develop themselves with other teachers as an effort to improve their abilities and performance. Teachers who have high competence tend to do what they have never done to improve student learning outcomes. This finding is in line with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Benjamin, Fauth, 2019)</ref> which found that: "Teacher competence affects student learning outcomes in basic science education". Teachers also always try to improve the abilities they don't have in order to be better than other teachers in doing their new work at school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. The indirect effect of the principal transformational leadership on professionalism through the competence of state junior high school teachers in Balangan Regency</head><p>The  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rakhman, 2020)</ref> which found that if the relationship between the leader and subordinates is good (for example, the leader respects, trusts and is liked), then the leader will be easier to exert effect and authority than if the relationship is good. the leader and subordinates are not good (for example, the leader does not respect, is disliked, and lacks trust in subordinates). Therefore, two factors, namely the principal transformational leadership and competence determine the professionalism of teachers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. The indirect effect of professional development on professionalism through the competence of State Junior High School teachers in Balangan Regency</head><p>The results of this study indicate that the beta value of the direct effect of the professional development variable on teacher professionalism is 0.187. While the indirect effect of professional development on professionalism through teacher competence is the beta value of the effect of the variable professional development on teacher competence multiplied by the beta value of the effect of the competence variable on teacher professionalism, namely: 0.219 x 0.192 = 0.042. The results of this calculation indicate that the value of the direct effect of professional development on teacher professionalism is greater than the indirect effect (0.187 &gt; 0.042), so Ho is accepted which means that there is no indirect effect of professional development on professionalism through the competence of State Junior High School teachers in Balangan Regency. The findings in this study are that there is a direct effect of professional development with teacher professionalism through competence at State Junior High Schools in Balangan Regency. The findings in this study are in line with the opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Siagian, 2009)</ref> which reveals: "The level of education and training that has been followed reflects the type of skills and intellectual abilities possessed by each person concerned". <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Imron, 2005)</ref> also emphasized that: "To improve the competence and professional abilities of teachers in improving learning processes and outcomes, this is done through the provision of assistance, which is primarily professional in the form of services to teachers"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV.
