<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past few decades, with the growth of positive psychology, an increasing number of studies focused on subjective happiness (or subjective wellbeing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Subjective happiness refers to individuals' sense of good and wellness, including satisfaction with life, enjoyment, love, and overall positive feelings. Also, higher subjective happiness means lower distress and negative emotions, such as anger or fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The reasons behind this interest could not be more important: compared with less happy people, happy individuals have better interpersonal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, are more productive (4), more socially responsible <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, have a higher academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and, generally, they live longer and have healthier lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>However, recent estimates suggested that psychological distress (which includes feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress) (8)as a measure of low subjective happiness, is one of the primary factors associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Thus, it is all the more important to identify the risk factors contributing to lower happiness, especially among one particularly vulnerable population regarding this matter, i.e., university students <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on one less investigated factor when discussing subjective happiness, i.e., multidimensional perfectionism. Furthermore, we aimed to examine how different forms of perfectionism might indirectly affect youth's happiness through substance use (i.e., alcohol and nicotine) and Internet addiction symptoms, especially since a growing number of studies highlighted the high prevalence of co-occurrence of alcohol and tobacco use among students <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, as well as the high numbers regarding Internet addiction symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Not all perfectionists are the same</head><p>Recent data estimates that perfectionism is increasing over time due to cultural changes reflected in competitive individualism, highlighting that today's youth have higher expectations of themselves, their peers, and society <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Perfectionism is considered a multidimensional personality trait, relatively stable across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. It is characterized by excessively high expectations of one's abilities and those around them, harsh self-and social criticism, and an obsession with perfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. There are various models and measures of perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, highlighting different facets such as (a) self-oriented perfectionism, other-oriented perfectionism, and socially prescribed perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, (b) rigid, self-critical, and narcissistic perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, or (c) adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. In the present study, we investigated perfectionism through the lenses proposed by the conceptualization proposed by Smith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>Rigid perfectionists expect nothing less than excellence from oneself, comprising elements of self-oriented perfectionism and reliance on external validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Furthermore, rigid perfectionism describes the importance of pursuing excellence and the connection between one's perceived worth and meeting personal standards of perfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Next, concerns, adverse reactions to defective or faulty performance, and the belief that others want one to be flawless are characteristics of self-critical perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Individuals high in self-critical perfectionism generally have overly adverse reactions to their perceived mistakes and failures; they experience pervasive uncertainty and dissatisfaction with their performance-since they tend to believe others demand perfection-and are overly self-critical of their perceived absence of perfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. Finally, narcissistic perfectionism defines the tendency to be excessively critical of others and self-centered in one's expectations of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Individuals high in narcissistic perfectionism are usually intolerant to others' mistakes, might expect special treatment due to feelings of selfentitlement, and believe they are superior to others regarding their perfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perfectionism and substance use</head><p>According to the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, as people's supplies run out, they may experience emotional distress, affecting their general wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Applying the COR theory to university students, Nelsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref> argued that students high in perfectionism may pursue excellence and high personal standards much more and consume more resources, such as energy and time, to achieve academic success. When these resources are drained over time, the emotional distress experienced by perfectionist students might be much higher than those lower in perfectionism. Furthermore, according to the stress-coping model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>, using alcohol and tobacco might be the reflection of a coping mechanism with negative emotions and to enhance positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref>. Therefore, as perfectionists are less likely to lower their standards and more likely to resort to harmful coping mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>, they might also be more prone to substance use.</p><p>Some previous studies have explored the link between different facets of perfectionism and substance use. For example, some suggested that adaptive perfectionism might be related to better mental health among college students, compared to maladaptive forms of perfectionism and lower substance use (i.e., drinking and smoking) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. Other studies suggested that maladaptive perfectionism and negative coping styles predicted substance abuse and addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>. Similar findings highlighted the significant link between maladaptive perfectionism and substance abuse as a coping mechanism [e.g., Rice and Van Arsdale <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref>]. However, there is also mixed evidence regarding the link between perfectionism and drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref>, highlighting the need for further evidence.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that rigid perfectionism positively predicts anxiety and negative emotions, such as guilt <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Selfcritical perfectionism is also considered a vulnerability toward stress perception, significantly predicting depression, anxiety, and risky health-related behaviors, such as eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34)</ref>. Since negative emotions and psychological distress are negative predictors of subjective happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref>, we can consider the indirect association between perfectionism and happiness. Also, the positive link between psychological distress and substance use, highlighted in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>, might underline the direct relation between perfectionism and substance use proneness <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref>. Finally, narcissistic perfectionism, which involves being critical, demanding, arrogant, and entitled, often involves conflict and derogation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>. In response to these conflicts, individuals might use drinking and smoking as coping (maladaptive) strategies to manage the related emotional negativity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perfectionism and internet addiction</head><p>Though it has many conceptualizations, Internet addiction generally describes a maladaptive form of Internet use, a psychological dependence on the Internet, characterized by symptoms of withdrawal, anxiety, and a loss of impulse control concerning the urge to use the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. According to recent estimates, generalized Internet addiction prevalence rates seem to vary from 12.6 to 67.5%, with significantly higher numbers among adolescents and university students <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref>. Internet addiction has many adverse outcomes regarding one's psychological and physical health, including depression, anxiety, stress symptoms, disordered sleep and eating habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41)</ref>, in addition to generally lower subjective happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43)</ref>. Furthermore, among university students, Internet addiction is also predicted by substance use and abuse, such as drinking and smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(44)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that maladaptive perfectionism is significantly associated with Internet addiction through the mediating role of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(45)</ref>. Other studies suggested that a perfectionistic attitude predicts Internet addiction even when depression is controlled <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(46)</ref>. Socially prescribed perfectionism, a facet of self-critical perfectionism, was also significantly related to problematic Internet use in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48)</ref>. Next, perfectionistic concerns seem significantly related to mobile phone addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref> and maladaptive cognitions about the self, translated by not meeting perfectionism standards, further predicting problematic social media use (which is a form of maladaptive Internet use) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, building on the stress-coping model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>, we consider Internet addiction as a result of maladaptive coping when managing the emotional burden of perfectionism. Previous studies that examined the risk factors of problematic Internet use, for instance, highlighted its role as a (maladaptive) mood regulation mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(51)</ref>. Thus, when individuals' stress is high (due to not meeting the standards of perfectionism), Internet use might become maladaptive, i.e., addictive. Consequently, we believe that high perfectionists are more prone to develop Internet addiction, which, in turn, might lead to lower subjective happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(52)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perfect people, happier lives? The aims of the present study</head><p>Finally, we come to the question: perfect people, happier people? In other words, what is the connection between rigid, self-critical, and narcissistic perfectionism and subjective happiness? Previous studies suggested that perfectionism involves a rigid evaluation of daily problems and that cognitive reappraisal might reduce the unfavorable link between perfectionism and cognitive flexibility, except among individuals with strong narcissistic perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>. Since individuals high in cognitive flexibility are usually happier <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(55)</ref>, perfectionism might indirectly affect happiness due to its negative association with cognitive flexibility. Other studies suggested that the link between various forms of perfectionism and subjective happiness is generally significant and negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(56)</ref>.</p><p>Building on the COR theory (25), we believe that individuals high in perfectionism might use more resources and energy to fulfill their overly high standards than those low in perfectionism. Furthermore, building on the stress-coping model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>, due to the pressure of achieving perfection, they might also experience more emotional distress, which might make them more prone to drink, smoke, and use the Internet in a maladaptive way to cope with the perceived stress. Subsequently, these specific risky behaviors might be reflected in lower subjective happiness.</p><p>Previous studies examined the mediating role of risky behaviors on the link between perfectionism and students' mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>, but our research has some specific novelties. First, we conceptualized perfectionism using Smith et al.'s (18) framework, measuring rigid, self-critical, and narcissistic perfectionism. Second, we investigated not only substance abuse but also Internet addiction symptoms as an additional maladaptive coping mechanism with the potential stress caused by perfectionism. Finally, we measured subjective happiness, a less investigated construct when discussing the link with university students' rigid, self-critical, and narcissistic perfectionism.</p><p>Based on the COR theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, the stress-coping model ( <ref type="formula">27</ref>), and previous findings examining the complex relationships between our variables of interest, our assumptions were the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 1 .</formula><p>Perfectionism would be positively associated with health-risk behaviors, i.e., smoking, drinking, and Internet addiction symptoms. H 2 . Health-risk behaviors would be related to lower subjective happiness. H 3 . Health-risk behaviors would mediate the link between perfectionism and subjective happiness.</p><p>The proposed research model is detailed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Participants and procedure</head><p>Our final sample comprised 431 students from two major universities in Romania. Their ages varied from 18 to 25 (M = 20.50, SD = 1.58), and most of them were females (79.81%, self-reported gender). Using convenience sampling (i.e., snowball sampling), data were collected in January 2023 using an online form distributed through student social media groups (e.g., Facebook). The participants replied to an invitation to participate in a study project addressing the psychological issues of the digital age in exchange for course credits.</p><p>All participants provided informed consent to participate in this study. Students were advised that their participation was entirely voluntary and that they might withdraw at any time. In addition, they were told that their answers would remain anonymous and private and would be utilized just for the current research. Twelve minutes was the average time necessary to answer all questions. The research was conducted following the ethical standards established by the 2013 Helsinki Declaration and was authorized by the Ethics Committee where the authors are affiliated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Subjective happiness</head><p>We used the four-item Subjective Happiness scale developed by Lyubomirsky and Lepper <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(57)</ref>  the items on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (a great deal). Higher scores indicated a higher level of subjective happiness. In the present study, Cronbach's alpha-s 0.79, 95% CI (0.75, 0.82).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perfectionism</head><p>We used The Big Three Perfectionism Scale-Short Form (BTPS-SF) developed by Feher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> to measure three facets of perfectionism, i.e., rigid (four items, e.g., I have a strong need to be perfect), self-critical (six items, e.g., The idea of making a mistake frightens me), and narcissistic perfectionism (six items, e.g., It bothers me when people don't notice how perfect I am). Participants answered the items on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). Higher scores indicated higher perfectionism on all dimensions. In the present study, Cronbach's α for rigid perfectionism was 0.91, 95% CI (0.9, 0.92), for self-critical perfectionism was 0.88, 95% CI (0.86, 0.9), and for narcissistic perfectionism was 0.86, 95% CI (0.84, 0.88). A CFA was performed, resulting in a marginal acceptable fitted model under the orthogonal assumptions (χ 2 = 562.72, df = 101, p &lt; 0.001, TLI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.08, RMSEA = 0.10, p &lt; 0.001, 90% CI (0.09, 0.11)].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substance use</head><p>We measured participants' alcohol and nicotine use using the items from The Personal Experience Screening Questionnaire (PESQ) developed by Winters <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(58)</ref>. Six items measured alcohol use (e.g., How often have you used alcohol at home? and How often have you used alcohol secretly, so nobody would know you were using?), and six items measured nicotine use, i.e., smoking (e.g., How often have you smoked at home? and How often have you smoked secretly, so nobody would know you were using?). Participants answered using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (often). Higher scores indicated higher substance use. In the present study, Cronbach's α for alcohol use was 0.83, 95% CI (0.8, 0.85), and nicotine use was 0.88, 95% CI (0.87, 0.9). A CFA was also performed, resulting in a marginally acceptable fitted model under the orthogonal assumptions [χ 2 = 325.98, df = 53, p &lt; 0.001, TLI = 0.98, SRMR = 0.11, RMSEA = 0.11, p &lt; 0.001, 90% CI (0.10, 0.12)].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internet addiction</head><p>We used the <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> Example items included I make it a habit to sleep less so that more time can be spent online and Going online is the first thought I have when I wake up each morning. Participants answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (does not match my experience at all) to 4 (Definitely matches my experience). Higher scores indicated higher Internet addiction symptoms on all dimensions. Our choice for this scale was based on the fact that it is one of the most used instruments to assess Internet addiction symptoms, and its validity and fidelity were demonstrated in various samples and cultural contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(61)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>. The cut-off score for this scale is 63/64 points for diagnostic purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(63)</ref>. However, in the present study, we used Internet addiction as a latent variable in a SEM model, thus not the total score that would indicate clinical values based on these cutoff points. A CFA was performed, resulting in an acceptable fitted model under the orthogonal assumptions [χ 2 = 936.78, df = 289, p &lt; 0.001, TLI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.07, RMSEA = 0.07, p &lt; 0.001, 90% CI (0.07, 0.08)].</p><p>A demographic scale assessed participants' age and selfreported gender. The instruments were translated using the backtranslation procedure (64).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of statistical analysis</head><p>We used R (Version 4. The initial assumptions assessment was performed by descriptive univariate analysis, data screening for outliers, and missing cases analysis to verify univariate normality; the Mardia indicator (81) was computed to assess multivariate normality. A confirmatory factor analysis based on diagonally weighted least squares <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(82)</ref> was used to test the instruments' factorial validity and dimensional structure. Finally, the main SEM model was assessed based on robust SEM techniques and the parameters were estimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary analyses</head><p>An initial descriptive analysis was performed to assess the univariate normality assumptions for the scalar variables (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The multivariate normality assumption based on the Mardia coefficient (81) was not met, as the Mahalanobis distances from centroid coordinates were between 1.14 and 6.23. A statistically significant multivariate positively skewed (Mardia = 12.91, Skewness = 927.38, p &lt; 0.001) and multivariate leptokurtic distribution (Mardia = 159.21, Kurtosis = 9.95, p &lt; 0.001) were observed.</p><p>Most of Spearman's ρ correlations were statistically significant (see Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), with values between -0.35 and 0.78, and the correlation matrix was positively defined. Rigid perfectionism was positively associated with compulsion (ρ = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001), withdrawal (ρ = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001), tolerance symptoms (ρ = 0.16, p = 0.001), and interpersonal and health problems (ρ = 0.15, p = 0.002), and negatively associated with substance use-smoking (ρ = -0.10, p = 0.031). Self-critical perfectionism was positively associated with compulsion (ρ = 0.29, p &lt; 0.001), withdrawal (ρ = 0.28, p &lt; 0.001), and tolerance symptoms (ρ = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001), interpersonal and health problems (ρ = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001), and time management (ρ = 0.17, p = 0.001), and negatively associated with subjective happiness (ρ = -0.25, p &lt; 0.001). Narcissistic perfectionism was positively associated with alcohol use (ρ = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001), smoking (ρ = 0.14, p = 0.003), compulsion (ρ = 0.33, p &lt; 0.001), withdrawal (ρ = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001), and tolerance symptoms (ρ = 0.16, p = 0.001), interpersonal and health problems (ρ = 0.32, p &lt; 0.001), time management (ρ = 0.28, p &lt; 0.001), and negatively associated with subjective happiness (ρ = -0.11, p = 0.022). Next, alcohol use was positively associated with smoking (ρ = 0.50, p &lt; 0.001), and negatively associated with subjective happiness (ρ = -0.25, p &lt; 0.001). Smoking was also negatively associated with subjective happiness (ρ = -0.18, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, all Internet addiction dimensions were negatively associated with subjective happiness (all p-s &lt;0.001).</p><p>We further analyzed the main model, and convergence was acquired after 111 iterations, estimating 26 parameters based on 431 data. The modification indices suggested a model adjustment by adding a covariance between measurement errors of substance use-drinking and smoking, resulting in an over-identified model with marginal acceptable fit indices [χ 2 = 321.40, df = 40, p = 0.373, CFI = 0.90, SRMR = 0.07, RMSEA = 0.07, p = 0.02, 90% CI (0.05, 0.08); see Figure <ref type="figure">2]</ref>.</p><p>The results suggested that addictive behaviors completely mediate the effect of perfectionism on subjective happiness. High levels of perfectionism were associated with high levels of addictive behaviors (B = 0.28, z = 5.24, p &lt; 0.001, β = 0.39), and high levels of addictive behaviors were associated with low levels of subjective happiness (B = -0.52, z = -3.74, p &lt; 0.001, β = -0.37). Moreover, high levels of perfectionism, mediated by addictive behaviors, were associated with low levels of subjective happiness, with perfectionism determining an indirect, statistically significant effect on subjective happiness (B = -0.15, z = -3.12, p &lt; 0.001, β = -0.15). On all paths, direct and mediated, our data suggested that perfectionism was negatively associated with subjective happiness (total effect: B = -0.16, z = -2.66, p = 0.001, β = -0.16). However, the direct effect of perfectionism on subjective happiness was statistically insignificant (B = -0.01, z = -0.17, p = 0.86, β = -0.01; see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>

In this relationship, we also examined the mediating roles of some specific health-risk behaviors, i.e., substance use (i.e., drinking and smoking) and Internet addiction symptoms.</p><p>We assumed that perfectionism would be positively associated with health-risk behaviors, i.e., smoking, drinking, and Internet addiction symptoms. Our results confirmed this assumption, but only in the case of narcissistic perfectionism, which was associated with all the examined health-risk behaviors. Rigid perfectionism was positively related to Internet addiction symptoms and negatively associated with smoking, but the link with drinking was insignificant. Furthermore, self-critical perfectionism was  positively related to Internet addiction symptoms, but the link between drinking and smoking was insignificant. These results highlight some specific aspects of the negative outcomes regarding health-risk behaviors concerning narcissistic perfectionism. As previous research highlighted, narcissistic perfectionists are usually highly critical; they can be demanding and arrogant due to feelings of entitlement <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>. Due to the conflicts generated by these behaviors, our results confirm the assumption that they might be more prone to engage in compensatory behaviors, such as drinking, smoking, and addictive Internet use, to manage the related emotional negativity. Previous studies also suggested that individuals high in narcissistic perfectionism are also highly focused on being and seeming perfect <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Thus, narcissistic perfectionists are vulnerable when confronted with the reality that they are not perfect and never will be flawless via the trials and tribulations of everyday life. When their private insecurities become public, the drive to seem flawless is coupled with a sense of hopelessness regarding recovery from public shame and embarrassment. Consequently, they might engage in addictive Internet use to build, maintain, manage, and protect their perfect public image. Furthermore, this effort might increase their proneness for other health-risk behaviors, such as drinking and smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(84)</ref>, and the present research results also underlined this significant positive association. At the same time, this striving for perfection comes with the price of addiction and risky behaviors, leading to lower subjective happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">85)</ref>.</p><p>Next, we assumed that health-risk behaviors (i.e., drinking, smoking, and using the Internet addictively) would be related to  lower subjective happiness. Our assumption was confirmed, with negative associations between all the examined risky behaviors and subjective happiness. Moreover, it seems that students who smoke and drink might be more prone to engage in addictive Internet use. These outcomes align with previous findings suggesting that health-risk behaviors (e.g., drinking) are generally negatively associated with subjective happiness among youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(86,</ref><ref type="bibr">87)</ref>. More importantly, these results highlight the need to assess and intervene when health-risk behaviors, such as drinking, smoking, and Internet addictive behavioral patterns emerge among students due to the various adverse negative consequences on their mental and physical health. Finally, our study's most important result highlights that health-risk behaviors (smoking, drinking, and addictive Internet use) fully mediated the link between perfectionism and subjective happiness. There are both theoretical and practical considerations to discuss concerning these specific results. On the one hand, the present findings add to the scarce literature examining the multidimensional facets of perfectionism and their indirect link with subjective happiness. On the other hand, the present results highlight the specific maladaptive outcomes of narcissistic perfectionism and the need to address such cognitive and behavioral patterns due to (1) the risk of developing Internet addiction and engaging in smoking and drinking to cope with the negative emotions fueled by not meeting perfectionist standards, and (2) their significant indirect effect on subjective happiness, which further translates into a higher risk for developing psychological distress.</p><p>Though we did not use cut-off cores that would indicate whether our sample scored in the clinical or subclinical groups, descriptive statistics of the factors indicated a rather subclinical sample and some recommendations for preventive measures can also be considered, given the increasing prevalence of Internetrelated addictions among youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(88)</ref>. Also, recommendations for preventive measures in subclinical samples are also useful to manage the associated risk factors (in this case, perfectionism), to prevent developing health risk behavioral patterns into severe addictions or substance abuse disorders to enhance resilience and lower vulnerability. More specifically, the findings of the present study might bring important insights for interventions aimed at (1) reducing health-risk behaviors among students and (2) increasing subjective happiness by addressing the significant direct effect of perfectionism (on smoking, drinking, and addictive Internet use), as well as its indirect influence (on subjective happiness). In order to do that, parents, teachers, and students must be familiarized with the troubling signs of high perfectionism and its maladaptive function without ignoring its beneficial effects. We know from previous studies adaptive perfectionism might contribute, for instance, to reducing academic procrastination (89) and enhancing creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>. Thus, a clear distinction between adaptive and maladaptive facets of perfectionism should be at the core of such interventions. Some possible ways to spot maladaptive perfectionism, especially narcissistic perfectionism, might include private conversationsface-to-face or online, group exercises, and formal and informal teacher-student contexts. The signs that might reflect a student's narcissistic perfectionism could include, for instance, the inability to get satisfaction from personal, professional, or leisurely pursuits because of their lofty expectations of themselves and others. Furthermore, anger and sadness stemming from unmet expectations of entitlement might as well contribute to the prevalence of depressive symptoms, translated into online and offline behaviors and speech, daily interactions with students and teachers, and even their GPA scores. Finally, similar to the cases of therapists treating individuals with high narcissistic perfectionism, teachers might feel worthless and inadequate, impatient and exploited, as common responses to such students' grandiosity and fragility. Thus, such signs should be spotted among both students and teachers, and further addressed in interventions aimed at reducing the negative effects of maladaptive perfectionism.</p><p>Furthermore, since drinking, smoking, and addictive Internet use might be used as coping mechanisms to deal with the frustration and negative emotions, in general (due to not meeting perfectionist standards), prevention and intervention campaigns among students might as well be effective in dealing with the negative outcomes of perfectionism, and its ramification on students' physical and mental wellbeing. Some examples in this regard are described in previous studies which highlight the important role of self-compassion when addressing maladaptive perfectionism <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91)</ref>. Also, multi-level ecological strategies are also recommended when discussing university-based interventions (instead of using a single level approach) aimed at reducing addictive behaviors among students <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(92)</ref>.</p><p>However, there are also a series of limitations to be considered in the present study. First, we used convenience sampling, lowering the generalizability of the present findings. Second, we relied on self-reported measurements, which may have been skewed toward positive responses. The suggested research model may benefit from experimental analysis in the future (for instance, when measuring perfectionism) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(93)</ref>. Also, the scale that we used to measure health-risk behaviors was originally designed for younger samples. Though our sample was formed by young adults, i.e., students, and in Romania-according to the official statistics, most of them (i.e., more than 50%) live with their parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(94)</ref>, future studies might benefit from using alternative measurements (designed for students) to address this limitation. Next, our methodology was cross-sectional, which prevented us from establishing a causal connection; future longitudinal studies might be employed to overcome this shortcoming. In addition, the proposed factors are not the only ones that influence the relationship between the proposed variables; additional variables may also be key predictors and moderators of the relationship between students' perfectionism and subjective happiness, such as autonomy, environmental mastery, and purpose in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(95)</ref>, personality factors and resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(96)</ref>, intellectual giftedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(97)</ref>, or achievement goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(98)</ref>. Also, pre-existing clinical conditions of the participants might also account for variability in the present findings (e.g., previously diagnosed personality disorders), which might be controlled in further studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The present findings highlight the significant negative indirect effect of perfectionism on students' subjective happiness through the mediating effect of health-risk behaviors, i.e., smoking, drinking, and addictive Internet use. Moreover, the current results highlight the maladaptive function of narcissistic perfectionism and its significant link with alcohol and nicotine use and maladaptive Internet use. Though in need of further research, this study might have a significant theoretical and practical contribution in addressing the negative outcomes of students' perfectionism on their subjective wellbeing, as well as their physical health.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE</head><label></label><figDesc>FIGUREThe proposed research model.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,56.64,96.91,481.92,245.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
