<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Disease-disease relationships (e.g., disease comorbidities) play crucial roles in pathobiological manifestations of diseases and personalized approaches to managing those conditions. In this study, we develop a network-based methodology, termed metapath-based Disease Network (mpDisNet) capturing algorithm, to infer disease-disease relationships by assembling four biological networks: disease-miRNA, miRNA-gene, disease-gene, and the human protein-protein interactome. mpDisNet is a meta-pathbased random walk to reconstruct the heterogeneous neighbors of a given node. mpDisNet uses a heterogeneous skip-gram model to solve the network representation of the nodes. We find that mpDisNet reveals high performance in inferring clinically reported disease-disease relationships, outperforming that of traditional gene/miRNA-overlap approaches. In addition, mpDisNet identifies network-based comorbidities for pulmonary diseases driven by underlying miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways (i.e., hsa-let-7a-or hsa-let-7b-mediated airway epithelial apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways) as derived from the human interactome network analysis. The mpDisNet offers a powerful tool for network-based identification of disease-disease relationships with miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The manifestation and clinical severity of human disease are affected by myriad factors, including genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, and various environmental variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Identification of disease-disease relationships not only offers insights into disease heterogeneity, but also reveal etiology and pathogenesis of disease comorbidities, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> thus driving development of effective therapeutic strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Previous studies designed to map comprehensive disease-disease connections focused mainly on known associations among diseases and associated genes/ proteins. However, the predisposition to human disease is dictated by a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Some complex diseases that are mainly driven by environmental or acquired triggers often display more limited genetic risk. Thus, traditional bioinformatics analysis of genetic risk factors offers limited power to detect the true breadth of complex disease-disease relationships.</p><p>Beyond genetic analysis, shared patterns of gene expression have raised possibilities to inspect disease-disease relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Alteration and dysregulation of gene expressions are caused by several biological mechanisms, including microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. In 1993, Ambros et al. discovered the first type of miRNA (lin-4) in a nematode, revealing for the first time the essential function of miRNA in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> MiRNAs belong to a class of endogenous, small, non-coding RNAs (~22 nucleotides) and play crucial roles in inhibiting the expression of target mRNAs at the posttranscriptional level. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Specifically, miRNAs regulate target genes by partially or completely pairing with their 3′ UTR region, thereby reducing the stability of the target miRNA or inhibiting translation to downregulate the expression of genes of interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> This complex regulatory network not only regulates the expression of multiple genes through one miRNA, but also finely regulates the expression of multiple genes by the combination of several miRNAs. Thus, the shared patterns of gene expression regulated by miRNAs may offer possibilities to inspect disease-disease relationships.</p><p>Currently, more than 30,000 miRNAs within ~200 species have been identified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Cumulative empirical evidences show that miRNAs are closely related to the development, progression, and prognosis of multiple diseases, such as pulmonary vascular disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> However, it is not obvious whether ascertaining the comprehensive breadth of miRNA-mediated gene networks offer discerning power to reveal important disease-disease relationships. Recent human protein-protein interactome network modeling shows that network-based approaches have raised possibilities to identify disease-disease relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and drug-disease associations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> In this study, we developed a network-based methodology, termed meta-path-based Disease Network (mpDisNet) capturing algorithm, to infer new disease-disease relationships from miRNAmediated network perspectives. We built a heterogeneous miRNA-gene-disease network by assembling four biological networks: disease-miRNA, miRNA-gene, gene-disease, and the human protein-protein interactome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Specifically, mpDis-Net searches a specific meta-path (a meta-path is a path linking two specified nodes in a network mode) based on a Random Walk algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> to reconstruct the heterogeneous neighbors of a node. Specifically, we utilized a heterogeneous skip-gram model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> to solve the network representation of the nodes in mpDisNet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We found that mpDisNet displayed a higher performance in inferring disease-disease relationships compared with traditional miRNA-overlapping approaches. Via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> the reduced dimension graphs generated by the disease-miRNA-gene and disease-gene networks reveal that mpDisNet can effectively distinguish different class of human diseases, offering potential pathobiological implications. We further identified pulmonary disease comorbidities (e.g., lung cancer-asthma and asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) with potential miRNA-mediated pathobiological mechanisms. If broadly applied, mpDisNet would offer a powerful network-based tool for identification of  disease-disease relationships for multiple complex diseases from heterogeneous biological networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pipeline of mpDisNet</head><p>MpDisNet infers miRNA-mediated disease-disease relationships based on the topology of multiple networks among diseases, miRNAs, and genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The pipeline of mpDisNet has four key steps (see Methods section): (i) network data integration: we reconstructed a heterogenous network by assembling four experimentally validated networks, including disease-miRNA, miRNA-gene, disease-gene, and the human interactome networks (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>); (ii) meta-path-based Random Walks: we reconstructed heterogeneous neighbors of the nodes using the random walk of the meta-path and generated instance sequences; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> (iii) heterogeneous skip-gram: we generated the multidimensional vector for each disease by the skip-gram from the instance sequences; and (iv) network-based inferring disease-disease relationships: we calculated the disease-disease cosine similarities based on the multidimensional vectors generated from the skip-gram (iii). The detailed pipeline of mpDisNet is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance of mpDisNet</head><p>We compared mpDisNet with miRNA-overlap measure on the experimentally validated disease-miRNA association network (see Methods section). Herein, mpDisNet is the result of selecting the meta-path M1 (disease-miRNA-gene-gene-miRNA-disease) and M3 (disease-gene-gene-disease) in an integrated heterogeneous network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). For miRNA-overlap measure, we assume that the set of miRNAs corresponding to disease A is A m , and the corresponding set of disease B is B m . We calculated disease-disease similarity based on overlap measure as below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S overlap ¼ A m T B m A m S B m<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We selected the top 300 pairs of the highest similarity disease pairs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) obtained by miRNA-overlap measure and mpDisNet, and plotted two network graphs of miRNA-overlap measure (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) and mpDisNet (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>), respectively. The node color of each disease is classified according to the disease pathobiological classification from a previous study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Overall, the mpDisNet (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) can capture clinically reported disease-disease comorbidities in the same pathobiological categories of specific diseases, outperforming miRNA-overlap measure (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). For example, associations among obesity (Mesh ID: D009765), diabetes mellitus (Mesh ID: D003920), cystic fibrosis (Mesh ID: D003550), osteoporosis (Mesh ID: D010024), and metabolic syndrome X (Mesh ID: D024821) are well captured by mpDisNet (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). For cardiovascular disease, the significant associations among heart disease (myocardial infarction), coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, ischemia, and hypertension are successfully identified by mpDisNet as well (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). For neurological diseases, the mpDisNet-predicted relationships among schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease were consistent with a recent study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Finally, multiple types of cancer are found to share a strong association identified by mpDisNet, consistent with recent pan-cancer studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Altogether, mpDisNet identifies potentially well-known disease-disease relationships.</p><p>To validate performance of mpDisNet further, we collected 220 clinically reported disease-disease pairs from a previous study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> We found that these 220 disease-disease pairs can be correctly reidentified by mpDisNet. However, miRNA-overlap measure can only identify 120 pairs. We plotted the network map (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) of mpDisNet-predicted 100 comorbid disease pairs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) which are not identified by miRNA-overlap measure. For example, mpDisNet successfully identifies the associations of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome with bipolar disorder, cataract, celiac disease, and Crohn disease. In addition, cerebral infarction is associated with several diseases or syndromes, including friedreich ataxia, long QT Syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 1, osteogenesis imperfecta, retinitis pigmentosa, telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic, and thalassemia, identified by mpDisNet as well (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>We next turned to evaluate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall curves based on 66 clinically reported disease-disease pairs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) derived from the previously published implicit semantic similarity measure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> We found that mpDisNet showed a reasonable accuracy (the area under ROC [AUROC = 0.65] and the area under precision-recall curve [AUPR] = 0.68, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) in inferring the clinically reported disease-disease pairs, outperforming that of miRNA-overlap measure (AUROC = 0.59 and AUPR = 0.56, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In addition, mpDisNet showed a reasonable accuracy (AUROC = 0.67 and AUPR = 0.66) in inferring the clinically reported disease-disease pairs on an external validation set, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> revealing high generalizability. Altogether, mpDisNet reveals high accuracy in inferring disease-disease relationships, outperforming traditional miRNAoverlap measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological interpretation of mpDisNet</head><p>We next turned to investigate whether the underlying miRNAmediated subnetworks identified by mpDisNet can offer potential pathobiological mechanisms for the inferred disease-disease relationships. Specifically, we integrated two networks into a single heterogeneous network and evaluated two meta-paths M1 (disease-miRNA-gene-gene-miRNA-disease) and M3 (disease-gene-gene-disease) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The multidimensional vectors of the two meta-paths were obtained by random walk and skip-gram, and then the multidimensional vectors were concatenated to infer disease-disease relationships (see Methods). We then performed dimensionality reduction visualization analysis using a t-SNE algorithm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> We removed diseases with unknown classification and kept diseases with wellknown pathobiological annotations with at least seven types of diseases in each category. In the dimensionality reduction diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>), a closer distance between two diseases reveals a higher relevant pathobiological relationship. We found that the same pathobiological categories of diseases are clustered by the multidimensional vectors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>), indicating that the underlying miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways can be identified by mpDisNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network-based identification of miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways between lung cancer and asthma</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, we found a strong association of cancers (e.g., lung neoplasms) with asthma and COPD. This finding is consistent with recent meta-analyses, suggesting the potential associations of COPD and asthma with several cancer types such as lung cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> For example, shortness of breath and respiratory distress often increase the suffering of advanced-stage lung cancer patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> However, the underlying disease pathways for lung cancer-associated asthma remain unclear. Asthma is a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the lungs, including airway hyper-reactivity, excessive mucous formation, and respiratory obstruction. We asserted that lung cancerassociated asthma may be caused from tumor cell microenvironments, such as cross-talk pro-inflammatory pathway. For example, recent studies showed that micro-environmental inflammation by tumor cell-immune cell cross-talk may induce lung cancerassociated pulmonary hypertension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> MiRNA-mediated disease-disease networks. Two network graphs of the top 300 disease-disease pairs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) identified by mpDisNet and miRNA-overlap measure, respectively, are shown. a A disease-disease network derived from the miRNA-overlap measure. The edges of disease-disease pairs in (a) represent the similarity by the miRNA-overlap measure (Eq. 1) alone. The top 300 inferred disease-disease pairs connecting 146 diseases are illustrated. b A disease-disease network identified by mpDisNet. The edges of disease-disease pairs in (b) represent the similarity from mpDisNet. In this graph, mpDisNet predicts disease-disease relationships by the combined M1 (disease-miRNA-gene-gene-miRNA-disease) and M3 (disease-gene-gene-disease) meta-paths (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Top 300 inferred disease-disease pairs connecting 61 diseases are illustrated. The node size denotes the degree. The color of nodes is encoded based on the pathobiological categories of diseases. This image is generated by Gephi (<ref type="url" target="https://gephi.org">https://gephi.org</ref>)</p><p>We therefore performed a multi-layer human interactome network analysis to inspect the miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways for lung cancer-associated asthma via mpDisNet (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). For example, two highlighted miRNAs, hsa-mir-7a and hsa-mir-155, play important roles in both lung cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and asthma, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> which are involved in multiple meta-paths in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Hsa-mir-34a was reported as a tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) growth and suppressing the CD44hi stem-like NSCLC cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> We found that a meta-path of hsa-mir-34a-SAA1-APBB1 may involve in the lung cancer-associated asthma by meta-path-based network analysis within the human protein-protein interactome (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). SSA1, encoding serum amyloid A1, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and promotes asthma in mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> Thus, hsa-mir-34a that mediates lung tumor growths, may involve in inflammasome-mediated pathways in asthma as well.</p><p>We next examined whether we can identify novel miRNAmediated pathways for lung cancer-associated asthma. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> reveals that a meta-path of hsa-mir-17-STK11/LKB1 plays a key role in lung cancer by regulating cancer cell metabolism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> STK11/LKB1 is a central regulator of T cell development, activation and metabolism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> In addition, the T cell plays an important functional role in asthma as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Collectively, hsa-mir-17-STK11/ LKB1 may offer a potential pathobiological pathway for lung cancer-associated asthma. In summary, potential miRNA-mediated disease pathways captured by mpDisNet offer candidate biomarkers in understanding of pathobiological mechanisms of lung cancer-associated asthma. However, these candidate network biomarkers identified by mpDisNet are warranted by experimental or clinical validation further.</p><p>Network-based identification of miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways between COPD and asthma Asthma and COPD are obstructive pulmonary diseases that have affected millions of people all over the world. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> They are two diseases with differences in etiology, symptoms, type of airway inflammation, inflammatory cells, mediators, consequences of inflammation, response to therapy and course. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> The similarities in airway inflammation in severe asthma and COPD and good response to combination therapies in both diseases suggest that they may share some pathophysiologic characteristics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> We next turned to inspect the miRNA-mediated pathways between asthma-COPD. Both hsa-let-7a (differentially expressed in patients with severe asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> ) and hsa-let-7b play important roles in asthma by targeting pro-inflammatory pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> We found two meta-paths, including hsa-let-7a-CASP3-CCND1-hsa-mir-20a and hsa-let-7b-CCND2-FOXO4-hsa-mir-499a between asthma and COPD, via mpDisNet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>). Genetic studies and in vitro observations have shown potential associations of CCND1 and CCND2 with asthma and COPD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> In addition, CASP3 was reported to play a functional role in airway epithelial apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> and pro-inflammatory cytokines (FOXO4) may contribute to regulation of muscle atrophy and smooth muscle cell migration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> Altogether, miRNA-mediated airway epithelial apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways (hsa-let-7a and hsa-let-7b) may offer potential mechanisms for the overlapping syndrome between asthma and COPD. In addition, several mpDisNetpredicted meta-paths, such as hsa-mir-148b-ADAM33-PGD-hsamir-1 and hsa-mir-221-ACTB-BUB1-hsa-mir-196a (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>) may offer new pathobiological pathways to explain the asthma-COPD comorbidity as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> A discovered miRNA-mediated disease-disease network by mpDisNet. In this network, 100 clinically reported disease-disease pairs connecting 39 diseases identified by mpDisNet, while they cannot be identified by miRNA-overlap measure, are shown.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Understanding of disease-disease relationships is important for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the human disease. Most of the existing comorbid data are from the medical records analysis of clinical patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> This method requires a large amount of data calculation and has many interference factors. Recent remarkable development of systems biology technologies and network medicine approaches raised possibilities to predict disease comorbidities from human protein-protein interactome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> In order to integrate biological networks to predict disease-disease relationships, we presented a networkbased methodology, termed mpDisNet, to infer disease-disease relationships from miRNA regulatory network perspective.</p><p>Specifically, we constructed a comprehensive, multi-layer biological network connecting diseases, miRNA, and genes. We employed a skip-gram algorithm to obtain the multidimensional feature vectors of disease and then calculated the disease-disease similarities from the reduced informative multidimensional vectors. We demonstrated that mpDisNet can identify both clinically reported and new disease-disease associations, outperforming miRNA-overlap measure. Moreover, mpDisNet offers miRNAmediated pathobiological pathways by searching miRNA metapaths from the human protein-protein interactome, as we showcased for lung cancer-associated asthma and asthma-COPD. However, comprehensive validation for more mpDisNet-predicted disease-disease relationships are warranted in the future.</p><p>We highlighted several significant contributions in the current study. We assembled four comprehensive networks, including disease-miRNA, miRNA-genes, disease-gene, and the human protein-protein interactome to search the meta-paths by mpDis-Net. In this way, we can utilize the complementary information from different biological networks compared with traditional network-based approaches using single type of data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> Network analysis further shows that integrating miRNA-mediated network can improve the capability in inferring disease-disease relationships, offering a new network-based tool for assessment of disease comorbidities. In addition, the network-based framework presented in mpDisNet could be applied for prediction of drug-target interactions, gene-gene (protein-protein) interactions, RNA-RNA interactions, and other biological networks as well. Finally, the new disease-disease relationships inferred by mpDisNet may offer potential candidate network biomarkers for better understanding of underlying pathobiological pathways from miRNA network perspective.</p><p>We acknowledged several potential limitations in current network-based framework of mpDisNet. First, when the known miRNA associated with disease is fewer, the comorbidity between disease pairs computed by miRNA-mediated networks may be false positive. Second, potential literature data bias (e.g., degree/ connectivity of well-studied miRNAs/proteins) may generate a potential false positive rate. Third, each random walk requires a specific meta-path, and the choice of this single meta-path may also affect performance of mpDisNet. In the future, we may improve mpDisNet by integrating more comprehensive biological networks, analyzing the relevant associations in tissue-specific networks in which the disease occurs, adopting more flexible random walk strategies.</p><p>In summary, this study offers a network-based, systems biology methodology for comprehensive identification of disease-disease relationships from miRNA regulatory network perspective. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, mpDisNet would offer a powerful network-based tool for understanding of clinical comorbidities for multiple complex diseases from heterogeneous biological networks, a significant challenge of precision medicine.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reconstruction of heterogeneous networks</head><p>We reconstructed a heterogenous miRNA-gene-disease network by assembling four types of networks: (a) disease-miRNA, (b) miRNA-gene, (c) disease-gene, and (d) the human protein-protein interactome networks.</p><p>Disease-miRNA network. We collected experimentally validated disease-miRNA associations from two databases: miR2Disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> and HMDD v3.0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> All disease terms were annotated by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) vocabularies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> The disease-miRNA associations in two databases were combined and the duplicate associations were removed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heterogeneous skip-gram</head><p>Furthermore, we employed a heterogeneous skip-gram representation learning model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The heterogeneous skip-gram is a modification based on the original Skip-gram model, by adding the superposition of different node types.

According to the negative sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> in Word2vec, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> the above function is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">OðXÞ ¼ log σ X cf Á X v ð Þþ X M m¼1 E u m f $Pf uf ð Þ logσ ÀX u m f Á X v h i<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where σ x ð Þ ¼ 1 1þe Àx and P f (u f ) are pre-defined distributions by the type of node of neighbor, c f , that aims to predict from which a negative node u m f is drawn from for M times. The dimensional reduction visualizes the latent vectors learned by mpDisNet. The latent vectors learned by mpDisNet by combining M1 (disease-miRNA-gene-gene-miRNA-disease) and M3 (disease-gene-gene-disease) meta-paths on an integrated network of disease-gene and disease-miRNA-gene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We only illustrated the diseases with the well-defined pathobiological category with at least seven types of diseases. The diseases are classified according to the clinically annotated pathobiological classification data (color key) from a previous study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> The gradients of the above pre-defined distributions are derived as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∂OðXÞ ∂X u m f ¼ σ X u m f Á X v À I cf ½u m f X v (7) ∂OðXÞ ∂X v ¼ X M m¼0 σ X u m f Á X v À I cf ½u m f X u m f (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where I cf ½u m f is an indicator function to indicate whether u m f is the neighborhood context node c f .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network-based inferring disease-disease relationships</head><p>The network-based similarities between two diseases can be calculated based on single meta-path or multiple meta-paths. In this study, we evaluated three meta-paths (M1, M2, M3) to infer disease-disease relationships. For M1 (disease-miRNA-gene-gene-miRNA-disease) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we randomly walked in disease-miRNA-gene heterogeneous network based on meta-path M1 for 50 steps. Each walk includes 251 nodes. We run 1000 random walks for each disease and 1000 random walk instance sequences are generated. By inputting all the sequences into heterogeneous skip-gram, we obtained the representation vectors of each disease. Then, we calculated the cosine similarity between diseases based on these vectors. In this way, we calculated the disease similarity for meta-path M2 (disease-miRNA-gene-gene-gene-miRNA-disease), M3 (disease-gene-gene-disease) as well. We predicted disease-disease relationships based on multiple meta-paths by concatenating the representation vectors learned from each meta-path and then calculated the cosine similarity between the concatenated vectors. Therefore, we assembled a disease-miRNA-gene network and a disease-gene network into a heterogeneous network. In this integrated heterogeneous network, we selected the meta-paths M1 and M3, respectively. The multidimensional vectors of the two meta-paths can be obtained by random walk and skip-gram, and then the multidimensional vectors were concatenated to infer disease-disease relationships. The detailed network-based analyses are provided in our recent studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> hsa-let-7a Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> Network-based identification of miRNA-mediated pathobiological pathways for lung cancer-associated asthma.
