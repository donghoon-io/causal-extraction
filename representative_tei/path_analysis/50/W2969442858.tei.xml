<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract. Aerosol-cloud interactions represent the leading uncertainty in our ability to infer climate sensitivity from the observational record. The forcing from changes in cloud albedo driven by increases in cloud droplet number (N d ) (the first indirect effect) is confidently negative and has narrowed its probable range in the last decade, but the sign and strength of forcing associated with changes in cloud macrophysics in response to aerosol (aerosol-cloud adjustments) remain uncertain. This uncertainty reflects our inability to accurately quantify variability not associated with a causal link flowing from the cloud microphysical state to the cloud macrophysical state. Once variability associated with meteorology has been removed, covariance between the liquid water path (LWP) averaged across cloudy and clear regions (here characterizing the macrophysical state) and N d (characterizing the microphysical) is the sum of two causal pathways linking N d to LWP: N d altering LWP (adjustments) and precipitation scavenging aerosol and thus depleting N d . Only the former term is relevant to constraining adjustments, but disentangling these terms in observations is challenging. We hypothesize that the diversity of constraints on aerosol-cloud adjustments in the literature may be partly due to not explicitly characterizing covariance flowing from cloud to aerosol and aerosol to cloud. Here, we restrict our analysis to the regime of extratropical clouds outside of low-pressure centers associated with cyclonic activity. Observations from MAC-LWP (Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path) and MODIS are compared to simulations in the Met Office Unified Model (UM) GA7.1 (the atmosphere model of HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1). The meteorological predictors of LWP are found to be similar between the model and observations. There is also agreement with previous literature on cloud-controlling factors finding that increasing stability, moisture, and sensible heat flux enhance LWP, while increasing subsidence and sea surface temperature decrease it. A simulation where cloud microphysics are insensitive to changes in N d is used to characterize covariance between N d and LWP that is induced by factors other than aerosol-cloud adjustments. By removing variability associated with meteorology and scavenging, we infer the sensitivity of LWP to changes in N d . Application of this technique to UM GA7.1 simulations reproduces the true model adjustment strength. Observational constraints developed using simulated covariability not induced by adjustments and observed covariability between N d and LWP predict a 25 %-30 % overestimate by the UM GA7.1 in LWP change and a 30 %-35 % overestimate in associated radiative forcing.</p></div>

This uncertainty reflects the difficulty in disentangling the many factors that determine cloud macrophysical properties. Unlike cloud droplet number concentration (N d ), which is primarily driven by the availability of suitable aerosol, cloud macrophysical properties are primarily determined by the state of the atmosphere but may be modulated by N d <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Stevens and Feingold, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we focus on liquid clouds. Within liquid clouds two main processes are hypothesized to alter cloud liquid content in response to changes in N d . As N d is increased the following may occur: (1) a suppression of precipitation by enhanced N d <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albrecht, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pincus and Baker, 1994)</ref>  <ref type="table"></ref>and<ref type="table"></ref> (2) strengthened entrainment of dry air <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackerman et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bretherton et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wang et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Xue and Feingold, 2006)</ref>. These processes drive the liquid content of cloud in opposite directions following a perturbation in microphysics, further complicating the interpretation of covariability between cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties. Because these processes exist at a timescale and length scale far below those resolved in climate models, they must be parameterized, resulting in substantial uncertainty. Because of this, constraining the cloud macrophysical response to changes in cloud microphysics using observations is an essential step towards constraining aerosol forcing. Aerosol-cloud adjustments are likely to contribute a relatively small fraction of overall variability in cloud macrophysical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bender et al., 2019)</ref> -making the data volume available from remote-sensing observations particularly relevant to providing an observational constraint by detecting the small signal from aerosol-cloud adjustments hidden in meteorologically induced cloud variability. The literature has produced numerous careful analyses of the observational record, but these analyses have produced divergent estimates of the aggregate effect of increased N d on liquid clouds. These impacts range from increased N d increasing liquid content in clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rosenfeld et al., 2019)</ref> to almost no response in in-cloud and area-averaged liquid water path (LWP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Toll et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Malavelle et al., 2017)</ref> and to decreasing liquid content <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gryspeerdt et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sato et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Toll et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, the response in cloud cover to N d has tended to be consistently inferred as producing a forcing equal to or larger than the first indirect effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gryspeerdt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Christensen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andersen et al., 2017)</ref>. A simulation of deep, opencellular boundary layers has shown an increase in the cloud fraction and a decrease in in-cloud LWP, ultimately resulting in an increase in reflected shortwave in the simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Possner et al., 2018)</ref>. Given the wide range of potential observational constraints it remains difficult to offer advice on the cloud microphysical parameterizations that are the most realistic.</p><p>However, the causal link flowing from N d to clouds is not the only mechanism relating cloud macrophysics to cloud microphysics. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wood et al. (2012)</ref>, the spatial pattern in N d observed in nature is primarily determined by precipitation scavenging. That is to say, N d may both alter cloud macrophysical properties and be altered by them, and interpreting observations as a constraint on only microphysical to macrophysical causality is erroneous, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gryspeerdt et al. (2019)</ref>. To be able to constrain cloud responses to aerosol-driven changes in N d we must be able to characterize the effects of cloud macrophysical properties on N d (by precipitation scavenging) and covariability between N d and LWP induced by confounding factors such as the relative location of aerosol sources and climatological cloud cover or meteorological modulation of aerosol and clouds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bender et al. (2019)</ref> proposed utilizing the observed covariance between N d and LWP as an aggregate measure of aerosol-cloud-radiation behavior across climate models and reanalyses. For a model to be able to realistically reproduce aerosol-cloud behavior one precondition is that covariance flowing from clouds to aerosol and from aerosol to clouds as well as the non-causal covariance induced by air mass history must result in total covariance consistent with observations. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gryspeerdt et al. (2019)</ref> examined covariance between N d and in-cloud LWP but proposed to separate variability induced by adjustments from other sources of covariability by using clustering on global data. This study follows these earlier studies and attempts to partition covariance between LWP and N d related to causality flowing from N d to LWP from other covariance. We utilize empirical analysis of observations and model output to try to disentangle variability driven by meteorological "cloud-controlling factors" <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Stevens and Brenguier, 2009)</ref> and variability related to changes in cloud microphysics. Within this framework we focus on the midlatitudes. Previous work has performed similar analysis on cyclonic midlatitude systems, finding a distinct increase in LWP at a fixed precipitation rate <ref type="bibr">(McCoy et al., 2018b)</ref>. These large synoptic systems account for roughly half of the midlatitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2014)</ref>. Here, we turn our attention to the remaining interstitial regions between cyclones. This regime tends to be less cloudy, have an overall lower albedo, and have a lower cloud optical depth (an example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Thus, while these regions do not host dramatic fronts and cloud shields, changes in their liquid cloud due to anthropogenic aerosol may contribute strongly to the overall aerosol forcing because cloud areal coverage and cloud optical depth are further below saturation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Region and variable selection</head><p>The empirical analysis on both observational and simulated data in this work follows pioneering studies investigating meteorological controls on subtropical <ref type="bibr">(Myers and</ref><ref type="bibr">Norris, 2013, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Qu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Klein et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seethala et al., 2015)</ref> and midlatitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Miyamoto et al., 2018)</ref> marine boundarylayer cloudiness. The selection of variables used in this study is based on the findings of these earlier studies. The predictors examined here are sea surface temperature (SST), largescale subsidence (ω) at 550 hPa, the strength of the inversion at the top of the boundary layer (estimated inversion strength -EIS -as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wood and Bretherton, 2006)</ref>, the total water vapor path (WVP), and sensible heat flux (SHF). A summary is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A priori we expect that increasing SSTs should lead to decreasing cloudiness <ref type="bibr">(My-ers and Norris, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Qu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">McCoy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bretherton and Blossey, 2014)</ref>. Increasing subsidence should decrease the liquid water path <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Myers and Norris, 2013)</ref>. Increasing inversion strength should lead to an increasing cloud fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wood and Bretherton, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Klein and Hartmann, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Qu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Myers and Norris, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seethala et al., 2015)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Miyamoto et al. (2018)</ref> from examination of midlatitude ocean fronts, increased SHF should increase cloudiness. Finally, while less extensively studied, an overall increase in WVP seems likely to lead to increased cloudiness as the atmospheric column moisture increases, holding all else equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(McCoy et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The central goal of this study is to develop an empirical constraint on aerosol-cloud adjustments. However, direct measurements of the aerosol state to constrain aerosol-cloud adjustments have been found to be sensitive to errors in pristine conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ma et al., 2018)</ref>. To develop a constraint on aerosol-cloud adjustments we examine the cloud microphysical state in addition to the meteorological parameters listed above. Cloud droplet number concentration is the state variable relating cloud macrophysics to aerosol concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Wood, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grosvenor et al., 2018)</ref> and is the predictor used in this study to characterize aerosol-cloud adjustments.</p><p>We hasten to note that the list of predictors described above is not intended to be complete (that is to say, we do not anticipate that we will be able to explain 100 % of the variability in clouds with these predictors). Our goal is to explain enough variability with these predictors to be able to infer statistically robust relationships between cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties in the variance unexplained by meteorological variability. The predictive ability of these inferred relationships will be tested within the context of a global climate model (GCM).</p><p>Having discussed predictors, we will now discuss predictands. Outside of cyclones cloud cover is primarily liquid, boundary-layer cloud, which substantially affects shortwave radiation but has little effect on longwave radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hartmann and Short, 1980)</ref>. Thus, we focus on the liquid water path (LWP) averaged over cloudy and clear regions. This variable allows observations and model output to be compared without needing to simulate output from a passive spectroradiometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2011)</ref> or considering cloud overlap, as would be required for in-cloud LWP.</p><p>Analysis is carried out in the Northern Hemisphere (here 30-60 • N) over oceans. This choice has been made for several reasons: first, there is a large variability in N d across the northern midlatitudes that is not strongly driven by the seasonal cycle. In the Southern Ocean cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) variability is primarily due to biogenic sources, and their variability is strongly driven by the seasonal cycle, making analysis in the context of meteorological controls difficult to interpret <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ayers and Gras, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">McCoy et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Charlson et al., 1987)</ref>. Second, Southern Ocean N d is still poorly represented in the Met Office Unified Model GA7.1 (discussed in Sect. 2.4), with both too low a mean value and generally too small a seasonal cycle -in contrast to the Northern Hemisphere, which compares well with observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mulcahy et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Outside of cyclone compositing</head><p>The passage of synoptic systems is the central mode of variability in midlatitude cloudiness. <ref type="bibr">McCoy et al. (2018b)</ref> focused on cyclone systems and showed that once meteorological variability was accounted for, the effects of changes in cloud microphysics driven by changes in N d on liquid content are revealed. This work utilized the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Field and Wood (2007)</ref> cyclone compositing algorithm, which uses sea-level pressure (SLP) to identify cyclone centers. Here we utilize the same compositing approach but focus on all data that are 2000 km away from a cyclone center, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bodas-Salcedo et al. (2014)</ref>. This separates the midlatitudes into times when a cyclone is nearby and when there is no cyclone nearby. Once cyclone centers are identified all data within 2000 km of an identified cyclone center are masked out of the data set. All data over land are also masked because microwave observations are unavailable (see next section).</p><p>A schematic representation of the frequency of occurrence of out-of-cyclone states is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> and is 42 % in the 30-60 • N region focused on in this study. All data are regridded to a common 1 • × 1 • spatial resolution before analysis. All data are daily mean, except for observed N d , which is only available for the MODIS Aqua overpass; however the diurnal cycle of N d is thought to be relatively slight <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dong et al., 2014)</ref>, and it is unlikely that this retrieval limitation significantly impacts our results. Our choice of resolution is motivated by the natural resolution of the Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) data set. Performing the analysis with a coarser resolution might change the regression coefficients derived in Sect. 2.5, as has been reported for analysis of the first indirect effect <ref type="bibr">(Mc-Comiskey and Feingold, 2012)</ref>. However, in Sect. 3.4 we validate the adjustments inferred from this resolution against the true adjustments in Met Office Unified Model (UM) GA7.1 (the atmosphere model of HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1) and find agreement, which demonstrates that our choice of resolution does not affect our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Observations</head><p>The cloud liquid water path (LWP) is calculated based on the aggregated observations from multiple satellite microwave sensors following the methodology of the multisensor advanced climatology of LWP (MAC-LWP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Elsaesser et al., 2017)</ref> at a daily mean resolution. Microwave radiometers are sensitive to total liquid. This means that the retrieval must calculate a partitioning between precipitating and nonprecipitating liquid. Here, the liquid water path in clouds is calculated following <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Elsaesser et al. (2017)</ref>. Previous analysis has shown that the midlatitude partitioning of rain and cloud in MAC-LWP compares favorably with convectionpermitting simulations <ref type="bibr">(McCoy et al., 2018b)</ref>. The MAC-LWP data set estimates that 7 % of total liquid path is rain in the NH midlatitudes outside of cyclones. Because of the low fraction of rainwater in the midlatitudes outside of cyclones it is unlikely that the need to partition the observations into rain and cloud water substantially affects observational constraints as calculated in Sect. 3.3. The liquid water path is defined as the average of cloudy and clear regions and is insensitive to overlying ice cloud (unlike passive optical retrievals). This definition of LWP is consistent with the definition from GCMs. Microwave retrievals are only available over the ocean.</p><p>Observations of N d are calculated based on MODIS observations of cloud optical depth and droplet effective radius. Level 2 swath data (joint product) from MODIS collection 5.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(King et al., 2003)</ref> are filtered by removing pixels with solar zenith angles greater than 65 • to eliminate problematic retrievals at a pixel level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grosvenor and Wood, 2014)</ref>. The daily mean N d at 1 • × 1 • resolution is calculated from the filtered level 2 swath data and only low (cloud tops below 3.2 km), liquid clouds were used to calculate N d . Only 1 • × 1 • regions where the liquid cloud fraction exceeds 80 % are considered valid <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bennartz et al., 2011)</ref>, and the N d is calculated using the effective radius from the 3.7 µm MODIS channel. This data set is evaluated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grosvenor et al. (2018)</ref> and in <ref type="bibr">McCoy et al. (2018a)</ref>, where it shows consistency with measurements from aircraft. We feel that this combination of radiometers in constraining adjustments is particularly advantageous because there is no shared information between the microwave retrieval of LWP and the shortwave and near-infrared retrieval of N d . This is in contrast to the common practice of utilizing MODIS retrievals of cloud droplet effective radius and optical depth to calculate both the in-cloud LWP and N d , making it conceptually difficult to cleanly infer changes in LWP due to changes in N d .</p><p>The meteorological state of the atmosphere is characterized using reanalysis from MERRA-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Molod et al., 2015)</ref> and microwave observations of WVP from MAC-LWP. The period during which all of these observations are available stretches from 2003 to 2015. A list of variables and data sources is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>

The GA7.1 atmosphere model is the physical basis for the atmosphere model included in the HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1 climate model submission to CMIP6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Walters et al., 2019)</ref>. All simulations are run for 2 years and 3 months, starting in September 2013. Simulations are nudged to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis winds above model level 16 (approximately 1.8 km). Paired simulations are conducted with emissions of aerosol and precursor gases set to preindustrial (henceforth labeled PI) and to present-day (labeled PD) levels. Anthropogenic emissions use the CMIP6 inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Eyring et al., 2016)</ref>, natural emissions over land use the MEGAN-MACC inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sindelarova et al., 2014)</ref>, and natural emissions over the ocean follow the POET inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Granier et al., 2005)</ref>. These simulations are conducted to calculate the response of cloud to anthropogenic aerosol. Additional sensitivity studies were carried out, starting with nudging at level 27 (approximately 5 km) and without nudging. In the latter case simulations of the PI and PD were run for 10 years and 3 months, starting in September 2003.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Analyzing covariance in the system</head><p>Our goal in this paper is to characterize how N d drives LWP. However, to reveal robust correlations between N d and LWP, meteorological variability must be accounted for. To achieve this we follow previous empirical analysis of cloudcontrolling factors and utilize multiple linear regression to characterize the dependence of various cloud properties as predictands on the predictors described above <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Myers and Norris, 2015)</ref>. As with all empirical analyses of observations, correlation between predictors and the predictand does not necessarily mean that they are causally linked. The meteorological predictors selected here have had mechanisms hypothesized to link them to cloud variability. Another issue with this and similar analyses of the response of cloud to cloud-controlling factors is that thermodynamic and dynamical predictors within the Earth's atmosphere are correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(McCoy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Myers and</ref><ref type="bibr">Norris, 2015, 2013)</ref>. As the variance shared by predictors grows, the uncertainty in the coefficients calculated by multiple linear regression increases. While this is an issue, it is inescapable in trying to disentangle the effects of different cloud-controlling factors on cloud properties. Examples of meteorological variables that are correlated but have opposing effects on cloud cover include subsidence and stability and stability and SST <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Myers and Norris, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Qu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wall et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To reduce predictor covariance we bin our 1 • × 1 • daily mean data from model output and observations into the space of SST and WVP. All output over oceans is considered in the analysis. We choose these predictors to bin our data before performing regression analysis because they represent two of the most basic meteorological state variables, because they covary strongly, and because LWP varies significantly as a function of WVP and SST in both observations and simulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>); 9 bins are used to span WVP (0-40 kg m -2 ), and 10 are used for SST (275-305 K). We propose that a multiple-linear-regression model of the form,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">LWP = a ccn CCN + a 2 ω 550 + a 3 EIS + a 4 WVP + a 5 SST + a 6 SHF + a 7 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>be trained in each bin of SST and WVP. All the predictors within the regression model are environmental drivers that are external to the clouds being influenced. However, robust remote-sensing observations of CCN are lacking and ln(N d ) is used in its place. As discussed above, N d is predominantly a function of CCN availability. Thus, a multiplelinear-regression model,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">LWP = a 1 ln(N d ) + a 2 ω 550 + a 3 EIS + a 4 WVP + a 5 SST + a 6 SHF + a 7 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>is trained in each bin of WVP and SST.

The initiation of precipitation in boundary-layer cloud can substantially impact LWP within a given cloud with a timescale longer than the daily sampling timescale utilized here <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berner et al., 2013)</ref>. However, the spatial scale of our analysis (1 • × 1 • ) samples clouds at many stages of their life cycle. This means that we do not need to consider rain to be a predictor of LWP and may think of it as scaling with cloud LWP.</p><p>Training the regression model in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) produces a measure of the covariance between predictors and predictands. In particular, it produces a measure of the covariability between ln(N d ) and LWP (a 1 ). However, this covariance does not show causality. N d may enhance LWP by, for instance, suppressing rain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albrecht, 1989)</ref>, and it is this relationship where causality runs from N d to LWP that is of interest in understanding adjustments. However, the observed covariabil- ity between N d and LWP is also the product of causality running from LWP to N d due to precipitation removing aerosol and reducing N d <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wood et al., 2012)</ref>. The overall covariance between N d and LWP is the product of these two causal pathways as well as correlation induced by environmental factors driving both clouds and aerosol and by geographic and seasonal distribution of sources of aerosol relative to cloud.  for consistency with Eq.

In the topographic space describing LWP in terms of N d Cloud and N d Scav , reduced N d Scav corresponds to increased precipitation rates and, in turn, LWP.

We note that this methodology is subject to several limitations. First, as noted above, it assumes that feedbacks between adjustments and scavenging are small. This assumption will break down as adjustments become stronger. However, the response in cloud to transient changes in aerosol does not appear to permit very strong adjustments <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Malavelle et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Toll et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Toll et al., , 2019))</ref>. Second, it is assumed here that the relationship between LWP and ln(N d ) is linear. Empirically this assumption appears to hold in the models and observations (as shown in the following section), and inclusion of higher-order polynomials of ln(N d ) in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) did not alter our results.</p><p>To reiterate, non-causal factors also lead to correlation between N d and LWP because air mass history is important for both clouds and aerosol <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mauger and Norris, 2007)</ref>. In the discussion of the conceptual model presented above we focused on the impact of changes in N d on LWP and vice versa. Spurious correlation due to air mass history will affect both terms on the right-hand side of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) when they are calculated using regression. Thus, the correction for scavenginginduced variability in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) also corrects for variability induced by air mass history simultaneously affecting N d and LWP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Variance in LWP as a function of N d</head><p>As described in the Methods section, data from observations and the control simulation in the UM between 30 and 60 • N over oceans and 2000 km from cyclone centers at a daily mean resolution are binned by WVP and SST, and the regression model shown in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) is trained in each bin. If we plot the quantity, LWP-a 2 ω 500 -a 3 EIS-a 4 WVP-a 5 SST-a 6 SHF-a 7 , (12) as a function of N d we can see that the coefficient relating LWP to N d is greater than zero at 99 % confidence, once variability associated with meteorological predictors is removed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). The residual variance in LWP covaries with N d similarly between the observations and UM simulations where observations exist. However, one key difference is the span of N d values in the observations and simulations. Observed N d almost never falls below 30 cm -3 (the grey line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>), while the N d calculated by the model occasionally falls below this value (∼ 10 % of modeled ln(N d )). This is not surprising because the model suffers from no retrieval limitations and can always measure an N d , even when cloud is extremely tenuous. Ultimately the goal of this study is to utilize the slope of LWP with respect to N d to infer adjustment strength. However, using the slope from the observations and the models will produce quite different values due to the strong increase in LWP with N d below 30 cm -3 . In order to compare observations and models fairly we exclude data for N d &lt; 30 cm -3 .</p><p>For N d &gt; 30 cm -3 residual LWP decreases with increasing N d in both observations and models. This agrees with the notion that precipitation variability drives N d <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wood et al., 2012)</ref> and agrees with previous analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gryspeerdt et al., 2019)</ref>. Clearly, this does not mean that the model reduces cloudiness in response to aerosol. The cloud microphysics within the UM GA7.1 must increase LWP in response to a change in N d , and analysis of the model response to changes from preindustrial (PI) to present-day (PD) aerosol confirmed a negative forcing from adjustments <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mulcahy et al., 2018)</ref>. As discussed in the Methods section, the difference in slopes between the scavenging-only and control simulation is a proxy for the response in cloud microphysics to N d . Before analyzing this difference, we will briefly discuss the covariance between LWP and meteorological predictors in the observations and the control simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Covariances between LWP and meteorology</head><p>Before returning to discussing aerosol-cloud adjustments, we discuss the covariances between observed LWP and the other predictors in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>). This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. The explained variance (R 2 ) by the regression model exceeds 40 % except at low WVP and SST. The variance explained across all bins of SST and WVP is 46 % of daily mean 1 • × 1 • variability. That is to say, nearly half of the day-to-day variability in LWP across the midlatitudes away from cyclones can be explained as a simple linear combination of five variables.</p><p>Several of the predictors have uniform effects on LWP: LWP decreases with subsidence (consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Myers and Norris, 2013)</ref>, increases with WVP, decreases with increas-ing SST (consistent with <ref type="bibr">Qu et al., 2015, and references therein)</ref>, and increases with sensible heat flux (consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Miyamoto et al., 2018)</ref>. We note that at very low SST it appears that LWP may increase with SST. It is possible that this feature is related to ice-to-liquid transitions <ref type="bibr">(Mc-Coy et al., 2015b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tsushima et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Senior and Mitchell, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tan et al., 2016)</ref>, but this region only accounts for a small fraction of the overall data volume. The only meteorological predictor that correlates positively and negatively with LWP across the SST-WVP phase space is EIS. At higher WVP and lower SST, EIS and LWP are negatively correlated, while at low WVP and high SST, they are positively correlated. The latter effect is consistent with increasing EIS increasing the cloud fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wood and Bretherton, 2006)</ref>. One possibility is that because clouds are closer to 100 % in areal coverage at higher WVP and lower SST, increasing stability suppresses the thickening of cloud in this regime, while the clouds cannot expand horizontally.</p><p>Examination of the control simulation shows very similar covariances between meteorological predictors and LWP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>). Notable differences are the stronger positive covariance between SST and LWP at low SST and uniform negative covariance between EIS and LWP across the SST-WVP phase space. However, the relationship between LWP and meteorology is strikingly similar to that between observations and the UM. The explained variance by predictors tends to be higher in the UM GA7.1 (64 %), but it is hard to say how much of this difference in explained variance is due to simplification of the real atmosphere and cloud physics by the model and how much is due to observational error.</p><p>In this framework we also characterize the covariance between ln(N d ) and LWP. The correlation between ln(N d ) and LWP is primarily negative in the observations, with positive correlations only occurring at high WVP and low SST. The correlation between LWP and ln(N d ) in the model is almost uniformly negative (in the data set restricted to N d &gt; 30 cm -3 ). Standardization of the predictor strength estimates the effect of a standard deviation change in each predictor in standard deviations of LWP. In both the observations and models the impact of a standard deviation in meteorological predictors dwarfs the effect of a standard deviation in ln(N d ), with contributions from subsidence and SHF dominating variability. That is to say, the relative contributions of variability in N d are quite small in comparison to variability that is simply due to the weather.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Inferring the effect of N d on LWP</head><p>As we have seen, the correlation between LWP and N d is mostly negative. The slope relating ln(N d ) to LWP in the context of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) is reproduced in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref>. However, if we manually set the N d seen by autoconversion, radiation, and settling to 75 cm -3 in the UM GA7.1 (the approximate mean value in the study region) the negative covariance strengthens substantially (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8c</ref>). This model version is termed "scav-   enging only" because scavenging is the only causal link between cloud and aerosol (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). As discussed in the Methods section, the effect of changes in N d on LWP may be approximated by the difference between Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8b</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>. This is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8e</ref>. This agrees with our expectation based on our knowledge of how the UM GA7.1 treats liquid cloud processes. We know that the effect of increasing N d on autoconversion and settling is to inhibit the conversion of cloud to rain and reduce cloud droplet fall speed.</p><p>To evaluate the accuracy of this method in inferring the sensitivity of LWP to N d we conduct simulations where causality is forced to flow from the N d to LWP. This is done by setting the N d seen by the autoconversion, settling, and radiation to constant values. Two simulations are conducted for each mechanism, with N d set to 100 and 300 cm -3 . The N d seen by the other mechanisms is held constant at 30 cm -3 . A further three simulations are conducted, in which N d seen by all three mechanisms is set to 30, 100, and 300 cm -3 (Table 2). This yields a set of simulations describing the effects on LWP of an increase in N d in the autoconversion, settling, or radiation as well as via all three mechanisms simultaneously. Analysis of the effects of increased N d seen by the radiation code showed negligible changes in LWP and is not shown here.</p><p>As in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, the fit in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) is trained in each bin of WVP and SST across each set of three simulations. The N d seen by the model parameterization is used in the multiple linear regression (Eq. 4). As expected, given the functional form of these parameterizations (Eqs. 1 and 2) the effect of increasing N d in either autoconversion or settling results in an increase in LWP, as does the case where N d in the settling, autoconversion, and radiation are all varied together. The effect of a perturbation in the N d seen by autoconversion, radiation, and settling on LWP is nearly identical to the slope inferred by subtracting the slope in the scavenging-only run from the control run following Eq. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8f</ref>). This comparison be-tween the true model sensitivity of LWP to changes in N d supports the validity of the multiple-linear-regression-based inference approach pursued here.</p><p>Autoconversion and settling are likely to interact with each other in a non-linear manner. As one is suppressed as a sink of cloud liquid, the other will grow (for example, if the conversion of cloud to rain is rendered inefficient, then the gravitational settling of cloud droplets will become more efficient as the liquid content grows). Analysis of crosstalk between these terms is not the focus of this article, but sensitivity of LWP to changes in each mechanism is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8f</ref>. The effect of perturbing settling N d on LWP is larger than the effect of perturbing the autoconversion N d , singling it out as an important lever in controlling adjustment strength for future study. This result is consistent with the large process rate for settling relative to autoconversion found in weakly precipitating low-cloud regimes in CAM5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gettelman et al., 2013)</ref>. It is also possible that interactions between settling and N d may decrease the sensitivity of warm rain to autoconversion representation that is diagnosed in other models <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Michibata et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jing et al., 2019)</ref>. Overall, the results of this study are insensitive to whether settling or autoconversion has a stronger effect on aerosol-cloud adjustments because we assume that feedbacks between scavenging and adjustments are small.</p><p>Given that the scavenging-only simulation can be used to infer the adjustment strength in the UM, we also attempt to use the scavenging-only simulation to infer the strength of adjustments in the real world (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8d</ref>). This assumes that the statistical relationship between LWP and rain rates in the UM GA7.1 and the scavenging of CCN-relevant aerosol by precipitation in the UM GA7.1 is realistic.</p><p>Based on the covariance between N d and LWP in the scavenging-only simulations in the UM GA7.1 and observations we offer an estimate of adjustment strength. The adjustment strength inferred from observations is stronger than the UM for low SST and high WVP. Unlike the UM, weak negative covariance between LWP and N d exists for high SST and low WVP. This may indicate that the scavenging of aerosol by the UM is too efficient, or some other confounder of the relationship between LWP and N d is poorly represented in the model, or it may point to the thinning of cloud via enhanced entrainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackerman et al., 2004)</ref>, which is not represented in the UM. Overall, the effect of increasing N d in the UM is an increase in LWP.</p><p>We have discussed how to infer adjustment strength from the total covariance between N d and LWP, which mixes covariance induced by causality flowing from cloud to aerosol and aerosol to cloud. In the next section we show how this inferred adjustment strength from the simple regression model is able to predict LWP adjustments in response to anthropogenic aerosols within the full GCM simulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Reproducing simulated adjustments between the preindustrial and present-day aerosol emission</head><p>We have produced an estimate of the sensitivity of LWP to changes in N d in the UM GA7.1 model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8e</ref>). Does this simple regression model hold skill in reproducing the actual change in LWP within the model between the presentday (PD) and preindustrial (PI) aerosol emissions? Simulations are carried out by setting aerosol emission to preindustrial values. This is done for simulations using the GA7.1 scavenging parameterization. A second set of simulations is conducted where the ECHAM-HAM5 scavenging coefficients are used to estimate the sensitivity to the representation of scavenging. PI, PD, and scavenging-only simulations are conducted for each scavenging configuration.</p><p>The change in LWP between the PI and PD ( LWP PD-PI ) simulated by the UM is 2.9 g m -2 , averaged across the 30-60 • N region. Using the UM-simulated change in N d ( N dPD-PI ) and the slope relating ln(N d ) to LWP diag-nosed from present-day variability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>) we calculate LWP PD-PI . If the covariance between ln(N d ) and LWP observed in the control run (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8b</ref>) of the model and N dPD-PI is used to predict LWP PD-PI , the negative correlation introduced by precipitation scavenging leads to a negative LWP PD-PI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9a</ref>; in disagreement with the UMsimulated LWP PD-PI ). If the covariance in the scavengingonly simulation (causality flows from clouds to precipitation to aerosol to N d ) is used (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8c</ref>), the regressionmodel-predicted decrease in LWP between PI and PD aerosol levels doubles. However, if we subtract the sensitivity in scavenging-only simulation from the control simulation to yield the sensitivity of LWP to changes in N d (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8e</ref>), the LWP PD-PI predicted by the regression model and the UM-simulated N dPD-PI agree well with the UM-simulated LWP PD-PI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>). This result supports the utility of the inferred sensitivity of LWP to N d in examining adjustments due to PD aerosol.</p><p>What does the covariance between LWP and ln(N d ) in the real world tell us about the model? Use of the observational estimate of adjustment strength (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8d</ref>) calculates a LWP PD-PI that is two-thirds of the LWP PD-PI inferred from the control run and N dPD-PI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>). This is because, while the inferred sensitivity of LWP to N d from observations is quite strong in some regions, it is weakly negative in the most commonly occurring WVP-SST regimes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8d</ref>). That is to say, if the efficacy of precipitation in removing CCN-relevant aerosol in the real atmosphere is near to the efficacy in the UM, the relationship between LWP and rain rates in the real atmosphere is near to the relationship in the UM, and the covariability between N d and LWP induced by other confounders of the N d -LWP relationship is realistic, then the adjustments ( LWP PD-PI ) simulated by the UM are not unreasonable, albeit a little large. This result is consistent with constraints provided by simulation of the Holuhraun eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Malavelle et al., 2017)</ref>, which showed that the anomaly predicted by HadGEM3 was within the observed range. However, the observationally inferred sensitivity of LWP to changes in N d is stronger in low-SST and high-WVP regimes than it is in the UM GA7.1 but much weaker, or even slightly negative, in low-WVP and high-SST regimes. This results in a strong latitudinal gradient in LWP PD-PI between 30 and 60 • N inferred from observations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9b</ref>).</p><p>The predicted LWP PD-PI based on the control and scavenging-only simulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8e</ref>) underestimates the UM-simulated LWP PD-PI by around 10 %. This may result from disregarding feedbacks between precipitation suppression and N d <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jing and Suzuki, 2018)</ref>, may simply be due to shortcomings in the simple linear model relating ln(N d ) to LWP, or may relate to meteorological differences between the PI and PD simulations not accounted for by meteorological predictors or compositing. However, the fractional reduction in inferred LWP PD-PI when observations are used to constrain the sensitivity of LWP to N d sug-gests that LWP PD-PI should be around 60 %-70 % of the value predicted by the UM GA7.1 averaged across the NH.</p><p>LWP PD-PI inferred from observations is extremely dependent on latitude, with almost no change in LWP over lower latitudes and warmer SSTs. We hasten to note that the change in N d between the PI and PD is uncertain and its prediction by UM GA7.1 may be biased, making the absolute values of the constrained LWP PD-PI less relevant than the fractional overestimation in UM-simulated LWP PD-PI . This analysis is repeated using simulations that are only nudged above level 27 of the model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) and not nudged at all (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), with minimal differences from the results presented in the main text.</p><p>We have focused on changes in LWP in this work because it is a variable that we have good observations of, it can be compared between models and observations in a straightforward way, and it clearly links to adjustments. However, this variable is not the key variable in discussing radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. How does the radiative forcing from adjustments scale with LWP? Determining the precise effects of adjustments on the shortwave cloud radiative effect is difficult, but if we assume that the perturbations in LWP induced by adjustments are similar to the perturbations that are driven by meteorology, we can offer a simple estimate to inform our understanding of the modeled forcing from adjustments.</p><p>Examination of the relationship between LWP and albedo within the UM GA7.1 shows a rapid climb in albedo for low LWP, followed by saturation at higher values, as expected from saturation of the cloud fraction and optical depth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>). This curve can be fit by a second-degree polynomial, meaning that the sensitivity of albedo to changes in LWP is a function of the LWP. That is to say, regions where LWP is already high are going to have a smaller increase in albedo for a unit change in LWP. The change in LWP between PI and PD is much smaller than the range of the variation in LWP in the climate mean state, so we use the average of monthly mean LWP between PI and PD to calculate the sensitivity of albedo to changes in LWP for the NH midlatitudes. This sensitivity (dα/dLWP) is multiplied by the change in LWP to yield change in albedo. This change in albedo is scaled by the downwelling shortwave to give the change in reflected shortwave.</p><p>The change in reflected shortwave predicted from LWP changes in the UM GA7.1 is 1.9-2.0 W m -2 , depending on the scavenging parametrization used. The change in shortwave inferred from the regression model of LWP trained in the control run and corrected by the scavenging-only run is 1.5 W m -2 . If the observed sensitivity of LWP to N d is used to constrain LWP, the predicted change in reflected shortwave is approximately 1.0 W m -2 . Thus, we estimate that GA7.1 overpredicts the change in reflected shortwave due to adjustments in response to a given change in N d by around 50 %. This estimate is subject to the caveat that changes in LWP due to adjustments may not affect albedo in the same way as suggested by examining the total variability. For ex-  ample, adjustments might only increase the liquid content of the thickest clouds and have a relatively slight impact on albedo. However, it is unclear how to provide a more complex calculation than the one presented here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>As the possible range for the radiative forcing from the first indirect effect has narrowed, aerosol-cloud adjustments have become an increasingly central source of uncertainty in aerosol-cloud radiative forcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bellouin et al., 2020)</ref>. Here we focus on the northern midlatitudes, where the majority of anthropogenic aerosol is emitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Myhre et al., 2013)</ref>. Previous work has examined aerosol-cloud adjustments in midlatitude cyclones, showing that cyclone liquid water path (LWP) increases with cloud droplet number concentration (N d ; <ref type="bibr">Mc-Coy et al., 2018b)</ref>. This work focuses on the remainder of cases in the midlatitudes, when there is no cyclone center within 2000 km (roughly 42 % of the time between 30 and 60 • N; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Untangling the effect of cloud microphysics on cloud macrophysics from the total variability in cloud macrophysics is challenging. In the observational record we can only characterize the covariance between predictors and predictands. In interrogating the observed covariances between cloud properties and different meteorological predictors we find many of the relationships that have been described in the literature documenting cloud-controlling factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Myers and Norris, 2015)</ref>. Once meteorological variability is accounted for, statistically significant relationships between cloud microphysics (N d ) and cloud macrophysics (LWP) appear. In keeping with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gryspeerdt et al., 2019)</ref>, LWP and N d are found to be negatively correlated. However, this is clearly not consistent with the UM GA7.1 GCM's actual response in LWP to changes in aerosol emissions between PI and PD. This negative correlation is due to a combination of N d being driven by scavenging, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wood et al. (2012)</ref>, and spurious correlation between N d and LWP driven by external variables affecting both terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mauger and Norris, 2007)</ref>, overwhelming any positive covariance driven by aerosol-cloud adjustments.</p><p>While we cannot disentangle the covariance due to adjustments and covariance due to scavenging and other confounders in the observational record, we can create simulations in which causality is forced to flow from clouds to N d (scavenging only). Using this measure of non-adjustmentinduced variability in N d , we can infer the effect of changing N d on LWP. This inferred sensitivity of LWP to N d agrees well with simulations where N d is manually varied in the cloud microphysics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8f</ref>). The inferred sensitivity of LWP to N d , combined with the UM-predicted change in N d , reproduces the UM-predicted change in LWP between the PI and PD ( LWP PD-PI ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>). These two tests support this method's relevance to understanding aerosol-cloud adjustments.</p><p>The analysis presented here, combined with the enhancement in LWP in cyclone systems shown in <ref type="bibr">McCoy et al. (2018b)</ref>, points toward an overall increase in LWP across the NH midlatitudes in response to anthropogenic aerosol. Ultimately, while the regimes examined here and in <ref type="bibr">McCoy et al. (2018b)</ref> are very different, the detection of a change in LWP in response to changes in N d rests on the ability of the technique to account for non-adjustmentinduced variability in N d . In <ref type="bibr">McCoy et al. (2018b)</ref> this was done by stratifying the data set by the cyclone precipitation rate, which is well-constrained by the large-scale environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Field and Wood, 2007)</ref>; this in turn stratifies the data set by the scavenging of aerosol.</p><p>Assuming that scavenging in the UM GA7.1 model is realistic, that the relationship between LWP and precipitation is reasonable, and that the non-causal covariance produced by other factors is replicated in the model, we evaluate the strength of adjustments based on observations. This reveals that the present version of the UM GA7.1 overestimates the sensitivity of LWP to changes in N d by approximately 50 % outside of midlatitude cyclones. Calculation of the implied change in shortwave shows a similar overestimate in forcing due to adjustments by the UM. Observations also imply that aerosol-cloud adjustments in the UM GA7.1 occur in the wrong regime. Adjustments in the UM favor warmer SSTs and lower WVP, while the observations favor colder SSTs and higher WVP. This difference in regime may be due to early precipitation onset in the UM GA7.1.</p><p>The present study and <ref type="bibr">McCoy et al. (2018b)</ref> project a negative forcing due to adjustments in the midlatitudes. Extension of this study to the subtropics and tropics is reserved for a future analysis. While extrapolating the present results to the tropics is difficult, it seems reasonable to suppose that the pattern of adjustments in the subtropics is relatively similar to the inter-cyclone regime analyzed here and to expect a negative forcing in this region due to adjustments, although this may be weaker than the midlatitude adjustments due to decreasing LWP for increasing N d over higher SSTs and lower WVP over some of the subtropics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8d</ref>). One important limitation of this study is that it assumes weak feedbacks between adjustments and scavenging. If some regimes have very strong feedback between precipitation and adjustments, then our analysis will infer adjustments that are too weak.</p><p>Our result is in contradiction with previous empirical constraint studies that have postulated that changes in N d greatly enhance LWP <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Rosenfeld et al., 2019)</ref>, have little effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Malavelle et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Toll et al., 2017)</ref>, or reduce LWP <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sato et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gryspeerdt et al., 2019)</ref>. We suggest that this diversity within the literature is because a range of constraints may be arrived at, depending on the degree to which precipitation scavenging and meteorological driving of aerosol and cloud occludes aerosol-cloud adjustments and the steps that are taken in the analysis to account for scavenging-induced and meteorologically induced covariability. Based on the analysis presented here we believe that positive, zero, or extremely strongly negative radiative forcings due to aerosol-cloud adjustments in the midlatitudes are not supported by the observations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

How do we constrain adjustments based on examination of modeled and observed N d and LWP if we cannot disentangle causality? The solution we propose is to use a simplified version of the model to characterize the sensitivity of N d to precipitation and other factors and use this sensitivity to interpret the full model. To conceptualize why this process can estimate the sensitivity of LWP to N d we can write an equation describing small changes in LWP in the space of small changes in N d . First, we consider that N d acting on cloud microphysics (N d Cloud ) and N d when precipitation scavenging is the only causal factor linking cloudiness and N d (N d Scav ) as separate entities. In the latter case air mass history and sinks unrelated to precipitation can affect N d , in addition to the effect of precipitation scavenging, but precipitation scavenging is the only causal link between cloud and aerosol (see Fig. 3). We consider changes in LWP relative to N d Cloud and N d Scav . That is to say we consider LWP = f n(ln(N d Cloud ), ln(N d Scav )), where the logs are added</figDesc></figure>

A simple conceptual model demonstrating how variance due to precipitation driving of N d and due to N d driving changes in LWP through cloud microphysics affects total covariance between N d and LWP in observations and models. N d where scavenging is the only causal link between cloud and aerosol (N dScav ) and N d affecting the cloud microphysics (N dCloud ) are considered to be distinct entities. The contour map in (a) illustrates a potential topological LWP space in terms of N dCloud and N dScav . The case where N dCloud is set to a constant value is shown with a blue line, and the case where N dCloud is increased independently is shown with a red line. In a causal sense this implies N dCloud driving LWP (shown in b) and N dScav being driven by LWP (shown in c), where N dScav is negatively correlated with LWP because dN dScav /dR &lt; 0 and dLWP/dR &gt; 0, where R is rain rate. The observed variability in LWP in terms of N d is shown in (d) for the cases N dCloud = N d and N dScav = constant (red), N dScav = N d and N dCloud = constant (blue), and N dCloud = N dScav = N d (the real world; dashed line).</figDesc><graphic coords="7,310.11,66.33,235.28,276.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>

That is to say, the cloud microphysics and radiation see that the N d calculated by the nucleation scheme and aerosol experiences the effects of scavenging and meteorology. In this particular case the derivatives of N d Scav and N d Cloud each go to unity because the N d seen by the cloud and affected by scavenging is equal, and we are left with dLWP d ln(N d ) = ∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Scav ) N d Cloud + ∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Cloud ) N d Scav . (9) We always sample along the dashed line in Fig. 4a in the observational record or in a model where clouds are sensitive to N d and aerosol is scavenged, giving the curve in Fig. 4d. This curve combines the effects of causality flowing from N d to LWP and from LWP to precipitation to aerosol and onto N d . The term ∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Cloud ) is the key to constraining adjustments because it describes the sensitivity of LWP to changes in N d (in this analogy the slope of LWP along the red line in Fig. 4a). While we cannot disentangle causality in observations or in a model where N d affects cloud microphysics, we propose that in a model configuration where cloud microphysics (e.g., radiation, settling, and autoconversion in UM GA7.1) are unaffected by N d we may estimate the term ∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Scav ) . That is to say, if N d Cloud = constant and N d = N d Scav , then dLWP d ln(N d ) = ∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Scav ) N d Cloud , (10) and the best fit of LWP to N d in the scavenging-only simulation is just a measure of the scavenging of aerosol by precipitation and the non-causal covariance between N d and LWP induced by other confounding factors. Thus, the sensitivity ∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Cloud ) can be estimated as the difference between the regression of LWP on N d trained in a simulation where clouds are insensitive to N d (N d Cloud = constant; scavenging only) and the regression in a control simulation (N d = N d Cloud = N d Scav ) because ∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Cloud ) N d Scav = dLWP d ln(N d ) -∂LWP ∂ ln(N d Scav ) N d Cloud .</figDesc></figure>
