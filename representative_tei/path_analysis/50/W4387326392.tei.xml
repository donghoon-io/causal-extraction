<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: A major illness is traumatic for patients and families, posing risk for disease-related posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). There is little available information to identify the cancer patients and caregivers at greatest risk for PTSS. This study examines the risk factors of PTSS in colorectal cancer.</p><p>Method: Patients with colorectal cancer and their caregivers (N=130 dyads) self-reported sociodemographic, psychosocial, and medical factors at diagnosis/treatment initiation (T1), at 1-(T2), and 2-years (T3) post-diagnosis. Cancer-related PTSS of intrusion, avoidance, altered arousal and reactivity (IES-R), and negative alterations in cognitions and mood (investigator-developed measure) were assessed. Path analysis examined associations between proposed correlates and PTSS.</p><p>Results: Among patients, higher neuroticism and greater physical symptom distress were concurrently associated with higher PTSS (Bs&gt; 0.10, ps&lt; .02); greater physical symptom distress at T1 and greater social support at T2 were associated with higher PTSS at T3 (Bs≥ 0.37, ps≤ .04). Among caregivers, female gender, higher neuroticism (Bs&gt; 0.12, ps&lt;.01), and lower social support (Bs&lt; -0.24, ps&lt; .02) were associated with higher concurrent PTSS; lower patient physical symptom distress and social support at T1 (Bs&lt; -0.27, ps&lt; .03) and longer hours spent for caregiving at T2 (B= 0.03, p=.05) were associated with higher PTSS at T3. Conclusions: Findings identify cancer-speci c risk factors (physical symptoms, hours caregiving) unique to cancer patients and caregivers, in addition to established risk factors (female, neuroticism, social support) in non-medical populations.</p><p>Implications for Cancer Survivors: The identi ed subgroups should receive ongoing screening and psychosocial referral for cancer-related PTSS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>After encountering a major stressor, it is common to experience intrusive thoughts, avoidance of cues or reminders of the trauma, altered physiological arousal and reactivity, and negative changes in cognitions and mood (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms: PTSS) <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. Elevated PTSS or clinically diagnosable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among non-medical populations, such as people exposed to accidents, assault, and war, have been associated with the development of various morbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) and early mortality <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. PTSS can be precipitated by chronic illness, such as cancer <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. PTSS from cancer is distinct due to the somatic nature of medical-related trauma and the ongoing and physical cues to the threat of the illness <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>. Cancer-related PTSS have been documented in not only patients, but also family or close friends ("caregivers") who intimately experience the trauma with the patient <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. However, there is limited information regarding the sub-groups of adult cancer patients and caregivers at elevated risk for PTSS <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>Plausible risk factors re ecting both the overlap with non-medical PTSS and the unique cancer-speci c features of cancer-related PTSS deserve consideration. The general trauma literature, mainly in nonmedical populations, has established risk factors for development and maintenance of elevated PTSS (e.g., female gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, younger age <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, lower socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, greater neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, and lower social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>). Comparable knowledge for medical and cancer populations, however, does not exist to date, in part because most studies on cancer-related PTSS examined gender-speci c cancers in women (e.g., breast, ovarian) or mothers of childhood cancer survivors, precluding testing the gender effect that was found as a signi cant risk factor in a metaanalysis of non-medical studies <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Moreover, the majority of studies measured PTSS based on previous Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM) editions (e.g., DSM-III and DSM-IV) that de ned PTSD/PTSS in three symptom clusters, excluding the fourth symptom cluster of negative alterations in cognitions in mood (NACM) that was added to the current edition (DSM-5) <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. NACM symptoms include negative affect, self-blame, and anhedonia, which have commonly been seen in cancer patients and caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, but rarely within the constellation of PTSS. In the general trauma literature, NACM is the symptom cluster that most accounts for the suicidal ideation associated with PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, thus it is gravely important to elucidate who is at risk. However, the extent to which identi ed PTSD/PTSS risk factors are replicable when the current criteria is applied to PTSS remains unknown.</p><p>According to the Enduring Somatic Threat model <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, the persistent, internal (i.e., unescapable), and somatic threat of medical illness distinguishes medical and cancer-related PTSS from other PTSS. For the patients, medical-related trauma involves constant cues to threat, such as undergoing repeated treatments and tests. Persistent somatic symptoms are also internal triggers and unavoidable reminders of one's own illness and mortality, perpetuating the perceived threat. More distressing somatic symptoms in medical populations are therefore thought to be associated with higher levels and longer duration of PTSS in patients <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Regarding the caregivers, the Secondary Traumatic Stress model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> suggests that helping or desiring to help a suffering person can lead to consequences similar to those in individuals directly-exposed. The level of exposure to the trauma in uences the severity of PTSS. Longer duration of exposure to others' suffering has been shown to predict higher levels of PTSS in trauma workers and medical professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p><p>We aimed to examine correlates of PTSS among adult colorectal cancer patients and caregivers across the two years following cancer diagnosis at timepoints demarcating distinct illness phases (i.e., treatment initiation, approximate treatment completion, and early survivorship). We examined sociodemographic (i.e., age, gender, SES) and psychosocial (i.e., neurotic personality, social support) risk factors that are well-established as predictive of non-medical PTSS, in order to test if they extend to cancer-related PTSS. Because of the unique nature of cancer-related PTSS and based on the abovementioned theories, we also examined cancer patient-speci c (i.e., physical symptom distress) and caregiver-speci c (i.e., hours spent for caregiving) risk factors. We hypothesized that younger age, female gender, lower education, higher neuroticism, lower social support, greater patient physical symptom distress (in patients and caregivers), and longer hours spent for caregiving (in caregivers) would be associated with higher concurrent and subsequent PTSS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Study method and results are reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement for cross-sectional studies <ref type="bibr">(von Elm et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Ethics Approval: All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Written informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedures</head><p>Patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer were identi ed from medical records at the University of Miami and Northwestern University oncology clinics and were recruited in-person at clinic visits or via phone. Eligibility criteria for patients were newly and recently (within 4 months) diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer (stage I-IV), 21 years of age or older, with English or Spanish speaking or reading/writing pro ciency at a 5 th grade level, and able to identify an unpaid family member or friend (i.e., caregiver) who was involved in the patients' cancer experience. Eligible caregivers were 21 years or older, with English or Spanish speaking or reading/writing pro ciency at a 5 th grade level, and self-identi ed as Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, or Hispanic (due to the aims of the parent study). Exclusion criteria for both patients and caregivers were active yet untreated psychosis, substance abuse, substance dependence, or suicidal ideation within the past year.</p><p>After they were screened for eligibility and provided written informed consent, patients and caregivers individually completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire assessing sociodemographic and psychosocial covariates, correlates, and PTSS. Questionnaires were completed in clinic or at the participants' homes at all three timepoints after contact from study staff. Participants were provided a $40 incentive at each timepoint for completing all materials. This prospective observational study was approved by and conducted in compliance with the University of Miami and Northwestern University Institutional Review Boards. The data analyzed for the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS). Three symptoms of PTSS (i.e., intrusions, avoidance, and alterations in arousal and reactivity) were measured using the 22-item Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The items referred to cancer as the traumatic event for patients and to the patients' cancer for caregivers. The intrusion symptoms were assessed by eight items (e.g., "I had waves of strong feelings about [my/his or her] cancer"). The avoidance symptoms were assessed by eight items (e.g., "I tried to remove [my/his or her] cancer from my memory"). The alterations in arousal and reactivity symptoms were assessed by six items (e.g., "reminders of [my/his or her] cancer caused me to have physical reactions, such as sweating, trouble breathing, nausea, or a pounding heart"). All items were evaluated on a 5-point Likert response format ranging from 0= "not at all" to 4= "extremely." In this sample, the total IES-R score had good internal consistency for both patients and caregivers at T1 (α = .89 and .86 for patients and caregivers, respectively), T2 (α = .81 and α = .79, respectively), and T3 (α = .75 and α = .74, respectively).</p><p>As the current study was a secondary analysis, the fourth (and most recently established) symptom of PTSS, negative alterations in cognitions in mood (NACM) symptoms that is not included in the IES-R, were assessed by six questionnaire items corresponding with the NACM subscale of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which map directly on to DSM-5 criteria.This included items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) [26], the Brief COPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the Pro le of Mood States Short Form-30 (POMS-SF) [28], and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness -Spiritual Well Being Scale (FACIT-Sp) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Both the IES-R and the items assessing NACM referred to the experience of symptoms in the seven days prior to completing the measure. All items measuring NACM were converted to a 5-point Likert response format for consistency with the IES-R. The NACM items had good internal consistency at T1 (α = .76 and .82 for patients and caregivers, respectively), T2 (α = .79 and .76, respectively), and T3 (α = .70 and .78, respectively). The six items that correspond with the content of PCL-5 items are included in supplemental material, and the psychometric properties of the four-symptom construct of PTSS are reported in our previous work.</p><p>The mean of the four symptom scores (intrusions, avoidance, alterations in arousal and reactivity, and NACM) was calculated to represent a total PTSS score. The combined measure had good internal consistency at T1 (α = .88 and .95 for patients and caregivers, respectively), T2 (α = .90 and .94, respectively), and T3 (α = .87 and .92, respectively).</p><p>Correlates of PTSS. Three groups of correlates were examined. The rst group was sociodemographic correlates (age, gender, and education). The second group was psychosocial correlates including personality (i.e., neuroticism) and social support. Neuroticism was assessed by two items ("anxious or easily upset" and, reverse coded, "calm or emotionally stable") from the Ten-Item Personality Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The items referred to how the participants perceive themselves generally and at the present time on a 7-point Likert response format ranging from 1= "disagree strongly" to 7= "agree strongly." This brief scale has established convergence with gold-standard measures of personality traits, such as the 44-item Big-Five Inventory (r 2 =.69, p&lt;.001), and good test-retest reliability (r=.70); while internal consistency (α=.50) is lower as it is a two-item measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In the current sample, the measure had similar internal consistency compared to the validation study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and other studies conducted in large population-based samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>: patients (α=. 60) and caregivers (α=. 55). Because personality is considered as a trait characteristic expected to be largely unchanged, neuroticism was assessed only at T1. Another psychosocial correlate, the perceived availability of social support was assessed by the 6-item Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> on a 4-point Likert response format ranging from 1= "very false" to 4= "very true." In the current sample, the scale demonstrated overall acceptable internal consistency at T1 (α=. 76, .69), T2 (α=.72, .81), and T3 (α=.66, .81) among patients and caregivers, respectively.</p><p>The third group, medical factors, was cancer-related physical symptom distress for patients and hours spent caregiving for caregivers. Patients' physical symptom distress was assessed in the patients only by the 23-item Rotterdam symptom checklist modi ed (by YK) [36] that included a diverse range of common symptoms associated with cancer treatment (e.g., lack of appetite, tiredness, sore muscles). Items referred to the extent of symptom distress experienced over the past week on a 4-point Likert response format ranging from 1= "not at all" to 4= "very much." The scale demonstrated high internal consistency in the current sample of patients at T1 (α = .93), T2 (α = .93), and T3 (α = .95). Hours spent for caregiving per day was assessed only for caregivers in an open-ended question: "about how many hours a day have you been helping this person through his/ her experience with cancer?" The item intended to capture subjective perceptions of the quantity of support they provided to the patients daily (0 to 24 hours).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Means, standard deviations, and frequencies of study variables are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. To test the degree to which the proposed correlates were associated with PTSS, we conducted path analysis using structural equation modeling in Mplus Version 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). For the patients (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) and caregivers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) separately, the models speci ed concurrent and prospective associations of the proposed correlates with PTSS cross-sectionally and in a time-lagged manner across the three timepoints (i.e., T1 variables predicting PTSS at T2, T1 variables predicting PTSS at T3, and T2 variables predicting PTSS at T3) <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. To account for potential effects of one's PTSS on the partner's PTSS (i.e., interdependence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, patients' PTSS was controlled for when predicting caregivers' PTSS at each timepoint, and vice versa.</p><p>Four model-t indices are reported: Chi-square (χ 2 ), the comparative t index (CFI), the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR). Chi-square values less than two times of degree of freedom, CFI&gt; .95, RMSEA&lt; .06, and SRMR&lt; .08 indicate adequate t of a speci ed model to the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Missing data were handled using the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) method. Statistical signi cance was set at a 2-tailed p-value&lt; .05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Characteristics</head><p>A total of 130 dyads (108 at University of Miami and 22 at Northwestern University) of patients and their primary family caregivers enrolled and completed baseline from April 2012 to April 2017 around the time of the patient's cancer diagnosis/ treatment initiation (T1). A total of 80 and 68 patient-caregiver dyads were retained at approximately 1-(T2) and 2-year follow-up (T3), respectively. Reasons for participant attrition at T2 included loss to follow-up (18%), withdrawal from study (12%), and patient death (8%). At T3, participants withdrew from study (5%), were lost to follow-up (4%), died (4%), and were medically unstable (1%). None of the study variables nor recruitment site were associated with participant attrition at any timepoint (ps &gt;.10).</p><p>The patients and caregivers were mostly middle-aged females and completed some college or higher education, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Approximately half of the participants identi ed as Hispanic. Most of the patients (73%) were diagnosed with advanced stage cancers (III or IV). The caregivers were largely either the spouse/partner (37%) or adult children (21%) of the patient. Compared with the caregivers, the patients were older, more likely to be male, less likely to decline reporting their education, lower on neuroticism and reported higher levels of social support at T2 and T3, ps &lt;.05. There were no differences between patients and caregivers in other examined correlates of PTSS, ps &gt;.05. Both patients and caregivers reported "a little bit" of the four PTSS symptoms at all three timepoints. Levels of PTSS were stable with no signi cant differences between PTSS scores across all three timepoints for both patients and caregivers, ps &gt; 0.10.</p><p>Overall, levels of other study variables were like those of population norms and other samples of cancer patients and caregivers. Compared to levels of neuroticism in an international sample of adult females age 51 to 60 (M = 2.57, SD = 1.14), the mean score in our sample of patients was similar (M = 2.55, SD = 1.52); t [4263] = 0.19, p =.85. However, the mean score in our sample of caregivers (M=3.01, SD=1.61) was signi cantly higher, t[4263]= =4.27, p&lt;.01. In the current sample at T1, patients and caregivers reported mean levels of social support of 3.51 (SD = 0.54) and 3.32 (SD = 0.54), respectively, which were higher than levels in a sample of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (M= 3.10, SD = 0.50; t [324]=7.02 , p &lt;.01) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and a national survey of cancer caregivers in the U.S. (M=3.39, SD = 0.63; t [354]=3.98 , p &lt;.01) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In the current sample, caregivers spent a mean 8.58 (SD = 8.76) hours caregiving at T1, similar to an average 8.30 (SD = 8.30) hours reported in another national survey of cancer caregivers in the U.S., t [846]= 0.38, p = .70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Physical symptom distress was signi cantly higher on average (M = 1.65, SD = 0.46) in the current sample of patients compared with a sample in the validation study of a Modi ed Rotterdam Symptom Checklist in cancer patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, (M = 1.40, SD = 0.26; t [1133]= 9.72 , p &lt; .001) Testing correlates of patients' PTSS First, the degree to which the proposed sociodemographic, psychosocial, and medical correlates were associated with PTSS among patients was tested. Model t to the data was acceptable: χ 2 (42) = 49.42, ,p = .03, RMSEA = .06 [90% CI: .02-.10], CFI = .88, and SRMR = .07. Unstandardized path coe cients for concurrent associations are presented in Table 2 (upper half). Patients' higher neuroticism at T1 and T3, greater physical symptom distress at T1 and T3, and their caregivers' higher PTSS at T2 were associated with the patients' higher concurrent PTSS.</p><p>Presented in Table 2 (bottom half), higher PTSS at T1 was associated with higher PTSS at T2. Greater physical symptom distress at T1 were associated with higher PTSS at T3. Finally, higher PTSS and greater social support at T2 were associated with higher PTSS at T3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing correlates of caregivers' PTSS</head><p>Next, the degree to which the proposed sociodemographic, psychosocial, and medical correlates were associated with PTSS among caregivers was tested. Model t to the data was acceptable: χ 2 (32) = 47.27, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI: .00-.06], CFI = .97, and SRMR = .05. Unstandardized path coe cients for concurrent associations are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> (upper half). Female gender was related to higher caregiver PTSS as T3. Caregivers' higher neuroticism at T1 and T3 and lower social support at T1 and T2 were associated with their higher concurrent PTSS.</p><p>Presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> (bottom half), caregivers' higher PTSS and lower patients' physical symptom distress at T1 were associated with caregivers' higher PTSS at T2. Caregivers who perceived lower social support at T1 had higher PTSS at T3. Finally, caregivers' higher PTSS and longer hours spent for caregiving at T2 were associated with caregivers' higher PTSS at T3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This was the rst theoretically-grounded study, to our knowledge, to examine risk factors of cancer-related PTSS in both patients and caregivers over the course of the cancer treatment trajectory. In support of our hypotheses, we identi ed similarities to the risk factors for non-medical PTSS and elucidated risk factors unique to the experience of cancer in the family. Findings also revealed that the associations each emerged at distinct treatment phases in both patients and caregivers. These results suggest subgroups of patients and caregivers who would bene t from monitoring and bolstered intervention at different stages of the illness trajectory.</p><p>Findings help advance our conceptualization of cancer-related PTSS as having certain overlapping risk factors with non-medical PTSS. As in the case of non-medical PTSS, female gender was associated with higher PTSS, but only well after the end of treatment and only in the caregivers. Taking on the caregiver role may feel more expected for female caregivers due to social and developmental learning of gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>; however, they could feel less prepared for the subsequent onerous caregiving tasks and consequences of the illness occurring later in treatment, resulting in delayed onset of distress. Moreover, the point when this association emerged-the early stages of survivorship-may demarcate a transition back to the patient's relative independence, with female caregivers returning to the workforce or adopting other important social roles. This transition and the multiple roles, combined with the tendency of caregivers to acknowledge their own experiences only after their caregiving responsibilities have waned <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>, may enhance caregiver vulnerability to PTSS at this later stage. It is therefore important to implement policies and interventions to better support women providing unpaid care (e.g., paid leave, psychosocial support services) to address the lasting psychosocial consequences of caregiving.</p><p>Caregiver support should be delivered to women throughout the illness to prevent latent distress and bolstered during the critical transition off treatment. Also supporting conceptual consistency between risk factors for cancer/medical-related and nonmedical-related PTSS, greater neuroticism was associated with PTSS for both patients and caregivers. Neuroticism has been linked to higher threat sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, which could apply to the threat of death associated with cancer that produces and maintains PTSS <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The association between neuroticism and PTSS emerged at the time of diagnosis and at the beginning of the treatment-free survivorship phase for both patients and caregivers. It is possible that the start of treatment and transition into survivorship, marked by uncertainty, anticipatory anxiety, and concerns about cancer recurrence <ref type="bibr">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> are most di cult to tolerate and are periods requiring bolstered psychosocial and trauma-informed support for those high on neuroticism.</p><p>The nal association supporting conceptual consistency between cancer/medical-related and nonmedical-related PTSS was between lower social support and greater PTSS in caregivers around diagnosis/initiation of treatment and around treatment completion. This association re ects the wellestablished protective role of social support on caregiver health <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and suggests that support earlier in the cancer treatment trajectory can buffer caregiver PTSS. Caregivers are typically intimately involved in patient care during diagnosis and treatment completion, and lacking assistance with caregiving tasks or a close other to disclose and process the trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> may make the experience even more distressing with lasting effects. Contrary to our hypotheses and among patients only, higher levels of social support early on related to higher PTSS in early survivorship. Not all forms of social support are helpful. Unsupportive social relationships involving detrimental interactions have been linked to high depressive symptoms and anxiety and a loss of sense of self in breast cancer patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Family and friends, often uncertain how to appropriately engage in their role, may sometimes may be overbearing or oppressive perhaps discouraging the patient's autonomy or self-e cacy, which could interfere the patient's processing of the trauma resulting in PTSS. Also, compared with non-medical traumas, an illness like cancer requires many types of social support like instrumental support with nursing tasks and activities of daily living. Therefore, results could even re ect patient greater reliance on others and related distress. The types of social support most bene cial to patients and caregivers at different phases of treatment require investigation.</p><p>Regarding the unique medical risk factors of cancer-related PTSS, initial physical symptom distress was associated with higher PTSS among the patients at around time of diagnosis and two years follow-up, and initial symptom distress predicted PTSS two years later. This highlights the role of the internal cue to threat in the patients and is consistent with the EST theoretical model <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Invasive cancer treatments and accompanying burdensome physical symptoms could serve as constant reminders of one's disease and mortality. Physical symptoms of illness can also be confounded with physiological symptoms of anxiety/ PTSS <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Misinterpretation of PTSS that manifest physically (e.g., alterations in arousal and reactivity symptoms) as cancer symptoms may perpetuate distress as patients perceive a risk when they notice physiological symptoms of anxiety like weakness, nausea, or elevated heart rate. Those patients who experience discomfort early in treatment may develop maladaptive ways of thinking about their symptoms (e.g., "my illness is getting worse). These thought patterns may also emerge two-years later, when patients interpret symptom distress as evidence of disease recurrence. This support for long-term impact of symptom distress on PTSS suggests that initial and ongoing interventions to target both maladaptive cognitions and physical sensations may have potential to mitigate subsequent PTSS. Contrary to our hypotheses, lower physical symptom distress in the patients at diagnosis/ treatment initiation were associated with their caregivers' higher PTSS around a year later. Caregivers of patients with low symptom distress around the time of diagnosis may be less prepared for the increasing symptom burden and accompanying caregiver responsibilities as treatment unfolds. Preparedness for caregiving and its demands is a well-established predictor of caregiver distress [56], and the patients' health status around the time of diagnosis may inform the caregivers' expectations. Moreover, the results could re ect caregivers of patients who were slightly earlier in the treatment trajectory and thus had more distressing medical events or symptoms closer to the assessment at treatment completion. Future studies with more frequent assessments of symptoms and illness-and treatment-related events will better elucidate the somatic precipitants of PTSS.</p><p>Finally, longer hours spent caregiving at one-year post-diagnosis were associated with higher PTSS around two-years post-diagnosis, re ecting the link between exposure to trauma and higher symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Caregivers with more exposure to the patients may require respite to mitigate PTSS. It also may be especially distressing to continue providing care into the early survivorship period, well after the time of diagnosis, and perhaps these results re ect the caregivers of patients with greatest need. We also did not assess the speci c tasks that caregivers take on during those hours. Patient care needs and caregiver tasks that are most subjectively traumatizing should be explored in a more detailed analysis of care provision.</p><p>This was one of the rst studies to examine associations of cancer-related PTSS at distinct timepoints, and notably the relations between patient and caregiver factors and PTSS varied by timepoint. These results re ect experiences at three critical transition periods throughout treatment, but cancer can involve many more distinct phases of illness events and care (e.g., treatment changes, surgeries, hospitalizations). PTSS may change more frequently than what can be detected at approximately yearly follow-ups. Future studies should investigate concurrent changes in prognosis, treatment, and symptoms, by taking more brief and frequent assessments, using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>) and digital assessment methods.</p><p>While the longitudinal associations identi ed should certainly be replicated in larger samples, they also suggest that the context of unique treatment phases make patients and caregivers vulnerable to the impact of speci c variables on their PTSS. Throughout the treatment trajectory, it is critical to assess for not only patient and caregiver PTSS but these factors like social support and neuroticism, time devoted to caregiving, and symptom distress as early identi cation of such factors may have predictive value in identifying vulnerable patients and caregivers requiring psychosocial support. The identi ed factors can also inform clinicians determining whether to account for PTSS in their case conceptualization Moreover, the evidence for longitudinal associations suggests the promise of early intervention in targeting modi able patient-and caregiver factors. Certain limitations of this study can inform future investigations. Although attrition was not systematically related to study variables, longitudinal research in larger samples maximizing participant retention will be important to better understand the risk factors for patient and caregiver PTSS, as participant drop-out and loss to follow-up may have impacted our ndings. Additionally, we did not assess trauma history. It is possible that many participants in the current sample have complex trauma, or multiple traumas (both medical and non-medical), which is associated with higher PTSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">68,</ref><ref type="bibr">69]</ref>. Previous traumas linked to physical pain or injury may especially impact sensitivity to physical symptom distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Future investigations of cancer-related PTSS should comprehensively assess trauma history (frequency, timing, and type). We also identi ed some unexpected associations that are in contrast with our hypotheses and the extant literature and theory. These ndings should be replicated but also may re ect nuances in the patient and caregiver experiences at certain phases of treatment.</p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations, this prospective longitudinal study, conducted in both patients and caregivers, provides important information to improve our conceptualization of cancer-related PTSS.</p><p>Cancer-related PTSS appear to share certain risk factors with non-medical PTSS, supporting the similarities between the two constructs, yet also have unique cancer-speci c risk factors. Patient and caregiver vulnerability to these risk factors also appears to vary by treatment phase. It is crucial to conduct more longitudinal research of these risk factors to better conceptualize cancer-related PTSS in clinical settings and to identify those in need of screening and intervention throughout the illness trajectory. Health care systems and clinicians should target the subgroups identi ed who may bene t from early trauma-focused intervention to mitigate long-term psychological and physical health outcomes secondary to cancer-related trauma. </p></div>

Though personality factors themselves are largely unchangeable, a recent study found neuroticism was amenable to change from Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy [58], which also effectively reduced distress among cancer patients [59]. Social support-focused interventions (e.g., support groups, social engagement skills training) delivered early in the treatment trajectory may mitigate subsequent distress, and certain stress management and communication skills interventions aimed to bolster social support have been developed for caregivers [60, 61]. Moreover, dyadic interventions aimed to enhance communication and cohesive coping and to optimize the type and quality of social support provided may be bene cial. Enhancing social support can be challenging, especially among caregivers who often have very limited time for themselves [62], but online modalities have been deemed feasible, cost-and time-effective among cancer caregivers [63]. Regarding the patients with higher symptom distress, interventions with somatically-focused components (e.g., body scan exercises, progressive muscle relaxation [64], sensory training, biofeedback) may serve bene ts. Such treatments like Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction [59] have been effective in reducing non-medical PTSS in individuals with pain or physiological cues to their trauma [65], and could potentially mitigate PTSS in cancer survivors with physical symptom distress. Cognitive therapies can be used to target the maladaptive thought patterns associated with experiencing symptoms and fears of recurrence [66, 67]. Psychoeducation to improve recognition of physiological symptoms of anxiety may also be clinically useful.</figDesc></figure>
