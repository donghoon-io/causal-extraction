Leadership <ref type="bibr">Handoko (2003: 27)</ref> argues that leadership is the ability someone has to influence other people to work towards their goals and objectives. <ref type="bibr">Rivai and Sagala (2009: 270)</ref> explain that leadership is an influencing process in determining the goals of an organization or agency, motivating followers' behavior to achieve goals, influencing to improve follower culture, and directing processes into positive activities that have to do with work in the organization or agency.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Respondents in this study were education and culture department employees of Kabupaten Padang Pariaman. The sampling technique used in this study was the proportional stratified random sampling method. The questionnaire was distributed to 112 employees of the Padang Pariaman District Education and Culture Office. Data were analyzed using BerJalurganda Linear Regression Analysis. Determination of the number of samples in this study is by using the Slovin formula.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>All statements used in this study are valid. And the Cronbach Alpha value for each variable is also high, all above 0.6. The data in this study also passed the classical assumption test. This shows that all data is feasible to be tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sub Structure 1 (Relationship of Leadership to Work Motivation)</head><p>Contributions or contributions to the influence of leadership on work motivation are 7.4%. It is known that the significance value of the leadership variable which is 0.004 is smaller than 0.05. While the value of the path coefficient for other variables outside the study is e1 = √ ((1-0,074)) = 0,926.</p><p>The influence of leadership and work motivation on job satisfaction is 46.3%. While for the value of the path coefficient for other variables outside the study is Ɛ2 = √ ((1-0,463)) = 0.537. The significance value of the leadership variable is 0.348 greater than 0.05 and the significance of the motivation variable is 0.000 less than 0.05. This gives the conclusion that leadership does not have a significant effect on job satisfaction while work motivation has a significant effect on job satisfaction of the Department of Education and Culture, Padang Pariaman.</p><p>The amount of contribution or contribution to the influence of leadership, work motivation, and job satisfaction on performance is 34.1%.

The significance value of the leadership variable which is 0.753 is greater than 0.05 and the significance of the motivation variable is 0.001 smaller than 0.05, then the significance of the job satisfaction variable is 0.014 smaller than 0.05. This gives the conclusion that work motivation and job satisfaction individually have a significant effect on the performance of education and culture department employees, Padang Pariaman.While leadership does not have a significant effect on the performance of employees of the Department of Education and Culture, Kab.Padang Pariaman.</p><p>So that the structure of the causal relationship between variables can be seen in the following figure. Leadership, both directly and indirectly, was found to have no effect on the performance of employees of the Department of Education and Culture, Padang Pariaman.

It is known that the leadership beta value for performance is 0.026. While the indirect effect of leadership through work motivation on performance is the multiplication of the beta value of leadership on performance with beta values of work motivation on performance, which is 0.026 x 0.361 = 0.009. So the total influence given by leadership to performance is a direct effect plus indirect influence, which is 0.026 + 0.009 = 0.035. Based on the results of these calculations, it is known that the value of indirect influence is greater than the value of direct influence. These results indicate that indirectly leadership through work motivation has a significant influence on the performance of employees of the Department of Education and Culture, Padang Pariaman.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Work Motivation Through Job Satisfaction on Performance.</head><p>It is known that the direct effect of work motivation on performance is 0.361. While the indirect effect of work motivation through job satisfaction on performance is the multiplication of beta values of work motivation on performance with a beta value of job satisfaction on performance, which is 0.361 x 0.266 = 0.096. Then the total effect given by work motivation on performance is a direct effect plus indirect influence, namely 0.361 + 0.096 = 0.457. Based on the results of these calculations, it is known that the value of indirect influence is greater than the value of direct influence. These results indicate that indirectly work motivation through job satisfaction has a significant influence on the performance of education and culture department employees of Padang Pariaman.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Leadership and Work Motivation</head><p>This study shows that direct leadership has a significant effect on the work motivation of employees of the Department of Education and Culture, Padang Pariaman. This is indicated by the significance value of the leadership variable, which is 0.004 smaller than 0.05.</p><p>Leadership can be interpreted as the ability of a leader to be able to move and encourage subordinates to apply and act in accordance with the objectives to be achieved. The leader must also be fair to his subordinates and must be able to foster good relations with subordinates. If a leader can provide a good example to subordinates, then this will be a motivation for subordinates to work as well as possible and improve achievement.</p></div>

Good and effective leadership will be able to increase employee motivation so that ultimately it will create job satisfaction. Effective and dynamic leadership that is shown by a leader is the dominant element in determining the likelihood of success of employee duties. Effective leadership tends to encourage a leader to study the work motivation of each employee so that leadership in accordance with the characteristics of the employee can be applied and will ultimately affect employee job satisfaction.</p><p>However, the processed data in this study shows that direct leadership does not have a significant effect on job satisfaction of the District Education and Culture Office staff. Padang Pariaman. This is indicated by the significance value of the leadership variable which is 0.348 greater than 0.05. This finding is contrary to research from Raimonda et al.

These stimuli can be given in the form of appreciation to employees for the achievements of the organization. So that the award will further encourage them to work harder and improve their abilities in the future. Motivation results in high morale, namely a positive attitude towards the work organization of leaders and coworkers. If high work motivation is owned by an employee, satisfaction will arise in the work. If employee job satisfaction has been achieved, job performance will be created.</p><p>This finding is in line with previous research by <ref type="bibr">Karsh and Iskender (2009)</ref> which revealed that motivation levels affect job satisfaction, where high motivation leads to high job satisfaction, and low motivation leads to low job satisfaction.
