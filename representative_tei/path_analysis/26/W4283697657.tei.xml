<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Job satisfaction expresses a number of conformities between a person's expectations about his work that can be in the form of work achievements provided by the organization and the rewards given for his work. In essence, a person is encouraged to do activities because he hopes that it will bring a better state than the current situation. Thesatisfaction of physical needs in an organization is usually associated with money, because money can buy clothing, food , boards, and when this is connected with the basic premise proposed by Maslow that clothing, food, boards are the main needs.</p><p>Disgruntled employees indicate that their needs have not been met. If this condition occurs protracted then in him there will be frustration, sadness and deep disappointment. As a result, work productivity will decrease, either due to low morale or high absenteeism. Thus there is a close link between performance and job satisfaction. There is a close relationship between needs, deeds or behaviors and satisfaction. Therefore, satisfaction is concerned with the conformity of one's expectations with the rewards provided. Teacher satisfaction has an impact on work performance, discipline, and the quality of their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHOD</head><p>This research was research with an associative quantitative approach. The study population was 156 teachers in 21 schools. The study sample was 112 people. The sampling technique used a proportional random sampling technique. The data collection was carried out using an instrument consisting of situational leadership of 15 items (telling, selling, participating, delegating), work climate of 20 items (responsibility, identity, warmth, support, conflict), job satisfaction 31 items (psychological aspects, physical aspects, social aspects, financial aspects), teacher performance 14 items ( make learning planning, carry out learning, evaluate learning) that have been tested for validity and reliability using the correlation of moment products. Data analysis of this study uses path analysis. Before the instrument was used, the trial test was carried out. The data from the instrument trial was analyzed to determine the validity and reliability. The description of the collected data used the path analysis to see the direct and indirect relationships, by first conducting tests of normality, linearity, and homogeneity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Direct effect of Situational Leadership on the Performance of SDN Teachers in Awayan District</head><p>Based on the results of the interpretation of the analysis, it can be seen that there is a significant positive relationship between situational leadership variables and the performance of elementary school teachers in Awayan District. This is evidenced by several test results such as the value of the regression result coefficient, which is 0.203 which means that if the Situational leadership variable increases by 1 point, the teacher's performance will increase by 0.203 points. So the better Situational leadership will be to increase or improve teacher performance. It is also in accordance with the t-test interplay can be known Sig value. of 0.000 &lt; 0.05 and a Calculated T value of 4.870 &gt; 1.656 (Ttable), meaning that there is a direct positive relationship of Situational leadership to teacher performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hutagaol (2018)</ref> shows a positive and significant relationship between Situational Leadership Towards Teacher performance. In line with the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kimani, 2021)</ref> it is stated that any effort to support the improvement of situational leadership styles and managerial skills of principals will have implications for improving teacher performance. (Sentana &amp; Wiyasa, 2021) menyatakan bahwa variabel kepemimpinan situasional secar a linier mempunyai pengaruh positive terhadap kinerja guru. Thus leadership in this study is interpreted as a person's process of influencing a group of people in achieving what is desired. To be an effective leader, a principal must be able to relate all the citizens of the school he leads in positive ways. Simply put, the situational leadership of the principal is also defined as a process to change and make a person willing to change and improve himself, which involves the performance of his subordinates.</p><p>A principal who has an authoritative nature in leading school organizations is a figure that deserves to be exemplified. In addition to this, the principal is also a person who involves subordinates in solving school problems, the principal is cold but firm when he encounters problems in the school and also the principal grows his hard work to maintain the progress of the school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Direct effect of Situational Leadership on the Work Climate of SDN Teachers in Awayan District</head><p>Based on the hypothesis test interpretation, it can be seen that there is a significant positive relationship between situational leadership variables and the work climate of elementary school teachers in Awayan District. This can be seen from the equation of the regression structure shows that the value of the situational leadership coefficient is 0.319, which means that if situational leadership increases by 1 point, the teacher's work climate will increase by 0.319 points. The value of the coefficient of positive value means that the relationship of situational leadership regression with the work climate has a positive impact This research is in line with the results of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fitri, 2021)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hartono, 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Herdiana, 2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mubarak, 2021</ref>) concluded that there is a relationship between situational leadership and the work climate. This gives an idea that the situational leadership that has been carried out, has a positive effect on teacher satisfaction at work. According to Schemerhorn <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anoraga, 2013)</ref>, the high low work climate is also caused by several aspects, such as the work itself, supervisors (supervision), co-workers, promotions, as well as wages or salaries. The work climate can also be effectd by several factors, such as compensation policy, job security, working conditions, relationships with superiors, promotion and career development, leadership style, working in a team, the employee himself <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dessler, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The creation of relationships with fellow teachers brings positive satisfaction in working and smooth work with colleagues in completing work that is team-work. Based on this, comfort and the fulfillment of all wants and needs that support the work of teachers create a confidence in themselves for commitment to work the impact that arises is that these teachers will remain in the organization One of the determining factors for the increasing work climate of teachers in schools, including Situational leadership. The work climate reflects a person's feelings for his work. This can be seen in the teacher's attitude towards his work and everything that is faced in his work environment. Leadership support for the teacher's work climate is very necessary and needs to be created in schools, so that teachers can work with high morals, discipline, enthusiasm, dedication and live their profession. Teachers who feel satisfied at work because they are effectd by the attitude of a harmonious leader, show a sense of friendliness, closeness, and consideration towards the teacher, both as individuals and groups. A good relationship with the principal both in terms of good satisfaction support can cause satisfaction in working. (Robbins, S., P. &amp; Timothy A., 2016) stated that the behavior of one's superiors is also a major determinant of satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Direct effect of Teacher's Work Climate on the Performance of SDN Teachers in Awayan District</head><p>Based on the results of the regression test, it can be seen that there is a positive relationship between the work climate The results of his research both concluded that the working climate will affect performance. The results of this study are in line with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rahsel, 2016)</ref>, (Janah, R and Akbar, 2020) concluding that the work climate is a predictor of performance, because the work climate has a moderate correlation with performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the high and low working climate of teachers will affect performance.</p><p>The working climate is a set of feelings of whether or not work is pleasant. A person working in an organization brings with him a set of desires, needs, desires, and past experiences that converge to form work expectations. The work climate shows the congruence between a person's expectations that arise and the rewards that work provides <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sedarmayanti, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Winardi (2014)</ref> explains that teachers at work need supportive satisfaction to interact and work with colleagues or workgroups. The benefit of interaction between individuals in the workplace is that they can exchange information, experiences, and most importantly the social relationships of colleagues can be harmoniously established so that teachers feel comfortable and happy, do not feel pressured and free to be able to realize themselves in showing their abilities. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hasibuan, 2014)</ref> a person in an organization needs to get satisfaction in work which can also have an impact on improving performance, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Priansa, 2014)</ref> which states that the work climate causes an increase in performance, so that satisfied workers will be more productive at work.</p><p>Another research that can prove that the work climate has a positive and significant effect on teacher performance is the result of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ideswal, 2020)</ref> states that there is a positive and significant effect of the work climate on teacher performance. The test results in this study prove that the work climate has a positive and significant effect on performance. This means that the higher the work climate, the more performance will increase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Direct effect of Situational Leadership on the Job Satisfaction of SDN Teachers in Awayan District</head><p>Based on the interpretation of the coefficient analysis test, it can be seen that there is a significant relationship between situational leadership variables and the satisfaction of elementary school teachers in Awayan District. This is evidenced by several test results such as the value of the regression result coefficient, which is 0.399, showing a positive value can be interpreted, there is an increase of 0.399 from teacher satisfaction every increase in units of the situational leadership variable. Judging from the results of the t-test, it can be known the value of Sig. by 0.001 &lt; 0.05 and 3.361 &gt; 1.656, this indicates a positive effect of situational leadership on teacher satisfaction, meaning that the better the situational leadership, the higher the teacher satisfaction will be.</p><p>Situational leadership is the ability that exists in a person to lead, effect, and direct others or members in an organization to carry out activities in achieving a certain goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Siagian, 2009)</ref>, while satisfaction is something that makes people to act or behave in certain ways based onmotives <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Danim, 2018)</ref>. The results of this study are supported by research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hidayati, 2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mattalatta, 2019)</ref> stating that the situational leadership of the principal has a positive effect on teacher job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Direct effect of Job Satisfaction on the Performance of SDN Teachers in Awayan District</head><p>Based on the hypothesis test interpretation, it can be seen that there is a significant effect of satisfaction variables on the performance of elementary school teachers in Awayan District. This can be seen from the value of the regression coefficient of the teacher job satisfaction variable of 0.111, which means that if the teacher job satisfaction variable increases by 1 point, teacher performance will increase by 0.111 points. So the better the teacher's job satisfaction will increase or improve the teacher's performance. Judging from the results of the t-test, it can be known the value of Sig. of 0.000 &lt; 0.05 and 3.969 &gt; 1.656, this shows a positive relationship of satisfaction with teacher performance, meaning that the higher the teacher's satisfaction at work, the better the teacher's performance will be. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hasibuan, 2014)</ref> satisfaction as a process of giving encouragement to oneself to work well, such as fulfilling the needs desired by the teacher. Satisfaction is actually in a person and is an energy that controls human behavior in the achievement of goals. If a teacher has an awareness and sense of responsibility for his duties, the encouragement to work well will be stronger so as to create high teacher performance which in turn can improve student learning outcomes.</p><p>Based on the description above, there is a positive effect between job satisfaction and teacher performance. In other words, teacher satisfaction is high, so the performance (work performance) will certainly be higher. The results of this study are in accordance with Rivai's theory which states that satisfaction is a series of attitudes and values that effect individuals to achieve specific things according to individual goals. These attitudes and values are invesible ones that provide the power to encourage the individual to behave in achieving goals (Rivai, V., &amp; Sagala, 2013). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Winardi, 2014)</ref> explains that "job satisfaction is a desire found in an individual that stimulates him to perform actions". (As'ad, 2015) says that "job satisfaction is something that generates encouragement or encouragement. Job satisfaction has a close relationship with performance. Thus it can be understood that if job satisfaction is low, it will result in low performance as well, despite having good abilities and available opportunities. Similarly, if job satisfaction is high, but if the opportunity to use their abilities is not given the opportunity, then performance will also be low. Or if job satisfaction is high, and opportunities have been given, but if the ability is not possessed by it, then the performance will also be low.</p><p>Another research that can prove that job satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on performance is the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Widayati, 2020)</ref> states that there is a strong effect between job satisfaction variables and teacher performance variables. Similarly, research (Warni, Rovita Eva, Aslamiah, 2021) states that there is a direct relationship between job satisfaction and performance. <ref type="bibr">(Suriansyah, 2015b)</ref> states that satisfaction affects performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afifah, Thara, 2017)</ref> states that job satisfaction affects performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aslamiah, 2016)</ref> states that job satisfaction affects performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hutagaol, 2018</ref>) reveals that performance is effectd by job satisfaction. (Mardianti, Ahmad Suriansyah, 2020) stated that job satisfaction directly affects performance. (Wote, Alice Yeni Verawati, 2019) states that job satisfaction affects performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aslamiah., 2019)</ref> states that there is a positive and significant relationship between job satisfaction and performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hartono, 2016)</ref> states that job satisfaction directly affects performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Suriansyah, 2015a)</ref> states that job satisfaction can have an effect on performance</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Indirect effect of Situational Leadership Through Work Climate on the Performance of Elementary School Teachers in Awayan District</head><p>The calculation of the magnitude of the value of the indirect relationship of the situational leadership variable with teacher performance through the work climate variable is to look at the result of the multiplication of path 2 with path 3, which is 0.319 x 0.201 = 0.064. This value shows that the value is positive, meaning that there is a positive Indirect effect of situational leadership through the work climate with the performance of elementary school teachers in Awayan District even though the intervening of work climate variables is not able to strengthen the direct effect of situational leadership with teacher performance, because indirect effect is only 0.064 &lt; 0.203 the value of the coefficient of Direct effect of situational leadership with teacher performance.</p><p>The results of this study state that good situational leadership is able to create comfortable working conditions and is able to fulfill the wishes of their subordinates so that subordinates will feel satisfaction in working and feel satisfaction with the leadership applied so as to strive to achieve higher and quality work achievements in return for the perceived work climate. It goes on to say that creating a work climate by aligning the wishes of the leadership with the wants and needs of the teacher in achieving the learning objectives of student achievement and this can only be done with learning leadership.</p><p>In accordance with the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Heriana, 2016)</ref> stated that given the importance of the principal's leadership to teacher performance in schools, a principal must be able to encourage and create work motivation for teachers, which allows teachers to work comfortably and calmly, full of familiarity and mutual respect. The same thing was also stated by Miner that the interaction between qualified superiors and subordinates will have an impact such as work motivation, productivity and employee performance.</p><p>Several studies that support this research such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hairudinor, 2018)</ref> show that situational leadership variables can be through intervening variables, namely the work climate in influencing the level of teacher performance but the value of the coefficient without going through the work climate or directly to teacher performance is greater. This research is also supported by other studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Noor, 2019)</ref>, mentioning that there is a positive and significant effect of situational leadership on teacher performance with the work climate as an intervening variable</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Indirect effect of Situational Leadership Through Job Satisfaction on the Performance of SDN Teachers in Awayan District</head><p>The calculation of the magnitude of the coefficient of indirect relationship of the situational leadership variable through job satisfaction with the performance of elementary school teachers in Awayan District is to look at the results of the multiplication of the path coefficient value 4 with the path coefficient 5, which is 0.399 x 0.111 = 0.044. The value shows that the value is positive, although the intervening of job satisfaction variables is not able to strengthen the Direct effect of situational leadership with teacher performance, because the Indirect effect of situational leadership on performance through job satisfaction is only 0.044 &lt; 0.203 of the value of the coefficient value of Direct effect of situational leadership on teacher performance. This means that there is an effect of mediation (indirect effect) of situational leadership on performance through job satisfaction in elementary school teachers in Awayan District.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wahjosumidjo, 2018)</ref> one of the important competencies that a situational leader must have is the ability to be able to satisfy his subordinates. The principal acts as a motivator both to subordinates and the surrounding environment. Situational leadership has a huge effect in improving performance, because the leadership is a role model and the spotlight of subordinates. Thus, if an organization wants to have high performance, leadership is needed that is able to move subordinates so that they feel motivated to do work with high enough performance. Basically, situational leadership will always provide satisfaction to teachers to improve performance optimally so that learning goals can be achieved as expected. The things that</p><p>The Influence of Principal Situational Leadership, Teacher Work Climate and Teacher Job Satisfaction with Teacher Performance at SDN in Awayan District the principal does are satisfied with the teacher's concern for the individual teachers of the principal such as the role of the principal as a supervisor or trainer in directing the teachers to work better, generating satisfaction by involving the teachers in solving every problem faced and also showing the intensity of continuous concern for the needs of the teachers at work. This is in accordance with the opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wibowo, 2014)</ref>, satisfaction is the impetus to a series of processes of human behavior in achieving goals. While the elements contained in satisfaction include; the element of awakening, directing, maintaining, and showing intensity, is persistent, and the presence of purpose.</p><p>Teacher performance should be based on strong satisfaction to practice their knowledge. Teacher job satisfaction is very necessary in order to realize a strong performance towards the achievement of learning objectives. Linked to the performance of elementary school teachers in Awayan District from the results of an average score of 2.88, this figure shows a moderate category score. According to Mc Clelland (Supardi, 2014) the resulting performance with high-achieving satisfaction can be seen from the attitude in taking work risks, wanting feedback from the results of his work, thinking of better ways to do things and prioritizing accuracy and speed of work. This is in accordance with the opinion of Tiffin <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Winardi, 2014)</ref> the results of teacher performance can be seen from the quality of teachers in mastering learning materials, managing the teaching and learning process, and managing classes, the accuracy of the use of media or learning resources, mastering the foundation of education, and planning learning programs and teacher initiatives in assessing student learning outcomes. With the satisfaction of achieving, ideas or ideas will emerge, desires and efforts to carry out activities effectively and efficiently. This is according to the research journal (Heriana, 2016) the higher the teacher satisfaction, the better the teacher gets the results of his work, the lower the teacher satisfaction, the lower the satisfaction obtained by the teacher. The results of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Noor, 2019)</ref> in the results of his research with high job satisfaction, teachers will be encouraged to work as much as possible in carrying out their duties. A teacher must be able to develop himself and balanced job satisfaction in the achievement of professional performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on the results of data analysis, there is a direct and indirect effect between situational leadership, work climate and job satisfaction on teacher performance. Teacher performance seen from the sub-variable of learning assessment needs to further optimize the evaluation ability referring to how the teacher carries out the evaluation activity after planning it and how the teacher uses the evaluation results for teaching purposes, for guidelines for the next teaching and learning process activities to be better, because assessment is a process of determining the quality of learning outcomes, or a process to determine the level of achievement of learning objectives by participants educated. As a result, it is very helpful for teacher performance in teaching which includes learning planning, implementation, and evaluation activities.</p><p>The Influence of Principal Situational Leadership, Teacher Work Climate and Teacher Job Satisfaction with Teacher Performance at SDN in Awayan District</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .
