<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Second-order Generalized Integrator (SOGI)-based quadrature-signal-generator (QSG) together with either a phaselocked-loop (PLL) or a frequency-locked-loop (FLL) constitute two types of typical synchronization units (i.e., SOGI-PLL and -FLL) that have been widely used in grid-tied converter systems. This paper will reveal and clarify the stability issue of these two synchronization units arising from different implementations of the frequency-feedback-path (FFP) connecting the SOGI-QSG and the PLL/FLL. In this regard, four types of FFP implementations that are frequently seen in the literature will be discussed. Although different implementations of the FFP will not affect the steady-state frequency adaptation, their dynamical effects on the small-signal stability of SOGI-PLL/FLL remain concealed. To this end, this paper will present a comprehensive stability assessment and comparative analysis of SOGI-PLL/FLL focusing on the FFP issue. To extend the applicability and accuracy of discussions, all the analyses will be fulfilled by using a parameter space-oriented stability assessment method formulated in the linear-time periodic (LTP) framework. The obtained results are verified by time-domain simulations, and the main findings are further interpreted by using appropriate analytical models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>distributed energy systems (DES) experience time-varying line frequencies, e.g., caused by load variations. Under such occasions, the in-phase and quadrature signals generated by the SOGI-QSG with a fixed resonance frequency will be asymmetric <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, affecting the precision and robustness of the grid-synchronization and the control of VSCs.</p><p>This sensitivity to frequency variations can be largely alleviated by endowing the SOGI-QSG with the ability of frequency adaptation. To this end, many frequency adaptive laws have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, including techniques known as adaptive-notch-filtering (ANF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A comprehensive review is performed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Among these methods, the following two frequency adaptive SOGI-QSG are most appealing for practical applications due to their simplicity in implementations: the SOGI-PLL <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and the SOGI-FLL (frequency-locked-loop) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In these two realizations, the frequency adaptation is achieved by adding a frequencyfeedback path (FFP) between the PLL/FLL and the SOGI-QSG, which is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> (a) (where the dotted line is only used in FLL). Furthermore, as given in Fig. <ref type="figure">1 (b)-(e)</ref>, depending on where the FFP is fed into the SOGI-QSG, four types of FFP implementations can be identified. As examples of common implementations, the Type-I FFP is adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, while the Type-II can be found in use in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The ability of frequency adaption opens many possibilities and opportunities for applying the SOGI-PLL/FLL in achieving the grid-synchronization and converter controls under diverse grid conditions. For instance, a sequence filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> can be realized by using a double SOGI (DSOGI) configuration <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which can be applied to improve the synchronization ability and gain more degree of freedom for converter controls under asymmetric grid conditions. Furthermore, several SOGIs can be composed together to obtain a multi-harmonics extractor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which can be utilized to improve the power quality of converters under severe grid distortions by further adding harmonic current controllers.</p><p>Despite the progress that has been made in the aforementioned aspects of SOGI-QSG, there is a fundamental yet significant issue that remains concealed, which is about the FFP implementation and its dynamic impacts. By analyzing the configurations given in Fig. <ref type="figure">1 (b)</ref>-(e) it can be obtained that the choice of different FFP implementations will not affect the steady-state characteristics of SOGI-QSG (i.e., the efficacy of steady-state frequency adaptation). However, since the FFP introduces nonlinearities to the synchronization units, its dynamical impacts on SOGI-PLL/FLL are anticipated to exist. In which, an in-depth study and clarification on their smallsignal dynamics and stability would be necessary, which is also the first step toward more sophisticated analyses (e.g., the largesignal stability analysis). To the authors' best knowledge, such an analysis is lacking in the literature.</p><p>To perform the small-signal analysis, system modeling is an essential step. In which, the modeling of SOGI-PLL/FLL is usually conducted with the help of the averaging technique so that the time-variant effects of the system can be removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which in turn leads to a simpler modeling process. Another assumption commonly made for achieving a quasi-steady-state model of a SOGI-QSG is that the dynamics of the SOGI-QSG are assumed to be much faster than those of the FLL frequency tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Based on these assumptions, a first-order model of SOGI-FLL has been developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Undeniably, such simplified models can gain insights into the behavior of SOGI-FLL, however, they are not suitable for rigorous and quantitative stability assessment due to ignored effects (e.g., the time-variance). To arrive at a model that is sufficiently rigorous for small-signal stability analysis, the linear-time-periodic (LTP) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> can be applied to better cope with the timevariance issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Due to this merit, in this paper, the modeling and analysis of SOGI-PLL/FLL will be performed in the LTP framework.</p><p>Overall, this paper will contribute to the following two aspects: 1) reveal and clarify the small-signal stability impacts of different FFP implementations for SOGI-PLL/FLL; 2) compare and discuss the stability performance of SOGI-PLL and -FLL over wide parameter space. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:</p><p>Section II introduces the parameter space-oriented stability assessment method. Based on this method, Section III performs a comprehensive stability assessment of SOGI-PLL/FLL under different FFP implementations. To consolidate the understanding of the main findings obtained from the numeric analysis, interpretations of those main findings will be provided in Section IV. Finally, Section V draws the main conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. PARAMETER SPACE-ORIENTED MODELING AND ANALYSIS</head><p>METHOD FOR SOGI-PLL/FLL This section will first introduce some fundamentals of the LTP method; afterward, the parametric stability assessment method and the approach of unifying the parameter space of SOGI-PLL/FLL will be elaborated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The LTP method</head><p>The SOGI-PLL/FLL are essentially time-varying systems as the outputs of SOGI-QSG are periodic signals in steady-state. When modeling and analyzing systems with periodic steadystate (PSS), the LTP method is usually applied. In which, the LTP system (2) with a period of T can be obtained by linearizing the system (1) around its PSS conditions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">    ,,<label>,, t t </label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1"> x f x u y g x u (1)         tt tt           x A x B u y C x D u (2) In (2),     , tt AB and     , tt</formula><p>CDare partial differentials of f and g and they are functions with a period of T.</p><p>Unlike the stability analysis of linear-time-invariant (LTI) systems, stability of the LTP system cannot be assessed by directly calculating the eigenvalues of   t A . To address this issue, (2) can be transformed into a state-space-like model, where the states, inputs, and outputs are all represented by corresponding Fourier coefficients. Such a model is referred to as the harmonic state space (HSS) model (please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for details) written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">         <label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the states and inputs are the Fourier coefficients of x and u ; while , , , are Toeplitz format matrices whose entries are Fourier coefficients of</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">        , , , t t t t A B C D respectively; is a block diagonal matrix consisting of 1 j , 0, 1,... k k N     I .</formula><p>It is noticed that the harmonic-order N has to be defined before (3) can be solved numerically. Usually, N is chosen according to the number of dominant harmonics existing in the system. In this paper, N = 4 is selected because the frequency responses of SOGI-PLL/FLL above this order are overall small (please see Appendix-A). Once N is defined, small-signal stability of (2) can be equivalently studied by the truncated model of (3), i.e., the eigenvalues of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. A parameter space-oriented modeling and analysis method for SOGI-PLL/FLL</head><p>Modeling and analysis of SOGI-PLL/FLL using the abovementioned LTP method primarily follow three steps:</p><p>1) Establish the state-space model; 2) Perform linearization around the PSS conditions;</p><p>3) Transform the linearized model into HSS for analysis. Implementation of the above steps using analytic methods is feasible for individual cases, however, the procedure becomes extremely cumbersome if the parametric study is aimed at. For instance, the PSS conditions in step 2) should be re-evaluated (which are typically obtained from lengthy time-domain simulations) and inserted in the analytic model. This process will be repeated for every change of the system's parameters.</p><p>Therefore, to arrive at an efficient method for parametric studies, the above procedures will be automatically fulfilled in MATLAB using symbolic and numeric calculations in this paper. To illustrate this, next, the SOGI-PLL/FLL with Type-I SOGI-QSG will be analyzed as an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) State-space modeling of SOGI-PLL/FLL (Type-I)</head><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (a), the state-space model of the SOGI-PLL can be described by the following equations: </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">  2 ˆŝogi g pll pll pll ipll gq pll ppll gq pll x k u x x xx x k u k u x                         <label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">                   (5)</formula><p>Similarly, according to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (b), the state-space model of SOGI-FLL can be described by the following equations:  </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">    2 sogi g fll fll fll g fll ff x k u x x xx x u x x k                    (6)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">x              (7)</formula><p>Then, ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) can be formulated in MATLAB using the command sym/syms for later symbolic calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Linearization</head><p>Linearization of ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) can be fulfilled analytically, however, since this paper aims at a systematic analysis of stability, the linearization process is assisted with using the symbolic calculation of MATLAB, i.e., the command jacobian ().</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Convert the linearized model into HSS</head><p>When converting (2) into (3), it is equivalent to transform should be obtained, which can be fulfilled by using the command FFT() in MATLAB.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">       </formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Update the PSS conditions</head><p>Notably, extracting the Fourier coefficients of e.g.,   t A for obtaining should be conducted upon an established steadystate, i.e., the PSS conditions should be known beforehand. In this regard, a Newton-based iterative method for fast PSS extraction is developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The method will be adopted in this paper as the iterative procedure is self-contained and can be readily integrated into later parametric stability analysis.</p><p>Once , , , are obtained according to the updated PSS conditions, the small-signal stability under various parameters can be readily assessed by calculating the eigenvalues of  . A flow chart of the above-illustrated parameter spaceoriented modeling and analysis method is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 (c</ref>).</p><p>After the above preparations, one more step is required for achieving a fair and straightforward stability comparison of SOGI-PLL and -FLL, which is discussed in the next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Parameter unification of FLL and PLL in terms of the settling time</head><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>  and 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 are the same. Therefore, the focus of parameter unification is placed on subsystems of FLL and PLL. First, for the FLL given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (b), it has been shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> that it can be approximated by a first-order system (which is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>  Next, to arrive at a similar parameter space for the SOGI-PLL, the main objective is to find a parameter that resembles FLL  , i.e., characterize the settling time of PLL at least in a small-signal sense (as this paper focuses on small-signal issues). To this end, the following analysis is performed.</p><p>First, the linearized PLL model can be obtained as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>     can be used, where 0 U is the nominal and peak value of grid voltage. Then, multiplying both sides of (8) with the Laplace variable s, the following equation can be obtained:  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> It can be seen that the introduced gain PLL  represents the decaying factor (i.e., inverse of time constant) of the secondorder system of PLL, which implies that the PLL can be approximated by a first-order system if the focus is on the settling time. Then, comparing Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>  Based on the above analysis, the parameter unification of SOGI-PLL and -FLL is achieved and the resulting twodimensional parameter space is: 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿/𝐹𝐿𝐿 , 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 . To further show the feasibility of this unification, a time-domain response comparison of SOGI-FLL and -PLL subjected to a step change of grid-frequency is applied, the results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3 (c</ref>). It can be seen that under the same parameter space, the simulated settling time of SOGI-PLL is similar to that of SOGI-FLL, which is also close to the estimated one using . Therefore, the presented parameter unification method is feasible.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">    0 2 0 g pll pll ipll pll g pll ipll k s k U ss s k s k U           </formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PARAMETRIC STABILITY ASSESSMENTS OF SOGI-PLL/FLL UNDER DIFFERENT FFP IMPLEMENTATIONS</head><p>In this section, the comparative stability assessment of SOGI-PLL/FLL under different FFP implementations will be conducted over the unified parameter space 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 , 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿/𝐹𝐿𝐿 . This can be fulfilled by repeatedly calling the method in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2  (c</ref>). Before proceeding with this analysis, the eigenvalues of an LTP system will be shortly discussed to acquire a better understanding of forthcoming stability plots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. An example of calculated eigenvalues</head><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>, eigenvalues calculated from the algorithm in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (c) contain frequency-shifted copies. The occurrence of this phenomenon is attributed to the inherent properties of LTP systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, in terms of stability judgments, only the real parts of the weakest modes (as highlighted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>) are most relevant for analysis. Moreover, since the real parts of these shifted modes are identical, they can be represented by a unified variable, e.g., 𝑅𝑒[𝜆]. Based on this notation, generally, 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] &gt; 0 indicates an unstable system, otherwise, the system is stable. Besides, 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] also reflects the system's stability margin, e.g., the system will be more stable if the value of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] is more negative. Based on these considerations, in the following analysis, 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] will be used as the indicator for parametric stability assessment.</p><p>0885-8969 (c) 2020 IEEE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Stability trait analysis of SOGI-PLL/FLL under different FFP implementations</head><p>According to the algorithm in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (c), three-dimensional plots characterizing the parametric stability traits of SOGI-PLL/FLL under different FFP implementations can be obtained, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. In these plots, the x-y plane denotes the parameter space 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 , 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿/𝐹𝐿𝐿 ; while the z-axis denotes the value of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Stability trait analysis of SOGI-PLL</head><p>First, according to Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> (a), a qualitative understanding of how parameter variations will affect the stability of SOGI-PLL can be immediately obtained. For example, see the plot of Type-I SOGI-PLL and assume that 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 is fixed around 10. Then by inspecting the value of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] along the 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿 -axis, it can be found that the increase of 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿 will first lead to a decrease in 𝑅𝑒[𝜆], then followed by a slightly increase. This means under this type of parameter variation, stability of the SOGI-PLL will be first enhanced then slightly deteriorated.</p><p>Apart from the qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of stability can also be achieved by examining the value of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] (e.g., see the data specified on the surfaces of those plots). From the value of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆], not only stability conclusion can be drawn (i.e., stable or not) but also the information of stability margin can be obtained. This delicate analysis will be discussed in Section III-D, along with time-domain simulations.</p><p>Next, by observing the overall stability traits of SOGI-PLL in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> (a), the following findings can be obtained:</p><p>1) Type-I and -III can be classified as one group because they exhibit a similar stability trait (i.e., Group I in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p><p>2) Type-II and -IV belong to another group as they share another similar stability trait (i.e., Group II in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p><p>3) By further observing the configurations of FFPs under each group, it can be found that the stability trait is more sensitive to the FFP location in the quadrature path than in the in-phase path. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-I Group-II</head><p>Change of FFP location in the quadrature-path (sensitive to stability)</p><p>Change of FFP location in the in-phase-path Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> Classification of FFP implementations according to their stability traits (i.e., Type-I and -III has a similar stability trait, while Type-II and -IV exhibit another similar stability trait, this plot applies to both SOGI-PLL and -FLL)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Stability trait analysis of SOGI-FLL</head><p>Stability trait plots of SOGI-FLL under four types of FFP implementations are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5 (b)</ref>. Following a similar analysis as the SOGI-PLL, it can be readily confirmed that the above-listed conclusions are all applicable to the SOGI-FLL, thus they are not repeated here. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Stability performance analysis of SOGI-PLL/FLL under different FFP implementations</head><p>Although from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> one could readily acquire a full picture of the stability trait over the parameter space, it is not easy to further identify which FFP implementation or which type of synchronization unit is better with respect to the stability performance. To this end, in this section, another form of presentation will be used, referred to as the stability region plot. The idea is to delimit a prescribed parameter space into stable and unstable zones. Afterward, the system with a larger stable zone is then considered to have a better stability performance.</p><p>According to the above description, the stability region plot can be conveniently found by projecting the stability trait plot onto the plane z = 0 (i.e., where 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] = 0 ). Specifically, projecting the space above z = 0 (i.e. where Re[λ] &gt; 0) will result in the "unstable" region while projecting the space below z = 0 will obtain the "stable" region. Following this procedure, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> can be converted into stability region plots as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Based on these plots, the afore-raised questions can be readily resolved, which are shown below:</p><p>1) First, overall, it can be obtained that the Type-I/III have a larger stable region than Type-II/IV regardless of the types of synchronization units used. In particular, for SOGI-FLL with Type-I/III, the stable zone covers the entire prescribed parameter space, indicating a superior stability performance.</p><p>2) By comparing SOGI-PLL and -FLL under each FFP implementation it can be further obtained that SOGI-FLL has overall better stability performance than SOGI-PLL due to the wider area of the stable region.</p><p>3) The above two main conclusions suggest that it is better to configure or implement the SOGI-QSG as Type-I/III to gain more benefits on stability. This conclusion applies to both SOGI-PLL and -FLL.</p><p>Based on the stability region plots it can also be observed that the previously identified sensitivity issue is more evident when the SOGI gain 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 is large (e.g., see Fig. <ref type="figure">7 (a)</ref>, where the unstable region of Type-II is significantly different from Type-I when 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 is large). More discussion on this observation will be given in Section IV. For a convenient reference, the above conclusions are summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, the above stability region-based analysis also demonstrates that the parameter space-oriented method using the stability region representation can serve as a useful tool for fast stability tests and parameter designs of SOGI-PLL/FLL. For example, parameter designs and optimizations of SOGI-PLL/FLL could be performed within the stable zone of the parameter space so that the small-signal instability would be largely avoided. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Stability margin analysis and time-domain verifications under different FFP implementations</head><p>As mentioned earlier, a quantitative analysis of the system stability margin can be fulfilled by examining how close the value of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] is to the zero. In the following, this quantitative analysis will be conducted by showing the subtle difference of stability margin existing between either Type-I-and III or Type-II-and IV (although, qualitatively, they have been shown to have a similar stability trait/region in the above analysis).</p><p>To fulfill this quantitative analysis, a set of data has been specified on the plots in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. For convenient references, they are collected and shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>.</p><p>From this table, it can be clearly seen that there exists a subtle difference in stability margin between Type-I and -III (or Type-II and -IV) under the same parameter set. For example, the values of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] for Type-I and -III (SOGI-PLL) are -0.582 and -2.798 respectively, showing that Type-I has a lower stability margin than Type-III. Therefore, in time-domain response, it is anticipated that the SOGI-PLL under Type-I implementation will present a longer settling time than Type-III. This will be shown later. It should be noted that this subtle difference in stability margin will not lead to evident impacts on overall parametric stability performance (since, as already shown, Type-I and -III have a similar size of the stable region).</p><p>Before validating the accuracy of the numeric results given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>, it can be observed that the values of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] are chosen intentionally, aiming at a more comprehensive validation. For example, the values of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] under Type-I/III are chosen to be negative for validating the case of a stable system, while those under Type-II/IV are chosen to be positive for validating the case of an unstable system. Based on this arrangement, time-domain simulations for both SOGI-PLL and -FLL under all the four types of FFP implementations are conducted in PSCAD/EMTDC using the parameters given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.</p><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, it can be seen that for both SOGI-PLL and -FLL, Type-I and-III exhibit a stable system, while Type-II and -IV present an unstable system. These simulated results are consistent with the theoretically predicted stability results given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>. Furthermore, when inspecting closer the stable waveforms of SOGI-PLL under Type-I and -III in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> (a), it can be seen that indeed the Type-I takes a longer time to settle down at the steady-state compared to Type-III (also the transient of Type-III is smaller). This observation is consistent with the analysis based on the values of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>.</p><p>Based on a similar analysis of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆], other waveforms can be explained as well. For instance, in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>). Whereas for the unstable waveforms in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> (either SOGI-PLL or -FLL), it can be seen that the magnitudes of unstable waveforms under Type-IV grow faster than those under Type-II. This is mainly because the value of 𝑅𝑒[𝜆] for either SOGI-PLL or -FLL under Type-IV is larger than that under Type-II (see the values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>).</p><p>Overall, the above analysis demonstrates that the theoretic stability results (i.e., the numeric values in the generated stability plots) are valid and accurate.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">II</ref>).</p><p>0885-8969 (c) 2020 IEEE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSIONS</head><p>To consolidate the understanding of the conclusions drawn from the numeric stability analysis, this section will provide some interpretations of the main findings from the control system perspective. To this end, a feedback system uniformly characterizing SOGI-PLL/FLL will be first developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The unified feedback system</head><p>Since this analysis will be concentrated on the impacts of FFP implementations, the frequency variation will be regarded as the main source of perturbation, while the input grid voltage is assumed to be ideal. Then, based on the linearization process given on the left side of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> (a), a unified feedback system can be obtained, which is shown on the right side of the figure.</p><p>From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> (a), it can be seen that the feedback system consists of three blocks, i.e., Block-I~III. The model of Block-II is shown in the middle of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> (a), while the models of Block-I and -III are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref> (b) and (c). Also, it is noted that Block-II is LTI while Block-I and -III are LTP variant. The presence of LTP blocks indicates that when transforming the overall system into the frequency-domain, frequency couplings will be present (see an example of this effect in Appendix-A). This will result in a high-dimensional model that is difficult to analyze. Therefore, to provide more insights into the system, a simplified frequency-domain model of the unified feedback system focusing on the input and output relation of the same frequency will be developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The simplified model of the unified feedback system</head><p>Derivation of the simplified frequency-domain model can be generally achieved by merely modeling the frequency components of interest, e.g., in this study, the frequency components at p1 2   or higher are neglected from the modeling, where p  is the perturbation frequency. Based on this assumption, a simplified control diagram of the unified feedback system can be drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. In this figure, for brevity, only the dimensions and types of Block-I~III are shown, while their detailed models are given in Appendix-B.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">   PLL s     s   I, TypeI~IV 2 1      G II, αβ 2 2      G III, PLL 1 2     G (a) SOGI-PLL (b) SOGI-FLL Block-I Block-II &amp; III    PLL s     s   I, TypeI~IV 2 1      G Block-I Block-II &amp; III II, α 2 2      G III, FLL 1 2      G</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> Simplified model of the unified feedback system Although this model is greatly reduced from the one used in parametric stability analysis, they are still rather difficult to interpret as the transfer-functions are in fact matrices.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Interpretation of the main findings 1) Interpretation of the cause of different sensitivities of stability to FFP location change</head><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>, the cause of different stability sensitivities to the change of FFP location can be overall interpreted like this: since the transfer-functions in the forwardpath exhibited by Type-I~IV implementations (i.e., I, TypeI~IV G ) are different, their resulting closed-loop stability characteristics will be different. To further explain that Type-I is similar to Type-III while different from Type-II or -IV, the sensitivity functions of SOGI-PLL/FLL (i.e., SOGI_PLL,FLL L ) with different 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 and 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿,𝐹𝐿𝐿 will be analyzed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>.</p><p>First, from Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> (a) it can be seen that the differences among Type-I~IV implementations are small when 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 is small.

Thus, the effects of different models of I, TypeI~IV G are greatly attenuated. However, when the SOGI gain is increased, evident differences between Type-I/III and Type-II/IV present. This can be more clearly seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Interpretation of the better stability margin of Type-I/III than Type-II/IV</head><p>As mentioned earlier, the sensitivity function also carries information about the system's stability margin. Based on this fact and by examining the characteristics of sensitivity functions given in Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>, it can be seen that for both SOGI-PLL and -FLL, the L(s) of Type-I/III overall shows fewer fluctuations than the Type-II/IV. Also, the L(s) of Type-I/III has an overall lower magnitude (aside from the negative-directional spike at 50 Hz). Therefore, it can be concluded that the stability margin of Type-I/III is indeed better than Type-II/IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Interpretation of wider stability region of SOGI-FLL than SOGI-PLL</head><p>The wider stability region of SOGI-FLL concluded from the parametric stability analysis can be translated into the implication that SOGI-FLL is more robust than SOGI-PLL against parameter variations, i.e., the margin of SOGI-FLL is less sensitive to the parameter change. To confirm this interpretation, the change of L(s) under different parameters (i.e., 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 , 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿,𝐹𝐿𝐿 ) can be examined, where the results of Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> can still be utilized for this analysis.</p><p>First, from Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref> (a) it can be seen that regardless of the FFP implementations, the change of 𝐿 SOGI_FLL is much smaller than 𝐿 SOGI_PLL when 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 varies. Thus the SOGI-FLL is more robust against the variation of 𝑘 𝑠𝑜𝑔𝑖 than SOGI-PLL. Next, by examining Fig. <ref type="figure">11 (b</ref>) it can be further confirmed that SOGI-FLL is still more robust than SOGI-PLL concerning the variation of 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿,𝐹𝐿𝐿 . In particular, for SOGI-PLL, the change (increase) of 𝛼 𝑃𝐿𝐿,𝐹𝐿𝐿 leads to the occurrence of a large spike in the sensitivity function, indicating its stability margin is of high sensitivity to this parameter's variation.</p><p>Overall, the above interpretations agree with the parametric stability analysis. However, it is worth reminding that since the above-applied models are greatly simplified for interpretations, they cannot be used for rigorous and quantitative stability analysis. In this regard, the parametric stability analysis method based on high-fidelity system models should be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper presents a parameter space-oriented stability analysis method aiming at a thorough discussion on the smallsignal stability of two types of widely applied synchronization units, i.e., SOGI-PLL and -FLL. The stability difference arising from different FFP implementations in SOGI-QSG is identified and evaluated using the parametric stability analysis method. The results from the presented analysis demonstrate how the FFP implementation can lead to significant impacts on the overall stability performance of SOGI-PLL/FLL. Therefore, the choice of the FFP implementation should be carefully considered, especially in applications concerned with stability. In this respect, the conclusions and analysis of this paper can serve as a useful reference. The detailed findings and conclusions are listed as follows:</p><p>1) Regardless of the frequency adaptive law (i.e., either PLL or FLL is used), Type-I~IV FFP implementations can be classified into two groups based on the stability characteristics: Type-I/III is one group, while Type-II/IV is another group.</p><p>2) Regardless of the types of synchronization units used, the stability performance of Type-I/III is overall better than Type-II/IV. Therefore, this conclusion suggests that it is better to configure or implement the SOGI-QSG as Type-I/III to gain more benefits on stability.</p><p>3) Under each FFP implementation, SOGI-FLL exhibits a wider stability region than SOGI-PLL, thus showing a better stability performance than SOGI-PLL. </p></div>			</div>
