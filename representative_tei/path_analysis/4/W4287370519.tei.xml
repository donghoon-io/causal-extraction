<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Passing the licensure examination which is administered and performed by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) is one of the biggest accomplishments of all board program graduates here in the Philippines. Similarly, graduates' licensing performance can reflect the quality and effectiveness of their respective institutions' instruction. The top priority of any Higher Education Institution (HEI) and State University and College (SUC) here in the Philippines is high performance in the board program licensing examinations conducted by the PRC. A number of passers in the Board Licensure Examination for Professional Teachers (BLEPT) have been produced by the Occidental Mindoro State College in recent years, but annual passing percentages are low compared to the national passing percentage. For this reason, the school is now challenged to deliver a desirable number of College of Teacher Education board passer graduates which is above the national passing rate. This study determined which among the subject areas in the academic and comprehensive examination predict the licensure examination performance of the OMSC-CTE BSEd and BEEd graduates. To explain the academic, comprehensive, and licensure examination performances of the graduates, descriptive statistics such as weighted mean and standard deviation were used. The relationships among the variables were established using Pearson-Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and path analysis was utilized in designing mathematical models in predicting the licensure performance of the BSEd and BEEd graduates. The findings of this study disclosed that the generally weighted averages (GWAs) in general education, major courses, and comprehensive examination are significant predictors of the licensure examination performance of BSED graduates while GWAs in general education and comprehensive examination are the significant predictors of the licensure examination performance of BEEd graduates. Based on these results, it was proposed that a more intensive enhancement practice with comprehensive examination must be provided by the college since the comprehensive examination was found to be a significant predictor of the graduates' licensure performance. The College of Teacher</head><p>Education's curriculum must also be constantly improved and strengthened, especially in general education and major courses, as these subject areas are important predictors of BLEPT.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Licensure examinations are performed among practitioners by professional regulatory offices in different countries around the world. A prerequisite for registration is the passing of the licensing exam for a graduate of a regulated occupation. Graduates cannot legalize the practice of their profession unless they passed the licensure examination. For example, before they are being issued a certificate of registration by the Board for Professional Teachers and legally practice their profession, education graduates are expected to pass the Board Licensure Examination for Professional Teachers (BLEPT). One of the most important educational reforms implemented in the Philippines is BLEPT. This was enforced under the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) based on Republic Act 7836, also known as the Professionalization Act for Teachers. The "Professionalization Act for Teachers" allows teachers to be certified under the PRC to increase the quality of the teaching profession and place it on a par with other occupations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Craig, 2017)</ref>. The top priority of any Higher Education Institution (HEI) and State College and University (SUC) here in the Philippines is high performance in licensure exams administered by the PRC. This is because of the distribution of funds from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) by Normative Funding (NF), the accreditation of state-recognized accrediting organizations such as Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), which caters to SUCs, and the suspension or termination of the program by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). Similarly, one of CHED's concerns is increasing the standard of education offered by HEIs. It is stipulated in CMO no. 48 s. 1996 that HEIs must demonstrate an ongoing search for excellence and a dedication to relatively high teaching standards © 2021, IJASRW, All right reserved <ref type="url" target="http://www.ijasrw.com">http://www.ijasrw.com</ref> </p><p>This study employed the descriptive research design in describing the academic, comprehensive exam, and licensure exam performances of the graduates. Likewise, in determining the relationship and the extent of the academic and comprehensive exam with that of the licensure performance, the same research design was utilized. When the research aim is to define attributes, frequencies, trends, associations, and categories, descriptive research is an acceptable choice. It is beneficial because not much is understood about the subject or problem yet. One has to understand how, when, and where it happens before he or she can investigate why anything occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(McCombes, 2019)</ref>. More specifically, in predicting the licensing performance of the graduates, this study adopted the descriptive method because it is the most suitable method for collecting the data required in the design of the mathematical model. Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref> depict the hypothesized models of the study. They illustrate the process involving the variables of this study which were the basis in designing a mathematical model through path analysis that can predict the licensure examination performance using the academic and comprehensive examination performances of the graduates in the different subject areas related to BLEPT. Descriptive statistics such as weighted mean and standard deviation were used to describe the academic, comprehensive examination, and licensure examination performances of the subjects, as well as the extent of variation of the scores in the different subject areas. To establish the relationship among the academic, comprehensive examination, and licensure © 2021, IJASRW, All right reserved <ref type="url" target="http://www.ijasrw.com">http://www.ijasrw.com</ref> examination performances, Pearson-Product Moment Correlation Coefficient was utilized. In determining the extent of the predictor variables and in designing the mathematical equation models, path analysis using SPSS and AMOS software was utilized.</p><p>The path analysis assumptions should be taken into account and these are as follows: relationships should be linear; data should be nominal dichotomous, measurement interval or ratio level; error terms should not be correlated with any variable; terms of disturbance should not be correlated with endogenous variables; low multicollinearity is assumed; and the path model should not be under-identified, exactly identified or over-identified. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Kline (1998)</ref> suggests that 20 times as many cases as parameters, and at least 200, should preferably be the sample size.</p><p>Finally, the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) accuracy test was used to evaluate the accuracy level of the predicted variables in the evaluation of the established mathematical model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>After analyzing and interpreting the data gathered, the following findings are hereby presented:</p><p>1. The BSEd graduates performed very satisfactorily in their general education courses performing best in Filipino and least in Science which was both verbally interpreted as "Very Satisfactory". Likewise, they also performed very satisfactorily in their professional education courses having the highest mean grade in Practice Teaching (Superior) and the lowest mean grade in Developmental Reading (Very Satisfactory). Also, the Math, English, and Filipino majors showed a "Very Satisfactory" performance in all their major courses. It could also be deduced from the results that the BSEd graduates performed better in their major courses than in their general education and professional education courses. This finding implied that BSEd graduates are better prepared in their field of specializations. When it comes to the comprehensive examination, the performance of the BSEd graduates in general education and professional education is both fairly satisfactory and satisfactory in major courses. For the licensure examination, the BSEd graduates exhibited the satisfactory performance in general education and a fairly satisfactory performance both in professional and major courses. About the overall academic performance, the BSEd graduates performed fairly satisfactorily in the comprehensive examination but they performed satisfactorily in the licensure examination. On the other hand, results indicated that the BEEd graduates performed very satisfactorily in their general education courses performing best in Filipino and least in Science which was both interpreted as "Very Satisfactory". It was also revealed in the results that in all their professional education courses, Practice Teaching got the highest mean grade (Superior) while the lowest mean grade was in Principle of Teaching (Very Satisfactory). The overall result showed that the BEEd graduates performed very satisfactorily in their professional education courses. About the comprehensive examination, the performances of the BEEd graduates in general and professional education courses were both barely satisfactory. In the licensure examination, it was revealed that professional education had a higher mean compared to general education which meant that the graduates performed better in their professional education courses than in their general education courses. This result is in contrast with the BSEd licensure performance in which the BSEd graduates perform better in general education than in their professional education courses. About the overall performance, the BEEd graduates performed barely satisfactorily in the comprehensive and licensure examination. between the academic and comprehensive examination performance was in the major courses (r=.562) while the lowest correlation was in the professional courses (r=.349). On the other hand, the highest correlation obtained between the academic and licensure examination performance was in the major courses (r=.469) while the lowest correlation was noted in the professional courses (r=.238). Since all the p-values were less than .05 (p-value=.000), then all the correlations from low to substantial between the academic performance of the BSEd and BEEd graduates and the result of their comprehensive examination were found to be significant. Similarly, as shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, there was a low to marked degree of correlation between the comprehensive examination performance of the BSEd and BEEd graduates and the result of their licensure examination. The highest correlation obtained between the comprehensive and licensure examination performance was in the General Weighted Average (GWA) of all the courses (r=.606) while the lowest correlation was in the major courses (r=.364). All the p-values are less than .05 (p-value=.000) indicating a significant correlation. Thus, results implied that the comprehensive examination performances of both the BSEd and BEEd graduates in general education, professional education, and major courses are very significantly related to their licensure examination performance. 3. As exhibited in table 3, the BSEd graduates' general weighted averages in their general education and major courses positively and significantly influence the general weighted average of their comprehensive examination. This finding indicated that the higher the grades in general education and major courses, the higher also are the scores in the comprehensive examination. On the other hand, professional education courses negatively and insignificantly affect the comprehensive examination which is an indication that the academic performance of BSEd graduates found in their GWA in professional education courses is not a significant predictor of comprehensive examination performance. Considering all the predictors of comprehensive examination performance, R-square was .36 which indicated that 36% of the variability of the comprehensive examination is explained by the predictors of the study. On the other hand, the BSEd graduates' GWAs in their general education, major courses, and comprehensive examination had a significant and positive influence, with medium effect, on the GWA of their licensure examination while the GWA in professional education is not significant. From the given set of predictors, the amount of variation of the licensure examination performance, as supported by its GWA, is explained by the R 2 value which was .46. This suggested that the linear effect of the predictor variables could be accounted for by a 46 percent difference in BLEPT results. It means, therefore, that other predictors can be applied to the remaining 54% of variances. Furthermore, the BEEd graduates' GWAs in their general and professional education courses have a positive medium effect on the general weighted average of their comprehensive examination. This finding signified that graduates with higher academic grades in general and professional education courses tend to have higher scores in a comprehensive examination. Results showed that the academic performance of graduates found in their GWA in general education and GWA in professional education are significant predictors of comprehensive examination performance. Results also showed that the determination coefficient after considering all the predictors of comprehensive examination performance was .16 indicating that 16 percent of the academic performance of BEEd graduates accounted for the variation in their performance in the comprehensive examination. Likewise, GWAs in the general education and comprehensive examination is positive and significant and had a medium effect on the GWA of the licensure examination while the GWA in professional education is negative and not significant. The findings indicated that the academic performance of BEEd graduates explained in their GWA in general education and the GWA in the comprehensive examination are predictors of licensure examination performance while GWA in professional education courses is not a significant predictor. Results have shown that the determination coefficient (R 2 ) was .30 showing that the predictor variables account for 30 percent of the BEEd graduates' BLEPT results.</p><p>4. Based on the standardized output models for the BSEd and BEEd, a mathematical model for each program has been developed. 54 With a predicting power equal to 54 percent, every one unit increase in the graduates' general weighted average in general education, professional education, and major course corresponds to a .3132 increase, .0809 decrease, and .4080 increase in the BLEPT performance consecutively. On the other hand, for the BEEd program, the dependent variable considered was the Licensure Examination while the independent variables were the General Education Course (GEC), Professional Education Course (PEC), and Comprehensive Examination (CE). The mathematical equation model for the BEEd program was: Licensure Examination = .3115 * GEC + .0720 * PEC + .70 With a predicting power of 70 percent, it is stated that for every one-unit increase in the generally weighted averages of the graduates in general education and professional education means .3115 and .0720 increase in the BLEPT performance respectively.</p><p>5. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value for BSEd of 17.55 percent which is less than 20 percent indicated that in all occurrences, the designed BSEd mathematical model predictive value is good. On the other hand, the MAPE value for BEEd of 34.66 percent which is between 20-50 percent implied that the designed BEEd mathematical model has a fairly good predictive value which can be attributed to the less than 50 percent predicting capability of the model based on the R-squared obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. The BSEd graduates performed very satisfactorily in the academics defined in their general education, professional education, and major courses, fairly satisfactorily in the comprehensive examination and satisfactorily in the licensure examination. On the other hand, the BEEd graduates performed very satisfactorily in their academics, and barely satisfactory both in comprehensive and licensure examinations. 2. The academic performances of both the BSEd and BEEd graduates defined in their general education, professional education, and major courses are very significantly related to their comprehensive and licensure examination performances. Also, their comprehensive examination performance is significantly related to their licensure examination performance. 3. The generally weighted averages (GWAs) in general education, major courses, and comprehensive examination are significant predictors of the licensure examination performance of BSED graduates while GWAs in general education and comprehensive examination are the significant predictors of the licensure examination performance of BEEd graduates. 4. The designed mathematical model in predicting the licensure examination performance of BSEd graduates was:</p><p>Licensure Examination = .3132 * GEC -.0908 * PEC + .4080 * MC + .54 On the other hand, the designed mathematical model in predicting the licensure examination of BEEd graduates was: Licensure Examination = .3115 * GEC + .0720 * PEC + .70 5. The designed BSEd mathematical model predictive value is good as indicated by a MAPE value less than 20 percent and the designed BEEd mathematical model has a fairly good predictive value with a MAPE value between 20-50 percent due to its low predicting capability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
