<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background Postpartum weight retention (PPWR) causes obesity, chronic diseases, and occurring adverse maternalfetal and neonatal outcomes. Given the social factors' effect on health and disease and considering the lack of information on social determinants of health (SDH) effects on PPWR, this study was conducted to survey the relationship between SDH and PPWR based on the World Health Organization (WHO) model.</p><p>Methods A cross-sectional study was performed on 400 women six months after delivery in 2020. Twelve health centers were randomly selected from the three universities of Medical Sciences in the city of Tehran, Iran. Participants were selected by convenience method and based on eligibility. Questionnaires used included: Lifestyle Profile Health Promoting II, Short Form Postpartum Quality of Life Questionnaire, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Postpartum Social Support, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, and questionnaires designed by reviewing the literature about breastfeeding, sleep, contraceptive, child health, unhealthy behaviors, postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs, body satisfaction, access to postpartum care, socioeconomic status, demographic, and obstetric questionnaire. Data analysis was performed in SPSS-23, and the relationship model was examined using the path analysis method in LISREL-8.8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Path analysis indicated the direct effect of six intermediate factors on PPWR including: gestational weight gain (β = 0.42), access to postpartum care (β = 0.11), postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs (β=-0.17), anxiety (β = 0.09), sleep duration (β=-0.09), pre-pregnancy body mass index (β = 0.09). Among the structural factors, woman's education and socioeconomic status had an indirect negative effect on PPWR. The model fit indices showed good fit (RMSE = 0/05, GFI = 0.92, CFI = 0.92, χ 2 /df = 2.17).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Postpartum weight retention (PPWR) refers to the weight difference between pre-pregnancy and sometime after delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. If this weight retention is ≤ 5 Kg, it is considered excessive <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In the United Kingdom, 73% <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and in Iran, 83.5% <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> of women had not reached their pre-pregnancy weight six months after delivery. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis, two-thirds of women were more weighted six months after delivery compared to their pre-pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. PPWR causes obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and maternal diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. PPWR is related to several biological/behavioral factors like breastfeeding, use of hormonal contraceptives, nutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, pre-pregnancy BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, gestational weight gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The association between psychological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and PPWR has been reported. Also, socioeconomic status and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, ethnicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> were related to PPWR. Socioeconomic factors such as income, wealth, and education have been mentioned as the main reasons for many health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Nowadays, social factors as the founding causes of health and disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have received more global attention. Social Determinants of Health (SDH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live and work. These conditions are key equality factors in health <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Different conceptual models have been proposed to illustrate social determinant mechanisms on health <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) model (2014), factors affecting health are divided into four groups: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the features of society and environmental factors, (2) socio-economic characteristics, awareness, attitudes, and health beliefs, (3) health behaviors and psychological and safety factors, (4) biomedical factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In the multi-level conceptual framework for the causes of childhood obesity, designed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hawkins et al. (2018)</ref>, individual factors over time are influenced by multiple upstream levels as they interact with biology and downstream levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Da Silva et al. (2013) designed a hierarchical and conceptual structure to analyze the determinants of postpartum weight variables. The first level (distal determinants) of this model, was included demographic and socio-economic factors. In the second level (intermediate determinants), variables related to the mother's fertility and the baby are proposed. In the third level (proximal determinants), postpartum lifestyle is discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Phillips et al. (2012)</ref> presented a conceptual model and depicted the psychological factors predicting PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The World Health Organization's Commission for Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) presented a model for social factors affecting health in 2010. According to this model, social factors affecting health are studied in two groups: 1-Structural social determinants and 2-Intermediate social determinants. These factors affect each other and, ultimately, health. Structural social determinants that form the social class include education, income, gender, and ethnicity (race). WHO model emphasizes the socioeconomic and political context and the structural determinants of health inequity. In this model, context, structural mechanisms, and the resultant socioeconomic situation of individuals are "structural determinants. " The structural social determinants of health shape the health outcome through a set of intermediate determinants of health. The terms "structural determinants" and "intermediate determinants" highlight the causal priority of structural factors. Intermediate social determinants include the following categories: material conditions such as work, and access to food; behavioral and/or biological factors such as nutrition, physical activity, and genetic factors; psychosocial factors such as psychosocial stressors and social support; and the health system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In this regard, PPWR can be considered a health consequence affected by structural and intermediate social factors.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 65.4% of Iranian women over the age of 18 were overweight or obese (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2) in 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and a systematic review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Djalalinia et al. (2021)</ref> showed that 71.7% of Iranian women had overweight, and 36.8% were obese <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Given the high prevalence of obesity and overweight in Iranian women and because PPWR is the cause of long-term obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, finding factors affecting PPWR seems necessary for Iran. Some previously mentioned related factors have been investigated in the form of models such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Phillips et al. (2012)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and da Silva et al. (2013) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Given that the social determinant of health model is one of the most completed models, and considering the WHO models, which were suggested by a group of experts in this study, are designed in a way that they can be implemented in most countries. So, the present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between SDH and PPWR based on the WHO social determinant of health 2010 model. The hypotheses of this study are: (1) Structural social determinants of health are related to PPWR (2) Intermediate social determinants of health are related to PPWR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>A cross-sectional study was performed on 400 women six months after delivery referred to community health centers in Tehran in 2020. Four health centers were randomly selected from each of the three universities of medical sciences, including Shahid Beheshti, Tehran, and Iran (a total of 12 health centers). Participants were selected from these centers in person by convenience method and based on eligibility. The inclusion criteria were six months postpartum; not pregnant; not on weight-loss diets for six months after delivery; no chronic diseases; the last pregnancy being a singleton, alive, term, and normal; having a health record in the health center; Literate; Internet access; having a mobile phone; and desire to participate in the study. The exclusion criterion was refusing to complete the questionnaire. So, whenever the participant declined to complete the questionnaire, she was excluded from the study. The study objectives were explained to eligible women and invited them to participate in the study. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the data was gathered through an online questionnaire. For this purpose, the participants' mobile phone numbers were received. Online filling out the questionnaire was explained to them, and their questions were answered in this regard. Then, the questionnaire link was sent to their phone number to fill it out at home. The height and weight of the participants were measured using a valid scale and tape available in health centers. Pre-pregnancy weight and gestational weight gain were extracted from the trustworthy health records of the participants. PPWR was calculated based on the difference between prepregnancy weight and six months after delivery weight. The sample size (400 subjects) was determined, given that in path analysis for each independent variable is usually considered 5-20 observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. For this purpose, at first, the independent variables were determined based on the review of the literature, including Pre-pregnancy BMI/weight, Gestational weight gain, Weight at six months postpartum, Breastfeeding, Contraceptive methods, Childbirth type, Parity, Child's health status, Sleep duration, Unhealthy behaviors, Women's lifestyles, Postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs, Depression, Anxiety and Stress, Social support, Body satisfaction, Socioeconomic status, Education, Job, Ethnicity, Access to postpartum health services and age of the mother. Then the final sample size was determined to be almost 400, considering 15 samples per independent variable.</p><p>The WHO model, which was suggested by a group of experts in this study, was studied carefully. A conceptual model of SDH affecting PPWR was designed by reviewing the literature and based on the WHO model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Data were collected using a demographic-obstetric questionnaire (including 26-item) and questionnaires assessing structural (socioeconomic status) and intermediate social determinants of PPWR (including 157-item).</p><p>Since the valid questionnaires were not for some variables, appropriate questionnaires were designed, and their validity (face and content) and reliability were evaluated. The face validity (qualitative and quantitative) of the designed questionnaires were evaluated. In the qualitative face validity, 12 postpartum mothers from the target group (six months after delivery) were asked to comment on the relevancy, level of difficulty, and ambiguity of the questionnaires items. Then proper modifications were applied to the items according to the received comments. In the quantitative face validity, each item's impact score was determined. Items with an impact score ≥ 1.5 are considered appropriate and retained for further analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Considering that the impact score of each item in the designed questionnaires was more than 1.5, no items were deleted.</p><p>The content validity (qualitative and quantitative) of the designed questionnaires were evaluated. In the qualitative content validity, 15 experts (Faculty members of eight universities of medical sciences) assessed the grammar, wording, and proper scoring of the designed questionnaires. Then proper modifications were applied to the items according to the received comments. In the quantitative content validity, the content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI) were measured.</p><p>To measure CVR, 15 experts in reproductive health were asked to score the essentiality of the designed questionnaires items into three categories, including "Essential", "Useful but not essential", and "Not essential" from 1 to 3 respectively, based on Lawshe's method. CVR was calculated in the following formula: CVR = (ne -(N/2)) / (N/2). In this formula, ne is the number of experts who rate an item as 'Essential' , and N is the total number of experts. The calculated CVR was compared with the minimum acceptable CVR according to Lawshe's table. Items with CVR more than that stated in the table for the given number of experts were considered necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, the number of experts was 15. Based on the Lawshe table, the criteria for accepting the questions was 0.49. According to the Lawshe table, the content validity of each item in the designed questionnaires was significant, with a content validity ratio (CVR) higher than 0.49 at the P &lt; 0.05 level. So, all the questions in all the designed questionnaires were retained.</p><p>To measure CVI, 15 experts in reproductive health were asked to rate the relevance of the designed questionnaires items on a four-point Likert scale from 1 to 4. CVI was calculated in the following way: Dividing the number of experts who had rated 3 or 4 for an item by the total number of experts. The Content validity index score above 0.79 is considered appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In the present study, based on the content validity index (CVI), all the items of the designed questionnaires had a score of 0.79 and more and are considered appropriate.</p><p>The reliability of the questionnaires was assessed by the stability and internal consistency of the questionnaires. The stability of the questionnaires was assessed by the test-retest method using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). For this purpose, 20 eligible people completed the questionnaires twice with an interval of 14 days. These people were not included in the main sampling. Then, the scores obtained in the two stages were compared using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). If this index is higher than 0.70, the level of stability is considered favorable <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This index was higher than 0.70 in all questionnaires, indicating the favorable stability of each questionnaire in the present study.</p><p>All of the present study questionnaires and their validity and reliability are as follows:</p><p>Socioeconomic status : Ten questions were designed by reviewing the literature and questionnaires in this field <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> to assess the participants' income, economic status, parents' education, housing, concern for financial status, and satisfaction with their car. Its validity (face and content) and reliability (using the test-retest method) were confirmed (Impact Score = 2.03-4.39; total CVR = 0.61; total CVI = 0.91-0.99; ICC = 0.82). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>: The psychometrics of the Persian version of this 12-item scale were assessed in Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study process was as follows: First, the WHO model, which was suggested by a group of experts in this study, was studied carefully. Then, factors affecting the PPWR were extracted by reviewing the literature. These factors were categorized into structural and intermediate groups based on the WHO model, and each extracted variable was placed in its appropriate position. So, a model was designed based on the WHO model and scientific documents. Since the valid questionnaires were not for some variables, appropriate questionnaires were designed, and their validity and reliability were evaluated. Finally, data were collected through a cross-sectional study.</p><p>The data were analyzed using SPSS-23 and LISREL-8.8. Pearson correlation coefficient was determined to investigate the relationship between the studied variables. The direct and indirect effects of variables and their overall impact were investigated using the path analysis method. The fit indices were used for evaluating the model goodness of fit. The final path model was established following Wright's rules for identifying all compound paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and considering the designed conceptual framework based on the WHO model and scientific documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In this study, information was collected from 400 postpartum women. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the demographic characters of participants and their husbands. The mean ± sd age of the participants and their husbands was 32.53 ± 5.02 and 36.25 ± 5.25 years, respectively. The majority of participants (41.5%) and their husbands (31.5%) had a bachelor's degree; 52% of them and 52.5% of their husbands were of Persian ethnicity. 72.25% of the participants were housekeepers, and 99% of their husbands were employed.</p><p>The mean ± sd parity was 1.83 ± 1.00, and 75.5% of the participants had delivered by cesarean section. The mean ± sd body mass index (BMI) pre-pregnancy was 24.78 ± 3.91 kg/m2, and the mean ± sd gestational weight gain was 13.23 ± 5.72 kg. Six months after delivery, 85.5% of the participants had not returned to their pre-pregnancy weight, and the mean ± sd PPWR was 5.28 ± 4.99 kg. Also, 50% of the participants had excessive weight retention (≥ 5 kg).</p><p>Most of the participants (77.5%) had average socioeconomic status. The mean ± sd social support score was 60 ± 14.8, and the majority of the participants (85.3%) had high social support after childbirth. 56.5% of the participants had mild depression, 69% had mild anxiety, and 50.7% had mild stress. 69.5% of the participants had high body satisfaction.</p><p>The majority of the participants (69.3%) had a moderate level of lifestyle, and the majority (83.5%) did not have unhealthy behavior. The mean ± sd sleep duration of the participants was 7.23 ± 2.36 h. The majority of participants (46.5%) had exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months after delivery. 90.5% of the participants used non-hormonal contraceptive methods.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the correlation coefficients between SDH with PPWR. The results of the Pearson test showed a positive and significant correlation between PPWR with gestational weight gain, anxiety, and access to postpartum care. Also, it showed a significant negative correlation between PPWR with postpartum social support, postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs, and sleep duration. The highest correlation was found between gestational weight gain and PPWR.</p><p>The final model of the path analysis is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.

Gestational weight gain had the most direct positive effect, and postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs had the most direct negative impact on PPWR. Stress had the most indirect positive effect (β = 0.06), and lifestyle had the most indirect negative effect (β = 0.03) on PPWR.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SDH and PPWR. The path analysis in the present study showed that structural determinants, including women's education and socioeconomic status, were indirectly related to PPWR through the effect on intermediate factors. This result is similar to the systematic review of Iranian studies, which reported a statistically significant relationship between education and PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The effect of women's low education on more PPWR has also been reported by Siega-Riz et al. (2010) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zanotti et al. (2015)</ref>, a higher level of education was significantly associated with maintaining a lower postpartum weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. These results are similar to the results of the present study. It seems that women with higher education and higher socioeconomic status have more belief regain their pre-pregnancy weight and therefore have more control over their weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The knowledge and skills acquired through education in people with higher levels of education may affect their cognitive performance and increase their acceptance of health messages or lead to better communication and greater access to appropriate health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Six following intermediate determinants had a direct effect on PPWR:</p><p>Gestational weight gain had the most direct and total positive effect on PPWR. These results are similar to the results of several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. Similar to the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that more weight gain in pregnancy has a significant relationship with the chance of more PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Gestational weight gain over Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> has been determined as a predictor of   Correlation is significant at 0.01 levels PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The continuation of the pattern of activity and nutrition in pregnancy until the postpartum period <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> or biological factors such as the effect of excess gestational weight gain on increasing insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> may be effective in increasing PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. This result can be helpful in health planning. In a way, health providers, in addition to recommending proper weight gain during pregnancy, should be instructed postpartum women according to gestational weight gain to control PPWR. Pre-pregnancy BMI showed a direct and positive association with PPWR. In other words, with the increase in pre-pregnancy BMI, the PPWR also increases. Similarly, Celik et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) reported a significant association between pre-pregnancy BMI and PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. On the other hand, Hollis et al. (2017) reported that low pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with increased PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This difference may be due to differences in pre-pregnancy weight measurement time. In a way, the time of pre-pregnancy weight measurement was 1.8 years on average before pregnancy, which is mentioned as a limitation of that research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Based on path analysis in the present study, Pre-pregnancy BMI is affected by parity. Thus, with an increase in the number of pregnancies, Pre-pregnancy BMI is expected to increase, leading to more PPWR.</p><p>Sleep duration has a direct and negative association with PPWR. Xiao et al. ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) systematic review study showed the impact of reduced sleep duration on the increase in PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gunderson et al. (2007)</ref> reported that ≤ 5 h of sleep duration in the six months postpartum was strongly associated with ≥ 5 kg weight retention one year after delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. It seems that shorter sleep duration affects energy balance by negatively affecting glucose metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Anxiety has a direct association with PPWR. Depression and stress indirectly affected PPWR. The most indirect positive effect on PPWR belonged to stress. High stress may increase cortisol <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref>. So, stress can prevent postpartum weight loss by helping to hormonal changes that increase obesity and behaviors such as overeating <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Phillips et al. (2014)</ref> also reported that stress in the three months after delivery had a positive and significant association with weight retention at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>. Results of a systematic review indicate a relationship between depression, anxiety, stress, and PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. Therefore, it seems that paying attention to the mental health of postpartum women can be effective in  <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) emphasized the protective role of social support in physical behaviors and mental health, which affects PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>.</p><p>Postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs showed the most direct negative effect on PPWR. In Nuss et al. ( <ref type="formula">2007</ref>) study, women who maintained less than 5% of their gestational weight gain one year after delivery were more knowledgeable about nutrition than women whose gestational weight gain was equal to or more than 5% maintained <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. It is similar to the present study and explains the necessity of planning to assess and promote the nutritional awareness of women during pregnancy and postpartum to achieve the goal of reducing PPWR. On the other hand, there is a difference between what women are advised to eat, what they feel they should eat, and what they were reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref>. So this indicates the necessity of designing practical interventions to improve the practice of women in postpartum nutrition.</p><p>Access to postpartum care had both a direct positive and an indirect negative effect on PPWR. In other words, more access to the cyberspace of health systems and private centers showed an increase in PPWR. It may be due to spending too much time in cyberspace and the resulting lack of physical activity in these people leading to weight gain or preventing the expected weight loss after childbirth. Also, factors such as inadequate program content, unhealthy nutrition, or poor health behavior in private centers can justify the results of the present study. On the other hand, access to postpartum care indirectly reduces PPWR by affecting lifestyle. The total effect of this factor, which is the sum of the direct and indirect effects, is positive. So, the importance of the health system is further bolded in promoting the postpartum women's lifestyle and reducing PPWR.</p><p>Following intermediate determinants, indirectly affected the PPWR:  Women's lifestyles had the most indirect negative impact on PPWR. The effect of healthy eating and increased physical activity, as important components of lifestyle, on PPWR has been confirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. In a prospective cohort study, Siega-Riz et al. (2010) identified high-calorie intake and eating behavior disorders as predictors of postpartum overweight <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Therefore, it seems that due to the effect of physical activity and nutrition on PPWR, with proper health planning, postpartum women can be encouraged to increase physical activity and healthy eating to reduce their overweight. According to the model of the present study, women's lifestyle affects their stress and depression. In other words, a healthy postpartum lifestyle reduces stress and depression in women and has an indirect and negative effect on PPWR by affecting anxiety. Similarly, Van Dammen et al. <ref type="bibr">(2018)</ref>, in a systematic review and meta-analysis study, reported that lifestyle-related interventions in overweight/obese women of reproductive age reduce signs of depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>. Lifestyle factors can affect both physical and mental health, as high mortality diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, obesity, diabetes, and cancers are affected by lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref>.</p><p>Body satisfaction had an indirect and negative effect on PPWR. In other words, less satisfaction with the body was associated with more PPWR. Similarly, Phillips et al. (2014) reported that higher levels of body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months postpartum were associated with greater PPWR at nine months postpartum <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Hartley et al. (2017)</ref> reported in a systematic review that more weight in the postpartum period and a slow return to pre-pregnancy body size are associated with greater dissatisfaction with the body, but the mechanism of this association is still unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref>.</p><p>Social Support/Postpartum Social Support had an indirect and negative effect on PPWR. According to the present model, social support affects women's lifestyles. Some studies have reported the impact of social support on women's lifestyle after childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75]</ref>. Women with children report a lack of social support as a barrier to healthy eating and physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref>. The absence of a person such as a mother, friend, or other relatives of postpartum women to assist in child care, exercise, and nutrition is one of the main barriers that limit women's ability to maintain their proper function <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref>.</p><p>Unhealthy behaviors had an indirect and positive effect on PPWR. The impact of smoking as an unhealthy behavior has also been reported in the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kirkegaard et al. (2015)</ref>, in which women who quit smoking during pregnancy or up to 6 months after delivery were more likely to gain long-term weight than non-smokers, but this was not true for smoker women <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In other words, smoker women gained more weight than women who quit smoking, which this result is close to the results of the present study. In the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Levine et al. (2012)</ref>, women who continued to smoke for up to 24 weeks postpartum were more likely to be overweight than women who resumed smoking at six weeks postpartum, and this difference was statistically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>. In the present study, in addition to smoking, unhealthy behaviors include several other cases (use of hookah, drugs, alcohol, exposure to secondhand smoke), while most of the existing studies are mainly about the effect of smoking (or other unhealthy behaviors) on PPWR, that may justify differences in results.</p><p>Parity showed an indirect and positive effect on PPWR by affecting the pre-pregnancy BMI. Similarly, in Hill et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) systematic review and meta-analysis, parity was positively related to pre-pregnancy BMI and indirectly affected the PPWR by affecting the pre-pregnancy BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Many women with a normal BMI before their first pregnancy show an increase of more than half a unit in BMI during their second pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref>. It seems that each pregnancy leads to overweight in women, which increases cumulatively with increasing the number of pregnancies. In other words, more pregnancies are associated with higher pre-pregnancy BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and it causes an increase in PPWR.</p><p>Breastfeeding frequency showed an indirect negative effect on PPWR. In other words, the more frequent breastfeeding, the lower PPWR. In Krause et al. (2010) study, women with full or combination breastfeeding had less PPWR than women who had only formula-feeding six months after delivery. These researchers emphasized the negative effect of breastfeeding on PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>. In Ghobadi et al. 's (2017) study in Iran, formula-feeding was reported as a risk factor for maintaining overweight six months after delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>. It is similar to the present study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Neville et al. (2014)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref>, in a systematic review, and Lambrinou et al. (2019) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref>, in a review paper, reported that although some studies support the role of breastfeeding in reducing postpartum overweight, many studies are needed to achieve a reliable result.</p><p>Child hospitalization mean days showed an indirect and positive effect on PPWR. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kac et al. (2004)</ref> reported a significantly marginal association between child hospitalization with PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref>. Siega-Riz et al. (2010) study showed a positive effect of child hospitalization on PPWR. In other words, the child hospitalization by affecting factors such as maternal sleep indirectly affected the increase in PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, similar to the present study.</p><p>Postpartum women's quality of life indirectly affected the PPWR by affecting their lifestyle. The quality of life of postpartum women has been affected by social support. The effect of social support on quality of life has been confirmed in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>. Women need family support to adapt during the transition to parenthood. Social support reduces depression and acts as a link between stressors and care <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>. The Akbay &amp; Tasci-Duran (2018) study showed that spousal support is very significant in improving the quality of life of postpartum women <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>. In the present study, the effect of quality of life on PPWR was negative. In a way, the decline in quality of life was indirectly related to the increase in postpartum overweight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Goldstein et al. (2016)</ref> also reported that worse quality of life was associated with more PPWR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Improving the quality of life of postpartum women requires planning. As mentioned, postpartum women's quality of life is affected by social support, so paying attention to increasing their social support from husbands, family, and others can improve their quality of life and ultimately cause an impact on their lifestyle and reduce PPWR.</p><p>Overall, the results of the path analysis showed that structural determinants, including women's education and socioeconomic status, were indirectly related to PPWR through the effect on intermediate factors. Six intermediate determinants, including gestational weight gain, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep duration, anxiety, postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs, and access to postpartum care, directly affected the PPWR. Other determinants had an indirect effect on PPWR. Gestational weight gain had the most positive direct effect on PPWR. In other words, gestational weight gain was the highest predictor of PPWR in the study. This result, as mentioned earlier, has been reported in previous studies, and its control should be given special attention in health planning. Another important factor that had the most negative direct effect on PPWR was postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs. Women who had more knowledge about postpartum nutrition had less PPWR, which is a valuable finding in health planning. Also, stress had the most positive indirect, and lifestyle had the most negative indirect impact on PPWR. Therefore, paying attention to stress management and improving lifestyle will be very important and effective factors in controlling PPWR.</p><p>The strength of this study is using the WHO model in SDH as a complete model that measures multiple factors. Maybe some unknown or genetic factors that are difficult/impossible to evaluate correctly were not examined, which may be a limitation of the present study. Another limitation may be recording pre-pregnancy weight from the health records. It was due to the lack of access to participants before pregnancy. Considering this recorded weight is measured according to the instructions of the Ministry of Health of Iran by health personnel, it is reliable. Another limitation, due to the numerous factors predicting PPWR, is a large number of questions and the need to spend a relatively long time to answer. So, the questionnaires with the fewest items were designed, and some short-form questionnaires were used. Also, by submitting the online questionnaire, individuals were given enough time to complete the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The present study aimed to investigate the association between SDH and PPWR based on the WHO model. According to the results, social determinants of health (structural and intermediate) affect PPWR, confirming the hypotheses of this study. Gestational weight gain had the most positive direct effect, and postpartum nutritional awareness/beliefs had the most negative direct effects on PPWR. Also, stress had the most positive indirect, and lifestyle had the most negative indirect impact on PPWR. Therefore, to prevent or reduce PPWR, programs should be paid more attention to gestational weight gain and increase women's awareness about postpartum nutrition's effect on their weight. Also, counseling and interventional programs are suggested to control psychological factors such as stress/ anxiety and improve the postpartum lifestyle of women. Paying attention to the impact of socioeconomic status as a structural determinant is very important, and improving it certainly requires long-term macroeconomic and political policies. Usage of the present study findings is suggested to midwives and health providers to increase women's awareness about lifestyle, especially proper nutrition during pregnancy/postpartum, and to policymakers for long-term policies. Also, paying more attention to weight management, health, breastfeeding, and lifestyle is suggested to pregnant/ postpartum women; and more social support for them is suggested to their husbands and families.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Conceptual framework of the relationship between social determinants of health and postpartum weight retention</figDesc><graphic coords="4,262.67,136.25,117.62,311.66" type="bitmap" /></figure>
