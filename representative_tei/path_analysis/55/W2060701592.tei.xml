<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Microbes have complex metabolic pathways that can be investigated using biochemistry and functional genomics methods. One important technique to examine cell central metabolism and discover new enzymes is 13 C-assisted metabolism analysis 1. This technique is based on isotopic labeling, whereby microbes are fed with a 13 C labeled substrates. By tracing the atom transition paths between metabolites in the biochemical network, we can determine functional pathways and discover new enzymes.</p><p>As a complementary method to transcriptomics and proteomics, approaches for isotopomer-assisted analysis of metabolic pathways contain three major steps 2 . First, we grow cells with 13 C labeled substrates. In this step, the composition of the medium and the selection of labeled substrates are two key factors. To avoid measurement noises from non-labeled carbon in nutrient supplements, a minimal medium with a sole carbon source is required. Further, the choice of a labeled substrate is based on how effectively it will elucidate the pathway being analyzed. Because novel enzymes often involve different reaction stereochemistry or intermediate products, in general, singly labeled carbon substrates are more informative for detection of novel pathways than uniformly labeled ones for detection of novel pathways 3,<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">4</ref> . Second, we analyze amino acid labeling patterns using GC-MS. Amino acids are abundant in protein and thus can be obtained from biomass hydrolysis. Amino acids can be derivatized by N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (TBDMS) before GC separation. TBDMS derivatized amino acids can be fragmented by MS and result in different arrays of fragments. Based on the mass to charge (m/z) ratio of fragmented and unfragmented amino acids, we can deduce the possible labeled patterns of the central metabolites that are precursors of the amino acids. Third, we trace 13C carbon transitions in the proposed pathways and, based on the isotopomer data, confirm whether these pathways are active 2 . Measurement of amino acids provides isotopic labeling information about eight crucial precursor metabolites in the central metabolism. These metabolic key nodes can reflect the functions of associated central pathways.</p><p>13 C-assisted metabolism analysis via proteinogenic amino acids can be widely used for functional characterization of poorly-characterized microbial metabolism 1 . In this protocol, we will use Cyanothece 51142 as the model strain to demonstrate the use of labeled carbon substrates for discovering new enzymatic functions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Dissolve the dried samples with 150 μL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 150 μL of N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide derivatization reagent. 2. Incubate all samples in an oven or a water bath between 65 and 80°C for 1 hour. Vortex occasionally to make sure the metabolites in the vial are dissolved. 3. Centrifuge the samples at 20,000×g for 10 min, and then transfer the supernatant to new GC vials. The supernatant should be a clear and yellowish solution. Due to saturation of the detectors, GC-MS measurement accuracy can be affected by the high concentration of injected TBDMS derivatized amino acids (these samples often shows dark brown color), therefore, we should dilute these samples using THF before GC-MS measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">6</ref> . 4. Analyze the samples by GC-MS (use a 1:5 or 1:10 split ratio, injection volume = 1 μL, carrier gas helium = 1.2 mL/min). Use the following GC temperature program: hold at 150°C for 2 minutes, increase at 3°C per min to 280°C, increase at 20°C per min to 300°C, and then hold for 5 minutes. Solvent delay can be set as ~5 min (for a 30 meter GC column). The range of the mass to charge ratio (m/z) in MS can be set between 60 and 500.</p><p>1. TBDMS derivatized amino acid measurement can also be affected by isotope discrimination in GC separation. Light isotopes move slightly faster than heave isotopes in GC column. To reduce the potential measurement bias, we may average the mass spectrum of the whole amino acid peak range 6 2. The GC and MS spectra of TBDMS derivatized metabolites have been reported before <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">7</ref> . The GC retention time and the unique m/z peaks for each amino acid are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. 3. Derivatization of amino acids or central metabolites introduces significant amounts of naturally-labeled isotopes, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C (1.13%), <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">18</ref> O (0.20%), 29 Si (4.70%), and 30 Si (3.09%). The measurement noise from natural isotopes in the raw mass isotopomer spectrum can be corrected by using published software 5 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">8</ref> . The final isotopic labeling data are reported as mass fractions, e.g., M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4 (representing fragments containing zero to four <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C labeled carbons). 4. Measurement of amino acids can provide isotopic labeling information about eight crucial precursor metabolites: 2-oxo-glutarate, 3-P-glycerate, acetyl-CoA, erythrose-4-P, oxaloacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, and ribose-5-P. The labeling patterns in these metabolites can be used to identify several central metabolic pathways (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">9</ref> . The outcome of the labeling experiments can be further confirmed using other biochemistry methods (e.g., RT-PCR).</p><p>1. Entner-Doudoroff pathway: [1- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C] glucose can be used as the carbon source. If the pathway is active, serine labeling will be significantly lower than labeling in alanine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">10</ref> . 2. Branched TCA cycle: [1- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C] pyruvate can be used as the carbon source. If the TCA cycle is broken, aspartate can be labeled by two carbons, while glutamate is labeled with only one carbon 11 , 12 . 3. CO2 fixation by Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in a mixotrophic metabolism: Non-labeled CO2 and labeled carbon substrates are both used as the carbon sources. If Calvin cycle is functional, serine and histidine labeling will be significantly diluted, comparing to other amino acids. Such method can determine the relative CO2 fixation when organic carbon sources are present in the medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> . 4. Oxidative pentose phosphate pathway: [1- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C] glucose can be used as the carbon source. If the pathway is active, non-labeled alanine will be &gt;50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">12</ref> . 5. Anaplerotic pathway (e.g., PEP + CO2 à oxaloacetate): <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> CO2 and non-labeled carbon substrates (e.g., glycerol or pyruvate) can be used as the carbon source. If the pathway is active, aspartate labeling will be significantly enriched, comparing to alanine and serine <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> . 6. Re-citrate synthase: [1- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C] pyruvate can be used as the carbon source. If the enzyme is active, glutamate is labeled in β-carboxyl group 3 , 4 . 7. Citramalate pathway: [1-13 C] pyruvate, [2- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C] glycerol, or [1- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C] acetate can be used as the carbon source. If the pathway is active, leucine and isoleucine labeling amounts are identical <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14</ref> . 8. Serine-isocitrate lyase cycle: [1-13 C] pyruvate or [1- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C] lactate can be used as the carbon source. If the pathway is active, the third position carbon in serine will be labeled <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">15</ref> . 9. Utilization of nutrients (i.e., exogenous amino acids): a culture medium with fully labeled carbon substrates and non-labeled amino acids can be used. If the cells selectively utilize these supplemented non-labeled nutrients, we will see significant labeling dilution of these amino acids in the biomass. This method can be used to investigate which nutrient supplements are preferred by the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">16</ref> .</p><p>medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">22</ref> with 54 mM glycerol (2-13C, &gt;98%). Cyanothece 51142 utilizes 2 nd position labeled glycerol as the main carbon source. We observe that threonine and alanine have one labeled carbon, while isoleucine is labeled with three carbons. Therefore, synthesis in Cyanothece 51142 cannot be derived from the threonine route employed by most organisms (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). On the other hand, leucine and isoleucine have identical labeling patterns based on fragment (M-15) + and fragment (M-159) + . For example, the isotopomer data from [M-15] + (containing unfragmented amino acids) show identical labeling for leucine (M0=0.01, M1=0.03, M2=0.21, M3=0.69) and isoleucine (M0=0.01, M1=0.03, M2=0.24, M3=0.67). Thus leucine and isoleucine must be synthesized from the same precursors (i.e., pyruvate and acetyl-CoA). This observation is consistent with the labeled carbon transition in the citramalate pathway for isoleucine synthesis. To confirm this pathway, we search the Joint Genome Institute database and find the presence of a citramalate synthase CimA (cce_0248) in Cyanothece.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Labeling transitions in isoleucine pathways in Cyanothece 51142 (modified from our previous paper) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">21</ref> .</p><p>This protocol consists of feeding the cell with a labeled substrate and measuring the resulting isotopic labeling patterns in the amino acids via GC-MS. Since MS data (m/z ratios) give just the overall amount of labeling of MS ions, we have to assess the isotopomer distributions of amino acids by examining the m/z ratios of both unfragmented (M-57) + and fragmented amino acids (i.e., (M-159) + and (f302) + ). Furthermore, we can perform several cell cultures with a chemically identical medium but substrates that have different labeling patterns (1 st position labeled, 2 nd position labeled, etc.). The labeling information about metabolites from these experiments can be integrated to decode the actual carbon transition routes through the central metabolic pathways.</p><p>For pathway analysis, the choice of a labeled substrate is important. In general, singly labeled carbon substrates are easier to use in tracing the fate of the labeled carbon when <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C percolates through central pathways, while multiple-carbon labeled substrates may confound carbon tracing. Also, singly labeled substrates are more informative to elucidate unique molecule structures in metabolites than uniformly labeled substrates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">4</ref> For example, the (Re)-type citrate synthase shows different reaction stereochemistry from normal citrate synthase, and thus causes citrate to have different molecular chirality. On the other hand, substrates are different in their suitability to detect their associated pathways. Glucose is best for detecting the split ratio between the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, while pyruvate or acetate are best for analyzing the TCA cycle and some amino acid pathways. Therefore, it is necessary to use different substrates to investigate the overall picture of cell metabolisms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

For leucine and isoleucine, the (M-57)+ was overlapped by other mass peaks. We suggest using fragment (M-15)+ to analyze the entire amino acid labeling. The (f302)+ group is detected in most amino acids, which contains only the first (α-carboxyl group) and second carbons in an amino acid backbone.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="13" xml:id="foot_0"><p>C-isotope labeling is a useful technique for determining functional pathways in microorganisms. However, this technique has several limitations. First, it is suited only for analysis of carbon metabolism using organic substrates, as it cannot directly resolve metabolism in autotrophic metabolisms if CO2 is used as the sole carbon source. Autotrophic cultures using CO2 label all amino acids to the same extent as the input 12 CO2/ 13 CO2 mixture<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">23</ref> . This makes pathway analysis difficult, as metabolism analysis has to be inferred from a rearrangement of<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C carbons in metabolites by different metabolic pathways. Second, this paper presents solely qualitative results discriminating between "active" and "non-active" pathways. Precise quantification of metabolism requires a sophisticated modeling approach (i.e.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C-MFA) to decipher metabolic fluxes from isotopomer data. Third, the scope of<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C-metabolism analysis is limited by technical challenges in determining low abundance and unstable metabolites. Broader metabolic network can be probed by analyzing free metabolites besides amino acids. Measurement of free metabolites requires both highly-efficient metabolite extraction methods and highly-sensitive analytical platforms. LC-MS, FT-ICR MS, and CE-MS have been used for identifying the labeling patterns of free metabolites, and provide more insight into cell metabolisms 2 . Fourth,<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C-assisted pathway analysis is best done in minimal medium, because addition of non-labeled nutrient supplements leads to falsely lower labeling concentrations and make quantitative<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> C-MFA studies not so straightforward. Also, cells may utilize exogenous amino acids extensively for protein synthesis, and thus give very weak labeling signals for these proteinogenic amino acids<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">24</ref> . If a rich medium is required to grow cells, measurement of intracellular metabolites, instead of amino acids, can effectively reduce the interference in labeling data that arises from exogenous non-labeled carbon nutrients.</p></note>
