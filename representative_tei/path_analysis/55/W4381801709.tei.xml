<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The study explores the mediating effect of teacher's empowerment on the relationship between instructional leadership (IL) to teacher's organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) toward student, teammembers, and school. 395 Israeli teachers completed PIMRS, SPES, OCB, and demographic questionnaire. Path analysis showed a good fit of the data to the theoretical model. Teacher's empowerment is a partial mediator for OCB toward student and school; and a full mediator for OCB toward team-members. Teacher's OCB is crucial for schools' effectivity, therefore identifying empowerment as a full mediator for OCB toward team-members may assist improving teamwork, especially through IL.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) in schools addresses teachers' voluntary extra-role behaviors which contribute to students, team-members, and school. Teachers' OCB toward students promotes academic achievements and emotional and social wellbeing. Teachers' OCB toward team-members, is expressed by sharing teaching materials, experience, and support. Teachers' OCB toward school, contains organizing projects and helping school enterprises <ref type="bibr">(Somech &amp; Drach-Zahavy, 2000)</ref>. Teachers' OCB is essential to schools' performance and improvement, as seen in past research regarding students' academic achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rezaaveisi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu et al., 2022)</ref>, teaching innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Khan et al., 2020)</ref>, teachers' turnover intentions <ref type="bibr">(Bukhari &amp; Kamal, 2019)</ref> job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Singh &amp; Singh, 2019)</ref>, organizational effectiveness <ref type="bibr">(Kumari &amp; Thapliyal, 2017)</ref> as well as teachers' instructional quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bellibaş et al., 2021)</ref>. These behaviors are motivated by personal and situational factors as well as school leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abu Nasra, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005)</ref> propose that the individual social perceptions effect his attitudes which lead him to behave in specific manner. In line with this theory the current study suggests that teacher's perception of principal's IL will elevate teacher's attitudes of empowerment which in turn will lead to teacher's OCB. While some research addressed OCB regarding individual and organization levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Somech, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Somech &amp; Drach-Zahavy, 2004)</ref>, little attention was given to the three dimensions model that include students, team-members, and the organization <ref type="bibr">(Somech &amp; Drach-Zahavy, 2000)</ref>. The current study analyzes each of the dimensions separately.</p><p>Teacher's perception of school principals' leadership has a dominant influence of teachers' OCB. The academic literature gives much attention to the relationships between OCB and transformational <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jha, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Khalili, 2017)</ref>, transactional (Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Raftar-Ozery, 2018), participative <ref type="bibr">(Bogler &amp; Somech, 2005)</ref>, servant <ref type="bibr">(Van der Hoven et al., 2021)</ref> and authentic leadership styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Joo &amp; Jo, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Little attention was given to the relationship between IL and OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dutta &amp; Sahney, 2022)</ref>. IL is unique to school environment and focuses on pedagogical issues regarding school's mission; handling the instructional programme; and facilitating positive school-learning climate <ref type="bibr">(Hallinger &amp; Murphy, 1985)</ref>. IL promote students' academic achievements <ref type="bibr">(Alam &amp; Ahmad, 2017)</ref>; teachers' self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zheng et al., 2019)</ref>, job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref>, and reduce the intent to leave their profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Qadach et al., 2020)</ref>. It also promotes school processes such as professional learning community <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zheng et al., 2019)</ref>, supportive school culture, teacher's collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref>, communal teacher efficacy, and schools' united vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Qadach et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Studies have also looked for mediating mechanism of the relationships between schools' leadership and OCB, focusing on teachers' empowerment as an important mediating factor <ref type="bibr">(Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Newman et al., 2017)</ref>. Teachers' empowerment consists of participation in decision making, autonomy, opportunities for professional growth, impact, status, and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Short &amp; Rinehart, 1992)</ref>. Teachers' empowerment was found to influence OCB (Tindowen, 2019), and to be influenced by IL <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Zahed-Babelan et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The aim of the current research is to expand the scope of research regarding the mediating effect of empowerment between IL that lies in the heart of educational deed and OCB. Moreover, the differentiation between OCB dimensions enables schools to promote students, teamwork, and the organization each, using precise suitable mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>Teachers' OCB is an important component of school efficacy <ref type="bibr">(Kumari &amp; Thapliyal, 2017)</ref>. Schools' low budgeting, teaching's low occupational status, parents' demands from teachers and 21st-century technological and sociological challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nir et al., 2016)</ref> bring teachers' unpaid over-role activity regarding students, team-members, and school to be crucial for schools' success. School leadership is a main resource for schools' conduct and plays a major role in creating educational, and organizational success <ref type="bibr">(Leithwood et al., 2020)</ref>. One of its unique aspects is IL which put schools' pedagogical vision; coordinating, monitoring, and evaluating curriculum instruction and assessment; and promoting a learning climate in the center of school's action <ref type="bibr">(Hallinger &amp; Murphy, 1985)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB)</head><p>OCB is a concept that appeared in the 1980's and belong to the field of organizational psychology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Podsakoff et al., (2000)</ref> explains that the term OCB emerged from earlier definitions of "willingness to cooperate" and the distinction between behaviors that are based on role description and behaviors that are spontaneous and innovative. OCB is characterized as employees' helpful behaviors that assist the organization yet are not included in the worker's job definition and are not directly or literally recognized by the formal reward system <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Organ, 1988)</ref>. OCB is important for any organization, but it is essential for schools. Low budgets and salaries, multiple and repetitive educational reforms (Arar &amp; Nasra, 2019), parental involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shaheen et al., 2016)</ref> and social-technological changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kim &amp; Gatling, 2019)</ref> bring schools to rely on teachers' OCB. <ref type="bibr">Somech &amp; Drach-Zahavy (2000)</ref> describe teachers' OCB in three levels: student level, team level, and organizational level. These levels have been examined as a united variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kouchi et al., 2016)</ref> and as three independent dimensions <ref type="bibr">(Somech &amp; Bogler, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>OCB is connected to students' positive outcomes such as:</p><p>students' learning <ref type="bibr">(Sun &amp; Leithwood, 2015)</ref>, academic achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Khalid et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rezaaveisi, 2018)</ref>, satisfaction (including its general definition and its aspects of student-teacher relations), feeling of accomplishment at school, appreciation of the schooling ability to contribute to future opportunity, and student's degrees of schoolrelated psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jimmieson et al., 2010)</ref>. Teachers' OCB is connected to teachers' positive outcomes such as: teaching innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Khan et al., 2020)</ref>, job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Singh &amp; Singh, 2019)</ref>, commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bogler &amp; Somech, 2004)</ref>, intrinsic teachers' job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zeinabadi, 2010)</ref> and sense of empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Joo &amp; Jo, 2017)</ref>. Special attention was given to OCB's dimensions and showed that self-efficacy was positively connected to OCB toward teammembers and the organization yet they were not related to OCB toward students <ref type="bibr">(Somech &amp; Drach-Zahavy, 2000)</ref>. Moreover, teachers' professional commitment is related only to OCB toward students <ref type="bibr">(Somech &amp; Bogler, 2002)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">and</formula><p>OCB predictors also include organizational factors such as: ethical climate (Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Raftar-Ozery, 2018), trust <ref type="bibr">(Choong et al., 2019)</ref> and organizational justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Singh &amp; Singh, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>It was also connected to OCB's dimensions showing that collective teachers' efficacy was found to be connected in a positive way only to OCB toward team-members <ref type="bibr">(Somech &amp; Drach-Zahavy, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>School leadership is one of the main predictors for teachers' OCB. Several leadership styles were identified as contributing to OCB.</p><p>Authentic leadership predicts teachers' OCB through teachers' job empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Joo &amp; Jo, 2017)</ref> and psychological empowerment (Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Tsemach, 2014) and was found to have a direct effect also on a collective perception level (Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Tsemach, 2014). Transformational leadership predicts teachers' OCB through teachers' job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nasra &amp; Heilbrunn, 2016)</ref> and psychological empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jha, 2014)</ref>. Transactional leadership (Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Raftar-Ozery, 2018) and spiritual leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kaya, 2015)</ref> promote teachers' OCB. Participative leadership predicts instructional leadership and teachers' organizational citizenship behavior… 341 teachers' OCB through affective trust in the supervisor <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Miao et al., 2014)</ref> and teachers' commitment <ref type="bibr">(Bogler &amp; Somech, 2005)</ref>. IL was found to promote teachers' OCB through social and affective school climate, yet mediation through empowerment was not examined. In accordance with previous research this research comes to explore the role of teacher's empowerment as a mediating factor in the connection between IL and teacher's OCB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Teacher's Psychological Empowerment and Their OCB</head><p>Beyond the statistical relationship between teacher's OCB to empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Tsemach, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ghalavi &amp; Nastiezaie, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Joo &amp; Jo, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Singh &amp; Singh, 2019)</ref> it is important to understand the mechanism that foster this relationship. Psychological empowerment is an inner process that employees develop in pursue of meaning and power. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Singh &amp; Singh (2019)</ref> explain that psychological empowerment brings employees to be proactive and creative on a personal level as well as connected and involved in the organization. This mechanism direct employee's behavior to actively do more than they are required for the benefit of the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Principal's IL and Teacher's OCB</head><p>Further theoretical look, above the statistical connection between principal's IL and teacher's OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dutta &amp; Sahney, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Karyadi &amp; Wahyu, 2022)</ref>, is needed. IL is a unique kind of leadership that puts professional concerns and abilities as a central issue. Principal's professionality that is coined into the organizational processes present the principal as a role model to the teachers. This motivates teachers to increase their professionality development through extra-role behavior expressed in innovative teaching, promoting student's learning, and making the school a better academic institute <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Karyadi &amp; Wahyu, 2022)</ref>. This mechanism inspires teachers to develop professionally through operation in the classes and in school. Another possible explanation could be conceptualized by the Social Exchange</p><p>Theory suggesting that principal's investment in professional resources of the teacher, bring the teacher to give back more personal resources exciding his job description <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berkovich &amp; Bogler, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructional Leadership (IL)</head><p>IL is a unique leadership style that exists only in educational systems. Its importance is based on the focus it gives to pedagogy. This focus is essential for schools due to its first and foremost goal of educating students. IL has been defined by <ref type="bibr">Hallinger &amp; Murphy (1985)</ref> in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Parlar &amp; Cansoy, 2017)</ref>, professional learning communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zheng et al., 2019)</ref> collective teacher efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Qadach, et al., 2020)</ref> school learning effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bellibaş, et al., 2020)</ref> and open school climate (Boyce &amp; Bowers, 2018). IL is reducing teacher's intentions to leave teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Qadach, et al., 2020)</ref>. It Is also positively connected to teachers' job satisfaction, organizational and professional commitment (Alam &amp; <ref type="bibr">Ahmad, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dou et al., 2017)</ref>, self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hallinger et al., 2018)</ref>, teachers' instructional practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bellibaş, et al., 2020)</ref>, teachers' ICT implementation (Chen, 2013), OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dutta &amp; Sahney, 2022)</ref>, and empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mina, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Zahed-Babelan et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>

In order to examine whether teachers' empowerment mediates the relationship between principals' instructional leadership and teachers' OCB toward students, team-members and school, a path analysis was preformed using R software (lavaan package). The path analysis is displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> and in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and demonstrates that teachers' empowerment predicts the three components of teachers' OCB, while principals' IL predicts teachers' OCB toward students and teachers' OCB toward schools but not teachers' OCB toward teammembers. Moreover, principals' IL predicts teachers' empowerment.</p><p>Finally, teachers' empowerment was found to mediate the relationship between principals' IL to the three components of teachers' OCB.</p><p>Higher perception of IL brings to higher teachers' empowerment, and higher teachers' empowerment brings to higher teachers' OCB toward students, team-members and school.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The study's purpose was to explore the mediating role of teacher's empowerment in the relation between teacher's perception of IL and teacher's OCB toward students, team-members, and school. This purpose highlights the importance of distinction of the OCB dimensions that effect school participants in different manners. As well as exploration teachers' psychological as a mediator between principals' IL and teachers' OCB, which was not studied so far.</p><p>Teachers' OCB is the voluntary, unpaid tasks, teachers take upon themselves in schools, which is important to school success, especially due school conditions of low budgeting <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shaked, 2016)</ref>, educational reforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nir et al., 2016)</ref>, competition with other schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Klein &amp; Shimoni-Hershkoviz, 2016)</ref>, and teachers' role modeling responsibility. OCB is also important to school due to its implications on students learning and achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jimmieson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Khalid et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rezaaveisi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sun &amp; Leithwood, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">), teachers' wellbeing (Chiang &amp; Hsieh, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Khan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Singh &amp; Singh, 2019)</ref> and to school successes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DiPaola &amp; Tschannen-Moran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kumari &amp; Thapliyal, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>One of the mechanisms that elicit teachers' OCB is conceptualized in the TPB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005)</ref>, which assumes that social perceptions affect the individuals' attitudes, which shapes individuals' behavior. In the school environment, principals have the power to shape the social perceptions to influence teachers' attitudes and bring teachers to behave in a useful manner to school.</p><p>This study suggests that IL, which promotes teaching and learning by principals' involvement in school pedagogy <ref type="bibr">(Hallinger &amp; Murphy, 1985)</ref> and is a powerful tool to elicit school norms of professionality will, in turn, enhance teacher's empowered attitudes toward their abilities to influence the school and promote their professionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bogler &amp; Somech 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2005)</ref>. These attitudes will lead teachers to volunteer to fulfill school missions and goals in preforming OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Tsemach, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The study's findings support its hypotheses, identifying teachers' empowerment as a mediator between principals' IL and teachers' OCB. The findings support the importance of educational leadership role in enhancing teachers' effective behavior through the mechanism of empowerment. The results regarding the mediating role of empowerment between principals' IL and teacher's OCB are in line with other leadership styles such as authentic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gill et al., 2017)</ref> and transformational leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jha, 2014)</ref>. This study's unique contribution pertains to the distinction of the different OCB dimensions. OCB toward students and toward the school were directly influenced by teacher's perception of principals' IL, but not fully mediated by empowerment, only teacher's OCB toward team-members was fully mediated by empowerment.</p><p>Separation of the three levels of OCB can refine and produce working mechanisms that will allow optimal function of each level of OCB.</p><p>The study sheds light on the optimal mechanism to reach OCB toward team-members with showing full mediation. These results may be useful for school principals, who can promote teachers' OCB toward team-members by preforming IL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berkovich &amp; Bogler (2021)</ref> stresses the importance of positive leadership on teacher's connection to and identification with school, which can be expressed in OCB. They explain that this mechanism operates through socio-affective and psychological capital resources of the teacher, as found in the current research. In practice principals shape and communicate the school's pedagogical goals. They manage and coordinates instructional curriculum, programs, and teachers' evaluation, and promote positive school-learning climate. These behaviors enhance teachers' empowerment by creating greater involvement in schools' decisions, promoting their influence, status, self-efficacy, and autonomy, and creating routes for professional growth. This process is meaningful to schools' performance, especially regarding the need of OCB toward team-members, which enhances teachers' coordination, team-learning <ref type="bibr">(Islam et al., 2016)</ref>, open organizational climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DiPaola &amp; Tschannen-Moran, 2001)</ref> and better initiation processes. The research findings could contribute to the general scholarly body of knowledge by putting emphasis on professionality and its importance to increasing psychological capital, which in return expend the borders of teamwork and collegiality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The study's purpose was to explore teacher's empowerment as a mediator between teacher's perception of principals' IL and teachers' OCB. Two issues stood at the heart of the current research. One handled the lack of knowledge concerning principals' IL connection to teachers' OCB through teachers' empowerment. The finding displays OCB. The second issue dealt with OCBs' dimensions. While OCB toward students can be regarded as an inherent part of a teacher's position, OCB toward the school is a harder aim for principals to obtain; even harder is promoting OCB toward team-members. The finding shows that IL, through empowerment, can bring teachers to share and elevate their work together. By addressing these two issues and combining the insights driven from them, schools can achieve better organizational and pedagogical climates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Policymakers around the world and in Israel understand the importance of IL. This understanding has brought awareness to the term itself and its assimilation into principals training programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Shaked et al., 2020)</ref>. Still, further assimilation is needed, especially among experienced principals that were not exposed to IL skills in their initial training. Expansion of IL training to the growing interim school leadership groups, could also be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Shaked &amp; Benoliel, 2019)</ref>. Continued research dealing with IL implication should be an important target of policymaker and researcher.</p><p>OCB should be addressed as a three-dimensional variable as opposed to one-dimensional variable. This viewpoint could help principals develop precise advance school processes. These kinds of processes can promote all levels of schools' participants, that will facilitate school improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research Directions</head><p>The current research is not free of limitations. Firstly, using a convenience sampling, which is non-randomized sampling calls for caution with generalization of findings. Data was gathered only from teachers; other position holders in school or educational system were not included in the sample. Taking these limitations under consideration calls for replication of this research with an attempt to overcome their influence in order to have a wider comprehension of the effect of the mediating role of teachers' empowerment in the relationship between IL and teachers' OCB. The issue of IL is shadowed by different leadership styles, regarding educational leadership. Giving a bigger emphasis to IL by exploring its' influence on teachers' behavior, such as absenteeism or lateness is an important additional research direction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>He further constructs the term based on comparison and encompassing leading definitions in seven components of OCB: individual initiative, civic virtue, and selfdevelopment.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>job performance (Chiang &amp; Hsieh, 2012). Teachers' OCB is negatively connected to turnover intentions (Bukhari &amp; Kamal, 2019). Moreover, teachers' OCB is positively connected to school outcomes such as: organizational effectiveness (Kumari &amp; Thapliyal, 2017), team innovation (Somech &amp; Khotaba, 2017) and open school climate (DiPaola &amp; Tschannen-Moran, 2001). Due to OCB positive effects, much academic attention was given to its predictors' identification. OCB predictors include personal factors such as: self-efficacy (Choong et al., 2019), organizational</figDesc></figure>

Teachers' empowerment has been conceptualized by<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Short &amp; Rinehart (1992)</ref> in a six-dimensional model including: Participation in decision making that refers to important decisions that affect teachers' work directly and indirectly. Autonomy that refers to teachers' feeling of control over different aspects of their work. Professional growth that refers to teachers' perception of professionally developmental opportunities such as academic learning or skills expansion during schoolwork. Impact that refers to teachers' need to influence the teaching and learning process and receiving feedback from superiors. Status that refers to professional respect from team-members. Self-efficacy is the feeling of mastery, competence and believe that one has the skills to perform his job.Techers' empowerment is associated with teachers' positive outcomes like, pursuing managerial promotion (Avidov-Ungar &amp; Arviv-Elyashiv, 2018), job satisfaction (Amoli &amp; Youran, 2014), organizational and professional commitment<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bogler, 2005)</ref>, and OCB<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahmad et al., 2014;</ref> Tindowen, 2019).Teachers' empowerment is associated with principals' empowering behaviors(Lee &amp; Nie, 2014). It mediates the relationship between a principal's leadership style and teachers' outcomes like in the case of entrepreneurial leadership and school effectiveness<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dahiru et al., 2017)</ref>, transformational leadership and organizational commitment(Avolio et al., 2004)  and authentic leadership and OCB<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gill et al., 2017)</ref>. Principal's IL and Teacher's OCB According to the Theory of Planed Behavior (TPB)<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005)</ref> people's behavior is a result of their intention to behave the way they do. The intention of a behavior is driven from people's attitudes toward that behavior and their perception of important others' attitudes toward that behavior. This conceptual model is used in educational context especially for explanations of teachers' behaviors(Bakari, et al., 2017). toward it and perceptions of others toward it, was expended focusing on attitudes and perceptions that are related to the behavior under concern. Evidence to such model can be seen in the work of Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Benoliel (2018) that studied the mediating effect of nurse's attitudes toward empowerment between nurse's perception of manager authentic (moral) leadership and OCB, tardiness, absenteeism, and leaving intentions. This model has been used also in educational context in the work of Buskila &amp; Chen-Levi (2021) regarding teacher's perceptions of principals' authentic leadership promoting emotional intelligence attitudes resulting in teacher's wellbeing behaviors. Shapira-Lishchinsky and Tsemach (2014) also used this model to explore teacher's perceptions of principals' authentic leadership, promoting their attitudes toward empowerment resulting in teacher's OCB. In the light of TPB, teacher's positive perceptions of IL will promote positive attitudes toward empowerment that will facilitate OCB. The proposed model describes mediating effect of teacher's empowerment on the relationship between teacher's perceptions of IL of the schools' principal and teacher's OCB. The study comes to expand the academic knowledge about IL, by exploring its connection to OCB; and to develop a wider vision of teacher's OCB regarding students, team-members, and school through processes of teacher's empowerment. Accordingly, the study hypotheses presented in Figure 1 and were: H1: Teacher's perception of principals' IL will be positively related to teachers' sense of empowerment. 8(2), June 2023, 335-371 346 H2: Teacher's sense of empowerment will be positively related to teacher's OCB, toward students (H2a), toward team-members (H2b), and toward school (H2c). H3: Teacher's sense of empowerment will mediate the relationship between teacher's perception of principals' IL and teacher's OCB, toward students (H3a), toward team-members (H3b), and toward school (H3c).</figDesc></figure>
