<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Organizational Citizenship Behavior is extra-role behavior or also called OCB <ref type="bibr">(Harper, 2015)</ref>. Employees should work without coercive and voluntary in organization to realize the organization's vision and mission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Waspodo and Minadaniati (2012)</ref> said that employees have a willingness to do more than their formal responsibilities; this willingness is then known as OCB. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ahmad and Tanzin (2016)</ref> suggest OCB is a form of voluntary activity from organizations members to support organizational functions. OCB arises from basic policies of company to do voluntarily and there is no coercion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Andriani, 2012)</ref>. OCB can also be defined as informal help and directly do not relate to individual competence in payroll system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ariani, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Newstrom &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Davis (1996)</ref> defined Organizational Climate as a human environment relates to employees in organizations where they work; organizational climate can foster employee morale and increase OCB. The organizational climate will determine how the company carries out its duties and responsibilities consistent with procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Purwanti and Nurhayati, 2016)</ref>. The organizational change has a strong effect on teamwork. Organization attention employees work problems through constructive relationships with work requirements can provide a positive environment for employees to rise OCB behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Prihatsanti and Dewi, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Meylandani (2013)</ref> showed a strong relationship between organizational climate and OCB.</p><p>Motivation is a process as an initial step to act to achieve certain goals. Work motivation can become a driving force for humans to do their duties and responsibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ek and Elegwa, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zabielske et al (2015)</ref> said that employees whose the needs are not met can become motivation to meet their needs. OCB is also needed by work motivation. <ref type="bibr">Abuiyada and Shih (2012)</ref> said that motivation can be interpreted as a force from inside or outside and spirit to achieve the desire. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nandan and Abdul (2015)</ref> said that Organizational justice is the concept of perceptions about their organization, and how these perceptions affect employee loyalty to organization. Unfair or injustice treatment not only reduces work performance but also reduces the quality of work and cooperation between workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Awang and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Wan, 2015 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Tahseen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Muhammad, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Oge et al. (2014)</ref> said that the fair concept contains several things; companies should be concern as work division, wage, award, treatment, and other things that determine the quality of interactions within company. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fatimah et al (2011)</ref> stated that organizational justice is the result of approved individual subjective perceptions by others around him. Fair and consistent superiors to each subordinate will create a positive perception to justice and will increase their satisfaction and commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rohyani, 2014)</ref>. A fair development process is important to consider <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ratnawati and Khairul, 2013)</ref>. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sanhaji et al (2016)</ref> showed a positive relationship between organizational justice and OCB. In addition, OCB positively affect distributive, procedural and interaction justice.</p><p>Problems related to organizational climate in CV.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demography analysis</head><p>The demographic profile of 50 respondents show that majority age is between 20-29 years (52%), classified as young. The male respondents were higher than women with a ratio of 64% compared to 36%. Most of respondents received a final education at Bachelor level (S1) of 54% and longest tenure was between 1-2 years at 28%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics Analysis</head><p>The distribution frequency score of all variables show high average. Therefore, hypothesis H6 that motivation has a significant effect on performance is accepted. 7. The t test result for the effect of Organizational Justice on Performance has coefficient value of 0.259 and significance level of 0.043 &lt;0.05. Therefore, hypothesis H7 that Organizational Justice has a significant effect on Performance is accepted.</p><p>The mediation effect can be calculated by Sobel test to sum the direct effects plus indirect effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baron and Kenny, 1986)</ref>. The mediation role is accepted if the total effect is greater than the direct effect. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> shows that the effect of Organizational Climate, Motivation, and Organizational Justice on Performance through Organizational Citizenship Behavior as an intervening variable have total effect is greater than the direct effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that Organizational Citizenship Behavior can mediate the Effect of Organizational Climate, Motivation, Organizational Justice on Performance that (H8, H9 and H10 are accepted).</p></div>
