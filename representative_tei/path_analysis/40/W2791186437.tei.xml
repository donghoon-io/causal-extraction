<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PT. Aneka Regalindo is engaging companies in furniture manufacturing that have experienced a decline in production output significantly over last 10 years. This decline has caused a decrease in productivity and employee performance. There is also a gap between the standards of compensation, job satisfaction, and job motivation. The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of job satisfaction and job motivation towards performance through organisational commitment. The method of this research study is explanative and quantitative. The finding results in addition to path analysis have concluded that job satisfaction does not influence performance</head><p>through organisational commitment. Separately, job motivation has an influence towards performance through the organisational commitment of the production department.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>An important factor in optimising human resources that needs attention is performance. There are many factors that affect employee performance such as motivation, job satisfaction, stress level, the physical conditions of the work, the compensation system, job design, commitment, economic aspects, technical and other behavioural aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref>. PT. Aneka Regalindo is a company that produces 3 types of furniture consisting of rattan, wood, and aluminium with a large production capacity.</p><p>Many factors affect employee performance. The internal factors include intellectual ability, job discipline, job satisfaction and job motivation and the external factors include leadership style, job environment, compensation and the management system contained in the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Employees who do not get job satisfaction and job motivation will usually have a low morale, often daydreaming and suffering from fatigue and boredom, unstable emotions, frequent absences and busy activities that have nothing in relation to their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p><p>This can be observed from the data of the recapitulation of presence summary of Production Department PT. Aneka Regalindo Unit Rattan in There is also data about the labour turn-over PT. Aneka Regalindo's rattan unit can be considered to be quite low as seen in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>  The labour turnover data related to the low job satisfaction and job motivation is usually due to a lack of vibrance, laziness, slowness and making mistakes and other negatives such as absenteeism, late entry to work and other things that affect employee performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The method of this research was explanative and quantitative. The quantitative explanative method is used to explain a generalisation, to explain the relationship of one variable with other variables, and to test the hypothesis in exploratory research using inferential statistics <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The sampling technique used is total sampling because of the amount of production department employees of PT. Aneka Regalindo rattan unit being 97 people. The conceptual definitions in this study are described as the following: job satisfaction, job motivation, performance and organisational commitment. This research used a validity test and reliability test <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The research hypothesis are the following: H1 = There is an influence of job satisfaction towards organisational commitment H2 = There is an influence of job motivation towards organisational commitment H3 = There is an influence of job satisfaction towards performance H4 = There is an influence of job motivation towards performance H5 = There is an influence of organisational commitment toward performance</p><p>The research instrument used in this research is based on the theory of job satisfaction, job motivation, performance and organisational commitment as a research variable. The data analysis techniques used are the classical assumption test and path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>Performance is the result of the work performed by employees in an organisation in accordance with predetermined standards of success that have been determined by the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref>. Performance can be measured through five dimensions: 1) Quality; 2) Quantity; 3) Knowledge and skills; 4) Timeliness and 5) Communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job Satisfaction</head><p>Job satisfaction is one of the most important factors to get optimal work results <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref>. Job satisfaction is a measure of sustainable human development process within an organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. The theory of Work Adjustment's development model measures 20 dimensions, which explains the needs of specific elements or specific amplifier conditions that are important in creating job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, the researchers only used 10 dimensions to suit the needs of the stuudy. The factors include: <ref type="bibr">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job Motivation</head><p>Motivation is a form of encouragement that exists in a person. The impetus comes from internal factors as well as external factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[10]</ref>. The key to understanding the process of motivation is within and is the link between needs, drivers and incentives <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. The motivation is divided into two, namely internal and external. Internal motivation occurs when a person wants something, then he will try to perform a certain activity so that what he wants to be achieved can be, which includes (1.) Achievements; (2.) Recognition; (3.) Responsibility; (5.) Growth or the possibility to grow and (6.) Work Itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[13]</ref>.</p><p>External factors arise when the individual does activities that get reciprocity from the outside to achieve their goals, which is influenced by (1.) Company policies and administration;</p><p>(2.) Supervision; (3.) Wages, salaries or other benefits including incentives; (4.) Interpersonal relationships; (5.) Status; (6.) Job security and (7) Working conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organisational Commitment</head><p>Organisational commitment is a sense of identification, involvement, and loyalty expressed by an employee to the organisation shown through the attitude and willingness of a person towards a relatively strong company. They will also strive to achieve the organisational goals. The components of organisational commitment dimensions that can be measured includes (1) Affective commitment; (2.) Continuance commitment and (3.) Normative commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation</head><p>Based on the analysis results, the findings can be shown within the below figure of a path diagram:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>After data processing with the statistical method and analysis, this research has yielded the following conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Job Satisfaction Towards Organisational Commitment</head><p>The influence of job satisfaction toward organisational commitment is not significant with a value of 0,021 (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>); the first hypothesis is not proven. This is opposed to the theories about the influence of job satisfaction towards organisational commitment:"High job satisfaction contributes to organizational comitment..." <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> and "another factor that can affect performance is employee job satisfaction as defined below, employee job satisfaction is fulfilled or not their desire to work...." <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Job Motivation Towards Organisational Commitment</head><p>The influence of job motivation toward organisational commitment is significant with a value of 0,301 (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>);the second hypothesis is proven. This fits with the theories about the influence of job motivation towards organisational commitment. "Implementation of the overall job motivation program successful positively affect to worker's commitment" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[16]</ref>. And "theoretically that the job motivation is the driving force that resulted in an organization member willing to mobilize the ability in the form of skills and skills, energy and time to organize various activities that are their responsibility and fulfill their obligation in order to achieve the various organizational goals that have been predetermined..." <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Job Satisfaction Towards Performance</head><p>The influence of job satisfaction towards performance is significant with a value of 0,237 (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>); the third hypothesis is proven. This fits with the theories about the influence of job satisfaction towards performance: "......the performance was divided into two parts, namely in role and extra role performance where in role performance is the performance that affect (antecedent) job satisfaction while the performance role was the performance which has influenced by job satisfaction therefore the opinion of previous researcher on whether job satisfaction was influenced or affect the performance considered depending on which performance correctly ......" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Job Motivation Towards Performance</head><p>The influence of job motivation towards performance is significant with a value of 0,296 (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>); the forth hypothesis is proven. This fits with the theories about the influence of job motivation towards performance: "......job motivation had a significant effect to employee performance where It was showing that the increased of job motivation will improve employee performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of Organisational Commitment Towards Performance</head><p>The influence of organisational commitment towards performance is significant with a value of 0,196 (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>); the fifth hypothesis is proven. This fits with the theories about the influence of organisational commitment towards performance: "....if the employee's organizational commitment was high It would affect to the employee performance improvement whereas if the employee commitment is low then the performance is also low..." <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Job Satisfaction Towards</head><p>Performance Through Organisational Commitment Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows that organisational commitment is not a mediating variable which influences job satisfaction and the performance of production department employees in PT. Aneka Regalindo's rattan unit. This opposes with the theories about the influence of job satisfaction towards performance through organisational commitment: ".....the positive variables on job satisfaction were the type of job itself, the salary/wage, the opportunity for promotion, their boss and the coworkers can be fulfilled then the commitment to the organization would arise well, so job satisfaction had influencing to performance through organizational commitment...." <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Job Motivation Towards Performance Through Organisational Commitment</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows that organisational commitment is a partial mediating variable which influences job motivation towards the performance of the production department employees of PT. Aneka Regalindo in the rattan unit. This opposes with the theories about the influence of job satisfaction towards performance through organisational commitment: "....the great motivation of each individual, both leader and employee was what can ultimately gave each example a good example so as to create job satisfaction and foster a sense of commitment in the organization where the mutual ownership appeared to be an important part in It, so It could provide morale and impact on the performance of employees who were getting better too...." <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[18]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: The Analysis Results of Path Diagram: Primary Data, 2016 Direct Influence Influence Direction Value of Influence Job Satisfaction (X1) ⇨ Organizational Commitment (Z) Positive 0,021 Job Motivation (X2) ⇨ Organizational Commitment (Z) Positive 0,301 Job Satisfaction (X1) ⇨ Performance (Y) Positive 0,237 Job Motivation (X2) ⇨ Performance (Y) Positive 0,296 Organizational Commitment (Z) ⇨ Performance (Y) Positive 0,196Table 4: Value of Direct Influence : Primary data, 2016</figDesc><graphic coords="4,182.04,177.00,259.56,146.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
