<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Indonesia's national five year development plan stipulated in the National Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2015-2019 is necessary for prioritizing in order to achieve food sovereignty, energy sufficiency and maritime and marine resources management. The five year development plan should increasingly lead to sustainable improved welfare conditions. The social welfare improvement as a barometer of success can be seen from the quality of the Human Development Index (HDI) including life expectancy, literacy rates, average length of school and average per capita income.</p><p>Based on BPS data of Riau Islands Province in 2015 the Human Development Index in 2013 was 69.97%, this was still below the national standard. The government of Riau islands Province has a program to improve social welfare. The program leads to the formation of special department-level agency in charge of coastal areas in order to avoid a gap between the public on the main island (Batam). The program consists of installation of solar power flow to meet the electricity needs by coastal communities, early childhood education program to spur one village, an early childhood education and family empowerment program for economic improvement.</p><p>there will be improvement on fulfillment on the physical and spiritual needs. Riau Islands Province, based on the 2013 data, the labor absorption reached nearly 93.74% of the workforce.</p><p>Economic growth is a process of change in a country economic sustainability leading to a better condition for a certain period. The economic growth is an indication of the economic development success because the economic growth is associated with the increase on production capacity that is realized in the form of the increase on national income. Riau Islands Province in 2015 had the economic growth rate by 7.14% occurred in all sectors of the business field.</p><p>Local revenue is the revenue from local sources of revenue consisting of local taxes and levies. Riau Islands Province has source of income that is still dominated by Balance Fund. The average Local Revenue (PAD) proportion is still below namely 40% of the revenues derived from local taxes, levies and other lawful income.</p><p>Investment is related to the accumulation of assets with an expectation to obtain profit in the future. The investments consist of three types, namely government investment, domestic investment and foreign investment. An area having most large investment level is an area with high infrastructure, natural resources and human resources. The Regency/City with higher investment level is city Batam because it has good level of infrastructure and very strategic to other countries.</p><p>Asset management is a combination of management, finance, economics, engineering machinery and working practices applied to the physical assets. This aims to possess the ability to provide the level of excellent service in the most cost efficient. Proper local asset management can increase social welfare because its function is bigger. There is lack of asset management in Riau Islands province, this can be seen from current unclear status of land and many regional assets that are not used by the regional Government. Many local assets are controlled by individual / private business.</p><p>Based on the above issues, there is a gap among the Human Development Index in Riau Islands Province. This is still far from the human development index in the national/international standards which is minimum by 80%. It means that Riau Islands province is still far from welfare. Excellent labor absorption is 93% of the total work force. Sources of Economic Growth in the districts/cities are quite high and the investment in the area has not been evenly distributed and the asset management in the areas is still far from the expectations because it still has relatively enough and less healthy. This means that there is a problem between regional revenue (PAD), Investment and Asset Management on the Economic Growth, Absorption of Labor and Social welfare.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to prove and analyze the effects of income, investment, and asset management on the economic growth, labor absorption and social welfare in the Regency / City in Riau Islands province.</p></div>

The results support researches by Sitorus (2013), <ref type="bibr">Wiratno (2007)</ref> and Emalia <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref>.</p><p>The large increase on regional revenues can simply increase the economic growth in this area to support government programs by providing regional authority to manage / explore sources of finances in the region. Regional development is an integral part of national development, then in this case , it is necessary for financial funds for the development expenditure.</p><p>4.2.2 Effects of Regional Own Source Revenue on the Labor Absorption</p><p>Based on the results of path analysis in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, it shows that t statistic value is 12.426 which is greater than 1.96, meaning that regional own source revenue has significant effects on the labor absorption.

The increase on the development will absorb more manpower, it takes a very high financial by optimizing regional own source revenue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Effects of Regional Own Source Revenue on the Social Welfare</head><p>Based on the results of path analysis in table <ref type="table">5</ref>, it shows that the t statistic values is 2.928 which is greater than 1.96, meaning that regional own source revenue has significant effects on the social welfare. The results of this study are contrary to a research by Azran ( <ref type="formula">2007</ref>) stating the results of research that the acceptance coal mining royalty do not affect on the social welfare.

This is consistent with researches by <ref type="bibr">Mulyadi (2005</ref><ref type="bibr">), Priyagus (2007</ref><ref type="bibr">), and Ahmad (2014)</ref> showing that the investment both private and public investments has significant effects on the economic growth. one source of effects of the economic growth is from the investment by encouraging high investment so that there will be high economic growth in Riau Islands province. The Investments in Riau Islands province consist of government investment and domestic investment.</p><p>Most districts / cities in Riau Islands Province are free trade zone (FTZ) such as Batam, Karimun and Bintan regencies, in these FTZ areas, there are many foreign investments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">Effects of Investment on the Labor Absorption</head><p>Based on the results of path analysis in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> it shows that t statistic value is 1.416 which is smaller than 1.96, meaning that investment has insignificant effect on the labor absorption. This research differs from a research by <ref type="bibr">Nekky (2008)</ref> stating that there is effect of the investment on the labor absorption. Investments are mostly in manufacturing, trade and tourism sector. In the sector, there is large labor absorption. Riau Islands Province is an archipelagic region and relatively young province as established in 2002, it has no all districts / areas at its establishment. The investment is not evenly distributed. The most attractive regencies / cities are Batam, Bintan and Karimun regency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.6">Effects of Investment on the Social Welfare</head><p>Based on the results of path analysis in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, it shows that the t statistic value is 2,329 which is greater than 1.96 meaning that the Investment has significant effect on the social welfare. The research supports a research by <ref type="bibr">Nekky (2008)</ref> stating that there is effects of the investment on the labor absorption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.7">Asset Management on Economic Growth</head><p>Based on the results of path analysis in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, it shows that the t statistic value is 0.886 which is smaller than 1.96, meaning that Asset Management has no significant effect on the economic growth. Proper asset management will lead to considerable benefits. There is lack of asset management in Riau Islands Province as can be seen from unclear status of land assets because Riau Islands province is a division of Riau province. Maritime tourism area is many managed and privately owned for business, so that it does not give revenue directly to the local governments. The local government with excellent asset management is Batam city because the area is managed by the Batam Authority or currently called as Batam Entrepreneur Board (BP Batam).</p></div>
