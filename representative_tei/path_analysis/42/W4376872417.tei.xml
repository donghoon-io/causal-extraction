<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>School administration must pay attention to professional teachers' roles rather than nonprofessional teachers as part of important human resources in imparting learning. This study aims to analyse the influence of leadership, work environment, and organisational culture on the teachers' competence and performance in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, Indonesia. A total of 57 teachers participated in this research. A descriptive analysis of questionnaires and hypothesis analysis using path analysis was used to analyse the data from the saturated sampling method, where 57 teachers became the sample and were categorised based on age, gender, level of education, years of service, and work unit. Using Smart PLS (Partial Least Squares), this research revealed that leadership and work environment positively but non-significant affect the teachers' competence. Meanwhile, organisational culture has a positive and significant effect on the teachers' competence but a nonsignificant positive effect on the teachers' performance. Thus, the work environment and teacher's competence have a positive and significant effect on the teacher's performance, yet leadership has a negative and non-significant effect on the teacher's performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>An organisation will run well if workers cooperate reasonably with good human resources management. As the founder of motivation theories, Abraham H. Maslow triggered many other motivation theories that claimed that an organisation needs to pay extra attention to developing human resources for more remarkable performance. School organisation is unique in giving service to develop children's potential. In this case, it also needs support from the Principal, teachers, staff, and Parent Teacher Associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. To improve a school system is not only about changing the rules, but it requires the way of thought and interaction among people because the primary key lies in each individual's relationship with the institutional structure, starting from the Principal, teachers, staff, and Parent Teacher Associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Teachers play an essential and crucial role in developing school students in education. Meanwhile, the other aspects, such as leaders, staff, stakeholders, parents, infrastructures, foundations, and the public, cannot be overlooked. Indonesia Law Number 14 of 2005 about teacher and lecturer part IV article 20 stated that teachers must plan, impart, assess and evaluate the learning to do their job professionally. Teachers' performance in Preschool, Elementary, Junior, and Vocational High Schools in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation in Pekanbaru, Indonesia, is as follows:</p><p>Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, all the teachers can prepare a lesson plan for each unit. According to the respondents' interviews, lesson plans are taken from the internet, available online and widely used in the lesson plan format. We know that teachers do administration matters but must also deal with students' problems daily. Also, evaluating the lesson plan in writing is always impossible because they must manage their full-time classes. Therefore, it is difficult for schools to improve their teachers' performance.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, there is always a target of 100% achievement at each stage, such as developing, implementing, and evaluating a lesson plan for each level, namely preschool, elementary, junior high, and vocational high school. However, no one level of education can fulfil the targets. Only the Preschool level has the highest achievement, with a rate of 90.91% at the evaluation level. The achievement targets in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> could not be met for several reasons, which were ascertained by researchers conducting this study using observations and interviews. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>'s explanations, several factors contribute to teachers' inability to meet the targets, such as their excessive workload or the fact that they must perform administrative duties in addition to their teaching duties. Aside from that, teachers are encouraged to be professional and competent, in accordance with the Law on the National Education System of the Republic of Indonesia 2005 number 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which contains four fundamental rights: pedagogic competence (teaching), personal competence, social competence, and competence acquired through professional education.</p><p>A highly competent teacher will do their best to conduct an innovative learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The quality of the graduates reflects the teachers' competence and quality in teaching. We will see the student's final achievement in every unit of Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation, Pekanbaru.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows a fluctuation in students' final exam scores in every unit. This may indirectly reflect upon teachers' professionalism and competency. Teachers' ability to educate and produce high-quality graduates indicates competence. Effective learning comes from operative teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Thus, teachers' professionalism and qualifications must guarantee competent and brilliant students <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Research related to teachers' competence and performance has been conducted in this last decade with mixed results. A teacher's performance means a set of actions, attitudes, and behaviours in the teaching-learning environment that results in achieving educational goals for students. Soetopo <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> revealed that leadership and organisational culture influenced work performance. Teachers' competence also affects their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Pujiastuti &amp; Rozi <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also showed that teachers' competence and the work environment influenced teachers' performance. In contrast, some researchers revealed that teachers' competence did not affect teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Anggrayni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proved that the work environment affected teachers' performance, but another research showed no correlation between the work environment and teachers' performance. Rahardjo <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> verified that leadership and the work environment influenced teachers' performance. Otherwise, Sampurno &amp; Wibowo <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> proved that the work environment did not directly affect teachers' performance, but leadership impacts teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Yani &amp; Indrawati <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> revealed that the work environment influenced the teachers' competence. There is a significant effect between leadership and organisational culture on teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. In addition, organisational culture also stimulates teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Yusuf <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> disclosed that leadership and organisational culture harmed teachers' performance. Putra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> proved no significant effect of leadership on teachers' performance. While Indajang <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> also unveiled that organisational culture did not influence teachers' performance. Another research showed that leadership and organisational culture positively influenced teachers' competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Abidin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> unveiled that the work environment did not directly affect teachers' competence.</p><p>Based on the phenomena above, the problem in this research is whether leadership, working environment, and organisational culture significantly affect teachers' competence and performance and whether the teachers' competence influences the teachers' performance. Therefore, this research examines and analyses the effect of leadership, working environment, and organisational culture on teachers' competence and work performance and the effect of teachers' competence on the teachers' performance in Prajanamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, Indonesia. Hopefully, this research will contribute both, in theory, to the development of similar studies in the education field and practical development as feedback for improving the teachers' competence and performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review and hypothesis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leadership</head><p>It can influence a person or an organisation to work willingly and effectively in achieving the organisation's vision in certain circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Leadership in an organisation is crucial in affecting decision-making. Hence, it must be directed to management procedures regarding the organisation's operational function <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Leadership's biggest challenge is deciding wisely, which can influence people at every moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. A leader can do the organisational activity by asking, motivating, influencing, and even forcing them to reach a goal. He also has excellent communication skills to make a great bond with the employee <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Successful leadership is affected by the working environment. Thus, it needs three prominent roles: leader, follower, and surrounding environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Leadership style is determined by the characteristics of the followers and the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Communication skills, personality, intelligence, employee characteristics, and goal achievement are the factors that can affect leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. An effective leader is skilful in using the leadership style which builds upon the situation required. On the other hand, others might change their style, confusing them <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>The leader also influences school development. The learning process defines the quality of education with the Principal's capability to lead and manage professionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The Principal manages the school to achieve the best education quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. The Principal's leadership style needs to be modified, and the school organisation's development needs to improve <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The Principal is the most critical component in developing the school, both in management and quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. The dimensions regarding leadership are: (1) a well-defined strategy with excellent communication skills; (2) awareness of the employee and working environment; (3) ability to motivate; (4) maintaining teamwork; and (5) appreciating the differences and beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work environment</head><p>In management literature, very little attention is given to the impact of the work environment towards working creatively and innovatively. Aspects such as interior design, lighting, and circulation are necessary for building work motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Knowledge and a modern perspective on the workplace must prepare the work environment to shape and confine employees' behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Increasing productivity will focus on individual motivation and work environment infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. As the prominent factor stimulating work, the work environment will develop the employees' economic growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. A good work environment will support each individual to have a strong tenure, convince them to have healthy competition, and work effectively even under pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The work environment holds the primary key in the individual variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>An excellent work environment relates to teachers' motivation to gain productivity in teaching and educating <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. The work environment dimensions are divided into physical environments such as lighting, sound, aerial, infrastructure, security, and safety. In contrast, the non-physical environment is the relationship between the leader, teacher, and staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organisational culture</head><p>The study of organisational culture started in the early 1980s. It has adapted to an organisation's new human values and eras <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Organisational culture begins from the habit, tradition, and common ways of doing things in an organisation based on past achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Culture in an organisation is a beneficial tool for reaching the goal of organisation activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Organisational culture is a subject that failed to get specific attention from researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. It is the soul of an organisation because it consists of philosophy, vision and mission, values, and other things followed by the people <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. It begins with forming the value and norms and passes on among individuals through social learning, role modelling, and observation. Ultimately, it helps the employee deal with external pressure threatening the organisation's continuity and internal integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Organisational culture is a set of beliefs, values, norms, customs, and behaviours that influence how people think, feel, and act <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. It is not defined but identifies how people work and behave to achieve their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>School culture is a group of norms, values, beliefs, rituals, ceremonies, symbols, and stories describing the school's distinctive features <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. It refers to every level of education. The vision and mission at school indicate the existence of culture because it proves that school and company cultures are equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. School organisational culture gives the identity, achievement orientation, behaviour standard, and various ways of working and determines the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. The dimensions in organisational culture are (1) Self-awareness to gain satisfaction in working, self-improvement, rule-obeying, and high service; (2) aggressiveness and determination in reaching the goal; (3) mutual respect, hospitality, openness, sensitivity to the needs of students; (4) Creative performance results in quantity and quality; (5) Team orientation with teamwork, communication, cooperation, involvement, commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competence</head><p>Competence is the primary key to deciding an organisation's effectiveness and success <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Competence means being qualified and capable of developing and well-functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. It can be related to the ability to problem-solving, cognitive skills, self-concept, behaviour, or value <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Competence can be the fundamental consideration in recruiting, selecting, planning, and evaluating work performance in developing human resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Competence differentiates one's behaviour from the others <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. It is crucial because the decision will be taken wrongly without the direction of competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p><p>In Indonesia Act, Number 14 of 2005 about Teachers and Lecturers, teachers as professional educators have the prominent roles of educating, teaching, guiding, training, assessing, and evaluating students from preschool, primary to high school. Teachers' competence will influence teachers' performance pedagogically, personally, and professionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. A teacher must have academic, competent, physical, and mental conditions to reach the national education goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. The dimension of teachers' competence are: (1) Having knowledge and skill from the formal or informal institution; (2) being Skillful in teaching and solving a problem effectively; (3) Uphold the organisation's ethics, acting positively and kindly; (4) Work properly <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work performance</head><p>It is the human work process <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Work performance also contributes to decision-making regarding salary based on achievement, promotion, and recruitment in building a positive team rapport <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. Work performance is an organisation's ability to manage human resources to reach its purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. Poor work performance will cause negative achievement and unpleasant results <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>.</p><p>Teachers' performance is the output from doing the task based on their ability, experience, sincerity, and time management <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. National Education Ministerial Regulation Number 35 of 2010 mentioned that teachers' performance assesses process and work achievement in doing their obligation. A professional teacher is knowledgeable in their teaching field, methods of teaching, and motivating students and comprehends social and human essence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A teacher's action is working with high morale, discipline, spirit, and dedication and living up to their profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The dimension of teachers' performance are: (1) having a target in fulfilling their job, (2) The quality of achievement, (3) Punctuality in working, (4) Attitude regarding work quality to be reliable, accountable, open, and responsible <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effect of leadership on teachers' competence</head><p>Leadership is defined as inspiring others to do their best to get what they want in developing and communicating vision, motivating employees, and keeping the commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Soetopo <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proved that leadership positively affects teachers' competence. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> revealed the result in contrast. Therefore, the first hypothesis is:</p><p>H1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effect of work environment on teachers' competence</head><p>If the work environment is uncomfortable, it will disturb teachers' competence. In contrast, a good work environment can create competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Furthermore, research showed that the work environment significantly affects teachers' competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, Abidin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> revealed that the work environment does not directly affect teachers' competence. Therefore, the second hypothesis is:</p><p>H2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effect of organisational culture on teachers' competence</head><p>Organisational culture helps shape the teachers' behaviour in improving teachers' competence to support teachers' professionalism.

On the contrary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> showed that it does not affect the teachers' competence. Therefore, the third hypothesis is: H3.

Transactional or transformational leadership can positively influence work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. The research revealed that leadership influenced work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Nevertheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> revealed that it does not affect the teachers' performance. Therefore, the fourth hypothesis is:</p><p>H4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effect of work environment on teachers' work performance</head><p>The work environment helps improve teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Creating a supportive environment of mutual respect and teamwork will significantly affect teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. A relaxing, harmonious, cosy, and comfortable environment at work is the main factor in building significant interaction in accomplishing work. Therefore, the work environment is the most dominant factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88]</ref>. On the other hand, some research showed that the work environment had no significant correlation with teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General description of Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru</head><p>Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru was founded in 2004 by religious figures in Riau Province with a total of ±14.000m 2 land and finally built Metta Maitreya School Pekanbaru starting from preschool, primary, secondary, and vocational high school. There are 84 employees, including 57 teachers and 27 staff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive analysis</head><p>Respondents' characteristic analysis. This general description will inform the respondent's characteristics Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru that is categorised based on age, gender, level of education, years of service, and work unit as follows:</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows that teachers in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru are dominated by the group of 21-30 years old, with 37 people or 64,91%. Sixteen people are from the group of 31-40 years old, or 28,07%. The age above 40 represents two people or 3,51%, and above 21 years old (19 years old for exact) represents two people or 3,51%. Most of the teachers are young, probably not having much experience in teaching. However, the researchers observed that the creativity in teaching, the willingness to improve themselves, and the ability to adapt to new technology are much better than others, which are indeed needed in this globalisation era.</p><p>Regarding gender, it is dominated by female teachers, with 43 people or 75,44%. Millennial women around 22 to 38 are more involved in education <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. However, the teachers' recruitment at school is not merely based on gender but competence and performance.</p><p>From the level of education, they are primarily undergraduates, with 48 people or 84,21%. Seven people, or 12,28%, graduated from high school. 1,75% or one person did a diploma, and the other did a postgraduate diploma. According to Indonesian Law Number 14 of 2005 Article 9 and Government Regulation Number 74 of 2008, a teacher must be at least a diploma holder or a graduate. The need for high school graduate teachers is to teach a specific subject, namely the Chinese Language and Moral Ethics. These subjects' teachers are still hard to recruit, but they are recruited because of their ability in these subjects. However, they are in the progress of studying the undergraduate program, Regarding years of service, most teachers have worked for five years representing 77,20% or 44 people. Ten people have been working for almost ten years, and only three can reach more than ten years. Ningsih <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> stated that there is no difference between years of service and professionalism in working. It seems that it is not easy to find a loyal employee nowadays.</p><p>Most teachers in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru work in the elementary unit, with 25 from 57. Besides, 24 work in high school and eight at preschool. This is merely based on the number of students in that unit. The more students, the more teachers are required.</p></div>

The path analysis result for these explanations can be seen in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation analysis</head><p>From the structural equation, we can conclude that leadership positively affects teachers' competence. If the leadership increases by 7,1% by assuming no intervention from other factors, the teachers' competence can increase by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Leadership has a positive effect on teachers' competence, which means that the improvement of leadership will subtly increase the teachers' competence and affect only a few. Therefore, it is non-significant. It is supported by the research of Putra, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Syakir &amp; Pardjono <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and, on the contrary, by the study of Soetopo <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Leadership and competence are essential in determining an organisation's effectiveness and success <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Leaders must motivate teachers to work significantly based on their competence resulting in qualified graduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Teachers in this foundation think that the leaders can encourage them, and mutual respect is present to learn from the leaders. Arman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> explained that teachers must be inclusive and objective without discrimination. He must communicate effectively, have empathy, and respect others. He will participate actively and supportively in the organisation if it meets their personal needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Teachers, too, feel that there is a need for a leader to listen to their opinion to help to develop the school.</p><p>The work environment positively affects teachers' competence, which means that improving the work environment will also trivially increase their competence and affect only a few. Therefore, it is non-significant. It is supported by Abidin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and in contrast with Soetopo's <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> research. On the other hand, the teachers feel that the opportunity to promote themselves at school is lacking. The government and schools should find a system to help the teachers be promoted faster to keep their motivation high. They should provide an objective approach in their promotion system, not a subjective one. It also affects the competence level of the teachers as well.</p><p>Organisational culture positively affects teachers' competence, which means that organisational culture improvement will also increase teachers' competence with a considerable contribution. Therefore, it is significant. It is supported by the research of Soetopo <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Syakir &amp; Pardjono <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and in contrast with the study of Indajang <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Each organisation has an important culture that can affect the behaviour and attitude of the employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Without a solid culture, no organisation can accomplish its goal and survive in the competitive era <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Organisational culture is the soul of an organisation, with its philosophy, vision, and mission held by its people <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. The organisational culture in this foundation is influential in the universal family concept that also influences how teachers think and act. Their acceptance towards this culture can be seen through the responses in this section. However, as observed in their questionnaire responses, these teachers still lack problem-solving competence.</p><p>Leadership hurts teachers' performance means that the improvement of leadership will decrease the teachers' performance in minor ways and affect only a few of them. Therefore, it is non-significant. It is supported by the research of Yusuf <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and in contrast with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>. The leaders' competence determines teachers' outstanding performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Qualified leadership leads to skilled performance, knowledge, competence, motivation and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. From our analysis, good leadership does not always influence the teachers' performance. The different circumstances in every research also contribute to different results compared to the theory in common. The questionnaire can also be biased since leadership itself has many dimensions. Since leadership only has one factor in improving performance, we must not overlook other factors such as achievement, learning preparation, commitment, and supervision <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. It can also be because the leaders are probably not fully helpful in developing the teachers as they think of it as the foundation's or the government's job <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. Therefore, the school must improve the leadership strategy to improve the teachers' performance.</p><p>The work environment positively affects teachers' performance, meaning that improving the work environment will also increase the teachers' performance and significantly impact most teachers. Therefore, it is significant. It is supported by the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and in contrast with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. The work environment will be conducive to increase work performance, leading to great productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. A good work environment will improve their ability to do their task <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>. Teachers feel that lighting and security will also help them to increase their work performance. A conducive work environment such as ample computers, ergonomic chairs, free stationeries and supportive senior colleagues will improve their work performance.</p><p>Organisational culture positively affects teachers' performance, which means that organisational culture improvement will also increase the teachers' performance with a small contribution by most teachers. Therefore, it is significant. It is supported by the research of Yusuf <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>. Furthermore, teachers strongly agree about the importance of being responsible and giving excellent service to students. This means a tremendous organisational culture will aim for outstanding work performance, indirectly improving teaching. The students will get the most from their teachers during every lesson.</p><p>Teachers' competence positively affects teachers' performance, which means that the improvement of organisational culture will also increase the teachers' performance with a significant impact on most of the teachers. Therefore, it is significant. It is supported by the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref> and the research of Rahardjo <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> dan Sari <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Excellent teachers' competence will improve teachers' performance because professional teachers will produce qualified education <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Competence is a personal factor that can influence teachers' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Mastering their subject will become a solid reason for the teachers' ability to do their tasks and be responsible as educators <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Knowing the competence level is required to know the level of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The competence standard is an approach to control the employee's performance by learning management <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. National Education Ministry Regulation Number 35 of 2010 stated that the teachers' performance could be improved if they reach the right competence. If they can find solutions for the mentioned problem, then they can provide excellent work performance with their skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>It can be concluded that leadership positively affects teachers' competence in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, which means that the improvement of leadership will also subtly increase the teachers' competence and affect only a few of them. The work environment positively affects teachers' competence in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, which means that improving the work environment will also increase the teachers' competence and affect only a few. Then, organisational culture positively affects teachers' competence in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru. This means that organisational culture improvement will also increase the teachers' competence with a massive contribution for most teachers. However, leadership negatively affects teachers' performance in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, which means that leadership improvement will decrease the teachers' performance in a minor way and affect only a few of them. The work environment positively affects teachers' performance in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, which means that improving the work environment will increase the teachers' performance and significantly impact most teachers. Organisational culture positively affects teachers' performance in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, which means that organisational culture improvement will also increase the teachers' performance, however, with a small contribution. Lastly, teachers' competence positively affects teachers' performance in Prajnamitra Maitreya Foundation Pekanbaru, which means that organisational culture improvement will significantly increase teachers' performance, impacting most teachers.</p><p>The implication of this research is four suggestions that the foundation can utilise. First, there is a necessity to improve the teachers' competence and performance to produce qualified graduates through motivation, improving the work environment, and training. Second, the foundation should consider all employees' opportunities to develop their abilities. Third, a strict recruitment process is also needed. Finally, the leaders' roles are crucial in dealing with the employee, so paying attention to the leader is necessary.</p><p>The implication of these teachers are suggestions that the teachers can implement. First, teachers must not overlook the importance of teachers' competence, so they must keep improving themselves in many ways, such as self-learning or training. Second, teachers must initiate wisely in working to solve problems quickly. Third, if there is an issue in solving problems, they must discuss it with their colleagues or leaders. Fourth, there are gaps in this research that other researchers can improve. The researchers can differ the variables to get various results. Researchers also can find more research gaps concerning these variables. Fourth, the research can be done in multiple foundations or schools.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
