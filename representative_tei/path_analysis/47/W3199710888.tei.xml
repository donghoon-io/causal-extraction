<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Social media is one of the most disruptive technologies in executing a firm's digital business transformation strategies. Does the firm's ability to use social media affect its proficiency in exploring and exploiting knowledge? What should be the role of business analytics talent in this equation? We study theoretically and empirically these cutting-edge research questions. Our proposed research model argues that social media capability enables the development of knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and business analytics talent exerts a positive reinforcing role in the impact of social media on knowledge exploration. We empirically tested the proposed research model with a secondary dataset from a sample of US firms using PLS path modeling. After running a robustness test by estimating eight alternatives/competing models, the empirical analysis revealed that social media capability is positively related to knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, but with a stronger effect on knowledge exploration. Moreover, business analytics talent plays a positive moderator role in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. This study contributes to the IS research by (1) introducing, developing, and operationalizing the concepts of social media capability and business analytics talent; and (2) theoretically arguing and empirically showing the pivotal role of social media capability in exploring new knowledge and the complementary role of business analytics talent. Our study also provides several critical lessons learned for top executives and proposes promising future IS research avenues.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Social media represents one of the most disruptive technologies in executing a firm's digital business transformation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Benitez, Ruiz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Wessel et al., 2021)</ref>. However, our theoretical understanding of this new corporate phenomenon is in its initial stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018)</ref>. Social media can play a key role in collecting, monitoring, and analyzing data to generate business value <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(He et al., 2015)</ref>, and social media platforms are considered one of the most popular online communication tools and sources of information, acting as facilitators of knowledge with potential impacts on firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Chai et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Krancher et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Leonardi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Luo et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, firms can use social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, corporate blogs) to build awareness about their products and initiatives and test them by collecting opinions, impressions, and ideas from customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Dong and Wu, 2015)</ref>. As an illustrative example, Lay's (a potato chip manufacturer) ran a campaign on social media <ref type="bibr">(Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram)</ref> called "Do us a flavor." This campaign aimed to innovate about the next potato chip flavor by collecting ideas from customers. Four finalist flavors were sold provisionally, and customers voted in social media for the best one, with the Southern Biscuits and Gravy flavor eventually being sold. Thus, social media provides a vast amount of customer, competitor, and supplier data that can be leveraged by the firm to innovate and improve firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aral et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018)</ref>. Based on the organizational capabilities-based theory, this study introduces, develops, and focuses on social media capability, which refers to the firm's ability to use and leverage external social media to execute business activities. Firms with a high level of social media capability may convert social media into a golden source of data, changing how firms exchange information <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">French et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Social media may have the potential to enable firms to analyze and examine new knowledge (i.e., knowledge exploration) and recombine existing knowledge (i.e., knowledge exploitation). Knowledge exploration refers to the learning obtained from acquiring/creating, sharing, and storing new knowledge. Knowledge exploitation is the learning process of assimilating, reusing, reinterpreting, applying, and leveraging new/existing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gupta et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">March, 1991)</ref>. However, despite the suggested potential value, how firms leverage external social media to explore knowledge and exploit knowledge needs further development and empirical testing.</p><p>Generating and collecting social data (i.e., data from social media) might not be enough to use information efficiently. The value creation from social data requires knowledge understanding. Monitoring, analyzing, and identifying relevant social media-based information is critical for transforming information into business gains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ransbotham et al. (2015)</ref> suggested that using social data effectively may be critical to support business activities. The process of changing data into valuable insights to support business activities is called "business analytics" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Holsapple et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., forthcoming)</ref>. Business analytics refers to the support of decision-making and problem resolution in firms through two main capabilities: "speed to insight" (i.e., how fast firms can transform social data into useful insights) and "pervasive use" (i.e., deep usage of business analytics across the firm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Wixom et al., 2013)</ref>. In this sense, firms face the challenge of attracting, hiring, developing, and retaining business analytics talent to transform social data into valuable insights for supporting business activities. This paper focuses on business analytics talent. As a scarce and valuable resource, business analytics talent may explain the variation in performance among contemporary firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Edwards, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ransbotham et al., 2015)</ref>. Business analytics talent is the firm's talent regarding effectively applying business analytics at the firm level by transforming data into valuable insights for supporting business activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ransbotham et al., 2015)</ref>. Firms with business analytics talent can effectively perform business analytics to turn analytical insight into business actions. Firms effectively performing business analytics move from descriptive analytics, to determine what occurred in the past and what occurs now and why, to predictive analytics to model what will happen in the future, to prescriptive analysis to develop multiple options about the future and help determine the course of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ransbotham et al., 2015)</ref>. Given its importance, business analytics talent is a scarce and valuable information technology (IT) resource that may help firms build IT wisdom in contemporary firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Liu et al., 2020)</ref>. It has been estimated that 2.7 million business analytics jobs will be posted in the US in 2020 alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Fenlon &amp; Peters, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Information systems (IS) research lacks theory building on how firms perform social media initiatives and how they may affect a firm's knowledge exploration and exploitation activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Dong &amp; Wu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Ngai et al., 2015)</ref>. Firms may invest in managing social media effectively to acquire and exploit social data to improve their performance. This argument introduces this study's first research question: (1) Does social media capability enable knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation? This study tries to fill this research gap and answer this question. The effect of social media capability on knowledge exploration may be stronger in firms that transform social data into new useful social knowledge through business analytics talent <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Davenport et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ransbotham et al., 2015)</ref>. This rationale motivates the second research question of this paper: (2) Can the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration be strengthened when business analytics talent comes into play?</p><p>We argue that social media capability can enable firms to explore and exploit knowledge, and that firms with more and better business analytics talent can amplify and strengthen the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. This is the central theoretical proposition of this manuscript. We tested the proposed research model using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling with a secondary dataset on a sample of US firms. After estimating eight alternatives/competing models in the robustness check, the empirical analysis provides substantial support to our central proposition.</p></div>

Organizational capabilities<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> can be classified into dynamic capabilities (a firm's proficiency in adapting its resource base in response to changes in the business environment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Teece, 2007)</ref>; operational capabilities (a firm's proficiency in solving operational problems and implementing the operations strategy by using interrelated operational routines) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Benitez, Chen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Wu et al., 2010)</ref>; and dual-purpose capabilities (organizational capabilities that are dynamic and operational capabilities because they can be controlled and exploited at both strategic/corporate and operational level) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Helfat &amp; Winter, 2011)</ref>. We use the organizational capabilities-based theory to conceptualize social media capability, knowledge exploration, knowledge exploitation, business analytics talent (the key constructs of this study), and to link social media capability to knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation.</p><p>The IT-enabled organizational capabilities perspective has emerged as a solid theoretical base in the IS literature to explain the value creation from IT by arguing that IT helps firms create business value by developing intermediate organizational/process capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Lin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Mandrella et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Mikalef et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Schmiedel et al., 2020)</ref>. Some of these organizational capabilities include business flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Benitez, Llorens et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chen et al., 2017)</ref>, supply chain management <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajamieh et al., 2016)</ref>, corporate entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chen et al., 2015)</ref>, new product development <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Pavlou &amp; El Sawy, 2006)</ref>, and knowledge search and relational search management <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Hensen &amp; Dong, 2020)</ref>. Since social media technology is a new type of digital technology, ITenabled organizational capabilities theory provides a useful conceptual framework to theorize that social media capability enables knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation.</p><p>Organizational learning refers to how firms pursue organizational renewal by creating knowledge, explaining, and codifying this knowledge, and sharing and transferring this knowledge within the firm to be used and embedding it through rules and procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(March, 1991)</ref>. This study draws on the organizational learning framework, which considers knowledge exploration and exploitation as two firms' learning activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gupta et al., 2006)</ref>. Knowledge exploration is the learning process of acquiring/creating, sharing, and storing new knowledge, while knowledge exploitation is composed of the learning obtained from the process of assimilating, reusing, reinterpreting, applying, and leveraging new/existing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gupta et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">March, 1991)</ref>. Ambidextrous firms in managing knowledge are those that efficiently achieve exploration and exploitation of knowledge simultaneously for operational purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Levinthal &amp; March, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Simultaneously achieving knowledge exploration and exploitation may help firms attain longterm business benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Raisch &amp; Birkinshaw, 2008)</ref>. Despite the importance of understanding how knowledge ambidexterity works, there is a critical difference between a firm's knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation because they require significantly different structures, processes, strategies, capabilities, and cultural values <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Dominguez &amp; Massaroli, 2018)</ref>. In this sense, knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation may have different relationships with other variables such as social media capability, business analytics talent, and firm performance. For example, knowledge exploration is related to organic structure, flexible systems, autonomy, and improvisation, whereas knowledge exploitation is related to mechanical structure, rigid systems, control, bureaucracy, and routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Dominguez &amp; Massaroli, 2018)</ref>. For these reasons, this study focuses on the individual impact of social media capability on knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation instead of examining the effect of social media capability on knowledge ambidexterity. We use the organizational learning framework to conceptualize knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation.</p><p>The complementary resource perspective is a theoretical framework that suggests that the firm's resource complementarity explains the differential effect in business benefits. Complementarity between resources/capabilities denotes the mutual reinforcing of the resources/capabilities where the presence of a resource/capability allows other resources/capabilities to exert their value <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ennen &amp; Richter, 2010)</ref>. These complementary relationships may drive the pursuit of more efficient processes, which may differ from the and dual-purpose IT and business capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>sum of the individual effects considered in isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adegbesan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bharadwaj et al., 2007)</ref>. Our central proposition is that the positive effect of social media capability on knowledge exploration can be amplified if the firm also has business analytics talent. We use the complementary resource perspective to explain how business analytics talent complements social media capability to enable knowledge exploration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunities for IS Research</head><p>Although prior studies in this stream of IS research have highlighted the critical role of social media and provided some evidence about its impact on individuals' and organizations' knowledge sharing, there are two research opportunities in the existing literature. First, although the crucial challenge for organizations is to learn how they can develop the ability to effectively select, use, and leverage external social media among changing platforms in order to scan, learn, and internalize knowledge, it remains rather unclear how companies can develop a social media capability and create business value from this capability. Instead, prior IS research has focused on understanding the knowledge sharing behavior of employees in enterprise social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beck et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Leonardi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neely &amp; Leonardi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Song et al., 2019)</ref>, user-generated content, and customer engagement to diffuse information through social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bapna et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Yang et al., 2019)</ref>. Prior IS research has also focused on exploring customer behavior in social media through complaints <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gunarathne et al., 2017)</ref> service <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Gunarathne et al., 2018)</ref>, and the knowledge-sharing behavior of bloggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chai et al., 2011)</ref>. Prior IS research has mainly focused on the employee, customer, and user, devoting less attention to organizations as the main level of analysis (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">A1</ref> in the Appendix). Despite the plausible role that the firm's proficiency in using and selecting external social media may play in exploring new knowledge and exploiting existing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chau &amp; Xu, 2012)</ref>, this research topic is undertheorized in IS research.</p><p>Although firms' business analytics talent may perform a critical role in understanding and acquiring new knowledge from big data on customers in social media, this plausible effect is not well understood. Instead, prior IS research has primarily focused on the impact of big data analytics capability on competitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Mikalef et al., 2020)</ref> and its reinforcing role in creating synergies and improving market performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Dong &amp; Yang, 2020)</ref>. However, an overemphasis on analytics software seems to prevail, minimizing the role of people and analytics talent <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Conboy et al., 2020)</ref>. The goal of our research is to address these research opportunities. First, our study examines the development of social media capability and its impact on the firm's exploration and exploitation of knowledge. Second, we also examine whether and how business analytics talent reinforces the impact of social media capability on knowledge exploration. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the proposed research model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Social Media Capability</head><p>Social media capability concerns the firm's ability to purposely use and leverage external social media platforms to execute business activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018)</ref>. This study considers the three external social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and corporate blogs) most used by contemporary firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Culnan et al., 2010)</ref>. In 2018 89%, 91%, and 53% of the Fortune 500 firms used Facebook, Twitter, and corporate blogs, respectively, for business activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes et al., 2019)</ref>. In this sense, social media capability covers three of the most relevant external social media platforms used by firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Braojos et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Braojos et al., 2019)</ref>. The development of social media capability is heterogeneous among companies, which suggests that companies may vary between high and low social media capabilities. Firms with highly developed social media capabilities can positively engage customers and employees to discuss their activities and cultural values and to share knowledge. Melia Hotels International (a leading hotel group worldwide) is an example of a company with high social media capabilities. Melia has leveraged social media to better manage the customer relationship/experience, improve its digital brand and web traffic, co-create knowledge, attract talent, and improve its employer branding. 2 In contrast, Molson Company (a multinational brewing company) illustrates a company with low social media capabilities. Molson Company had a static presence on Facebook in 2007 when it decided to exploit the potential of social media by launching a Facebook campaign that encouraged university students to post pictures of drinking. The company was criticized for promoting irresponsible drinking, which negatively affected its corporate reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Compeau &amp; Qureshi, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Recent IS research on IT and knowledge management capabilities has operationalized the concept of ITenabled capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Joshi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Saldanha et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Joshi et al. (2010)</ref> conceptualized IT-enabled absorptive capacity as the IT contributions to firms' abilities to acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Saldanha et al. (2020)</ref> have operationalized IT-enabled social integration capacity as the firm's IT use that fosters social capital through social interaction and connectedness. For this purpose, they also introduced several internal and external IT applications (e.g., wikis, blogs, enterprise social 2 According to Gabriel Escarrer (CEO of Melia Hotels International): "The influence of social media these days on corporate reputation and firm performance is undebatable. Being active in social media has given us the opportunity to share more and networking sites). We draw on this prior IS research to conceptualize social media capability. However, our social media capability concept presents unique and original characteristics concerning IT-enabled absorptive capacity and IT-enabled social integration capacity. First, social media capability refers directly and exclusively to the firm's ability to leverage external social media platforms (i.e., a specific IT).

In prior literature, two theories on organizational viability coexist to explore and exploit knowledge: as two extremes of a continuum (tradeoffs) or as two independent activities (complementary strategies) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gupta et al., 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Business Analytics Talent</head><p>Business analytics comprise a group of people, approaches, organizational procedures, and tools used in combination that convert data into insights for problem recognition and solving within a business situation context <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Holsapple et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Trkman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Wixom et al., 2013)</ref>. The notion of business analytics talent in this study is derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Ransbotham et al.'s (2015)</ref> work on analytics talent, and we draw on this work to conceptualize and measure business analytics talent. Business analytics talent is a firm resource that refers to people's talent in performing business analytics (i.e., high-level analytical skills) to transform data into insights valuable for supporting business activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ransbotham et al., 2015)</ref>. Business analytics talent is conceptually a different construct than social media capability, as some companies with high/low social media capability do not have business analytics talent because of its scarcity in the market. Our conceptualization is consistent with recent IS research that investigated big data analytics capability individually and highlighted its potential value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Mikalef et al., 2020)</ref>. However, other IS scholars may be interested in examining general IT-enabled information management capability, which could potentially combine the analysis of both social media and business data analytics under the same concept and theoretical lens (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Andrade &amp; Kathuria, 2014)</ref>. Our conceptualization of business analytics talent deliberately excludes business analytics talent. We propose that social media capability can enable firms to explore and exploit knowledge and that firms with more and better business analytics talent can amplify and strengthen the relationship between social media capability and firm knowledge exploration. 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Social Media Capability and Knowledge Exploration</head><p>Social media capability can facilitate the firm's knowledge exploration. Firms can use external social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, corporate blogs) to acquire new knowledge from customers, competitors, and suppliers and to create and share new knowledge with them, thus facilitating the exploration of new knowledge. Firms can use Facebook and Twitter to reach current and potential customers and interact with them to acquire customer knowledge (e.g., customer preferences and feedback on the current firm's products) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andrade &amp; Kathuria, 2014)</ref>. These social media platforms can also be leveraged to co-develop new products with customers, (Patroni et al., forthcoming;   3 We check for discriminant validity between social media capability and business analytics talent by estimating the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020)</ref>. The value of the HTMT between social media capability and business <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Testa et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Xie et al., 2016)</ref>, and for knowledge sharing with customers (e.g., communication of new products), thus enabling knowledge exploration. For example, Mercadona (i.e., the leading supermarket chain in Spain) has used Twitter to acquire new customer knowledge in the form of customers' complaints about out-of-stock products in stores posted on Mercadona's Twitter site, allowing them to respond to these complaints more quickly. Mercadona has also leveraged Twitter to recognize new customer preferences (e.g., vegan products) faster than direct competitors. Thus, Mercadona is an example of a company with high-level social media capabilities that uses social media to acquire customer knowledge.</p><p>Firms can also use external social media to obtain knowledge from competitors and co-create new knowledge with their supplier network. Firms can monitor social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs) of direct competitors to acquire knowledge on competitor moves and actions (e.g., a supermarket chain that analyzes the key supplier base of its direct competitors on Twitter) in order to design competitive strategies and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andrade &amp; Kathuria, 2014)</ref>. A firm's external social media can also be used as a collaborative platform to enable knowledge exploration with suppliers by exchanging information and co-creating new products and projects. Therefore, we hypothesize:</p><p>H1: There is a positive relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Social Media Capability and Knowledge Exploitation</head><p>Social media capability can also positively influence the exploitation of existing knowledge. The firm's proficiency in selecting, using, and leveraging external social media (Facebook, Twitter, corporate blogs) may help the firm assimilate, reinterpret, reuse, and apply existing knowledge, thus increasing knowledge exploitation. The external social media can serve as customer and competitor knowledge repositories, which facilitate knowledge assimilation and reuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Jarvenpaa &amp; Majchrzak, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Lu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Companies can also use external social media to develop and maintain long-term relationships with current and potential customers, collaborating and sharing knowledge with the firm to reinterpret and apply customer and product knowledge, thus enabling the exploitation of knowledge. For example, Mercadona uses Twitter to exploit existing knowledge. After its Twitter account was flooded requests for e kefir (i.e., a sour drink containing so-called gutanalytics talent is 0.361 (lower than 0.90) and was significantly smaller than 1 (0.499), thus suggesting the existence of clear discriminant validity between these two constructs. These two constructs are both conceptually and statistically different.</p><p>friendly bacteria). Mercadona applied and leveraged this knowledge to commercialize this product in response to increasing demand in its stores, which has been acknowledged by its customers. One customer uploaded a picture of kefir with the following text: "If there is one thing that I like about Mercadona is that they always listen to the customers' suggestions." This example illustrates how firm-customer interactions in external social media (e.g., Twitter) provide Mercadona "clues" for reinterpreting and reusing existing customer and product knowledge, thus facilitating knowledge exploitation. We thus hypothesize:</p><p>H2: There is a positive relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">The Business Value of Business Analytics Talent: Business Analytics Talent as Moderator between Social Media Capability and Knowledge Exploration</head><p>We argue that when the firm has talent in business analytics, the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration may be amplified because business analytics talent can play a positive moderator (reinforcing) role in this relationship. Social media facilitates the exploration of a vast amount of new knowledge. However, business analytics talent must have a good understanding in order to efficiently explore this knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chau &amp; Xu, 2012)</ref>. Firms with superior business analytics talent can collect, monitor, analyze, and summarize the vast amount of unstructured new information to quickly create new insights and meaningful knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(He et al., 2015)</ref> that can be easily stored (i.e., knowledge exploration). Social media data are often unstructured, subjective, and massive <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chan et al., 2016)</ref>. The ideas expressed in social media can be easily misunderstood and misapplied <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Faraj et al., 2011)</ref>, which requires firms to use analytical skills to effectively explore knowledge and convert social data into useful and understandable new knowledge. Business analytics talent is pivotal for firms seeking to create and store useful knowledge acquired from external social media. Therefore, we hypothesize:</p><p>H3: Business analytics talent positively moderates (reinforces and amplifies) the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents a summary of the main arguments of the hypotheses that composes the proposed research model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sample</head><p>We tested the proposed model with a sample of the 100 small firms listed in the 2013 Forbes America's Best Small Companies ranking (hereafter, the Forbes database). This ranking comprises the best 100 publicly recognized US small firms with sales under one billion dollars <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018)</ref>.

We focused on this specific ranking list for two reasons: First, since small firms have a lower portfolio of financial resources they can use to compete in the market, leveraging their investments in social media capability and business analytics talent to manage knowledge remains central, in comparison to large firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018)</ref>. Second, most prior IS research on social media and business activities has focused on large firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Luo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kane, Palmer et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>To check whether our sample met the minimum required size to examine the proposed model's effects, we performed a statistical power analysis prior to data collection. Assuming an anticipated medium effect size (f2 = 0.150), to achieve a statistical power of 0.800, five predictors (i.e., the number of effects received by knowledge exploration), and an alpha of 0.05, the minimum required size for our sample was 91 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Social Media Capability</head><p>Social media capability is a composite second-order construct composed of three dimensions: Facebook capability, Twitter capability, and blog capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Culnan et al., 2010)</ref>. We used the firm's social media activities on Facebook, Twitter, and corporate blog(s) because they serve as a good proxy to evaluate social media capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Braojos et al., 2019)</ref>. It is rational to expect that firms develop a social media capability by experimenting and executing a high number of social media activities. These social media activities refer to activities performed by the firm and do not include the posts of the social media users, thus removing customer engagement metrics from social media capability measurements. The measurement and conceptualization focus on the firm's social media activities. Facebook, Twitter, and blogs are three of the most relevant external social media platforms used by companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Benitez, Ruiz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Culnan et al., 2010)</ref>. We measured social media capability based on the validated measure scheme from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Benitez, Castillo et al. (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Benitez, Ruiz et al. (2020)</ref> with data collected in 2014.</p><p>Facebook capability was evaluated as a composite first-order construct based on the following ingredients: number of events, experience, and updates, using information from the firm's Facebook site. 74% of the firms of the sample had a Facebook site; if a firm did not have a Facebook site, each of the specific ingredients of Facebook capability was coded as 0. One of these ingredients is the number of events organized on Facebook by the company. Facebook events refer to the number of past and future upcoming calendar-based occasions, such as celebrations, meetings, conferences, and showings organized by a company. From the point at which the firm's Facebook site was created until the end of the data collection period (2014), the sample firms organized 5.510 events, on average. The second ingredient of Facebook capability was the firm's experience using Facebook. Firms likely develop the ability to use and leverage Facebook through experience, trial and error, and experimentation. Facebook experience was measured as the average number of months that the firm had been operating on Facebook, from the creation of the Facebook firm's site until 2014, with information collected from the Twopcharts database. On average, the sample firms had 33.773 months of experience using Facebook. The final ingredient used to asses Facebook capability was the firm's update activity, which refers to the firm's activity in updating content on its Facebook site. The logic of this measure is that companies that frequently update their site likely have high Facebook capabilities. We measured the frequency of updates with a score of 1 (low) to 5 (high), based on when the firm made its last comment on Facebook-1: more than one month ago, 2: in the last month, 3: two weeks ago, 4: in the last week, or 5: in the last two days) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benitez, Castillo et al., 2018)</ref>. The average update activity score among the sample firms was 2.740.</p><p>Twitter capability was operationalized as a composite first-order construct using three indicators: time spent writing tweets,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> experience, and updates using information collected from the firm's site in the Twitter and Twopcharts databases. 71% of the sample firms had a Twitter site. If a firm did not have a Twitter site, each of the specific Twitter capability ingredients was coded as 0.</p><p>The spent time writing tweets refers to the average number of hours the firm spent writing tweets from the creation of the firm's Twitter site until 2014. This ingredient is likely a good indicator of Twitter capability because it measures the time a company invests in learning to use and leverage Twitter. On average, the sample firms invested 17.280 hours on Twitter. Experience and updates were measured in the same way as for Facebook capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Braojos et al., 2019)</ref>. On average, the sample firms had 35.752 months of experience using Twitter and an update activity score of 2.750.</p><p>Blog capability: Following the measurement scheme validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Benitez, Castillo et al. (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Benitez, Ruiz et al. (2020)</ref>, we measured blog capability through a construct composed of firm experience and firm updates on the blog(s) using data collected from the firm's blog(s). We accessed the firm's blog by using a direct firm website link to the corporate blog used by firms to interact with their customers and other stakeholders. 35% of the firms of the sample had a corporate blog. If a firm did not have corporate blog(s), each of the specific blog capability ingredients was coded as 0. Experience and updates were measured in the same way as for Facebook capability. On average, the sample firms had 17.266 months of experience using their corporate blog and an update activity of 1.255.</p></div>

This confirmatory composite analysis analyzes the composite model's adequacy, comparing the empirical correlation matrix and the model-implied correlation matrix. It shows whether the structure of the measurements (the saturated model) is correct.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Evaluation of the Measurement Properties</head><p>The constructs of our model (social media capability, knowledge exploration, knowledge exploitation, business analytics talent) are composite. Thus, we evaluated their multicollinearity, weights, loadings, and level of significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cenfetelli &amp; Bassellier, 2009)</ref>, by running a bootstrap analysis using 4,999 subsamples. To ensure that multicollinearity is not a problem, the variance inflation factor (VIF) must be below the suggested threshold of 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Tanriverdi &amp; Uysal, 2015)</ref>. For weights estimated by Mode A, an assessment of multicollinearity is not necessary, as they are scaled covariances and therefore ignore multicollinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Rigdon, 2012)</ref>. Higher VIFs for knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation (both constructs estimated by Mode A) are not a problem in the proposed model. The VIFs of the proposed model's indicators/dimensions, which are estimated by Sum Score, ranged from 1.000 to 1.470, suggesting that multicollinearity is not a problem in our data <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018)</ref>. All indicators/dimensions of the model have significant weights (ranging from 0.133*** to 0.714*** for indicators, and from 0.483*** to 0.483*** for dimensions) and significant loadings (ranging from 0.508*** to 0.979*** for indicators, and from 0.520*** to 0.780*** for dimensions). We performed the two-step approach to estimate the proposed model since social media capability is a second-order construct. First, we freely correlated all the first-order constructs and dimensions of the second-order constructs to obtain the dimensions' latent variables scores. Second, we used these latent variables scores as the ingredients that compose social media capability.</p><p>We executed the following weighting scheme in our estimation. First, we started the estimation by using Mode B for all constructs. Second, we employed Mode A for those constructs with VIF values higher than 10 and/or negative weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018)</ref>. Finally, we selected Sum Score as the preferred weighting scheme of some of the constructs, as suggested by the incremental improvements in the overall fit of the estimated model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020)</ref>. The measurement model evaluation is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">7</ref>.

These results mean that with a probability of 5%, we can claim that the proposed research model of social media and knowledge exploration and exploitation is correct for explaining how the corporate and IT world functions.  The dominant indicator approach can be executed in the ADANCO software package and refers to the indicator of a construct that is expected to correlate with the construct positively. It represents the most important ingredient of the composite construct when this information is known or assumed theoretically before the estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020)</ref>. None of the constructs/indicators was considered as the dominant in our PLS estimation because we preferred to let the data and the analysis dictate the weights of the ingredients for each construct freely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Test of Hypotheses</head><p>To test the hypothesized relationships, we performed a PLS estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dijkstra &amp; Henseler, 2015b)</ref> to evaluate the beta coefficients and their significance for the proposed model by running a bootstrap analysis with 4,999 subsamples. The R2 values and the effect size (f2) of the proposed relationships were also evaluated. First, we evaluated a baseline model to test H1 and H2. This baseline model describes the base relationships, including all control variables and excluding the moderator variable (business analytics talent). Second, we tested Model 1, which includes business analytics talent and adds the interaction terms (social media capability x Business analytics talent) to the baseline model to test H3. H1 and H2 are supported, suggesting that social media capability enables knowledge exploration (H1) (β = 0.270, p &lt; 0.001), and knowledge exploitation (H2) (β = 0.134, p &lt; 0.01). H3 is also supported, which suggests that the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration is amplified (positively moderated and reinforced) when the firm has business analytics talent (β = 0.584, p &lt; 0.01). Thus, business analytics talent plays a reinforcing moderator role in this relationship.</p><p>Control variables did not show any significant relationship with knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation in our model's context, except industry. The relationships between industry and knowledge exploration and industry and knowledge exploitation are positive and significant, suggesting that firms of services industries explore and exploit knowledge more than firms of manufacturing industries. The R 2 values are 0.177 and 0.060 for the baseline model and 0.750 and 0.060 for Model 1. The f 2 values of the key relationships of the proposed model range from 0.079 to 0.017 for the baseline model and from 0.017 to 0.136 for Model 1, which indicate from weak to medium-large effect sizes between the exogenous and endogenous variables of the proposed theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cohen, 1988)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Robustness Testing</head><p>We tested for the robustness of the proposed research model by estimating eight alternative/competing models. In the first alternative model, social media capability affects knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and business analytics talent moderates both the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration and the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploitation. The rationale for this model is that firms may additionally use analytical skills to assimilate and exploit knowledge (e.g., making predictions). In the second alternative model, social media capability affects knowledge ambidexterity (i.e., a composite first-order construct composed of two indicators: knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation), and business analytics talent moderates the relationship between social media capability and knowledge ambidexterity. The rationale for this research model is to examine the effects of social media and business analytics talent in the simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation (i.e., knowledge ambidexterity).</p><p>In the third alternative model, social media capability affects knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, which affect firm performance, retaining the moderating role of business analytics talent in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. The rationale for this research model is to examine the final and full effects on firm performance. In the fourth alternative model, social media capability enables knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and knowledge exploration facilitates knowledge exploitation, preserving the moderating role of business analytics talent. <ref type="bibr">Benitez, Llorens et al. (2018)</ref> found that firms explore business opportunities first and then exploit opportunities through operational capabilities (the company's heart and core). Drawing on <ref type="bibr">Benitez, Llorens et al. (2018)</ref>, the rationale for this fourth alternative research model is that knowledge exploration may precede knowledge exploitation. In the fifth alternative model, social media capability enables knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, knowledge exploration facilitates knowledge exploitation, and business analytics talent moderates both the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration and the relationship between knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation.</p><p>In the sixth alternative model, we measure Facebook capability, Twitter capability, and blog capability with experience and updates, that is, with homogeneous measurements, but every other model specification stays the same. The seventh alternative model controls for advertising spending on knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation. The rationale is that the development of social media capability and its effects on knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation may be affected by the firm's marketing activities.</p><p>Finally, the eighth alternative model combines the model specifications of the second and seventh alternative models but estimates knowledge ambidexterity by multiplying knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation. The next section presents the results of the estimation of these eight alternative models.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Business Analytics Talent as Moderator between Social Media Capability and Knowledge Exploitation</head><p>In the first alternative model, we assume that social media capability affects knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and that business analytics talent moderates both relationships (i.e., social media capability affects knowledge exploration and social media capability affects knowledge exploitation). The rationale for testing this model is that business analytics talent may enable firms to extract, monitor, and analyze unstructured existing/new knowledge to be reused, transformed, applied, and leveraged in the firm, which may reinforce the effect of social media capability on knowledge exploitation. This first alternative model yielded results similar to those obtained in the proposed model, but the moderating effect of business analytics talent in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploitation was not significant (β = -0.476). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">10</ref> shows the results of this robustness model, indicating that business analytics talent does not amplify the effect of social media capability on knowledge exploitation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">The Relationship between Social Media Capability and Knowledge Ambidexterity</head><p>In the second alternative model, we propose that social media capability affects knowledge ambidexterity, and business analytics talent moderates the relationship between social media capability and knowledge ambidexterity. Thus, we examine the potential enabling role of social media capability on knowledge ambidexterity and the potential amplifying role of business analytics talent in this relationship. We operationalized knowledge ambidexterity as a composite first-order construct composed of two indicators: knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation. Results show that the link between social media capability and knowledge ambidexterity in the baseline model (i.e., a model describing the base relationship between social media capability and knowledge ambidexterity, including all control variables and excluding business analytics talent) was positive and significant (β = 0.285, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the moderating effect of business analytics talent in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge ambidexterity was positive and significant (β = 0.524, p &lt; 0.05). The results of this empirical analysis suggest that firms effectively using social media simultaneously explore and exploit knowledge, and that business analytics talent amplifies the impact of social media capability on knowledge ambidexterity. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">11</ref> presents the results of this alternative model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">The Relationship between Knowledge Exploration and Knowledge Exploitation and Firm Performance</head><p>In the third alternative model, we propose that social media capability affects knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, which affects firm performance, preserving the moderating role of business analytics talent in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. Prior research has suggested a firm's knowledge management activities as a source of superior firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Lee et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Tanriverdi, 2005)</ref>. The ability to bring new knowledge from social media to the firm (i.e., knowledge exploration) increases the diversity and heterogeneity of the firm's knowledge pool and the possibilities of new knowledge combinations, thus improving firm performance such as innovation performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Katila &amp; Ahuja, 2002)</ref>. When the discovered knowledge is exploited and leveraged, the firm creates business value (e.g., converting new knowledge in product and process innovation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Benitez, Llorens et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, Lubatkin et al., 2006)</ref>. In this alternative model, we operationalized firm performance in terms of financial performance, marketing performance, and innovation performance. To measure financial performance and marketing performance, we collected data from the Datastream database from 2014 to 2018. To measure innovation performance, we collected data from the US Patent and Trademark Office in the same period. The links between knowledge exploration and firm performance (β = 0.145, p &lt; 0.05), and knowledge exploitation and firm performance (β = 0.256, p &lt; 0.001) are positive and significant. Therefore, the empirical analysis results for this alternative model suggest that firms effectively use social media to explore and exploit knowledge. The firm's proficiency in exploring new knowledge and exploiting existing/new knowledge enables the firm to improve performance. Since the analysis of the effects of knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation on firm performance goes beyond the goal of this paper and has already been explored in prior IS research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kathuria et al. 2016)</ref>, we kept this model only in the robustness check.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4">The Relationship between Knowledge Exploration and Knowledge Exploitation</head><p>In the fourth alternative model, we assume that social media capability affects knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and knowledge exploration affects knowledge exploitation preserving the moderating role of business analytics talent in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. The theoretical argument to test this model is based on prior studies, suggesting that exploration enables exploitation in different contexts.</p><p>Evidence supports the effect of exploration on exploitation in the context of business opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Benitez, Llorens et al., 2018)</ref> and the context of mergers and acquisitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Benitez, Ray et al., 2018)</ref>. However, in the specific context of knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, in our sample of small US firms, we did not find a significant relationship between knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation (β = 0.071). Future research should explore the relationship between knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation in firms of different sizes and geographic contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.5">Business Analytics Talent as Moderator between Knowledge Exploration and Knowledge Exploitation</head><p>In the fifth alternative model, we assume that social media capability affects knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and knowledge exploration affects knowledge exploitation, keeping the moderator role of business analytics talent in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration and adding a moderator role of business analytics talent in the relationship between knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation. The rationale for testing this model is that business analytics talent can be the pivotal complementary resource to move explored social media-enabled knowledge into exploited knowledge. This additional analysis might explain the lack of support for the effect of knowledge exploration on knowledge exploitation in the fourth alternative model. 11 However, in this alternative model, the moderating effect of business analytics talent in the relationship between knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation was not significant (β = -0.413). Future IS research should explore the relationship between knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation and the potential moderator role of business analytics talent in firms of different sizes (e.g., small European firms) and geographic contexts (e.g., Asian companies).</p></div>

In the sixth alternative model, we measure Facebook capability, Twitter capability, and blog capability using experience and updates only-that is, using homogeneous measurements-with every other model specification kept the same. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">13</ref> presents the results of this alternative model.

Prior IS literature considers social media to be a key source of information and data <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Leonardi, 2014)</ref>. However, acquiring and generating social media data is not a sufficient condition for creating business value. Monitoring, analyzing, and identifying relevant information is key in transforming social media data into valuable information, knowledge, and business gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ransbotham et al., 2015)</ref>. Firms face difficulties in efficiently selecting and assimilating social media data and converting them into business benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chan et al., 2016)</ref>. We propose that firms with social media capability can exploit and explore knowledge. Moreover, we argue that the effective application of social media data in business activities can be achieved if firms explore and exploit knowledge and leverage</p><p>12 Some of the alternative theoretical explanations were not supported by the empirical analysis, and none of the eight alternative models of the robustness check yields a better overall fit of the estimated model in the context of our sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Benitez, Henseler et al., 2020)</ref>. In this sense, we can conclude that none of these alternative models provide a better theoretical model to explain how business analytics talent. This study analyzed the impact of social media capability on knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation and examined the potential moderator role of business analytics talent. The proposed research model was tested using a unique set of archival data from a sample of US firms. After checking eight additional alternative explanations/research models in robustness testing, we are confident that the empirical analysis strongly supports our proposed research model. 12   How does social media capability influence knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation? The empirical analysis results show that social media capability enables firms to explore and exploit knowledge because social media are new organizational channels capable of facilitating knowledge management (e.g., acquiring and transferring new knowledge; recombining, modifying, and integrating new/existing knowledge). Social media capability helps firms acquire knowledge from customers, competitors, and suppliers. In this way, social media capability and business analytics talent function in companies and help them to create business value. The results of the estimation of these eight alternative models provide additional robustness and credibility to the findings of our study.</p><p>firms can identify valuable information from suppliers, competitors, and customers and apply and leverage this useful information to achieve improvements in firm performance. Even though we find that social media capability enables both the exploration and exploitation of knowledge, the effect is greater for knowledge exploration than for knowledge exploitation, suggesting that social media plays a more important role in exploring new knowledge than in exploiting existing knowledge. Furthermore, our results show that business analytics talent amplifies the impact of social media capability on knowledge exploration by helping firms quickly create meaningful new knowledge from unstructured information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Dong and Yang (2020)</ref> find that social media diversity and big data analytics have a positive interaction effect on market performance, which is more salient for small than for large firms. Our findings are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Dong and Yang's (2020)</ref> work. We show that business analytics talent is a valuable IT resource that can help firms convert unstructured social data (captured through social media capability) into useful new knowledge to be explored, shared, and stored. In this sense, the empirical analysis supports our proposed research model.</p><p>Based on our robustness testing, we obtained additional results regarding how knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation (driven by social media capability and amplified by business analytics talent) affect firm performance. Both exploration and exploitation have been found to help firms increase their business benefits. Organizational knowledge is a resource that is difficult to imitate and may be a source of competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alavi &amp; Leidner, 2001</ref>). As an illustrative example of the role of social media and knowledge management in improving firm performance, Dell created a social media platform (<ref type="url" target="http://ww.ideastorm.com/">http://ww.ideastorm.com/</ref>) to acquire and exploit social data from their customers that enabled their customers to submit ideas, vote for other ideas, and comment on the ideas of other customers. Dell managed customers' data to implement the best ideas (e.g., biodegradable packing material), which led to improved firm performance. This shows how effective exploration and exploitation of knowledge can provide an excellent return on firm investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Dong &amp; Wu, 2015)</ref>. Indeed, our results suggest that knowledge exploitation has a greater effect on firm performance than knowledge exploration, which is rational and consistent with prior IS research <ref type="bibr">(Benitez, Llorens et al., 2018)</ref>. The acquisition creation of new knowledge are related to sensing new business opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Benitez, Llorens et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Cui et al., 2019)</ref> and affect firm performance. However, the biggest effect on firm performance is realized once the company assimilates, uses, and exploits the knowledge related to the exploitation of business opportunities. Therefore, it is rational to expect that the effect on firm performance of using, leveraging, and applying knowledge (knowledge exploitation) is greater than the creation, sharing, and storage of knowledge (knowledge exploration).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Key Contributions to IS Research</head><p>This study draws on IS literature on knowledge management and the business value of social media to link social media capability and firms' knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation. This paper contributes to IS research in three ways. First, although the crucial challenge for organizations is to learn how they can develop the ability to effectively select, use, and leverage external social media in order to scan, learn, and internalize knowledge, it remains rather unclear how companies can develop social media capabilities and create business value based on these capabilities. Prior IS research has largely focused on understanding employees' knowledge sharing behavior in enterprise social media (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beck et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Leonardi)</ref>, user-generated content, and customer engagement in diffusing information on social media platforms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bapna et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast to prior IS research on this topic, which has emphasized the employee, customer, and user as units of analysis, we focus on the organizational level. We develop the concept of social media capability, explain it theoretically, provide a set of measures that can be built with archival data, and offer empirical evidence on how firms can explore and exploit knowledge from social media. This is the primary contribution of this manuscript to IS research.</p><p>Second, although a firm's business analytics talent may perform a critical role in understanding and acquiring new knowledge from big data on customers in social media, this plausible effect has been undertheorized in IS research. Prior IS research has focused mainly on the impact of big data analytics capability on competitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Mikalef et al., 2020)</ref> and on its reinforcing role to create synergies and improve market performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Dong &amp; Yang, 2020)</ref>. We believe that the extant literature overemphasizes the importance of analytics software and minimizes the significance of people and analytics talent <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Conboy et al., 2020)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations and Avenues for Future IS Research</head><p>This paper also has some limitations, which also suggest excellent avenues for further IS research. First, these results can only be generalized to small firms in the US market. Future IS research could investigate whether the proposed research model is also supported in different geographic markets and larger companies. Second, we restricted our focus to a limited number of external social media platforms. This approach implies that the effects explored by this study on knowledge exploration and exploitation can only be associated with firms' external social media. Although we examined three of the most popular external social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Braojos et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Culnan et al., 2010)</ref>, our research does not explore enterprise/internal social media platforms (e.g., Microsoft Yammer, Facebook Workplace) and other important external social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn). Moreover, cultural differences may influence how firms leverage social media capability and business analytics talent. We encourage IS scholars to investigate these potential differences in future IS studies. For instance, exploring how the external social media platforms used by Chinese firms (e.g., WeChat) and the digital ecosystem of Chinese firms/customers are different from those used by US firms/customers could be an interesting topic for future impactful IS research. Further, IS research could extend this study by examining enterprise social media platforms and other new external social media platforms and including them in conceptualizing social media capability. Third, we are confident that the ingredients used to assess Facebook capability, Twitter capability, and blog capability represent a good proxy to evaluate these constructs, which has also been supported by the confirmatory composite analysis. However, we recognize that our measurements of these constructs may present some "noise" between the conceptualization and the measurements, which is typical when a study uses secondary data. Future IS research could develop perceptual measures for social media capability and validate them through a confirmatory composite/factor analysis, which would offer a valuable means of replicating our study results.</p><p>Fourth, the development of social media capability and its exploitation to create business value may be contingent on the firm's social media governance mechanisms. How could the firm's governance structure best maximize the value creation from social media? Future IS research could theorize and empirically examine the effects of social media governance mechanisms on social media's business value. This seems an excellent research topic to explore in future IS research. Fifth, we found a greater effect of social media capability on knowledge exploration than on knowledge exploitation, which offers an opportunity for future research to theorize on moderators of the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploitation that firms may need, and organizational capabilities that could mediate this relationship. We encourage IS scholars interested in this research topic to theorize and investigate organizational capabilities that can exploit existing knowledge. Finally, this study conceptualizes and finds discriminant validity between social media capability and business analytics talent. However, some IS scholars may consider these concepts to be closely related or even part of each other if they focus on a more general concept such as IT-enabled information management capability. We thus call for further knowledge discovery to address this debate, which represents another exciting avenue for IS research.</p><p>Nevertheless, this paper has the capacity to change some of the existing paradigms in IS research in two directions. The first potential change is methodological. The current scenario of IS research provides us with the opportunity to build innovative datasets and search for confirmatory IS research. We hope this study inspires other IS scholars to use our secondary data-based measurements and test their consistency and adequacy through an overall fit evaluation of the saturated model. This study also shows that IS research can confirm the proposed research model through the estimated model's overall fit evaluation. We introduce the ADANCO software package, explain when it could be used, and illustrate how to use it for confirmatory IS research in the research stream of the business value of IT.</p><p>The second potential change is related to digital capabilities. The design and execution of digital transformation strategies have become "a must" for companies. This strategic imperative has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, exploring new digital resources will require new digital capabilities for firms. These new digital capabilities (e.g., leveraging artificial intelligence, 5G, blockchain) have the capacity to serve business activities and maximize business benefits. However, many of these new digital capabilities will need to be conceptualized and tested empirically in isolation from prior IT capabilities, as was done in this study with social media capability and business analytics talent. We hope this paper inspires others in this direction. In the words of Coco Channel, "I do not do fashion. I am fashion"; similarly, IS research does not do fashionable research, IS research is fashion. Future paradigms in IS research may involve "unframed thinking." Who wishes to take up this challenge?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Key Lessons Learned for IT and Business Executives</head><p>The findings of this study also provide important lessons learned for IT and business executives. First, developing social media capability enables firms to explore and exploit knowledge. Executives should be aware of the potential benefits associated with the usage of external social media to acquire customer, competitor, and supplier data. Companies can also use social media to promote their products and initiatives to collect valuable opinions, preferences, suggestions for improvement, ideas from customers and suppliers, and competitor's strategic information. Social media can also be leveraged to co-create knowledge with customers and suppliers. Thus, this study suggests that managers should invest, deploy, and leverage social media to acquire and exploit knowledge. For example, Grupo Expansion (a leading Mexican communication industry holding) has the capacity to use external social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to reach potential customers, run marketing campaigns, and acquire knowledge from current customers and competitors, thus enabling the exploration of new knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Hootsuite, 2020b)</ref>.</p><p>Second, firms can amplify the impact of social media capability on knowledge exploration if they recruit, develop, and retain business analytics talent. This study shows evidence of strategies that can be deployed to win the war for top tech talent. Executives should be aware of the importance of employing specialized business analytics experts, keeping in mind the expected shortage of this market talent. Since business analytics talent is scarce, companies should go the extra mile to attract, retain, and develop such talent (e.g., by developing an outstanding employer branding) and be willing to train those with high potential. Firms with high levels of business analytics talent are in a position to benefit more from social media since social media capability and business analytics talent reinforce each other to attain better knowledge exploration. The new knowledge created and captured today will constitute the base of the firm's future exploitation activities, which will help to ensure the future survival of the firm. Grupo Expansion also uses business analytics talent to convert external social media data into useful new knowledge. They use Hootsuite Analytics to assess social media metrics (e.g., number of followers and clicks, customer engagement) to better create content and acquire customer knowledge. Andrea Sanchez, the senior specialist of digital products of Grupo Expansion, made the following statement, which is consistent with our findings: "Analytics helps our team to convert data into useful information and specific recommendations.</p><p>Our digital team can make strategic decisions based on business intelligence, and we are obtaining business benefits" <ref type="bibr">(Hootsuite, 2020b, p. 3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Core Conclusions</head><p>Social media are disruptive IT resources that can transform firms digitally, build a seamless digital business strategy, and help ensure firms' long-term survival in the digital disruption era. This paper proposes a research model on social media capability, knowledge exploration, knowledge exploitation, and business analytics talent, finding that social media capability enables firms to explore new knowledge and exploit existing knowledge. We also discovered that business analytics talent reinforces the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. Although social media data have become a gold mine for business intelligence, companies need business analytics talent to reveal useful new knowledge. By drawing on the lens of knowledge exploration and exploitation and business analytics talent, we offer a new theoretical explanation and empirical evidence to the IS research community by investigating social media's business value through knowledge exploration and exploitation. Of course, IT does matter.
