<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While business analytics is being increasingly used to gain data-driven insights to support decision-making, little research exists regarding the mechanism through which business analytics can be used to improve decision-making effectiveness at the organisational level. Drawing on the information processing view and contingency theory, this paper develops a research model linking business analytics to organisational decision-making effectiveness. The research model is tested using structural equation modelling based on 740 responses collected from UK businesses. The key findings demonstrate that business analytics, through the mediation of a data-driven environment, positively influences information processing capabilities, which in turn have a positive effect on decision-making effectiveness. The findings also demonstrate that the paths from business analytics to decision-making effectiveness have no statistical differences between large and medium companies but some differences between manufacturing and professional service industries. Our findings contribute to the business analytics literature by providing useful insights into business analytics applications and the facilitation of data-driven decision-making. They also contribute to managers' knowledge and understanding by demonstrating how business analytics should be implemented to improve decision-making effectiveness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Business analytics (BA) refers to "the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions" <ref type="bibr">[1, pp. 7]</ref>. The concept of BA was initially developed in the mid-1950s and has been widely examined over the years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. However, BA has recently re-emerged as an important area of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Several key reasons can be identified for the growing importance of BA. First, the advances in information technology (IT) have enabled businesses to develop innovative ways to collect data from both internal and external sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This leads to the unprecedented challenges of big data, characterised by "high volume, high velocity, and/or high variety" <ref type="bibr">[4, pp. 1249</ref>], as processing big data is difficult and requires new and advanced technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. At the same time, big data offers remarkable business opportunities for organisations to gain useful insights into customers and operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Consequently, BA, based on sophisticated IT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, has been increasingly used by organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Second, organisations require BA to "gain an edge by making better or faster decisions" <ref type="bibr">[10, pp. 30]</ref> to face increasing competition and turbulence in their marketplaces due to the speed of technological advancement and globalisation. Third and most importantly, the confluence of big data, advances in IT, and BA, has brought decisionmaking to a completely new level that is ever so data-driven, allowing managers to see what was previously invisible <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This represents "a qualitative change in opportunities to generate value and competitive advantage", and to enable decision-making move towards "territory which has historically been seen as reliant on human judgment" <ref type="bibr">[12, pp. 288-289]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the importance of BA and data-driven decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, surprisingly little academic research has been conducted to understand BA as an emerging field of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, little is known about the mechanisms through which BA improves decisionmaking. As many companies are still struggling to figure out how to use analytics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>,</p><p>the absence of such an understanding limits the ability of businesses to effectively leverage BA for value creation. Until the mechanisms through which BA influences organisational decision-making is better understood, realising business value from BA remains a challenge. This paper therefore aims to reduce this research gap by developing an understanding of the mechanisms through which BA improves decision-making effectiveness that is the extent to which a decision results in desired outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Drawing on the information processing view and contingency theory, this paper develops and empirically tests a path model to explain how BA and other organisational factors work together to enhance decisionmaking effectiveness.</p><p>Although contingency theory and the information processing view have been used</p><p>previously to understand the impact of IT on organisations, no research based on these two theories has been conducted to date to examine the emerging BA and its impact on decisionmaking effectiveness. Thus, this research seeks to contribute to the literature by developing a research model in which relevant constructs regarding BA's impact on decision-making effectiveness are conceptualised and tested. To evaluate this research model empirically, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is used, based on 740 responses that are collected from an online questionnaire survey of UK businesses. A multigroup analysis is also conducted to understand whether industry and firm size moderate the relationships hypothesised in the research model. This study shows that BA supported with a data-driven environment will lead to the development of information processing capabilities, which in turn have a major impact on organisational decision-making and decision-making effectiveness. This research will also contribute to managers' knowledge and understanding of BA and its impact thereby to improve organisational decision-making.</p><p>The next section of the paper presents the literature review, the research model, and hypotheses. The subsequent sections describe the instrument development and the data collection processes, and report on the findings. The final section discusses the results and implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>This section begins with defining the key terms to be used in this paper and then develops hypotheses regarding the effect of BA on decision-making effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Key concepts defined</head><p>From the information processing view <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, the key task for organisations is to manage uncertainty such as task complexity and the rate of environmental change through deploying mechanisms of information processing. The information processing view emphasises the importance of matching information processing requirements with information processing capabilities: the greater the task uncertainty, the greater amount of information that has to be processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Therefore, organisations should design its structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to facilitate information processing to enable decision makers to process a great amount of data, thereby to inform decision-making, reduce costs, and improve organisational performance. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> demonstrates that the interactive effect of information processing needs and information processing capabilities has a significant effect on performance in an inter-organisational supply chain context. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> shows that there is a positive relationship between inter-firm information processing capabilities and supply chain company performances. Thus, an organisation is expected to be more effective when its information processing requirements are matched by its information processing capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The concept of information processing capabilities is initially used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> without a definition to outline the information processing view of organisational design. These terms are adopted by <ref type="bibr">[17, pp. 614</ref>] to further develop the information processing view, while information processing is defined as "the gathering, interpreting, and synthesis of information in the context of organizational decision making". Based on the information processing view and BA studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, information processing capabilities of an organisation can be defined as its capacities to capture, integrate and analyse data and information, and use the insights gained from data and information in the context of organisational decision-making.</p><p>The next key concept to be discussed is an organisation's data-driven environment that is the organisational practices reflected by developing explicit strategy and policy to guide analytic activities and designing its structure and processes to enable and facilitate BA activities. <ref type="bibr">[21, pp. 22]</ref> suggests that "for analytics-driven insights to be consumed-that is, to trigger new actions across the organization--they must be closely linked to business strategy, easy for end-users to understand and embedded into organizational processes so action can be taken at the right time". Similarly, it is argued that it is vital to develop an "analytically driven strategy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, relevant business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and organisational structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> so that BA can be embedded into organisational practices thereby to improve decision-making and decision-making effectiveness. Otherwise, "a company will not know on which data to focus, how to allocate analytic resources, or what it is trying to accomplish in a data-toknowledge initiative" <ref type="bibr">[7, pp. 122</ref>]. Thus, in order for an organisation to use BA effectively to create business value, a data-driven environment must be created by developing specific organisational strategy, policy, structure, and business processes to support and enable BA activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, data-driven decision-making can be defined as the extent to which an organisation is open to new ideas that challenge current practice based on data-driven insight;</p><p>has the data to make decisions; and depends on data-based insights for decision-making and the creation of new service or product <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Hence, decision-making effectiveness can be specified as the extent to which a company is more effective than its competitors at making real-time decisions, responding to change, and understanding customers, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">BA and information processing capabilities</head><p>Prior BA studies [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> suggest that the application of BA in an organisation is likely to enhance the organisation's abilities to process data and to use the insights derived from that data to make effective decisions, thereby to improve organisational performance.</p><p>Thus, based on the definition of BA and that of information processing capabilities, we propose:</p><p>H1: BA has a positive and direct effect on information processing capabilities.</p><p>However, the causal link from BA to information processing capabilities is much more complex than this direct relationship could describe. Prior BA studies have indicated that in order for a business to benefit from BA, simultaneously the business needs to develop a datadriven environment to support BA applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Essentially this suggests a degree of fit between BA and a data-driven environment, and the nature and the importance of this fit can be better understood drawing on contingency theory.</p><p>Contingency theory defines fit as "the degree to which the needs, demands, goals, objectives, and/or structures of one component are consistent with the needs, demands, goals, objectives, and/or structures of another component" <ref type="bibr">[24, pp. 45]</ref>, and conjectures that performance is a consequence of that fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Contingency theory has been extensively applied to examining the relationships between, for example, IT, organisational factors, and organisational performance [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. These IT business value studies suggest that when IT and organisational factors are integrated, together they are seen to be able to generate various types of IT capabilities [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, which in turn enable an organisation to leverage technology to differentiate from competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Inspired by IT business value studies and drawing on extant BA studies, the fit between BA and a data-driven environment in an organisation can be argued to have a positive impact on the organisation's information processing capabilities. It can be expected that an organisation with a higher degree of fit between its BA and data-driven environment will outperform those with lower degree of fit;</p><p>and the better the fit, the stronger the information processing capabilities.</p><p>Regarding how this fit influences information processing capabilities, a mediation model of fit can be supported by the proposition that technology can be an important determinant of organisational processes and structure in research underpinned by contingency theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> argues that increasing technological complexity would require greater structural complexity for effective performance, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> suggests that technology can be a determinant of organisational processes and structure. Alternatively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> examines the relative routineness of work and advocated that organisational structure depends on technology. In line with this, it can be argued that BA applications are likely to bring about a data-driven environment embedded in and reflected by explicitly developing organisational strategy, policy, structure, and business processes to guide and enable BA activities, which will help develop information processing capabilities. Thus, it is proposed that H2: BA has a positive and indirect effect on information processing capabilities through the mediation of a data-driven environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data-driven environment, information processing capabilities and decisionmaking</head><p>Drawing on the information processing view, an organisation is more likely to make effective decisions when it designs its structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to facilitate its information processing capabilities thereby to meet its data processing requirements. For instance, the processing requirement of big data is complex as it involves dealing with data that are high in volume, variety, and velocity. This big data processing requirement is overwhelming to organisations since "it is very difficult for individuals to process large volumes of incoming information comprehensively" <ref type="bibr">[35, pp. 156]</ref>. It is also impossible for traditional systems to capture, store, and analyse big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>; rather, it requires new and innovative forms of information processing capabilities that are likely to be provided by BA with "advanced and unique data storage, management, analysis, and visualization</p><p>technologies" <ref type="bibr">[3, pp. 1166</ref>]. Therefore, in order for an organisation to meet its big data processing needs, it must develop its information processing capabilities through effective BA applications, which are enabled by developing an "analytically driven strategy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and designing relevant business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and organisational structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>When an organisation has developed strong information processing capabilities to match its data processing requirements, the organisation can be expected to have sufficient information and data-driven insights to allow it to evaluate its business practices, to make informed decisions not only to improve internal business efficiencies but also to create new products or services for customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, to achieve faster cycle times and greater flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>,</p><p>and/or to significantly improve its performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This is consistent with the strategic decision-making research. For example, it is expected that when a business has complete and accurate information about the relationship between choices and outcomes, it will be most likely to make successful decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, to generate viable organisational strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and to improve organisational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Therefore, it is proposed that H3: Information processing capabilities have a positive effect on a data-driven decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4:</head><p>Information processing capabilities have a positive and direct effect on decisionmaking effectiveness.</p><p>Furthermore, it has been widely recognised in the BA literature that the potentials of BA can only be realised when a data-driven environment is developed so that decisionmaking, strategy, and operations rely on data-driven insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. A data-driven environment is seen to help a company to have the data to make decisions, to be open to new ideas, to make decisions depending on fact-based insights, and to use fact-based insight for the creation of new service or product. Thus, it is proposed that H5: A data-driven environment is positively and directly associated with data-driven decision-making.</p><p>H6: Data-driven decision-making is positively associated with decision-making effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">The moderating effect of firm size and industry type</head><p>The relationship between IT and firm size is an important area of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Firm size matters because it may affect the relationship between IT and other organisational aspects such as the use and spending patterns of IT investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. This paper is particularly interested in whether firm size might affect the way organisations implement BA.</p><p>Prior research has reported in the IT context that firm size has a moderating effect on for example the total effects of quality system on final outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> or weakly on the performance relationship of advanced manufacturing technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In other areas of management research, the findings on the moderating impact of firm size are at variance [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Nevertheless, the impact of firm size should not be ignored. This research examines whether firm size moderates the paths from BA to decision-making effectiveness. As prior studies indicate that companies with different sizes behave differently regarding IT use and investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, it is thus proposed that H7: Firm size moderates the paths from BA to decision-making effectiveness.</p><p>Another important variable is industry type since firms in different industries often differ systematically regarding IT spending, needs for IT, and other organisational and technological conditions that are relevant to the way IT is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. While the impact of industry type on IT has received limited attention in IT research <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, prior studies in other research areas, however, have found support for the moderating effect of industry type on organisational performance [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. Similarly, it is expected that industry type is likely to play a moderating role in affecting BA applications. Thus, it is proposed that H8: Industry type moderates the paths from BA to decision-making effectiveness.</p><p>As a result, our research model can be summarised in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESEARCH METHOD</head><p>The hypotheses are tested based on survey data using PLS-SEM. PLS-SEM is recommended to be well suited for research situations where theory is less developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>  reflective and formative constructs, both of which are used in the research model. In the following section, we outline the instrument development, validation, and dissemination processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Research model constructs</head><p>To develop and test the research model, a number of constructs are identified and are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. As BA is still re-emerging as a new research area, there are few previously validated measurement items. Thus, five new formative constructs have been developed for this research based on literature on BA and IT business value.</p><p>To properly develop formative constructs is challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> as the scale development procedures suggested in the literature are limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Failing to define constructs properly may cause serious problems such as damaging the validity of the constructs and statistical conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and/or affecting theory development and theory testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. In order to avoid common misspecifications, we develop the five constructs based on the four decision rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>: the direction of causality between construct and indicators, the interchangeability of indicators, the covariation among indicators, and the nomological net for the indicators.</p><p>To make the development process more transparent and robust, the definition of BA is used as an example. Based on prior research [e.g., 3, 7, 9], BA is defined formatively by 13 different indicators in two stages: before and after data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Prior to data collection, the first decision rule considered is the direction of causality between BA and its analysing digital data are more likely to covary than those having different themes are. Thus BA seems to be multidimensional than unidimensional, which could be verified by conducting a factor analysis after data collection. Finally, regarding whether the indicators have the same antecedents and consequences, the answer is not necessary. For example using web analytics to analyse digital data may be driven by e-commerce initiatives while modelling can be enacted by any business practices; accordingly, their consequences may differ. This consideration again suggests that BA should be defined as a multidimensional construct. For example, indicators focusing on digital data analysis should be grouped together and defined as a reflective construct because they share a common theme and tend to be interchangeable; the same should also be applicable to indicators relating to modelling.</p><p>Thus, prior to data collection, it is seen to be more appropriate to define BA formatively as a higher-order component by a few lower-order reflective components. The reflective lowerorder components are then determined based on an exploratory factor analysis after data are collected, which is covered in Section 4.4. Similarly, other formative constructs are defined based on the four decision rules.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Respondent's profile</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> summarises the respondents' characteristics in terms of their organisational positions and years of experience in their current firms and industry. A key informant approach is used to collect data <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. The reported positions of the respondents suggest that 28% of the respondents are in a senior managerial position and the rest of them are middle managers. Based on their managerial positions, the respondents are highly likely to participate in decision-making processes related to the topic of the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Of all respondents, 49% have been with their firms for more than 10 years, whilst 86%</p><p>have been in the industry for more than 10 years. The respondents are from a number of different industries, for example 31% from manufacturing sector, 15% from professional services, and 8% from retail/wholesale. Overall, the sample of respondents seems to be diverse, representing various industry, managerial position and experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Common method and non-respondent bias</head><p>Common method bias that may affect the correlations between variables and cause biased parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> is assessed by conducting an exploratory factor analysis (EFA).</p><p>Harman's single-factor test is conducted by entering all independent and dependent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. If a single factor explains most of the variance of all the indicators, then the common method variance (CMV) associated with the data is high. Conversely, if more than one factor emerges to explain most of the communality, then the CMV associated with the data is low.</p><p>In this research, the test result shows that the first factor accounts for 33.22% of the total variance; there is no evidence of a substantial amount of CMV in the data.</p><p>To evaluate the presence of non-response bias, we conduct two tests. The first test compares the distributions of the position and company size of the respondents with those of the complete sampling frame (respondents plus non-respondents with e-mail addresses), based on the known value for the population approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, the position and company size of the respondents are the observed values, while the position and company size of the members of the full sampling frame are the expected values. If the observed and the expected values are significantly different, there is a bias between respondents and non-respondents. A nonparametric chi-square test comparing the distributions of the observed and expected values finds no significant differences. As a second test for non-response bias, we compares early (n=350) and late (n=390) respondents, based on the premise that early respondents represent the average respondent while late respondents represent the average non-respondent <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. All 29 indicators are evaluated by comparing the two groups through an independent t-test. The t-test results yield two statistically significant differences: MM1 (one of 13 BA indicators) scores are significant at the p=0.008&lt;0.05 (two-tailed) for early respondents (M=2.429, SD=1.2253) and late respondents (M=2.160, SD=1.0952); and OPEN1 (one of four data-driven decision-making indicators) scores are significant at the p= 0.033&lt;0.05 (two-tailed) for early respondents (M=4.013, SD=0.7515) and late respondents (M=4.155, SD=0.7732). However, for the rest of 27 indicators, the t-test result does not find significant difference between the two respondent groups. Consequently, nonresponse bias does not appear to be a major problem for the whole research while caution should be exercised in applying the findings.</p></div>

Of all 29 indicators, 26 of them are normally distributed, while three (FC1, KPI1, OPEN1) are not. This deviation from normality is not considered a major issue in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Exploratory factor analysis on BA applications</head><p>BA includes different techniques. In order to explore the dimensions of BA and classify various types of BA into meaningful categories, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using a principal component analysis with Varimax rotation (SPSS21). Consequently, three factors are identified from 13 BA techniques with 62.72% of total variance explained.</p><p>The first factor includes four BA techniques: statistical analysis, forecasting, query and analysis, and business reporting/KPIs. Since these statistical approaches are commonly used by organisations, thus we broadly name them as commonly used BA (CBA). The second factor includes six BA techniques: model management, optimisation, predictive modelling, simulation, interactive data visualisation, and data and text mining. We name them as modelbased BA (MBA) since modelling is the uniform essence of all these techniques. The third factor includes web analytics, social media analytics, and text-audio-video analytics. We name them as web-oriented BA (WBA) as they are used for analysing clickstream data and information collected mainly on the web. We are aware that while this classification provides a useful broad categorisation to facilitate communication, it needs to be further improved. For example, MBA includes data-and text mining that could be part of WBA and some organisations use web analytics more commonly. Detailed BA applications for each group are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. The EFA results are assessed based on the threshold values suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. The associated KMO with the EFA is 0.89, which is acceptable; Bartlett's Test is significant at p&lt;0.000, and all communalities are above 0.4, suggesting the appropriateness of the data.</p><p>Cronbach's alpha is 0.88, suggesting reliability. All factor loadings are above 0.30 with a sample of 740, suggesting convergent validity. In addition, the three factors identified namely CBA, MBA, and WBA make sense because variables similar in nature loaded together on the same factor, suggesting face validity. However, discriminant validity is not entirely satisfactory since three variables including query and analysis, text-audio-video analytics, and data and text mining have cross-loadings that are not different by more than 0.2. Yet, these three variables are retained since they provide useful information about BA and this is an exploratory research in nature.</p><p>Apart from developing a BA classification, this EFA analysis has also confirmed our previous discussion in Section 3.1 that BA should be defined as a multidimensional construct. Therefore, BA as a higher-order formative construct is finalised and defined by three lowerorder reflective constructs, namely, CBA, MBA, and WBA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Evaluation of the reflective measurement indicators</head><p>Our PLS-SEM model includes both formative and reflective constructs (only lower-order components). Following the recommendations made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, the reflective measurement model is evaluated by considering the internal consistency (composite reliability), indicator reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity.</p><p>Composite reliability (CR) scores summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> indicate that results based on these constructs are consistent since all constructs meet the recommended threshold value for acceptable reliability, that is, both CR and Cronbach's α should be large than 0.70. Indicator reliability is first assessed by observing the factor loadings and each indicator's variance, the former should be large than 0.70 and the latter should be no less than 0.50. All factor loadings are above 0.7 except that DTM1's loading is close to 0.7 and IDV1's loading is 0.7; and all variances are above 0.5 except that the variances of IDV1 and DTM1 are below 0.5. Therefore, indicator reliability is not entirely satisfactory but acceptable.</p><p>Convergent validity is also satisfactory since the average variance extracted (AVE) value for each construct in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> is no less than the recommended threshold value of 0.50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discriminant validity is satisfactory based on two tests. The first test is to analyse</head><p>Fornell-Larcker criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> to evaluate if the square root of AVE value for each construct is greater than the correlation of the construct with any other construct, which is true based on the comparison summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">6</ref>.</p><p>The second test is to observe if each reflective indicator loads highest on the construct it is associated with, which is also true (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>), thus demonstrating discriminant validity is satisfactory. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Assessment of formative measurement indicators</head><p>The formative measurement model is evaluated in terms of collinearity, the indicator weights, significance of weights, and the indicator loadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. To assess the level of collinearity, the variance inflation of factor (VIF) values of all formative constructs are evaluated (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>). The threshold value suggested for VIF is 3.3 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and 5 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>; thus, there are no collinearity issues.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">9</ref>. Except for AD1 and CUS1, all other indicators' outer weights are significant. When a formative indicator's outer weight is not significant, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> suggests that it should be kept if its outer loading is above 0.5. As AD1 and CUS1's outer loadings are above 0.5, they are retained, demonstrating each indicator's absolute contribution to the associated formative construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Hypothesis testing</head><p>SmartPLS 3 is used for testing the hypotheses and the results are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, the structural model is assessed in terms of collinearity and the significance and relevance of the structural model relationships. To assess collinearity issues, four sets of predictor constructs are evaluated in SPSS 21 based on the latent variable scores from SmartPLS 3. The VIF values are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">10</ref> and there are no collinearity issues.   The significance and relevance of the path coefficients are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. BA is significantly related to both data-driven environment (DDE) and information processing capabilities (IPC). Data-driven environment is strongly related to information processing capabilities, which in turn are significantly related to data-driven decision-making (DDM) and decision-making effectiveness (DME). Data-driven decision-making is significantly contributing to decision-making effectiveness.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">11</ref>, information processing capabilities have the strongest total effect on decision-making effectiveness, followed by data-driven environment, BA, and data-driven decision-making. A data-driven environment has the strongest total effect on information processing capabilities, followed by BA. The predictive power of the model can be assessed by observing the amount of variance attributed to the latent variables (i.e., R 2 ) and the value of the predictive relevance Q 2 , summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref>.</p><p>All Q 2 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref> are above zero, providing support for the model's predictive relevance regarding the latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The model's predictive power is reflected by the variables' R 2 values. When PLS-SEM is used in IT studies, the effect size suggested for R 2 is small=0.1, medium=0.25, and large=0.36 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. In line with this, the effect sizes of DDE and DDM can be classified as large; the effect sizes of DME and IPC are close to medium. The organisational structure, and business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">13</ref> summarise the results of hypothesis testing with the standardised path coefficients and p-values where appropriate. H1 suggests that BA has a positive and direct effect on information processing capabilities (IPC), which is supported as BA's effect on IPC is 0.106 (p&lt;0.05). H2 assumes that BA has an indirect effect on IPC through the mediation of a data-driven environment (DDE). To validate H2, the mediating role of data-driven environment on the relationship between BA and information processing capabilities was analysed, following the steps suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> but based on bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The relative size of the mediating effect is decided by calculating the variance accounted for (VAF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. The result of the analysis summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">14</ref> suggests that data-driven environment partially but strongly mediates the effect of BA on information processing capabilities; thus, H2 is supported.</p><p>H3 suggests that information processing capabilities have a positive effect on datadriven decision-making (DDM). As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">13</ref>, the effect of information processing capabilities on data-driven decision-making is 0.173 (p&lt;0.001); thus H3 is supported. H4 posits that information processing capabilities have a direct and positive effect on decisionmaking effectiveness (DME), which is supported as the effect of information processing capabilities on decision-making effectiveness is 0.399 at (p&lt;0.001). H5 suggests that datadriven environment has a direct and positive effect on data-driven decision-making, which in turn has a positive effect on decision-making effectiveness (H6). We find that the direct effect of data-driven environment on data-driven decision-making is 0.525 (p&lt;0.001) and the effect of data-driven decision-making on decision-making effectiveness is 0.167 (p&lt;0.001); thus, both H5 and H6 are supported.</p><p>H7 and H8 propose that firm size and industry type moderate the paths from BA to DME respectively. To understand whether firm size or industry type moderates the paths from BA to decision-making effectiveness, a PLS-SEM multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA) is conducted. When engaging in PLS-MGA, the number of observations in each group also needs to meet the minimum sample size requirement. In order to detect a minimum R 2 value of 0.25 in any of the constructs for a significant level of 1%, the minimum sample size required is 98 since the maximum number of arrows pointing at a construct is five in this research <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Thus, to test the moderating effect of firm size, we compare medium (n=524)</p><p>and large (n=216) companies; to test the moderating effect of industry type, we compare manufacturing (n=232) and professional services (n=108) industries. We are unable to compare others because the sample size for each of the other industries is below 98. The comparison between the hypothesised paths of medium (n=524) and large (n=216) companies indicates that company size has no moderating effect on the paths from BA to decision-making effectiveness because none of the p-values associated with the comparison is significant; thus, H7 is rejected Similarly, in order to assess the moderating effect of industry type on the paths from BA to decision-making effectiveness, the hypothesised paths are compared between manufacturing (n=232) and professional services (n=108). The comparison identifies that two of the seven paths are significantly different: the comparison p-value associated with the DDM to DME path is 0.012&lt;0.05 while the comparison p-value associated with the IPC to DDM path is 0.044&lt;0.05. Thus, there is some statistical difference between the paths of professional and manufacturing; H9 is weakly supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8">Testing the exogeneity of explanatory variables</head><p>Before we proceed to interpret the findings, a potential problem with our research is the endogeneity of explanatory variables in the research model, which may introduce a serious bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> that makes inferences problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. To validate our research, a Hausman test is conducted to show the exogeneity of the explanatory variables and the absence of the correlation between the explanatory variables and the error terms. This test uses instrumental variable (IV), which must be (a) strongly correlated with the independent variable and (b) independent of the error terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Three IVs are identified. The first IV is identifying problems and opportunities, which could result in the use of BA but is unlikely to lead to a data-driven environment (DDE) directly as the latter refers to the organisational strategy, structure, and business processes that are specifically developed to support and enable BA applications. A correlation analysis confirms that this IV is related to BA (p&lt; 0.05, 2-tailed) but not to DDE; therefore, identifying problems and opportunities is used as an IV for BA.</p><p>The second IV is routing gathering of opinions from clients that is part of BA application, which helps develop a data-driven environment based on contingency theory as we have discussed previously in section 2.2. Thus, the second IV is expected to relate to DDE but not to data-driven decision-making (DDM) directly since the latter is defined by a number of other factors, though it may use the insights gained from routing gathering of opinions from clients as part of decision input. A correlation analysis confirms that routing gathering of opinions from clients is related to DDE (p&lt; 0.05, 2-tailed) but not to DDM. Thus, routing gathering of opinions from clients is used as an IV for DDE. The third IV identified is the use of predictive analytics that is seen to provide useful input to support DDM but not likely to directly affect decision-making effectiveness (DME) since the latter is the combined result of data-driven decision-making and other organisational factors. A correlation analysis indicates that the use of predictive analytics is related to DDM (p&lt; 0.05, 2-tailed) but not to DME. Therefore, we use predictive analytics as IV for DDM. However, we are unable to find suitable IV for information processing capabilities (IPC). Using the three IVs, we attempt to conduct the Hausman test for each of the following four paths: BA→DDE, BA+DDE→IPC, DDE+IPC→DDM, and DDM+IPC→DME. The test result listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">15</ref> indicates that the explanatory variables in our model are not significantly endogenous, except that we are unable to test the exogeneity of IPC. Thus, the PLS estimation is seen to be acceptable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>The motivation of this study is to develop an understanding of the mechanisms through which BA improves decision-making effectiveness. While BA has recently re-emerged as an important area of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>; little is known about BA's impact on organisational decisionmaking as little academic research has been conducted to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>This study has based on prior BA literature, the information processing view and contingency theory to develop a path model to conceptualise and examine relevant concepts pertaining to BA and its impact on decision-making effectiveness. In the process of enhancing understanding of these concepts and their relationships, we believe our research offers original insights into how BA improves decision-making effectiveness.</p><p>First, we contribute to the literature on BA by developing an understanding of the mechanisms through which BA improves decision-making effectiveness. Although the importance of developing a data-driven environment and the potential of using BA to create business value have been indicated by prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, there is little conceptual understanding and empirical evidences to validate these assertions. This research advances our knowledge by developing a conceptual understanding underpinned by relevant theories and providing empirical evidence. By conceptualising the links between BA and decisionmaking effectiveness, our research directs attention to the complex interdependences between different organisational factors and the processes underlying BA applications. We have also provided empirical evidence to support the conceptualisation. The research findings show that BA has a positive effect on information processing capabilities directly and indirectly through the mediation of a data-driven environment. Then information processing capabilities will have a positive effect on data-driven decision-making, which positively improve decision-making effectiveness. On the one hand, this finding confirms the suggestions made in prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> that BA positively enhances information processing capabilities. On the other hand and more importantly, the findings show that, in addition to a direct effect, BA positively influences data-driven environment. By explicating such mechanisms, our research suggests that applying BA requires an organisation to have a data-driven environment simultaneously to support and enable BA activities; otherwise, BA applications are likely to be unproductive. We hope that our conceptualisation of the relationships between BA and other organisational factors will inspire others to conduct more research so that a deeper understanding of the domain can be developed.</p><p>Second, we add to the on-going debate surrounding the proposition that IT can be an important determinant of organisational factors underpinned by contingency theory [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Our empirical evidence suggests that facing the challenges of big data, increasing competition, and technological advancement, BA applications and their benefits will help organisations to realise that it is advantageous to develop appropriate strategy, structure and processes to guide and enable BA activities. Thus, an important implication of our study is the need to conduct more research on how BA helps develop a data-driven environment in an organisation thereby to better support its decision-making.</p><p>Third, we contribute to the information processing view by providing empirical evidence to support the key idea that an organisation needs to design its structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to improving its information processing capabilities thereby to improve its decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Our research through the concept of a data-driven environment and empirical evidence suggests that when an organisation has developed specific strategy, policy, structure, and processes to enable BA activities, its information processing capabilities can be enhanced to improve its decision-making. Therefore, in addition to the idea that BA is an important factor for the development of a data-driven environment underpinned by contingency theory, our research drawing on the information processing view further supports that creating a data-driven environment in an organisation will help improve the organisation's information processing capabilities and ultimately its decision-making effectiveness. Consequently, this research underpinned by both contingency theory and the information processing view enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of BA's impact on decision-making.</p><p>Fourth, we provide useful insights into whether company size and industry type moderate the paths from BA to decision-making effectiveness. Our findings indicate that large and medium companies use BA similarly to support decision-making. This is not actually in conflict with <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> since we have not included small business that are expected to behave differently regarding IT use, compared with large companies. However, our findings indicate that there are some differences across industries regarding BA applications.</p><p>While our methodology does not allow us to provide an in-depth explanation of this finding, it provides empirical evidence in the context of BA to weakly support the moderating effect of industry type <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. This tentative result calls for more research to develop a deeper understanding of how different industries use BA.</p><p>Our research findings also provide important implications for BA practitioners. The findings suggest that in an organisation BA is an important determinant of a data-driven environment, which is the necessary condition for effective BA applications and decisionmaking. Thus, BA must be implemented in tandem with developing a data-driven environment to realise its potential. A data-driven environment would enhance BA's impact on the organisation's information processing capabilities, which in turn, influence data-driven decision-making and decision-making effectiveness. Therefore, companies should focus on developing information processing capabilities with BA applications in a data-driven organisational environment.</p><p>The study has several limitations. First, although we have followed the four decision rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> to develop formative constructs to avoid misspecifications, we are unable to assess the convergent validity of the formative constructs to evaluate whether the entire domain of each formative construct has been covered by the selected indictors because the research design does not include additional reflective items or "shadow" reflective constructs that capture the essences of all five formative constructs. Second, our sample does not include small enterprises with less than 50 employees. Thus, our findings are not applicable to small enterprises. Third, we have used perceived measures to understand the key variables in this research while quantitative measures based on specific decisions may complement the perceived measures. Finally, we have not tested the exogeneity of information processing capabilities since we are unable to find suitable instrumental variable for this constructs.</p><p>Despite these limitations, however, we believe our study offers opportunities for future research. First, the understanding of BA and its impact could be further advanced by conducting more context-specific (such as a particular industry) investigations, thereby help companies to make better decisions about their investment. A second area for future research is to understand the status of BA applications and its impact on decision-making in small businesses. Third, factors such as top management team, organisational structure, and business environment may have a significant effect on shaping the outcomes of strategic decisions and thus should be examined in future BA research. Finally, in order for researchers to have more confidence in drawing conclusions from research, future empirical IT research should begin to address the issue of endogeneity as it could lead to biased and inconsistent estimators thereby to limit the validity of research models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial relevance statement</head><p>Business analytics is being increasingly used to gain data-driven insights to support decisionmaking; however, extant literature indicates that many companies are still struggling to figure out how to use business analytics. Some of them are unsure how to proceed, while others are struggling to achieve a worthwhile return. The findings of this paper could provide valuable insights into how an organisation should use business analytics to improve its decision-making effectively. The findings of this paper show that a data-driven environment in an organisation is the core-facilitating factor for the application of business analytics and effective decision-making. In order to realise the potential of business analytics, an organisation must develop explicit organisational strategy and policy to guide analytic activities, and design its organisational structure and business processes to enable and facilitate data-driven decision-making. Our research findings suggest that a data-driven environment would enhance the impact of business analytics on the organisation's information processing capabilities, which in turn influence data-driven decision-making and decision-making effectiveness. Therefore, in order to realise the potentials of business analytics, companies should implement business analytics by developing an internal datadriven environment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Thus, changes in each indicator would have caused change in how BA is defined and interpreted. Second, are the indicators interchangeable?
