<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study explores the relationship among spirituality, self-efficacy, COVID-19 anxiety, and hopelessness. The participants are comprised of 418 individuals (282 females and 136 males) in Turkey whose ages range between 18 and 61 years old. The participants completed the following surveys: The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Spiritual Orientation Inventory. The relationships among the variables have been examined using path analysis. According to the results, spirituality, self-efficacy, and COVID-19 anxiety have direct effects on hopelessness. The analysis also shows self-efficacy to mediate the relationship between spirituality and hopelessness. The proposed model has good fit indices. The findings are discussed in the context of the literature on COVID-19, spirituality, self-efficacy, and hopelessness, with practical implications for mental health professionals being provided.</p></div>

As of October 29, 2021, 245,373,039 cases and 4,979,421 deaths have been confirmed worldwide due to COVID-19, with 7,961,535 cases and 69,998 deaths confirmed in Turkey <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 2021)</ref>. The outbreak has demonstrated individuals to be emotionally illprepared in the face of a biological disaster and has shown how frail and helpless they can be <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Serafini et al., 2020)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hopelessness</head><p>Beck's cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Beck et al., 1974)</ref> is one of the theoretical approaches toward depression, a common mental health disorder, and suicidal behaviors resulting from depression. Beck conceptualized hopelessness as a cognitive schema that involves negative expectations regarding the future. This model suggests that individuals who are prone to depression perceive themselves as inadequate and defective and negatively interpret the world and the future. These individuals consider life to be full of challenging situations and feel hopeless about the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Beck, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Blackburn, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chioqueta &amp; Stiles, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Westefeld et al., 1990)</ref>. Hopelessness also may increase based on individuals' cognitive distortions and unrealistic ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Minkoff et al., 1973)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Beck et al. (1989)</ref> further clarified the relationship among depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation in their study on adult psychiatric outpatients. They found hopelessness to be more significant than depression in terms of explaining suicide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Zuo et al. (2021)</ref> investigated the impact of perceived social support, meaning in life, and epidemic risk levels on hopelessness. The results showed perceived social support and meaning in life to negatively predict hopelessness. Saricali et al.'s (2020) research showed COVID-19-related fear to be a powerful positive predictor of hopelessness. This predictive relationship is partially mediated by mindfulness and humor. <ref type="bibr">Aguglia et al.'s (2021)</ref> study evaluated the impact the pandemic has had on the mental well-being of health care workers, focusing on the association among hopelessness, death anxiety, and post-traumatic symptomatology. The findings showed death anxiety to be a potential mediator of the significant association between hopelessness and post-traumatic symptomatology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Padmanabhanunni and Pretorius (2021)</ref> found hopelessness during the pandemic to reduce life satisfaction. Kaplan Serin and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Doğan (2021)</ref> found a significant relationship between their study's participant nursing students' levels of anxiety and hopelessness.</p></div>

(2000, p. 252)</ref> defined spirituality as "an awareness of a being or force that transcends the material aspects of life and gives a deep sense of wholeness or connectedness to the universe." They also stated spirituality to include elements such as hope, meaning/purpose of life, meditation and prayer/worship, compassion, altruism, values, belief in the existence of a supreme power, and transcendence. Having high levels of Islamic spirituality has also been shown to allow individuals to reinterpret a crisis so as to provide purpose and meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Koenig et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Spirituality may relieve physical, psychological, and even social issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Luquis et al., 2012)</ref>.

Other research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Durmuş et al. (2021)</ref> found a significant negative correlation between the spiritual wellbeing of pregnant women and fears of COVID-19 and depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Rababa et al. (2021)</ref> found religious coping and spiritual well-being to be significant predictors of death anxiety in older adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lee et al. (2021)</ref> reviewed 58 articles and summarized the roles religious groups have played during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review showed religious communities to have served as a critical resource for managing and controlling COVID-19 in many parts of the world. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bandura (1977)</ref> conceptualized self-efficacy as one's belief in their abilities to plan and execute the courses of action required for managing future-related situations. According to Bandura, individuals can generalize their perceptions of an ability from any context to assessing different abilities in similar contexts. Ideas on the generalizability of self-efficacy then developed a new concept known as general self-efficacy and derived from self-efficacy. General self-efficacy generally refers to an individual's efficacy beliefs about coping with stressful and challenging life events. In addition, general self-efficacy has also been defined as an individual's general confidence in the face of new, complicated, and unfamiliar situations that may arise in many areas. People with high general self-efficacy are more successful in addressing stressful events and overcoming traumas <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bandura et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004)</ref>. They may even view stressful life events as encouraging and challenging opportunities. High self-efficacy creates a protective factor against the negative effects of traumatic events (Joie-La <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Marle et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Self-Efficacy</head><p>Because self-efficacy has critical importance in traumatic situations, it has been one of the variables investigated during the pandemic. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Xiong et al. (2020)</ref> found a negative relationship between self-efficacy and anxiety, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Casali et al. (2021)</ref> found a positive relationship between self-efficacy and transcendent character strength. <ref type="bibr">Chong et al.'s (2020)</ref> research has additionally shown self-efficacy to have positively affected adherence to precautionary measures during the pandemic. One longitudinal study revealed self-efficacy to be positive alongside positive affect and adaptive performance at work (Joie-La <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Marle et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>

Anxiety is considered to be an emotional response to "a threat to some value that the individual holds essential to his existence as a personality" <ref type="bibr">(May, 1977, p. 205)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hacimusalar et al. (2020)</ref> reported anxiety to have caused hopelessness to increase during the current pandemic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lee (2020)</ref> developed the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale to identify cases of dysfunctional anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic and found a strong positive relationship between coronavirus anxiety and negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, and suicidal ideation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Study</head><p>Pre-pandemic studies conducted on the relationship between hopelessness, COVID-19 anxiety, spirituality, and general self-efficacy (i.e., the variables of the present study) found a negative relationship between hopelessness and spirituality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdollahi &amp; Abu Talib, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abu Talib &amp; Abdollahi, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hasanshahi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Williams et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Spirituality provides hope in the most hopeless of circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cotton et al., 2009)</ref>.

Among the studies conducted during this pandemic, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hacimusalar et al.

Moreover, Banerjee (2020) proposed general self-efficacy belief to be a protective factor against hopelessness during the current pandemic. Bandura had suggested perceived inefficacy to play a vital role in depression, anxiety, stress, and other emotional distress disorders (as cited in <ref type="bibr">Muris et al., 2016, p. 609)</ref>.</p><p>Many studies have found a positive relationship between spirituality and selfefficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Adegbola, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Asghari et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Han et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jun &amp; Lee, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rakhshanderou et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wong &amp; Longshore, 2008)</ref>. Some approaches have shown people's spirituality development to be about cognitive abilities, behaviors, and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Oman et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandura (2003)</ref> believed individuals' efficacy beliefs to affect their thoughts about the world, their life, the goals they have set, and actions they choose for achieving their goals. Many recent studies have emphasized spirituality and spiritual health to be able to affect self-efficacy and other psychological perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rakhshanderou et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Other studies conducted during the pandemic have also indicated spirituality to relieve anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(González-Sanguino et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kasapoğlu, 2020a)</ref>, with prepandemic studies supporting this result <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ai et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nelson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Reutter &amp; Bigatti, 2014)</ref>. Research has shown belief in self-efficacy to be associated with spirituality; these two attributes are therefore regarded as two strong motivators in human development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Adegbola, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Hopelessness during the pandemic being associated with negative consequences including suicidal behavior has made studying the factors likely to influence this variable crucial. While much research exists on COVID-19, a need for data still exists in order to develop empirical strategies for identifying the factors affecting hopelessness during the outbreak. As a result, the present study aims to explore the extent to which spirituality directly and/or indirectly explains hopelessness through its relationship with general self-efficacy, and COVID-19 anxiety. The diagram of the model created for testing these relationships is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>The study uses the convenience sampling method <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gravetter &amp; Forzano, 2012)</ref> to gather data from participants 18 years or older. Individuals accepted the online consent form and completed a survey in Turkish. The data were collected using the online survey software, Google Forms, rather than in person due to social isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak. From December 2020 to January 2021, 418 responses were collected from people living in Turkey.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that demographic characteristics for the 418 participants, 282 females (67.5%) and 136 males (32.5%), with ages ranging from 18 to 61 (M = 33.47, SD = 10.26). The group consists of 127 (30.4%) people with a high school diploma or less and 291 (69.6%) with an undergraduate degree or higher; 201 (48.1%) participants are single, and 217 (51.9%) are married. Of the participants, 235 are employed (56.2%) and 183 are unemployed (43.8%); 182 (43.5%) have a relative who has had COVID-19. Forty-four participants (10.5%) have a history of anxiety disorders. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale</p><p>The scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lee (2020)</ref> to identify cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis. It is a one-dimensional 5-item, 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = never, 4 = every day for the last two weeks). The scale was translated into Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Akkuzu et al. (2020)</ref>. For the exploratory factor analysis, a single-factor structure of the scale was found to explain 58% of the total variance. The confirmatory factor analysis shows the fit indices to be within acceptable limits (χ 2 = 52.204; p &lt; 0.001; χ 2 / df = 10; GFI = 0.98; AGFI = 0.95; CFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.09). The internal consistency reliability coefficient was calculated to be 0.82 and test-retest reliability as r = 0.88.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beck Hopelessness Scale</head><p>This scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Beck et al. (1974)</ref> and first adapted to Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Seber et al. (1993)</ref>. Its validity was studied later by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Durak and Palabıyıkoğlu (1994)</ref>. The scale consists of 20 items, with the exploratory factor analysis revealing three factors. Of the total variance, the factor of feelings and expectations toward the future explains 28%, loss of motivation explains 8%, and hope explains 6.6%. The reliability analyses indicate a Cronbach alpha of α = 0.78. Correlations among the three factors range from 0.48 to 0.59 (p &lt; 0.001). The Beck Depression Scale was chosen as the concurrent validity criterion with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.69 (p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Self-Efficacy Scale</head><p>The scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sherer et al. (1982)</ref> and adapted into Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Yıldırım and İlhan (2010)</ref>, who also conducted validity and reliability studies. The exploratory factor analysis of the scale revealed three factors to explain 41.47% of the total variance, with the first factor explaining 20.2%, the second factor 11.9%, and the third factor 9.5%. The reliability analyses indicate an internal consistency of α = 0.80. Test-retest reliability was calculated at r = 0.69 (p &lt; 0.01). This 5-point Likert-type scale consists of 17 items, with items 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 17 being reverse scored. A higher score on the scale indicates stronger self-efficacy beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spiritual Orientation Scale</head><p>Kasapoğlu (2016) developed the Spiritual Orientation Scale (SOS) for evaluating individuals' levels of spirituality. <ref type="bibr">Myers et al. (2000, p. 252</ref>) defined spirituality as "an awareness of a being or force that transcends the material aspects of life and gives a deep sense of wholeness or connectedness to the universe". This scale is a 7-point Likert-type with 16 items. Its exploratory factor analysis reveals a single factor explaining 47.50% of the total variance. Its confirmatory factor analysis shows acceptable levels of fit for the single-factor structure (χ 2 / df (100) = 2.39, p = 0.000; RMSEA = 0.06, RMR = 0.05, GFI = 0.93, AGFI = 0.90, CFI = 0.95, IFI = 0.95, NFI = 0.92). Validity was measured using the spirituality sub-dimension from the Wellness Evaluation of Lifestyle Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Witmer &amp; Sweeney, 1992</ref>) and adapted into Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Doğan (2004)</ref>. SOS shows a significant positive and moderate correlation with the sub-dimension of spirituality (r = 0.57; p &lt; 0.01). The internal reliability of the scale was calculated as α = 0.87 and its test-retest reliability measured over a 2-week interval to be 0.84 (p = 0.000). The scale items are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The present study examines the relationship hopelessness has with spirituality, general self-efficacy, and COVID-19 anxiety, first by calculating the descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) and analyzing the relationships among the variables using Pearson's r and point-biserial correlation (r pb ). The related literature states point-biserial correlation calculation to be a special case of the Pearson product-moment correlation, which is used when one of the variables has two categories (e.g., gender; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Field, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The relationships among the variables were tested through path analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM). The suitability of the data for SEM analyses was examined first by exploring multicollinearity and normality <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Teo et al., 2013)</ref>. VIF values less than 10 indicate no multicollinearity to be present in the data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kline, 2015)</ref>. Skewness and kurtosis values were then calculated in regard to the normality of the data. The skewness of the variables was found to vary between 1.49 and -1.61, while the kurtosis values varied between 1.89 and -0.14. Skewness and kurtosis values within the range of ± 2 are considered acceptable for normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(George &amp; Mallery, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, the results show the data to be suitable for SEM analyses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics and Correlational Analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> displays the variables' descriptive statistics and the correlation coefficients in the study. The skewness values range from 1.49 to -1.61, and the kurtosis values range between 1.89 and -0.14. The Cronbach alphas for the scales are above acceptable limits (α = 0.79 and 0.87; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Büyüköztürk et al., 2010)</ref>. Correlational analyses show hopelessness to be significantly and positively correlated with COVID-19 anxiety (r = 0.10, p &lt; 0.01) and negatively correlated with general self-efficacy (r = -0.40, p &lt; 0.01) and spirituality (r = -0.32, p &lt; 0.01). No statistically significant relationship was found between COVID-19 anxiety and spirituality (r = -0.08, p &gt; 0.05), and selfefficacy (r = -0.07, p &gt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Analysis</head><p>According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, a significant relationship exists among spirituality as the independent variable, hopelessness as the dependent variable, and general selfefficacy as one of the mediating variables. Likewise, a significant relationship exists between the mediating variable of general self-efficacy and the dependent variable of hopelessness. No relationship has been found between spirituality and the other mediating variable, COVID-19 anxiety. A significant relationship was found for COVID-19 anxiety with general self-efficacy and hopelessness.</p><p>Because four of the six correlations among the variables are significant, a mediation model has been established between these variables for testing the indirect and direct paths from the variable of spirituality to hopelessness through general self-efficacy as well as from the variable of general self-efficacy to hopelessness through COVID-19 anxiety. The tested model shows the goodness-of-fit indices to be ideal: χ2 / df 2 = 1.85, p = 0.157, RMSEA = 0.045, CFI = 0.98, GFI = 0.99, AGFI = 0.98, NFI = 0.97, and SRMR = 0.036 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kline, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Şimşek, 2007)</ref>. The standardized path coefficients for the model are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Bootstrap resampling over 1000 iterations was used to test the significance for the coefficients indicating the direct and indirect effects from spirituality, selfefficacy, and COVID-19 anxiety on hopelessness. According to the bootstrap analyses, spirituality (β = 0.26, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI [0.36, 0.172] directly and significantly increased general self-efficacy. Spirituality (β = -0.22, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI [-0.321, -0.119] and self-efficacy (β = -0.33, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI [-0.417, -0.262] directly and significantly decrease hopelessness. COVID-19 anxiety (β = 0.15, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI [0.065, 0.241] directly and significantly increase hopelessness. Additionally, spirituality (β = -0.09, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI [-0.139, -0.053] indirectly and significantly decrease hopelessness. These three variables explain 22% (R 2 = 0.22) of the variance in hopelessness in the model. Findings on the standardized path coefficients for the model are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study has investigated the relationship among spirituality, self-efficacy, COVID-19 anxiety, and hopelessness for individuals living in Turkey during the COVID-19 process. The results have determined spirituality, general self-efficacy, and COVID-19 anxiety to be significant predictors of hopelessness. Furthermore, the findings show general self-efficacy to mediate the relationship between spirituality and hopelessness, explaining 22% of the variation in hopelessness scores.</p><p>According to the model the present study has confirmed, spirituality reduces hopelessness (i.e., increases hope) both directly and through general self-efficacy indirectly. This finding is consistent with the results of other studies that have been conducted during the pandemic. <ref type="bibr">Zou et al. (2021)</ref> found the meaning of life whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sarıçalı et al. (2020)</ref> found mindfulness to negatively predict hopelessness. Some  efforts are also found with recommendations in the form of letters to the editor. These letters emphasize developing a solid relationship with the transcendent to be able to increase hope during the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Heidari et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Roman et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The previous research results have also point to similar findings between spirituality and hopelessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdollahi &amp; Abu Talib, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abu Talib &amp; Abdollahi, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hasanshahi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Williams et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdollahi and Abu Talib's (2015)</ref> study found spirituality to moderate the relationship between hopelessness and suicidal ideation. Their results indicated higher suicidal ideation for those with high hopelessness and low spirituality, as opposed to those with high spirituality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Williams et al. (2008)</ref> examined the role of spirituality in presenting concerns, diagnosis, psychopharmacologic treatment, and spiritual orientation among students seeking treatment at a university counseling center. Their analysis found spirituality to be inversely correlated with hopelessness. The findings of the current study and other studies indicate spirituality to act as a buffer against hopelessness.</p><p>The current findings are in-line with the thesis that spiritual and transcendent values may foster meaning, purpose, harmony, and connections during COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Walsh, 2020)</ref> and provide hope in extremely hopeless situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cotton et al., 2009)</ref>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, spiritual values can help alleviate individuals' physical, psychological, and social problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Luquis et al., 2012)</ref>. In addition, these values can help individuals give new meaning to crises <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Koenig et al., 2012)</ref>, thus reducing their hopelessness levels by seeing themselves to be more competent at overcoming difficulties. In other words, they may develop fewer negative expectations for the future.</p><p>This study has found a significant positive relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and hopelessness. This finding is in-line with the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lee (2020)</ref>. The present outbreak presents a grave threat to individual lives and health. When considering constraints such as social isolation and the uncertainty that consolidates this grave threat, anxiety is inevitably expected to increase hopelessness. Meanwhile, one expected result is that increased general self-efficacy perceptions decrease individuals' hopelessness levels (i.e., they become more hopeful). This is because, while hopelessness is the belief that negative situations will occur and one can do nothing to change them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abela &amp; Seligman, 2000)</ref>, self-efficacy is related to one's belief in being able to overcome the tasks faced <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura, 1977)</ref>. To the author's knowledge, no similar studies conducted during the pandemic have found comparable findings. However, prior research supports the present study's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Bozkur et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hasanshahi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kezer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Najafi &amp; Foladjang, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>While those who consider themselves capable of facing hardship try harder to handle and overcome hardship <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bandura et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Benight &amp; Bandura, 2004)</ref>, those who feel themselves incapable give in to difficulties easily and feel anxious, depressed, and hopeless <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Muris et al., 2016)</ref>. During the uncertain times of the pandemic, self-efficacy has been promoted to protect against hopelessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Banerjee, 2020)</ref>. The present study's findings support this incentive.</p><p>Another finding from this research is that spirituality positively affects general self-efficacy. This finding resembles the results of very few studies that have evaluated these two variables during the pandemic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Casali et al. (2021)</ref> found a positive relationship between self-efficacy and transcendent character strength. Likewise, the previous research results also support this finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Adegbola, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Asghari et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Han et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jun &amp; Lee, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rakhshanderou et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wong &amp; Longshore, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Adegbola (2011)</ref> carried out a study to assess the relationship spirituality has with self-efficacy and quality of life in adult patients and found a strongly significant correlation to exist among the variables. This finding suggests that the more spiritual beliefs an individual has, the higher their levels of self-efficacy and quality of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rakhshanderou et al. (2020)</ref> carried out a study to examine the relationship between spirituality and perceived self-efficacy among college students. They found a significant positive relationship between spirituality and self-efficacy.</p><p>Those who believe potential threats to be unmanageable tend to exaggerate them, while those high in spirituality are also high in self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Sullivan &amp; Atkins, 2009)</ref>. These two features are strong motivations in human development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Adegbola, 2011)</ref>. Such individuals may be able to cope better with the stressful and threatening circumstances of the pandemic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Limitations</head><p>This study has several limitations that bear upon the generalizability and interpretation of the findings and should be addressed. Data were collected from a sample without chronic disease. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to chronic disease cases. This study also performed a cross-sectional analysis of the data. The relationships among the variables being correlational does not imply cause and effect. The findings are based on data obtained from self-report measures, which carry the risk of bias. Despite these limitations, the study's findings provide valuable data to mental health professionals dealing with the mental health issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>An individual who perceives the COVID-19 outbreak as a threat to their life can lead them to have adverse reactions and cause anxiety and hopelessness. However, based on the findings of this study, we can say individuals during the pandemic are able to strengthen their self-efficacy to the extent to which they are able to benefit from spiritual resources. As a result, they will be able to cope better with the stress of uncertainty and reduce their negative expectations for the future. This research also suggests that education around spirituality might give people positive beliefs in their self-worth and future.</p><p>Psychosocial interventions that promote spirituality and self-efficacy may help lower hopelessness levels by assisting the population in enduring and overcoming uncertainty, loss, and restrictions. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Dutra and Rocha (2020)</ref> provided practical examples in military chaplaincy and hospital chaplaincy. Additionally, the effects from techniques used in existential anxiety and stress interventions in third-generation cognitive-behavioral therapies can also be specifically utilized for those suffering from the psychological consequences involving COVID-19 anxiety.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Tested model</figDesc><graphic coords="5,92.13,469.68,255.12,118.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
