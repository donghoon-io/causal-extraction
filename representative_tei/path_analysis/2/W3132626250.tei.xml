<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Although theory-driven evaluations should have empirical components, few evaluations of public health interventions quantitatively test the causal model made explicit in the theory of change (ToC). In the context of a shared sanitation trial (MapSan) in Maputo, Mozambique, we report findings of a quantitative process evaluation assessing intervention implementation, participant response and impacts on hypothesised intermediary outcomes on the pathway to trial health outcomes. We examine the utility of path analysis in testing intervention theory using process indicators from the intervention's ToC. Methods: Process data were collected through a cross-sectional survey of intervention and control compounds of the MapSan trial &gt; 24-months post-intervention, sampling adult residents and compound leaders. Indicators of implementation fidelity (dose received, reach) and participant response (participant behaviours, intermediary outcomes) were compared between trial arms. The intervention's ToC (formalised post-intervention) was converted to an initial structural model with multiple alternative pathways. Path analysis was conducted through linear structural equation modelling (SEM) and generalised SEM (probit model), using a model trimming process and grouped analysis to identify parsimonious models that explained variation in outcomes, incorporating demographics of respondents and compounds. Results: Among study compounds, the MapSan intervention was implemented with high fidelity, with a strong participant response in intervention compounds: improvements were made to intermediary outcomes related to sanitation 'quality'latrine cleanliness, maintenance and privacybut not to handwashing (presence of soap / soap residue). These outcomes varied by intervention type: single-cabin latrines or multiple-cabin blocks (designed for &gt; 20 users). Path analysis suggested that changes in intermediary outcomes were likely driven by direct effects of intervention facilities, with little contribution from hygiene promotion activities nor core elements expected to mediate change: a compound sanitation committee and maintenance fund. A distinct structural model for two compound size subgroups (≤ 20 members vs. &gt; 20 members) explained differences by intervention type, and other contextual factors influenced specific model parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Process evaluations of complex interventions elucidate how and why an intervention has (or fails to have) a particular effect and which intervention components have the greatest impact on outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Recent Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on evaluating complex interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> recommends theory-driven approaches to evaluation that articulate the hypotheses and rationale behind interventions so they can be evaluated <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Public health interventions are either implicit or explicit embodiments of theory, involving the expectation that intervening will alleviate a problem via a set of intermediary outcomes and relying on a set of assumptions about how participants respond to programme activities to produce outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These 'mechanisms of change' are highly sensitive to context <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; and recent approaches to evaluationsuch as the 'realist' approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> highlight the need for evaluation approaches that assess how intervention effects differ by contextual factors such as social group or location to understand 'what works, for whom and in what circumstances' <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The theory of change (ToC) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> depicts the hypothesised mechanisms of an intervention as a causal diagram of multiple pathways leading from activities to outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Each outcome in a ToC is measured by an indicator, and therefore the theory lends itself to testing using a range of analytic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Statistical analysis of relationships between indicators in a ToC could identify mediating factors that intervene in the relationship between two components <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Quantitatively testing an hypothesized causal model in this way could improve our understanding of context-mechanism-outcome configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and attribute deviations from expected outcomes to theory and/or intervention failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Although ToC is recommended by official bodies concerned with clinical and complex intervention trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, a systematic review of the uses of ToC in public health intervention evaluations found that very few have used the approach alongside trials of health impact, explored the influence of context on outcomes, or quantitatively tested the causal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Path analysisan early variant of structural equation modelling (SEM)is an analytical tool used to estimate relationships that account for variation among a set of observed variables, and has been suggested for use within programme evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Path analysis is predicated on defining a strong theoretical model that posits hypothesised linear relations between variables and reduces to the solution of one or more multiple regression analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Path models involve two sets of variables: exogenous variables, whose variation is explained by factors not in the model; and endogenous variables, whose variation is explained at least in part by other variables in the model. Correlations among variables can be decomposed into direct and indirect (mediated) effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, detailing patterns of different effects in one model. A theory can then be identified as tenable among alternative theoretical models based on the ability to explain the pattern of observed relationships.</p><p>Aspects of both ToC and path analysis suggest the approaches are complementary: both rely heavily on a strong theoretical model with one-way causal flow, and make explicit the distinctions between context, mechanism and outcome variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Ideally, theory-driven evaluations should have both theoretical and empirical components <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A ToC already includes indicators for each step and therefore the ToC and path analysis approaches may be combined, making the theory accountable to empirical testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In the context of a shared sanitation trial in Mozambique, we describe the results of a cross-sectional process evaluation assessing intervention implementation, participant response and impacts on hypothesised intermediary outcomes on the pathway from intervention to trial outcomes. We then demonstrate how path analysis can be used to test the intervention ToC, with the aim of understanding how any change in intermediary outcomes may have occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study setting: shared sanitation in Maputo, Mozambique and the MapSan trial</head><p>Sanitation plays an essential role in preventing transmission of faecal pathogens that cause infectious disease and is associated with improvements in various health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Improved sanitation facilities shared between multiple households are defined by the UNICEF and World Health Organization Joint Monitoring Programme as 'limited' sanitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Prevalence of shared sanitation is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where rapid growth of peri-urban informal settlements, characterised by extreme poverty, lack of infrastructure, and high burden of disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, poses particular challenges for health. Approximately 70% of Maputo's residents live in informal settlements <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, 89% use onsite, non-sewered sanitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and 9% of Mozambique's urban population rely on shared sanitation facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Ensuring access, use and quality of shared facilities is important to maximise the health benefits of sanitation. However, ensuring adequate access and quality of shared facilities is often difficult to maintain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>The Maputo Sanitation (MapSan) trial is a controlled before-and-after study assessing the health impacts of a shared sanitation intervention implemented by Water &amp; Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) in 11 bairros (neighbourhoods) in low-income informal urban settlements of Maputo (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02362932 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). Housing in these bairros is often organised into compounds, groups of houses clustered around a communal space. Compound members may be homeowners or renters, may share a single latrine, and may have a chefe de composto (hereafter chefe), an informal leader for the compound who may be responsible for managing sanitation facilities.</p><p>The MapSan trial intervention consisted of improved, pour-flush toilets with a septic tank shared among all compound members, delivered in two forms to meet a target ratio of one cabin (i.e. toilet stall) per 20 users: single-cabin shared latrines (SLs) were intended for 20 or fewer users; Communal sanitation blocks (CSBs), with multiple cabins, were intended for more than 20 users. WSUP planned to construct 200 SLs and 50 CSBs with available funds. CSBs also had a built-in handwashing sink (not by default connected to a water supply) among other amenities (Text A1, Additional file 1). Compound eligibility criteria to receive the WSUP intervention included location, minimum 12 members, poor condition of existing sanitation, willingness to contribute to costs (10%, around US$97, for CSBs; 15%, around US$64, for SLs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and engineering and construction considerations. Existing pit latrines (of varying structure and low quality) were removed, including both the superstructure and pit. New facilities constructed under WSUP supervision were handed over to users during a 14-month period from 2015 to 2016. WSUP mobilised local community-based organisations (CBOs) to identify possible intervention sites and conduct compound-level training and household-level hygiene promotion. For the MapSan trial, control compounds meeting a subset of intervention criteria and of comparable compound population were enrolled concurrently with intervention compounds across 17 bairros of Maputo, including the 11 intervention bairros. Children aged between 29 days and 48 months were enrolled at baseline (pre-intervention) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Further details of eligibility and enrolment are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>The ToC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) describes how intervention activities were hypothesised to promote changes in behaviour leading to intermediary outcomes, positioned on the causal pathway to trial outcomes. This ToC was not formally developed by the intervention agency (WSUP) before the intervention; rather, it was reconstructed post hoc based on structured conversations with WSUP programme managers, and then reviewed by these managers to ensure it accurately described the sequence of intervention activities. The rationale behind the theory and underlying assumptions are also presented. In essence, the ToC for MapSan was that high-quality shared sanitation facilities would be installed, and subsequent CBO visits within intervention compounds would lead to formation of compound sanitation committees and financing agreements, creating the necessary capacity to manage sanitation facilities over time. Effective shared sanitation management, maintenance, and promotion of handwashing behaviours through household-level visits were expected to promote child health and user wellbeing in intervention compounds.</p><p>A 2016 external evaluation of the WSUP sanitation project <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> assessed relevance, efficiency and sustainability of the intervention through focus-group discussions with beneficiaries, local bairro leaders, and CBOs. However, this external evaluation did not quantitatively assess effects on participant response nor compare with control compounds of the MapSan trial. The report noted a major scaling-back of planned hygiene promotion activities due to increased costs of infrastructure construction, suggesting that the effectiveness of this component warrants investigation. A qualitative assessment of sanitation management structures in study compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> identified factors including compound leadership, number of households and relational structure that might influence cleanliness and maintenance of facilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation design</head><p>This evaluation comprised a cross-sectional study of intervention and control compounds of the MapSan trial between 24-and 42-months post-intervention, and was centred on the trial ToC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Drawing on relevant process evaluation frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, we assessed three domains with several subdomains (labelled A-D): Indicators used to assess each domain are detailed in Additional file 2. Subdomains of dose received, participant behaviours and intermediary outcomes (A, C and D) map directly to indicators on the ToC. Examination of context focused on demographic characteristics of clusters and participants, how those may have affected intervention reach (B), and are incorporated as exogenous variables in subsequent path models. Analytic methods focused on the contribution of fidelity, response, and context to intermediary outcomes, including: sanitation accessibility, privacy, cleanliness and maintenance, presence of a handwashing facility (HWF) with access to soap and water, and handwashing with soap (HWWS) by users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and sampling</head><p>Enumerators collected survey data between 26 April and 17 July 2018. Compound eligibility criteria included having households that had completed the 12-month follow-up phase of the MapSan trial. In each selected compound, up to three respondents were recruited (Text A2, Additional file 1), including caregivers of children enrolled in the MapSan trial ('MapSan trial participant') an additional adult respondent not enrolled in the MapSan trial ('secondary respondent'), and compound chefes at half the compounds, identified by residents as the person with the most knowledge about the compound's sanitation management.</p><p>Surveys were conducted using mWater, developed for this study in English, translated to Portuguese, and piloted over 1 week in December 2017 and an additional 2 days in April 2018 in non-study compounds of one Maputo bairro. Feedback on survey items from local enumerators in Maputo was used to iteratively revise the surveys and ensure face validity. All data were encrypted and kept on a secure server.</p><p>Surveys were developed specifically for this process evaluation and addressed various aspects of intervention implementation and participant behaviours, and demographic characteristics of individuals and compounds (Additional file 3). Photographs of sanitation infrastructure taken by enumerators were checked against responses to ensure they matched reported intervention status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data handling and analysis</head><p>Data were cleaned and analysed in Stata version 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p><p>Intervention and control compounds were designated as in the MapSan trial. Control compounds that received intervention latrines and intervention compounds that did not receive intervention latrines were analysed under intervention fidelity and excluded from subsequent analyses. Control compounds that had upgraded their sanitation autonomously following initial recruitment to the trial were still included as controls.</p><p>We derived measures of dose received, reach, and participant behaviours (subdomains A, B and C) from questionnaire responses from all respondents. The proportion of participants who reported personally cleaning the latrine twice per week was used to indicate individual cleaning frequency, and the proportion reporting their latrine being cleaned daily was used to indicate collective cleaning frequency.</p><p>We derived measures of pre-defined intermediary outcomes (listed above and in Additional file 2) from questionnaire responses and observation of facilities linked to household respondent (MapSan trial participant and secondary respondent) surveys. The condition of the latrine slab/floor was used as a proxy measure for latrine maintenance. Latrines were considered 'clean' if no faeces, solid waste, urine, dirty water or anal cleansing materials were visible, 'accessible' if they had no outside lock or all households had a key, and 'private' if they had a working door and inside lock. The presence of soap residue (or signs of recent soap use) at an HWF was used as proxy for HWWS.</p><p>For compound-specific indicators (e.g. whether the compound received household visits), we applied a single respondent's data to all respondents from that compound, prioritizing data from the chefe, followed by the MapSan trial participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. For individual-level outcomes (e.g. whether the respondent participated in training), we included all respondents in analysis, and considered respondent type as a covariate, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC (1,k)) to indicate interrater reliability, with values above 0.4 indicating fair agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Intermediary outcomes were considered individual-level responses, considering that sanitation quality and HWWS may vary even for the same facilities, depending on the day of visit.</p><p>We calculated relative household wealth for household respondents using the Simple Poverty Scorecard for Mozambique <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, including 8 of 10 inputs and excluding number of beds (missing data) and latrine type <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Surveys with compound chefes were limited to sanitation operation and management issues and did not include poverty scoring measures. Since chefe is not a formal leadership role and was often the person resident in the compound for the longest time, we approximated household wealth for chefes as the average of other respondents' scores within the same compound. We converted scores into relative wealth terciles for analysis.</p><p>We compared intermediary outcomes and indicators of fidelity and participant behaviours between intervention and control compounds using the chi-squared (χ 2 ) test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis</head><p>We converted all variables included to dichotomous variables (Additional file 2). As some indices were only available for a subset of the population by planned missingness (i.e. intermediary outcomes assessed for household respondents and not chefes), we applied full information maximum likelihood estimation. There were no other missing data.</p><p>We converted the ToC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) into an initial path diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) designed to test ToC, including the role of specific elements (e.g. sanitation committee, cleaning rota), and the overall relative effects of sanitation infrastructure (direct effects) and hygiene promotion activities (indirect effects) on intermediary outcomes. We initially included all paths in the model, and conducted a model trimming process: where multiple explanatory variables led to the same endogenous variable (e.g. intervention facilities and collective cleaning both lead to latrine cleanliness), we removed a path where its removal did not alter path coefficients for other explanatory variables and was therefore considered an unnecessary complication. We began at purely endogenous variables (intermediary outcomes) and moved backwards through the diagram (in numbered order in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Longer pathways were therefore removed when they no longer connected to an intermediary outcome. We calculated the variance accounted for by the path model for each endogenous variable using Wright's tracing rules for path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and variables contributing additional error were considered for removal, in order to achieve the simplest abstraction useful for our aims while maintaining the theoretical basis for the model.</p><p>We defined a priori a set of contextual factors hypothesized to influence the larger ToC. For each contextual factor, we estimated path coefficients and repeated the above trimming process for each dichotomous group separately, assessing whether the grouping led to changes in model structure or changes to specific path coefficients within the model. Where there were no structural changes, we treated the variable as another exogenous variable within the model at pre-specified points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), assessed alongside other explanatory variables in the larger model trimming process. By using a carefully-specified ToC with the minimum number of variables kept close to those concepts they represented, we minimised redundant measures and avoided sources of collinearity in our models. We examined models throughout the process for any instability in path coefficients that would indicate the need to merge too-similar conceptual variables.</p><p>We conducted path analysis as both a probit model using generalised structural equation modelling (GSEM), and as a linear probability model using SEM, assuming many dichotomous outcomes (e.g. latrine cleanliness) indicate an underlying normal distribution. Both models produced an identical structure and parameter estimates for the linear probability model fell within acceptable ranges (between 0 and 1). We therefore retained the linear probability model.</p><p>The final model was estimated using clustered robust standard errors, adjusting for non-independence within compounds. Use of robust standard errors precluded use of likelihood-based indices of goodness-of-fit, so we Abbreviations: 'chefe', chefe de composto (informal compound leader); CSB, communal sanitation block; HWF, handwashing facility; HWWS, handwashing with soap report the coefficient of determination for the final model. The model was refined using standardised coefficients and reported with unstandardised coefficients for interpretability. We calculated indirect effects as the product of unstandardised path coefficients along each pathway from intervention to intermediary outcomes, and total effects as the sum of indirect and direct effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis</head><p>Grouped analyses by dichotomised contextual variables produced a different structural model when grouping by compound size (compounds of 20 members or fewer vs. more than 20 members) or by intervention type (CSBs vs. SLs). When stratifying by compound size, there was no further structural change when further grouping by intervention type, so we considered compound size to account for differences between CSBs and SLs. Other contextual variables such as having a chefe or relatives in the same compound were included as exogenous variables.</p><p>Intermediate models (without clustered robust standard errors) for both compound size groups had acceptable fit: for small compounds (≤ 20 members), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.066 (90%CI: 0.049-0.083), comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.91, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.89); for large compounds (&gt; 20 members), RMSEA = 0.063 (90% CI: 0.055-0.070), CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.91). The final path analysis models for the two groups are displayed in Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>. The coefficient of determination was 0.839 for small compounds, and 0.897 for large compounds. Unstandardised path coefficients (b) represent the amount of expected changein this case, the increase in absolute probability in the outcome as a result of a unit change in the exposure. This is considered the direct effect of that exposure when controlling for other explanatory variables. The residual variance not explained by the model for endogenous variables is indicated. Covariances between exogenous variables were included in models, but not pictured (full models in Additional files 4, 5, 6 and 7). Estimated total effects (TE), subdivided into direct and indirect effects (IE) where there were multiple pathways, are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Decomposition of covariance between observed variables into 'direct' and 'indirect' effects suggested that the direct components accounted for the majority of intervention effects on intermediary outcomes due to several factors:</p><p>In small compounds, removal of indirect pathways that did not explain variation in outcomes meant large improvements to latrine maintenance (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; b = 0.45, p &lt; 0.001) and privacy (b = 0.69, p &lt; 0.001) were direct effects. The intervention had a small negative effect on accessibility (b = -0.053, p &lt; 0.001), and no significant effects on probability of having an HWF with soap and water or signs of soap use. Where indirect pathways are present, group-specific path coefficients indicate points where the theory breaks down. For example, both the intervention facilities (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; b = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001) and collective cleaning frequency (b = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with latrine cleanliness. However, because the intervention had only a minor effect on collective cleaning (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; TE = 0.022, p = 0.003), without use of a rota system, the indirect effect on latrine cleanliness was negligible (IE = 0.004, p = 0.020).</p><p>In large compounds, the reverse is true for latrine cleanliness. With a greater number of latrine users, collective cleaning frequency does not significantly contribute to latrine cleanliness (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>; b = 0.21, p = 0.056), so despite an increase in collective cleaning frequency (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; TE = 0.077, p = 0.027), mostly attributable to the compound maintaining a rota system to manage cleaning (TE = 0.044, p = 0.046), the effect on cleanliness was also primarily a direct effect of receiving an intervention latrine (b = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the intervention had a minimal indirect effect on latrine privacy via recent repairs (IE = 0.009, p = 0.161), despite the association between repairs and privacy (b = 0.21, p = 0.009). Counterintuitively, a negative effect of the intervention on probability of having an HWF with signs of soap use was observed Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> Linear probability path analysis of data from small compounds (≤ 20 members) of the MapSan trial.

Sections of the model corresponding to process evaluation domains and subdomains indicated by dashed lines. The model structure was more complex than that of the small compounds subgroup. Large direct effects on latrine maintenance (condition of slab/floor), privacy (working lock) and cleanliness were observed. Indirect effects on latrine cleanliness via cleaning behaviours (supported by a compound cleaning rota system) and indirect effects on latrine privacy were both minimal. A small negative effect on handwashing (soap residue) was observed. Abbreviations: 'chefe', chefe de composto (informal compound leader); HWF, handwashing facility; HWWS, handwashing with soap compounds in this study had fewer residents, due in larger part to significant out-migration in the study area in the period since compound selection (2015) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Among intervention compounds, improvements were made to intermediary outcomes of latrine cleanliness, maintenance and privacylatrine 'quality'but not to handwashing behaviour as indicated by soap residue. While concerns around quality of shared sanitation have prevented acceptance of shared facilities as 'improved' in global indicator classifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, this study demonstrates that shared sanitation can be high-quality, as the MapSan intervention was a significant improvement over existing shared latrines. This finding is particularly relevant to residents of low-income urban settlements, where shared sanitation is the only solution in the shortto-medium term <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. Improvements to intermediary outcomes were not accompanied, however, by compliance with the intervening behaviours hypothesised to mediate change, such as formation of a compound sanitation committee, and variation by intervention type (SL or CSB) was observed. Path analysis applied to ToC gave insights into why change may not have occurred as expected, adding to our understanding of 'what works, for whom and in what circumstances' <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in this setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>'What works?'</head><p>In our analysis, partitioning the different effects of the intervention suggested that large improvements to sanitation quality (latrine cleanliness, privacy, maintenance) were mainly driven by direct effects of intervention facilities, and not by indirect pathways including participant behaviours. This finding contradicts the ToC, in which intermediary outcomes were considered part of 'participant response.' Path coefficients also point to weakness in the ToC. For instance, contributions of compound members towards repairs did not translate into maintenance of latrines, assessed by condition of the slab/floor. This may be due to survey timingthe expected lifetime of intervention latrines is longer than traditional latrines, so the need for repairing the floor may have not arisen <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> or might reflect limited economic resources reducing capacity to make major repairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. In large compounds, spending towards repairs was associated with maintenance of the latrine door and lock - moving parts expected to wear downsuggesting minor repairs were being made, prioritising privacy. Formation of a compound sanitation committee also did not explain variance in participant behaviours.</p><p>The committee model may be less appropriate in this setting for compounds with 15 or fewer members, as informal management systems may be sufficient to maintain quality among small groups of people with existing social ties <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Several behavioural interventions have demonstrated effectiveness at improving and maintaining the quality of shared sanitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. In the longer term, stronger behaviour-focused strategies that prevent reversal of progress on intermediary outcomes associated with infrastructure improvements may be needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The ineffectiveness of the household-level behaviour change component at altering handwashing behaviour, with an apparent negative effect for some participants, may play a critical role in determining the intervention's health benefits. Inclusion of outcome variables in the path model could provide a bridge between evaluation of process and mechanisms and outcome evaluation, and inform assessment of intervention health impacts.</p><p>'For whom?' An important distinction emerged between contextual factors that influenced values of specific parameters within the model, and those for which the dynamics of the model were fundamentally altered. Analysis of subgroups suggested structural differences by compound size accounted for disparities by type of intervention received. The large compound model (&gt; 20 members) was more closely aligned to theorised mechanisms, with elements such as having a cleaning rota or maintenance fund playing an important role, but cleaning practices were less effective at maintaining cleanliness. With a high number of users, shared management responsibility is difficult to achieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> and facilities can quickly deteriorate; higher numbers of households sharing latrines have been correlated with lower sanitation quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. Identifying factors affecting the dynamics of change has useful application in multi-site evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, and supports understanding of how interventions function for specific groups and in varied contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>'In what circumstances?'</head><p>Characteristics of both compounds and individuals were also included in the models as potential modifying factors, allowing testing of hypotheses that emerged from qualitative research. Women were 25-35% more likely to clean latrines, confirming accounts of division of cleaning responsibilities along gendered lines in this and other urban informal settlements <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The idea that more transient residents contributed little to cleaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> was refuted: length of residence was negatively associated with self-reported individual cleaning frequency. In large compounds, members without family relations in their compound were more likely to spend money on repairsperhaps unsurprising given repairs were made to maintain latrine privacyand presence of a compound chefe affected soap and water availability and adherence to a cleaning rota, supporting qualitative findings that compound leaders can facilitate collective decision-making and resolve conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. An alternative approach to improve hygiene behaviours in this setting might therefore focus on training and funding a dedicated compound resident to promote change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study was cross-sectional and examined only a portion of the ToC 24-42 months after intervention delivery; therefore, the causal direction could not be determined, nor variation in intervention effects or demographics over time. Building in data collected at multiple time pointsfor example, measuring change in behaviour across the intervention periodcould improve validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> and allow assessment of longevity of effects. Observation of handwashing may be a better indicator of behaviour than presence of soap residue, as soap may be used for other purposes than handwashing. We considered contextual factors only at a limited level, and participants were similar with regard to demographics like socioeconomic status, so we could not adequately assess their influence. Our study focused primarily on participants in a larger trial of a public health intervention and findings may not be generalisable to non-trial participants, as will often be the case with SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Some limitations may be minimised by developing a ToC before the intervention is implemented, specifying a set of indicators appropriate for the expected agents of change and the level at which the intervention was implemented, and clearly defining key contextual factors. Whereas path analysis assumes variables are measured without error, including latent variables in SEM may be appropriate to assess underlying changes to participants' knowledge, attitudes or social norms, and could allow measurement error to be estimated and controlled <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. Use of a linear probability model as in this example will not often be appropriate, and evaluators should make use of GSEM options depending on the variables of interest.</p><p>Lastly, while path analysis applied to intervention ToC can provide useful evidence to validate or negate proposed theory, there are many assumptions involved with path analysis or SEMthat pathways are independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, all relevant variables are included and the model is well-specifiedthat limit its widespread use and adoption. The assumptions underlying SEM may not always be met and findings from this and similar analyses should be interpreted with caution. It is plausible that direct effects of shared sanitation might be further decomposed into more likely pathways, such as the direct effect of infrastructurethe 'behaviour setting' <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref> on cleaning behaviour. Uncertainty around paths to handwashing behaviours means the negative effect for some participants remains unexplained. Path analysis is not designed for exploratory purposes of discovering other factors that may be relevant to the system. Adding or removing variables a posteriori to maximise model fit can also lead to over-specification or path coefficients that are heavily dependent on the correlation structure of predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. Ultimately, the capacities of path anato test a Theory of Change are dependent on the validity of the theories being evaluated. Close coordination with qualitative research activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, as recommended in process evaluation guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, is therefore necessary to include the most plausible set of alternative pathways. Qualitative evidence could also be used to develop theory concerning unintended consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref>, which could be fed back into the path model for testing. Properly placed in regard to other sources of evidence, combining path analysis with ToC can be an effective tool for unpacking causal pathways for complex interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Although identification of process indicators and specification of a causal model are inherent parts of the process of developing a ToC, path analysis and related methods have been under-utilised in testing the theorised causal model. Application of the path analysis approach to a shared sanitation intervention in Mozambique revealed weaknesses in the proposed ToC and provided evidence for different mechanisms of change between contextual subgroups, informing interpretation of process evaluation findings. The MapSan intervention achieved high implementation fidelity and improved intermediary outcomes related to sanitation quality, likely through direct effects of sanitation infrastructure and not behaviour change activities. For process evaluations of complex interventions with multiple interacting components, this approach has use in distinguishing essential components, supporting refinement of intervention theory and improving understanding of the contexts in which an intervention will be most effective.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Implementation fidelityhow intervention dose (A) and reach (B) compared with what was intended 2.
