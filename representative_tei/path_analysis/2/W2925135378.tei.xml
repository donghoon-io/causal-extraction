<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Analysis of yield components in maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids across planting dates is limited. Research was conducted in 2013 and 2014 at Mead, Nebraska, United States with the objective to determine the influence of year, hybrid, drought tolerance type, and maturity classification across planting dates on maize yield and yield components. Early-and late-maturity DroughtGard (with CspB transgene) maize hybrids, and a late-maturity non-DroughtGard maize hybrid were planted at three dates in each year. Average maize yields were 10.8 ± 1.3 t/ha in 2013 and 13.6 ± 1.6 t/ha in 2014 with little difference across planting dates. Yield for 109 to 114 CRM (610 to 650 FAO maturity) hybrids was 13 ± 1.9 t/ha compared to 11 ± 1.6 t/ha for 97 to 100 CRM (450 to 480 FAO maturity) hybrids, and similar yields for late DroughtGard and non-DroughtGard hybrids were found. The yield of the earlymaturity DroughtGard hybrids was associated most with direct effects of the number of ears per square meter (R = 0.53**) and kernels per ear (R = 0.44**) while the latematurity DroughtGard hybrids were affected most by the direct effects of ears per square meter (R = 0.54**) and kernel weight (R = 0.57**). Yield components accounted for most yield differences between hybrids with different maturity classifications. Yield component compensation which occurred between DroughtGard and non-DroughtGard hybrids led to similar grain yields across planting dates.</p></div>

Rainfed maize grain yields have increased at a rate of 50 to 120 kg/ha per year in the Great Plains of the United States during the last 75 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Mason et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Assefa et al., 2012)</ref>. Selection of maize hybrids for native drought tolerance has always been important for rainfed conditions, but recently there is increasing interest in use of biotechnology-driven drought-tolerant maize hybrids containing the bacterial cold shock protein B (CspB), hereafter termed DroughtGard <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nemali et al., 2015)</ref>. Under well-watered conditions, the DroughtGard maize hybrids have been reported to produce similar yields to non-DroughtGard hybrids <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nemali et al., 2015)</ref>, and higher grain yield under waterlimited conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Castiglioni et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nemali et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kucharik (2008)</ref> found that earlier planting increased maize grain yield by 60 to 140 kg/ha per day in the states with relatively shorter growing seasons including Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin, but not in the longer growing season states of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. In Nebraska, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Swanson and Wilhelm (1996)</ref> found the highest maize yield when planted 10 to 12 May while grain yields were lower at earlier and later dates. <ref type="bibr">Irmak and Djaman (2016)</ref> found a decreasing maize yield with delayed planting under irrigation in contrast to a variable and small yield response under rainfed conditions.

Initial maize hybrids in the United States were developed by crossing lines that were good "pollen producers" and good "seed parents" together to optimize grain yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tracy and Chandler, 2006)</ref>, and today maize inbred lines are largely developed through recycling of closely related inbred lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mikel, 2011)</ref>. Modern hybrids have a large contribution of southern dent maize races <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown and Anderson, 1948)</ref> which is a major contributor to Reid Yellow Dent <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tracy and Chandler, 2006)</ref> and Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tracy and Chandler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikel, 2008)</ref> heterotic groups used in breeding programs today. Modern hybrids have little content of the early-maturity northern flint germplasm, which is often termed the Lancaster heterotic group, having decreased from 15% in the 1940s to only 3% in the 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mikel and Dudley, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tracy and Chandler, 2006)</ref>. The southern dent maize race was characterized by ears with up to 24 rows of deep kernels, commonly with girthy ears <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown and Anderson, 1948)</ref> while the early-maturity northern flint germplasm was characterized by multiple ears per plant, and long, slender ears with 8 to 10 rows per ear of broad and shallow kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown and Anderson, 1947)</ref>. Yield component studies regarding other maize heterotic groups have not been published.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p>Field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 in rainfed environments at the University of Nebraska Agriculture Research and Development Center (ARDC) near Mead, Nebraska, United States (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The predominant soil type was Tomek silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic, Pachic, Argiudoll) with 0 to 1% slope. The experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement and 3 replications. Three planting dates of 27 April, 16 May, and 3 June in 2013 and 18 April, 5 May, and 20 May in 2014 were nested within year and considered the whole plot. DroughtGard earlymaturity (450 to 480 FAO units), DroughtGard late-maturity (630 to 650 FAO units) and non-DroughtGard late-maturity (610 FAO units) hybrids were the split plot. More details about the experiment procedures can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Mason et al. (2018)</ref>. Grain yield was measured by mechanically harvesting the middle three rows of the plots at approximately 200 g/kg water content. Grain was weighed, water content was measured, and yield for each plot adjusted to a water content of 155 g/kg. Prior to harvest, the number of ears was counted and six consecutive-ear samples were collected from each plot for measurement of yield components. Primary and secondary yield components measured were ears per square meter, kernels per ear, rows per ear, kernels per row, kernel depth, and kernel weight. Rows per ear, kernels per row , and kernels per ear were hand counted prior to hand shelling. Kernel depth was calculated by using calipers to determine the mid-ear diameter and cob diameter. The number of kernels per ear was hand counted and 100 kernels were randomly selected from each ear and used to determine the kernel weight, and corrected to a moisture content of 155 g/kg. Data were analyzed using PROC Mixed of SAS <ref type="bibr">(SAS Institute, 2014)</ref>. Initially analysis of variance, Pearson correlations and path analysis were conducted with year (Y), planting date within year [PD(Y)], and hybrid main effects and their interactions were considered fixed effects, while replication and interactions with replication were considered random effects. Path analysis indicated that early-maturity DroughtGard hybrids (97 and 100 CRMs) and late-maturity DroughtGard hybrids (112 and 114 CRMs) had similar models, so the 97 and 100 CRM, and 112 and 114 CRM hybrids were pooled together to increase the power-of-test for the Pearson correlations and path analysis. Pearson correlations were calculated to identify interrelationships among measured parameters. Path correlation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mohammadi et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kmail et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Milander et al., 2017)</ref> of yield and the primary yield components of the number of ears per square meter and kernels per ear, and kernel weight, and secondary yield components of the number of rows per ear and kernels per row, and kernel depth was completed using PROC CALIS to determine model goodness-of-fit.</p></div>

(2018)</ref>.</p><p>Compensation among yield components to maintain grain yield occurred. In 2013, maize yield components were increased by 0.2 ears per square meter for late compared to early planting, and by reducing kernel depth by 0.7 mm, and kernel weight by 4.1 mg per 100-kernels. In contrast in 2014, maize yield components were decreased by late rather than early planting date by 0.7 ears per square meter and 0.3 mm increased kernel depth, and 4 mg per 100-kernels. Early-developing yield components of ears per square meter and number of kernels per ear were relatively more important for earlier planted maize while late-developing yield components of kernel depth and weight were relatively more important for late-planted maize. The late-maturity DroughtGard and non-DroughtGard hybrids produced 13 ± 1.9 (n = 54) t/ha compared to 11 ± 1.6 (n = 36) t/ha for the early-maturity DroughtGard maize hybrids. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pearson correlations</head><p>Maize grain yield was correlated with the number of kernels per ear and kernels per row, and kernel depth, and kernel weight for all hybrids (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). The number of ears per square meter was associated with grain yield for the late-maturity DroughtGard hybrids, but not for the non-DroughtGard hybrid. The number of ears per square meter was weakly correlated with grain yield for the early-maturity DroughtGard hybrid.

DroughtGard hybrids but varied by hybrid. Yield of early-maturity DroughtGard hybrids were associated with all primary yield components, but to a lesser extent for kernel weight than the other yield components. The number of ears per square meter had direct effects on grain yield of DroughtGard hybrids (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>), and kernel weight had high direct effect of greater than 0.55 on grain yield for latematurity DroughtGard and non-DroughtGard hybrids (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). The number of kernels per ear had direct effects on grain yield for early-maturity DroughtGard and non-DroughtGard hybrids (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). The number of kernels per ear had a direct effect on kernel weight for DroughtGard hybrids, while the number of ears per square meter had a direct effect on the number of kernels per ear for non-DroughtGard hybrids. Secondary yield component association with primary yield components were similar for DroughtGard hybrids except for the negative association of the number of rows per ear with kernel weight for early-maturity hybrids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). There was a positive association of kernel depth with both the number of kernels per row and kernels per ear, and the number of kernels per row with kernel weight for late-maturity hybrids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). The number of kernels per row with kernels per ear was the only association between secondary and primary yield components for non-DroughtGard hybrids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>), partially due to presence of fewer degrees of freedom than for DroughtGard hybrids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Maize grain yield was not influenced by planting date regardless of hybrid drought tolerance and maturity classifications <ref type="bibr">(Mason et al., 2018)</ref>, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lauer et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kucharik (2008)</ref>. This was unexpected, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Seifert et al. (2017)</ref> did find less effect of maize planting date following soybean as in this study than for maize following maize. Planting date variation among hybrids was small and had no influence on grain yield or yield components. Yield component compensation occurred to maintain grain yields across planting dates <ref type="bibr">(Mason et al., 2018)</ref>, as also found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Milander et al. (2016)</ref> across plant populations.</p><p>Grain yield was greater for late-maturity than early-maturity DroughtGard maize hybrids, consistent with findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Milander et al. (2017)</ref>. The greater yield of the late-maturity DroughtGard hybrids was associated with production of more kernels per ear and rows per ear combined with decreased kernel weight, more rows per ear and greater kernel depth. Grain yield of DroughtGard hybrids with different maturity classification was influenced by the number of ears per square meter. However, the early-maturity DroughtGard hybrids yield also had a direct effect of the primary yield component number of kernels per ear while the late-maturity hybrids had direct effect of kernel weight. Early-maturity DroughtGard hybrids had a direct effect of the number of early occurring rows per ear on kernel weight, while for the late-maturity DroughtGard hybrids, kernel depth had direct effects with the later occurring number of kernels per ear and kernels per row, which was similar to the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Milander et al. (2017)</ref>. Visual observations confirmed that early-maturity DroughtGard maize hybrids had longer ears with shallower kernel depth consistent with northern dent germplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown and Anderson, 1947)</ref>, but present in only small amount in modern North American germplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mikel and Dudley, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tracy and Chandler, 2006)</ref>. In contrast, late-maturity DroughtGard maize hybrids had girthier ears and deeper kernels consistent with southern dent germplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown and Anderson, 1948)</ref> common in modern hybrids <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Tracy and Chandler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikel, 2008)</ref>. It appears that yield component differences across maturity classifications were likely due to differences in germplasm composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown and Anderson, 1947;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown and Anderson, 1948)</ref>, although recent studies have not reported a connection between maturity classification and germplasm source <ref type="bibr">(Mikel, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mikel and Dudley;</ref><ref type="bibr">2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tracy and Chandler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mikel, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the girthier ears and deeper kernels which developed late in the growing season are consistent with their greater importance for yield determination in latematurity DroughtGard hybrids compared to early-maturity DroughtGard hybrids. DroughtGard and non-DroughtGard corn hybrids with similar late maturity classification produced similar grain yield, however, great variation in yield components occurred. The DroughtGard hybrids had direct effects of the earlydetermined number of ears per square meter on grain yield, while the non-DroughtGard hybrid had a mid-season direct effect of number of kernels per ear on grain yield. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Castiglioni et al. (2008)</ref> found that DroughtGard hybrids had increased production of ears per square meter and kernels per ear than non-DroughtGard hybrids. Although the understanding of the production of the similar yields with great differences in yield components is incomplete, it is speculated that germplasm differences associated with or without the CspB transgene were related to germplasm differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Planting date had no influence on maize yield but great yield component compensation occurred among planting dates. Late hybrid maturity increased grain yield over early-maturity hybrids, due to yield component differences detected by Pearson correlation and path analysis that were likely associated with germplasm source. These maturity classification differences were undoubtedly related to seasonlong interception of photosynthetically active radiation and accumulation of growing degree units (GDUs). Similar grain yields were produced by DroughtGard and non-DroughtGard maize hybrids, but yield components in this study varied greatly likely due to germplasm source. To understand yield response in crop management research, grain yield components should be measured and as possible, related to germplasm differences in the hybrids planted.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Original scientific paper DOI: /10.5513/JCEA01/20.1.2106 MASON et al.: Path analysis of drought tolerant maize hybrid yield and yield components across...</figDesc></figure>
