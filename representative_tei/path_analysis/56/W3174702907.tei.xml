<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Population and Sample</head><p>The universe of the research consists of academic and administrative staff working at Osmaniye Korkut Ata University in Osmaniye and its districts. The convenience sampling method was used in the study and the data were collected through a questionnaire. Osmaniye Korkut Ata University has a total of 1022 academic and administrative staff according to the 2019 Internal Evaluation Report of the university (<ref type="url" target="http://sgdb.osmaniye.edu.tr/">http://sgdb.osmaniye.edu.tr/</ref>). Accordingly, the universe of the research consists of 1022 university staff. People are working in different units, including academic and administrative staff at universities. In this respect, it is thought that the organizational structure of universities is different from other public institutions and universities differ from other public institutions in this respect. The universe of research has been chosen as university personnel, considering that the personnel working in different departments in academic and administrative positions may have different perspectives. Ethical Approval (Date and Number of Document: 29/11 / 2019-30866) was obtained from the Scientific Research and Publication Ethics Board of Osmaniye Korkut Ata University to conduct the research. Following the necessary permissions, a total of 500 questionnaires were distributed between December 11, 2019, and January 10, 2020. 396 of the questionnaires were answered. 6 questionnaires that were filled in incorrectly and incompletely were excluded from the study. Analyzes were carried out with a total of 390 questionnaires. The survey response rate was 78 percent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data Collection Tools</head><p>The data collection tool consists of four parts: the Organizational Citizenship Behavior Scale, the Interactional Justice Scale, the Communication Satisfaction Scale, and the Personal Information Form. The Organizational Citizenship Behavior Scale, which has been translated into Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Basım and Şeşen (2006)</ref> and whose validity and reliability is carried out, consists of 19 items and five dimensions (altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, gentlemanship, civic virtue).

The participants were asked in the Personal Information Form about their age, gender, and marital status, as well as their educational level (primary education, high school, associate degree, undergraduate, graduate, doctorate), total tenure, employment type, positions, and whether they undertook administrative duties at the university.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS</head><p>In this part of the study, the demographic characteristics of the participants, reliability analyses to determine the reliability of the scales, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to determine the construct validity of the scales, and the findings of the analysis of the hypotheses are included. Histogram graph, skewness, and kurtosis values of the variables were examined and as a result, it was determined that there was a normal distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Demographic Characteristics of the Participants</head><p>The gender distribution of the respondents who answered the questionnaire was 35% female and 65% male. In terms of marital status, 73,1% of the participants were married and 26.9% were single. In terms of staff duties, 51,5% of the participants were in academic status, 40,5% were in administrative status, and 8% were in worker status. The demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Findings Regarding the Scales</head><p>The reliability values and exploratory factor analysis values of the scales used in the study are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and the confirmatory factor analysis values are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The findings in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> show that the items are collected under a single factor as a result of the exploratory factor analysis of the Interactional Justice Scale. Two statements were excluded from the analysis because they negatively affected internal consistency. According to the exploratory factor analysis result of the Communication Satisfaction Scale, the items were grouped under three factors: communication with the superior, individual feedback, and horizontal communication. There are five dimensions and 26 expressions in the original scale. Expressions related to organizational integration and communication climate dimensions were omitted from the analysis because they were below factor load values and loaded on more than one factor. Besides, one statement from both individual feedback and horizontal communication dimensions was excluded from the analysis due to their low factor loadings. According to the exploratory factor analysis of the OCB scale, the items were grouped under four factors: civic virtue, altruism, courtesy, and gentlemanship. The original scale had five dimensions and 19 expressions. Three expressions were excluded from the analysis due to their low factor loadings and/or their being loaded on more than one factor. The question regarding the dimension of conscientiousness was attributed to the civic virtue dimension with seven high factor loadings and the gentlemanship dimension with eight high factor loadings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demirel et al. (2011)</ref> explained the scale in three dimensions: altruism and courtesy as one dimension, conscience and gentlemanship as one dimension, and civic virtue as one dimension (p. 40). It has been observed that there were similar uses in the literature. Accordingly, it was decided that these two expressions should remain under the factor they were loaded with. The reliability of the scales used in the study was determined according to the Cronbach Alpha coefficient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Karagöz (2016)</ref> suggests that the Cronbach Alpha value should be at least 0,60 <ref type="bibr">(Karagöz, 2016, p.941)</ref>. The KMO value should be above 0,60 as well as the Barlett test should be significant in determining the factor analysis appropriateness of the data <ref type="bibr">(Büyüköztürk, 2005, p. 126)</ref>. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results of the scales showed that they were structurally valid (See Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). It has been determined that the scales meet the general reliability criteria along with their dimensions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Findings Regarding the Hypotheses</head><p>This part of the study includes the results of Pearson correlation analysis conducted to examine the relationship between variables and the findings of the hypotheses that were created to examine the relationship between interactional justice, communication satisfaction, and OCBs of employees.</p><p>Pearson correlation analysis results showing the relationship between variables are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The correlation coefficients between all variables are positive based on the result of the correlation analysis. It was found that the relationship between the altruism variable and the individual feedback variable was not significant, yet the relationships between all other variables were significant. The values are as follows: r = 0 no relationship, 0,00 &lt;r≤0,25 very poor, 0,26≤r≤0,49 poor, 0,50≤r≤0,69 medium, 0,70≤r≤ 0,89 strong, 0,90≤r &lt;1 very strong, r = 1 full relationship <ref type="bibr">(Karagöz, 2016, p.727)</ref>. Considering the strongest and weakest relationships between variables, it was found that the strongest positive relationship was between the communication with the superior variable and the interactional justice variable, and the lowest positive relationship was between the courtesy variable and the individual feedback variable.</p><p>A path analysis was conducted with structural equation modeling to test the mediating role of communication satisfaction in the effect of interactional justice on the OCB and the effect of communication satisfaction on the OCB. The reason behind choosing the structural equation model instead of regression analysis while investigating the mediation effect is that the structural model offers a stronger infrastructure. While regression analysis uses the averages of the variables in the tests, the structural equation model also includes measurement and residual errors in the calculation <ref type="bibr">(Meydan &amp; Şeşen, 2015, p.131)</ref>. If the entire effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is through an mediating variable, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> call this effect "partial mediation". On the other hand, if the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is entirely through the mediating variable, such an effect is called "full mediation" <ref type="bibr">(Meydan &amp; Şeşen, 2015, p. 129-130)</ref>.</p><p>Structural equation model path analysis was created to test the research hypotheses. The structural equation model is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. It is seen that interactional justice (independent variable) has a significant positive effect on OCB (dependent variable) (β=0,194; p &lt;0,001) based on the path analysis regression coefficients. It is seen that interactional justice (independent variable) has a significant positive effect on communication satisfaction (mediating variable) (β = 0,626; p &lt;0,001). It is seen that communication satisfaction (mediating variable) has a significant positive effect on OCB (dependent variable) (β = 0,350; p &lt;0,001). The mediating role of communication satisfaction in the effect of interactional justice on OCB and communication satisfaction on OCB affects interactional justice, communication satisfaction (β = 0,624; p &lt;0,001), and OCB (β = 0,194; p &lt;0,001) based on the regression coefficients. The effect of interactional justice, which has an effect on OCB, became insignificant after the inclusion of communication satisfaction in the model (β = 0,028; 0,707&gt; p&gt;0,05). Communication satisfaction has a full mediation role in the effect of interactional justice perception on OCB, based on the analysis results.</p><p>The direct, indirect, and total effects of interactional justice and communication satisfaction on the OCB are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. The independent variable affects the dependent variable through the mediating variable, which is called full mediation <ref type="bibr">(Little et al., 2007, pp. 209-210;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gunzler, Chen, Wu, &amp; Zhang, 2013, p. 392)</ref>. According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>, although a direct effect of interactional justice on OCB has not been determined, it has a mediation effect (β = 0,317; p &lt;0,05). The result of the analysis shows that communication satisfaction is a dominant mediator in the research model. Communication satisfaction fully explains the relationship between interactional justice and OCB. It is necessary to determine the significance of the decreases in Beta (β) values to fully reveal the mediating role of communication satisfaction. Sobel Test was used to determine this significance. The Sobel Test tests the significance of the change in the regression coefficient by including the regression weights of the variables in the model and the standard errors of the relationships between the variables <ref type="bibr">(Meydan &amp; Şeşen, 2015, p.133)</ref>.</p><p>The results of the Sobel Test conducted to confirm the mediating role of communication satisfaction are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>. According to the results of the Sobel Test, communication satisfaction was found to have a mediating role in the effect of interactional justice on OCB (Z = 2,356; p &lt;0,05). As a result, hypothesis H4 (Communication satisfaction has an mediating role in the effect of interactional justice on organizational citizenship behavior) has been verified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SONUÇ</head><p>This study aims to examine the relationship between perception of interactional justice, communication satisfaction, and OCB and to determine whether communication satisfaction has an mediating role in the effect of interactional justice on OCB. In this context, four research hypotheses have been created. Initially, correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between participants' perceptions of interactional justice, communication satisfaction levels, and OCBs. As a result of the correlation analysis, it was found that the relationship between the altruism variable and the individual feedback variable was not significant, where the relationships between all other variables were significant. When the variables with significant relationships with each other were examined, it was found that these relationships were positive, the strongest positive relationship was between the interactional justice variable and the communication with the superior variable, and the weakest relationship was between the courtesy variable and the individual feedback variable.</p><p>Then, a path diagram was created with the structural equation model to reveal the detailed relationship between the variables in the study and to reveal whether the communication satisfaction levels have a mediating role in the effect of the participants' perceptions of interactional justice on their OCBs. It was seen that the path analysis and goodness of fit values were compatible with the acceptable goodness of fit values. It was seen that interactional justice had a significant positive effect on the OCB, based on the first hypothesis regression coefficients of the structural equation model path analysis. This finding is compatible with the results of the studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Smith et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Farh, Podsakoff and Organ 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moorman 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Konovsky and Folger 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Organ and Moorman 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aquino 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Konovsky and Organ 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Skarlicki and Latham 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">İşbaşı 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fire 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arslantaş 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fassina, Jones and Uggerslev 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yellow 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Şahal 2015</ref>. The widespread adoption of interactional justice within the organization and the transparent, respectful, and sincere explanation of the decision-making process of organizational managers to the employees regarding the distribution of gains increases the OCB of the employees.</p><p>It was seen that interactional justice has had a significant positive impact on communication satisfaction, based on the second hypothesis regression coefficients of the path analysis. This finding is compatible with the results of the studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thomas, Zolin and Hartman 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Özkılıçcı 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tanius, Pheng, Kasim and Yulia 2017.</ref> It was seen that communication satisfaction has had a significant positive effect on OCB, based on the third hypothesis regression coefficients of the path analysis. This finding is compatible with the results of the studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kandlousi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aydoğdu 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chan and Lai 2016.</ref> It has been concluded that the increase in communication satisfaction of the employees has a positive effect on both OCB and interactional justice.</p><p>The mediating role of communication satisfaction in the effect of interactional justice on OCB was tested within the scope of path analysis fourth hypothesis. Interactional justice affects both communication satisfaction and OCB based on the regression coefficients of the model. The effect of interactional justice on the OCB has become insignificant following the inclusion of communication satisfaction in the model. As a result, it has been concluded that communication satisfaction has had a full mediation role in the effect of interactional justice perception on OCB. Finally, Sobel Test was performed to confirm the mediation effect of communication satisfaction.</p><p>Sobel test results supported the mediating role of communication satisfaction in the effect of interactional justice on OCB. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Konovsky and Organ (1996)</ref> concluded that organizational justice and satisfaction affected the OCB, and another study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fournier (2008)</ref> suggested that there was a positive relationship between interactional justice, communication satisfaction, and OCB.</p><p>It has been determined that communication satisfaction has an mediating role in the relationship between organizational justice and OCB in Turkey as well, based on the findings as a result of the analysis carried out in the study. As a result of the regression analysis performed in a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chan and Lai (2016)</ref>, it was determined that communication satisfaction has an mediating role in the relationship between employees' interactional justice perception and OCB. It has been understood that communication satisfaction increases the effect of interactional justice on the OCB. It is thought that communication satisfaction of employees has a key role in predicting the OCB and activities that will ensure the widespread adoption of communication satisfaction are needed to ensure interactional justice within the organization and to increase the OCB.</p><p>The main feature that distinguishes this study from similar studies in the literature is that it includes interactional justice, communication satisfaction, and OCBs together in the analysis process. While the impacts of interactional justice and communication satisfaction on citizenship behaviors are statistically significant, the impact of the independent variable interactional justice becomes insignificant under the mediating impact of communication satisfaction. While interactional justice affects citizenship, communication satisfaction also significantly affects it through interactional justice. It is thought that the study will contribute to the literature in this aspect. In this context, some suggestions that may be beneficial for the practitioners and future studies have been presented in the light of the information obtained from the research findings. It is particularly observed that the need for communication and OCB has increased as organizations adapt to alternatives such as flexible working/telecommuting, which are being used more intensively with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Providing opportunities to increase the communication satisfaction of employees and encourage them to exhibit OCBs will contribute to organizations both in the short and long run. It is thought that the establishment of an effective communication network according to the structure and operation method of the organization will improve the communication of the personnel working in different departments with each other so that the managers will be aware of the expectations, requests, suggestions, and complaints of the employees in a short time. In this way, problems in organizational functions can be prevented. It is thought that the adoption of equal pay and equal work policy for the personnel working in the same position can increase the trust of the employees towards the organization. Ensuring justice among employees may increase employees' commitment to the organization. Besides, more efficient communication will be possible with methods such as meetings and seminars that allow face-to-face communication. Activities such as celebrations and picnics that will enable employees to have a pleasant time together outside of work will also improve relations between employees and prevent prejudices.</p><p>However, this study has some limitations as in the case of any academic study. The findings should be considered within these limitations. The study was carried out on the staff of Osmaniye Korkut Ata University in Osmaniye, Turkey. In this context, it was limited to a questionnaire conducted on the staff of a public university. In addition, since the cross-sectional time data collection method is used in the study, the results obtained are limited to the period in which the research was applied. Other public and private sector organizations could not be included in the sample due to time and cost constraints. The findings of the research may not be generalized to other sectors. Testing the research model in different sectors, using larger samples, and conducting longer-term studies may generalize the research results of future studies. Including organizational variables such as organizational commitment, job satisfaction, job performance, job satisfaction, culture, and trust in the model can provide more detailed results and make more important contributions to the literature.</p></div>

Yapısal eşitlik modeli yol analizi aracılık modeli uyum iyiliği değerlerine göre modelin kabul edilebilir uyum iyiliği değerlerini sağladığı tespit edilmiştir.</p><p>Bu araştırmada literatüre paralel olarak etkileşimsel adaletin ÖVD üzerinde pozitif yönde anlamlı bir etkisinin olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Kurum içerisinde etkileşimsel adaletin yaygınlaştırılmasının, örgüt yöneticilerinin kazanımların dağıtımları ile ilgili karar alma sürecini çalışanlarla şeffaf, saygılı ve samimi olarak açıklamaları çalışanların ÖVD'nı arttırmaktadır.</p><p>Etkileşimsel adaletin iletişim memnuniyeti üzerinde pozitif yönde anlamlı bir etkisinin olduğu ve iletişim memnuniyetinin ÖVD üzerinde pozitif yönde anlamlı bir etkisinin olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Çalışanların iletişim memnuniyetinin artmasının hem ÖVD üzerinde hem de etkileşimsel adalet üzerinde olumlu yansıması olduğu belirlenmiştir.</p><p>Etkileşimsel adaletin ÖVD üzerindeki etkisinde iletişim memnuniyetinin aracı rolünün varlığı test edilmiştir. Modelin regresyon katsayılarına göre, etkileşimsel adalet, iletişim memnuniyetini ve örgütsel vatandaşlık davranışını etkilemektedir. ÖVD üzerinde etkili olan etkileşimsel adaletin bu etkisi iletişim memnuniyetinin modele eklenmesi sonrasında anlamsızlaşmıştır. Sonuç olarak etkileşimsel adalet algısının ÖVD üzerindeki etkisinde iletişim memnuniyetinin tam aracılık rolü olduğu belirlenmiştir. Son olarak iletişim memnuniyetinin aracılık etkisini teyit etmek amacıyla Sobel testi yapılmıştır. Sobel testi sonucuna göre, etkileşimsel adaletin örgütsel vatandaşlık davranışı üzerindeki etkisinde iletişim memnuniyetinin aracı rolü olduğu desteklenmiştir.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sonuç ve Tartışma</head><p>İletişim memnuniyetinin etkileşimsel adaletin ÖVD üzerindeki etkisini arttırdığı anlaşılmaktadır. Etkileşimsel adaletin ÖVD'nı yordamasında çalışanların iletişim memnuniyetinin kilit bir role sahip olduğu, etkileşimsel adaletin örgüt içerisinde sağlanmasının ve çalışanların ÖVD'nı arttırmasında iletişim memnuniyetinin örgüt içerisinde arttıracak ve yaygınlaştırılacak faaliyetlere ihtiyaç duyulduğu anlaşılmaktadır.</p><p>Bu çalışmayı literatürdeki benzer çalışmalardan farklı kılan özelliği etkileşimsel adalet, iletişim memnuniyeti ve örgütsel vatandaşlık davranışlarının birlikte analiz sürecine dahil edilmeleri, etkileşimsel adaletin ve iletişim memnuniyetinin vatandaşlık davranışları üzerindeki etkileri istatistiki açıdan anlamlı iken iletişim memnuniyetinin aracılık etkisinde bağımsız değişken etkileşimsel adaletin etkisinin anlamsızlaşmasıdır. Etkileşimsel adalet örgütsel vatandaşlık davranışını doğrudan etkilerken iletişim memnuniyeti de etkileşimsel adalet üzerinden anlamlı bir şekilde etkilemektedir. Bu yönüyle literatüre katkı sağlayacağı düşünülmektedir. Bu bağlamda araştırma bulgularından edinilen bilgiler sonucunda uygulamacılara ve gelecek çalışmalara faydalı olabileceği düşünülen öneriler sunulmuştur. Özellikle günümüzde yaşanan Covid-19 salgını ile daha yoğun olarak kullanılmaya başlanan esnek, uzaktan çalışma gibi alternatiflere örgütlerin uyum sağlamasında iletişime ve örgütsel vatandaşlık davranışlarına duyulan ihtiyacın arttığı gözlemlenmektedir. Çalışanların iletişim memnuniyetlerini arttırıcı, örgütsel vatandaşlık davranışları sergilemelerini teşvik edici imkanların sağlanması hem kısa hem de uzun vadede örgütlere katkı sağlayacaktır. Örgütün yapısı ve işleyiş yöntemine göre etkili bir iletişim ağının oluşturulmasıyla; farklı bölüm/departmanlarda çalışan personelin birbirleri ile iletişimlerinin arttırılması ile yöneticilerin çalışanların beklenti, istek, öneri, şikâyet gibi olumlu ve olumsuz durumlarından kısa sürede haberdar olabileceği ve bu sayede örgütsel işleyişteki aksaklıkların önüne geçilebileceği düşünülmektedir. Aynı görevde çalışan personel için eşit ücret, eşit iş politikasının benimsenmesinin; çalışanların örgüte olan güvenlerini artırabileceği, yüz yüze iletişimi sağlayacak toplantı, seminer gibi yöntemlerle; iletişim verimli kılınabilecektir. Çalışanlar arasında adaletin sağlanmasının çalışanların örgüte bağlılıklarını artırabileceği düşünülmektedir.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
