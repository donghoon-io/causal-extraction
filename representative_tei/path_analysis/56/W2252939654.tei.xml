<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Alkaline-earth (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba) complexes are shown to catalyse the chemoselective crossdehydrocoupling (CDC) of amines and hydrosilanes. Key trends have been delineated in the benchmark couplings of Ph3SiH with pyrrolidine or tBuNH2. Ae[E(SiMe3)2]2•(THF)x (E = N, CH; x = 2-3) are more efficient than {N^N}Ae[E(SiMe3)2]2•(THF)n (n = 1-2) complexes bearing an iminoanilide ligand, and alkyl precatalysts are better than amido ones. Turnover frequencies (TOF) increase with Ca&lt;Sr&lt;Ba. Ba[CH(SiMe3)2]2•(THF)3 displays the best performance (TOF up to 3600 h -1 ). Substrate scope (&gt; 30 products) include di(amine)s and di(hydrosilane)s. Kinetic analysis of the Ba-promoted CDC of pyrrolidine and Ph3SiH show that (i) the kinetic law is rate = k [Ba] 1 [amine] 0 [hydrosilane] 1 , (ii) electron-withdrawing psubstituents in arylhydrosilanes improve reaction rates, (iii) a maximal kinetic isotopic effect (kSiH/kSiD = 4.7) is seen for Ph3SiX (X = H, D). DFT computations have identified the prevailing mechanism. Instead of an inaccessible -bond breaking metathesis pathway, DFT provides evidence that the CDC follows a stepwise reaction path with N-Si bond-forming nucleophilic attack of the catalytically competent Ba pyrrolide onto the incoming silane, followed by rate-limiting H-transfer to Ba. The participation of Ba silyl species is prevented energetically. The trend Ca&lt;Sr&lt;Ba results from greater accessibility of the metal centre and increasing Ae-Namide bond strength upon going down in group 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The catalysis of cross-dehydrocoupling ( CDC) reactions between E-H and E'-H moieties leading to the formation of E-E' bonds and release of dihydrogen as by-product, where E and E' are respectively electronegative (N, O, P) and more electropositive (B, Si) p-block elements, is attracting growing interest in main group chemistry. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> The resulting molecular or macromolecular species are useful as emissive materials, high-performance elastomers, synthetic precursors for ceramic thin films and monoliths, and in biomedicine. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> Of interest to our research program, the formation of N-Si bonds yields silazanes.</p><p>These are valuable as ligands in coordination chemistry, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[3]</ref> as bases, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> silylating agents <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> or protecting groups for amines, indoles and anilines in organic synthesis. <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> In addition, some oligo-and polysilazanes make for excellent precursors of Si3N4 ceramics. <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> Traditional processes for the production of silazanes require metalation of amines with alkali bases or aminolysis of chlorosilanes, <ref type="bibr">[ 7 a,8]</ref> but these procedures involving the formation of stoichiometric amounts of salts or HCl by-products are not optimal. The impetus is now shifting towards cost-and atom-efficient methods such as the expedient catalysed N-H/H-Si cross-dehydrocoupling of hydrosilanes with HNR 1 R 2 amines (R 1 , R 2 = H, alkyl, aryl). Middle and late transition metal compounds where the low-valent metal centre can undergo oxidative addition, e.g. palladium Al2O3-supported species and graphene-supported nanoparticles, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> Ru3(CO)12 and Rh6(CO)16 clusters, <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> or discrete ruthenium(II), <ref type="bibr">[ 6 b, 6 e]</ref> rhodium(I), <ref type="bibr">[ 6 c,11]</ref> or chromium(0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[12]</ref> complexes, first dominated the arena; a copper(I) system was also described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[13]</ref> Notable results were later achieved with hard, oxophilic metal ions for which bond metathesis or Si-to-metal hydride transfer are prominent mechanistic features. Hence, some success was met in the 1990's with Cp2TiMe2, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> while more recently Al 3+ , <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[15]</ref> Y 3+ , <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[16]</ref> Yb 2+ , <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> U 4+ , <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[18]</ref> Zn 2+ , <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[19]</ref> and especially Ae 2+ (Ae = alkaline-earth) <ref type="bibr">[17c,20]</ref> catalysts have shown great promise. B(C6F5)3 is useful for the coupling of hydrosilanes with aromatic amines. <ref type="bibr">[ 6 f]</ref> Of these, alkaline-earth catalysts are particularly efficient, achieving high selectivity in the coupling of hydrosilanes and amines, hydrazines or ammonia.

The Ca precatalyst performed substantially better than its Mg and Sr analogues, as exemplified in the coupling of Et2NH with Ph2SiH2. However, several subtleties associated to the bond polarity and to charge density of the Ae ion became apparent upon mechanistic investigations. The kinetic rate law was first-order in [metal] and [amine] and zeroth-order in [silane] for Mg and Ca precatalysts, but it was second-order in [metal] and first-order in [amine] and [silane] with Sr.</p><p>In a recent communication, we reported that highly active and selective Ba complexes surpass their Ca and Sr analogues for chemoselective N-H/H-Si CDC reactions; <ref type="bibr">[20c]</ref> the main mechanistic features were delineated upon combination of experiment and DFT computations.</p><p>The full scope of this Ae-catalysed reaction is presented here together with a thorough DFT analysis of rival mechanistic pathways.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Precatalyst synthesis</head><p>A broad range of Ae precatalysts, some devoid of bulky ancillary ligands and some instead stabilised by the bidentate iminoanilide {N^N} -( [ArN(o-C6H4)C(H)=NAr] -with Ar = 2,6-iPr-C6H3) were initially screened in the CDC of amines and hydrosilanes (families of complexes 1-8, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Most were prepared according to known literature protocols. The silanido compounds Ae(SiPh3)2•(THF)3 (Ae = Sr, 5-Sr; Ba, 5-Ba) and the heteroleptic complex {N^N}Ba{N(SiMe2H)2}•(THF)2 (7-Ba) were synthesised here for the first time. The pyrrolido complexes {N^N}Sr{N(CH2)4}•(HN(CH2)4) (9-Sr), where some degree of stabilisation is ensured by a coordinated molecule of pyrrolidine ( HN(CH2)4), <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[21]</ref> and {N^N}Ba{N(SiMe3)2}•(HN(CH2)4)2 (10-Ba) were also prepared for mechanistic purposes. The yellow 5-Sr (29Si = -12.14 ppm) and the orange 5-Ba (29Si = -12.11 ppm) were obtained in 32% and 86% in non-optimised yield, respectively, upon salt metathesis between the alkaline-earth iodides AeI2 and 2 equiv of freshly prepared KSiPh3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[22]</ref> in THF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[23]</ref> The orange 7-Ba supported by the bulky bidentate iminoanilide {N^N} -was synthesised by salt metathesis of {N^N}H, anhydrous BaI2 and 2 equiv of KN(SiMe2H)2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[24]</ref> following a known one-pot protocol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[25]</ref> The orange strontium-pyrrolide 9-Sr was prepared in pentane upon aminolysis of the alkyl complex 8-Sr with excess pyrrolidine (3 equiv); on the other hand, treatment of 6-Ba with 2 equiv of pyrrolidine merely afforded the bis-adduct 10-Ba by displacement of THF, with no evidence for the release of HN(SiMe3)2 and formation of a Bapyrrolide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[26]</ref> Diagnostic resonances in its 1 H NMR spectrum include broad overlapping multiplets at  2.49 and at 1.27 ppm, integrating each for 8H and belonging to the coordinated pyrrolidine molecule and pyrrolide, and a broad singlet at  0.94 ppm for the two HNpyrrolidine acidic hydrogens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[21]</ref> The presence of N(SiMe2H) -moieties in 7-Ba compared to the more traditional N(SiMe3)2 -amido group in 6-Ba is known to impart greater stability and kinetic inertness to complexes of the large alkaline-earth metals owing to the formation of intramolecular Ba•••H-Si -agostic interactions, although this may at times come at the expense of catalytic efficacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">27]</ref> The agostic contact in 7-Ba is detected spectroscopically: the 1 JH-Si coupling constant of 160 Hz in the 1 H NMR spectrum and the stretching frequency vSi-H of 2004 cm -1 in the FTIR spectrum of the complex both testify to the existence of agostic bonding of mild intensity. Agostic distortions are better visualised in the molecular solid-state structure of the complex determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). A large discrepancy is noted between the Ba2-N53-Si3 (129.7(2) °) and Ba2-N53-Si4 (105.31(19) °)   angles. Moreover, the four atoms Ba2, N53, Si4 and H4 (with the Si4-H4 bond pointing towards the metal) are nearly perfectly coplanar whereas Ba2, N53, Si3 and H3 are not. Both observations imply the presence of a single, mild Ba2•••H4-Si4 agostic interaction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> resulting in a formerly 6-coordinate Ba2 atom. By comparison, the two Ba-N-Si angles (114.85(15)° and 119.78(14)°) in {N^N}Ba{N(SiMe3)2}•(THF)2 (6-Ba) do not show as great a difference as in 7-Ba, and the Ba-Namide bond length in 6-Ba (2.623(3) Å) is elongated visà-vis that in 7-Ba (2.601(4) Å). <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[29]</ref>  Ba2-N53 = 2.601(4), Ba2-N51= 2.676(4), Ba2-N52 = 2.764(4), Ba2-O96 = 2.774(3), Ba2-O91 = 2.811(3); Si4-N53-Ba2 = 105.31 (19), Si3-N53-Ba2 = 129.7(2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Precatalyst screening</head><p>The performances of the families of complexes 1-9 as precatalysts in N-H/H-Si CDC reactions were first assessed in two benchmark reactions: the coupling of triphenylsilane with the highly reactive pyrrolidine or with the more reluctant tert-butylamine (Scheme 1). From the results of this preliminary screening collated in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, the following main lines emerge: (i) independently of the identity of the ligands, the catalytic activity increases systematically according to Ca &lt; Sr &lt; Ba (compare the following sets of experiments: entries 9, 10 and 11, entries 15, 16 and 18, entries 20, 21 and 22, or entries 24, 25 and 26); <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[30]</ref> the barium precatalysts afforded unmatched overall turnover frequency (TOF) values calculated at 75-99% conversions up to 3600 molsubstrate•molBa -1 •h -1 as in entry 13; (ii) the simple bisamido complexes 1 are more effective than their direct heteroleptic counterparts 6 (compare entries 9 and 15, 10 and 16, or 11 and 17), the same being true of the bis-alkyls 4 and their heteroleptic derivatives 8 (compare entries 14 and 19 or 22 and 26); (iii) the presence of coordinated THF molecules in bis-amido precatalysts bears no influence on the overall catalytic efficiency (compare entries 3 and 4, or 10 and 12); (iv) the alkyl complexes are significantly more effective than their amido analogues (compare entries 1 and 2, 11 and 13 or 23 and 26); (v) the complexes incorporating N(SiMe2H) -amide afford very little, if any, catalytic activity (entries 5 and 7); (vi) the bis-silanido complex 5-Sr (entry 6) is inactive whereas the pyrrolido compound 9-Sr does promote catalysis competently (entry 8), <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[31]</ref> two observations heavy of implications regarding the nature of the operative mechanism (vide infra); and (vii) even in the presence of 2 equiv of Ph3SiH per amine, the very mildly reactive tBuNH2 solely affords the monocoupled product tBuNHSiPh3 with 100% chemoselectivity with no detectable formation of the decoupled tBuN( <ref type="formula">SiPh3</ref>)2 (entries 20-26), hence highlighting the difficulty in making RN(SiPh3)2 disilazanes from primary amines with this procedure.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

It is reasonably easy to prepare on a multi-gram scale compared to its more intricate heteroleptic derivative 8-Ba. Its more robust THF-coordinated amido analogue 1-Ba, which is admittedly easier to synthesise, also exhibit impressive performances and therefore constitutes an excellent alternative. For these reasons, in terms of substrate scope, the focus will be on these two precatalysts in the followings.</p><p>That the complexes 3-Ba and 7-Ba bearing a tetramethyldisilazide moiety display very poor performance is disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. Similar observations were made before with the related calcium complex {LO}CaN(SiMe2H)2•(THF) complex [{LO} - aminoether-phenolato ligand) for the catalysis of intramolecular hydroamination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[27]</ref> It was then demonstrated that this complex reacted with 2,2-dimethylpent-4-en-1-amine ( H2NR) upon release of H2 through a process of self-catalysed dehydrocoupling to yield the catalytically inactive {LO}CaN(SiMe2H)(SiMe2NHR)x. One can assume that a similar process of deactivation is occurring in the present situation with 3-Ba and 7-Ba, especially because of the nature of the catalysed reaction under investigation here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reaction scope</head><p>The substrate scope of the catalysed reaction was evaluated using precatalysts 1-Ba and 4-Ba (the heteroleptic and less active 6-Ba was only used twice in specific cases for very reactive substrates) and a variety of silanes and amines. The results for this screening are summarised in Scheme 2 for reactions involving monoamines and mono(hydrosilane)s, while the coupling of di(hydrosilane)s with monoamines and that of diamines with mono(hydrosilane)s are collected in Schemes 3 and 4, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[32]</ref> The reactions were performed in C6D6</p><p>(identical outcomes were obtained for reactions carried out in C6D5Cl and in 5:1 mixtures of C6D6 and 1,2-C6H4F2, which present higher dielectric constants than C6D6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[33]</ref> and substrate conversion was monitored by 1 H NMR spectroscopy; all new products were characterised by standard analytical methods ( 1 H, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">13</ref> C and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">29</ref> Si NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry).</p><p>Generally speaking, the chemoselectivity and measured conversions were excellent and, in the case of potentially difunctional substrates, the course of the reaction and specific formation of a given product could be controlled by judicious choice of the precatalyst (the more active 4-Ba was used for more reluctant reactions and/or substrates) and experimental conditions (i.e.</p><p>temperature, reaction time, substrate loading).</p><p>Arylhydrosilanes, be it Ph3SiH, Ph2SiH2 or PhSiH3, react very quickly with pyrrolidine (Scheme 2). The dihydrosilane Ph2SiH2 selectively yields Ph2SiH(N(CH2)4) (I) or Ph2Si(N(CH2)4)2 (II) depending on the reactions conditions; the corresponding TON (up to 800 equiv of amine per metal) are otherwise unmatched. With 1-Ba as a precatalyst, PhSiH3 leads to the facile formation of PhSiH(N(CH2)4)2 (X) or even to the tricoupled PhSi(N(CH2)4)3 (XI), but the high reactivity of the PhSiH3/pyrrolidine pair of substrates precludes clean formation of the monocoupled product PhSiH2(N(CH2)4) (IX). The presence of an electron-withdrawing group in para position increases reaction rates, as seen with (p-CF3-C6H4)PhSi(N(CH2)4)2 (III) for which complete conversion is achieved within 1 h</p><p>(compare to the formation of I and II); this observation will be discussed in more detail in the kinetic and mechanistic analysis of this catalysed process (vide infra). Benzylamine is as good a substrate as pyrrolidine, with high chemoselectivity, turnover numbers and reaction rates being achieved at 298 K to afford (C6H5CH2NH)SiPh3 (VI) and (C6H5CH2NH)2SiPh2 (VII).</p><p>Such level of selectivity is remarkable, and the formation of the N-dicoupled product (C6H5CH2)N(SiPh3)2 was never observed. This suggests the limited ability of (SiR3)xNH3-x silazanes (x = 1, 2) to engage in CDC with hydrosilanes, a reckoning already made during the preliminary screening (vide supra) and further reinforced by the complete absence of formation of V in the attempted catalysed coupling of Ph3SiH and HN(SiMe3)2.</p><p>Scheme 2. Barium-catalysed cross-dehydrogenative coupling of mono(amine)s and mono(hydrosilane)s.</p><p>Reactions in C6D6, using precatalysts 1-Ba, 4-Ba or 6-Ba. For each product (I-XV) are indicated the The utilisation of diamines leads to the formation of valuable di(silazane)s (Scheme 4).</p><p>Starting from 1,2-ethylenediamine, the reaction can be oriented towards the formation of Ph3SiNHCH2CH2NH2 (XXII) or Ph3SiNHCH2CH2NHSiPh3 (XXIII) depending on the initial contents in Ph3SiH; in no case was further coupling to (Ph3Si)2NCH2CH2NHSiPh3 or even Bn(Ph3Si)NCH2-C6H4-CH2NHBn (XXX) but in poor yield (16%), even at 333 K with 4-Ba. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[34]</ref> Scheme 4. Barium-catalysed CDC of diamines and triphenylsilane. Reactions carried out in C6D6, using precatalysts 1-Ba or 4-Ba. For each product (XXII-XXXII) are indicated the [diamine]0/[silane]0/[precat]0 contents, reaction temperature and time, precatalyst, substrate conversion (related to the conversion of the initial di(amine)) and chemoselectivity between mono-, di-and tri-silazane products. Newly-formed bonds in red.</p><p>Overall, the barium precatalysts 1-Ba and 4-Ba display a remarkable combination of productivity, activity and chemoselectivity in N-H/H-Si CDC reactions, and give access to a wide panel of original mono-and disilazanes. Of particular interest, several of these products still possess N-H and/or Si-H reactive functional groups, rendering them useful synthetic intermediates which can be used for further functionalisation reactions. The performance displayed by 1-Ba and 4-Ba in the CDC of ditopic diamines and dihydrosilanes or di(hydrosilane)s suggests that they could make good precatalysts for dehydrogenative polymerisation to afford poly(carbosilazane)s, and indeed we have for instance been able to prepare low molecular weight polymers (Mn = 3-6.10 3 g mol -1 ) from N,N'dibenzylethylenediamine and Ph2SiH2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[32]</ref> Kinetic analysis Kinetic investigations were carried out to improve our understanding of these Ae-mediated N-H-/H-Si CDC reactions.

As far as the intrinsic reactivity is concerned, both the N-Si bond-forming nucleophilic attack of the Ba pyrrolide (G ‡ int = 4.5 kcal mol -1 relative to C3•S•A) and the hydrogen transfer (G ‡ int = 4.8 kcal mol -1 relative to C4•A) are seen to be feasible kinetically to an astonishingly comparable amount. In terms of observable catalytic performance, the nucleophilic attack is predicted to be kinetically affordable (G ‡ = 17.4 kcal mol -1 relative to C3•(A) 2 ) as is -H elimination (G ‡ = 19.0 kcal mol -1 relative to C3•(A) 2 ). It is the unfavourable thermodynamic profile of the nucleophilic attack, which favours C3•S•A somewhat over C4•A, that makes the second hydrogen transfer more demanding kinetically. As can be anticipated, the incoming pyrrolidine is likely to displace the silazane product P at C5•P•A readily. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[43]</ref> It</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">renders the stepwise C3•(A) 2 →C3•S•A→C4•A→C5•P•A→C5•(A) 2 silazane formation</formula><p>almost thermoneutral, with the second hydrogen transfer to barium dictating the overall kinetics of this process.</p><p>On the other hand, despite all our efforts, a low-energy TS structure describing Ba-N/Si-H -bond-breaking metathesis, which would represent the concerted silazane-generating analogue (see Scheme 5), could not be located. The careful examination of the metathetical transformation with the aid of a reaction-path-optimisation (chain-of-states) method using suitably guessed initial TS structures resulted in minimum-energy pathways describing either nucleophilic attack or hydrogen transfer (depending on the initial TS guess) as energetically prevalent alternatives. This let us conclude with some confidence that higher kinetic demands would be associated with the alternative concerted pathway and is thus unlikely to have any relevance for barium catalyst turnover. As to whether these findings hold true for more compact alkaline earths will be analysed below.</p><p>The subsequent protonolysis of pyrrolidine by the {N^N}Ba hydride converts C5 back into the catalytically competent {N^N}Ba pyrrolide for another catalyst turnover.

The turnover-limiting -H elimination accounts for the rate acceleration observed for a silane with an electron-withdrawing group in para position, the negative charge build up at silicon (given that a transient silicate intermediate featuring a hypervalent silicon centre is involved) as indicated by a Hammett analysis of substituted silanes and also for the substantial primary kinetic isotope effect. Moreover, the Hammett analysis, which is inconsistent with other examples of -bond metathesis processes that have not shown substantial charge accumulation in the TS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[46]</ref> provides further support for the operation of the pathway for stepwise silazane formation.

In contrast, an Ae silyl compound is seen to be incapable of effecting silazane formation and would thus make an initial conversion into an Ae amide indispensable for CDC catalysis to proceed.

The computations show that in the presence of a catalytically competent iminoanilide barium amide or barium alkyl complex, pathways which involve a barium silyl to mediate CDC catalysis or to furnish a disilane by-product are noncompetitive. This is fully consistent with the experimental data, as indeed the formation of these species was never detected spectroscopically during the monitoring of catalysed CDC reactions. Instead, complementary experimental and computational data provide conclusive evidence that the CDC of amines and organosilanes follows a stepwise reaction path consisting of (i) N-Si bond forming nucleophilic attack of the barium-pyrrolide onto the silane, followed (ii) by turnover-limiting -hydrogen transfer to the Ba centre. A related mechanism was proposed for the {To M }Mg(N(SiMe3)2) CDC precatalyst, where nucleophilic attack has been proposed to be rate determining. <ref type="bibr">[20a]</ref> That these Ae precatalysts are chemoselective and compatible with (dihydro)silanes, di(amine)s and di(hydrosilane)s opens up a range of synthetic possibilities. The synthesis of original poly(carbosilazane)s by coupling of di(amine)s and di(hydrosilane)s is an area where these Ae-mediated CDC processes can prove invaluable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[32]</ref> Moreover, starting from an initial monohydrosilane (e.g. Ph3SiH, Et3SiH), stoichiometric cascade couplings of di(amine)s (H2NCH2-C6H4-CH2NH2, piperazine etc.) or primary amines (e.g. BnNH2) with dihydrosilanes (e.g. Ph2SiH2) can yield unusual polysilazanes. Encoded and/or functionalised (macro)molecules can be prepared from judiciously selected bifunctional substrates such as arylsilanes with functional p-substituents. The Ae-promoted dehydrocoupling of amines with boranes and the coupling of silanes with phosphines are other natural extensions of this work.</p><p>Our efforts in these aims will be detailed in forthcoming reports.</p></div>

With 2-adamantylamine ( adam-NH2), no conversion to (adam-NH)SiPh3 (XII) was detected spectroscopically, while CDC of tetramethylpiperidine with Ph3SiH to yield VIII only reached 16% conversion after 1 h at 333 K. Aromatic amines exhibit lower reactivity than aliphatic ones, most presumably on account of their reduced nucleophilicity. Hence, 2,6-diisopropylaniline can be paired with Ph2SiH2 to give (2,6-iPr2-C6H3-NH)SiHPh2 (XIV) with good selectivity after prolonged reaction time at 333K, but the corresponding coupling with the bulkier Ph3SiH to generate XV failed entirely. The reactions with the less encumbered aniline proceed more smoothly. Starting from a 40:20 mixture of aniline and Ph2SiH2, clean formation of (C6H5N)SiHPh2 (XIII) is achieved at 298 K, while a 78:22 mixture of XIII and its dicoupled derivative (C6H5N)2SiPh2 is obtained at 333 K; clean synthesis of this last product could not be achieved under the chosen experimental conditions.The reactivity of di(hydrosilane)s follows that detailed for mono(hydrosilane)s, and gives access to original di(silazanes)s (Scheme 3). Hence, 1,2-bis(dimethylsilyl)ethane is rather unreactive. It undergoes CDC with pyrrolidine only after 12-15 h and preferably at 333 K to give mixtures of ((CH2)4N)(Me)2SiCH2CH2SiH(Me)2 (XVIII) and preponderantly its dicoupled analogue ((CH2)4N)(Me)2SiCH2CH2Si(Me)2(N(CH2)4) (XIX) with limited selectivity, even with precatalyst 4-Ba. Greater reactivity is seen for 1,4bis(diphenylsilyl)benzene, which under mild conditions couples twice with pyrrolidine</figDesc></figure>

From a same N,N'dimethylethylenediamine/Ph3SiH feed ratio of 20:40, precatalysts 1-Ba (at 298 K) and 4-Ba (at 333 K) yield respectively the monocoupled Ph3Si(Me)NCH2CH2NHMe (XXV) and Ph3Si(Me)NCH2CH2N(Me)SiPh3 (XXVI). Similarly, on adjusting the initial hydrosilane contents, the CDC of Ph3SiH with piperazine at 298 K catalysed by 1-Ba readily affords the mono-and the dicoupled products XXVIII or XXIX with high chemoselectivity. By pairing N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine with Ph3SiH, one gets access to Ph3Si(Bn)NCH2CH2NHBn(XXXI) and Ph3Si(Bn)NCH2CH2N(Bn)SiPh3 (XXXII), although the selectivity towards XXXI was only moderate (83%).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_18"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>in the Supporting Information). Both stepwise and concerted pathways are conceivable, but a stepwise pathway (shown dashed in Scheme 6), which bears formal similarity with the one shown in Figure 10, is found energetically prevalent. Alike to what has been discovered for all the steps studied thus far, one associated amine spectator molecule A greatly facilitates silane homocoupling. In light of their formal analogy, it is tempting to compare the inherent propensity of the {N^N}Ba silyl C6 and {N^N}Ba pyrrolide C3 to nucleophilically attack triphenylsilane S and to effect -H elimination from a five-coordinate silicon centre onto the alkaline earth. Considering intrinsic barriers as a valuable means, Si-Si bond formation via C6•S•A→C7•A is seen to be more demanding kinetically and also thermodynamically (G ‡ int/Gint = 13.8/9.9 kcal mol -1 relative to C6•S•A; Figure 15) when compared with C3•S•A→C4•A N-Si bond formation (G ‡ int/Gint = 4.5/1.3 kcal mol -1 relative to C3•S•A; Figure 10); this thereby reflects the enhanced nucleophilicity of the pyrrolide N centre together with some steric constraints associated with silane homocoupling. By contrast, -H elimination from the hypervalent silicon centre at transient silicate intermediates C7•A (G ‡ int = 5.4 kcal mol -1 relative to C7•A; Figure 15) and C4•A (G ‡ int = 4.8 kcal mol -1 relative to C4•A; Figure 10) is equally found highly facile. Despite its associated low intrinsic barrier, the fact that the nucleophilic attack of the {N^N}Ba silyl is strongly uphill renders the second hydrogen transfer step to determine the overall kinetics for the generation of Si2Ph6 and {N^N}Ba hydride C5. Figure 15 reveals a prohibitively large overall barrier (G ‡ = 36.2 kcal mol -1 relative to C3•(A) 2 ) for the rival silane homocoupling, which remains unachievable due to its non-competitive kinetic demands when compared with the most accessible stepwise pathway for silazane formation (Figures 10 and 11).</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and concluding remarks</head><p>Alkaline-earth metal complexes constitute excellent, chemoselective and versatile precatalysts for the production for a range of silazanes by cross-dehydrocoupling of amines and silanes.</p><p>The scope of the reaction is large, and also includes di(amine)s and di(hydrosilane)s.</p><p>Characteristically, the catalytic activity increases substantially upon going down in group 2, according to (Mg &lt;&lt;) Ca &lt; Sr &lt; Ba. This observation has been rationalised by DFT computations, showing that greater accessibility of the metal centre and, to a lesser extent, increasing Ae-Namide bond strength upon going to ever heavier alkaline earths, are behind this trend. However, these conclusions solely apply to the CDC catalysis presented herein, and should not be extended a priori to all Ae-mediated catalytic processes. The barium precatalysts Ba[CH(SiMe3)2]2•(THF)3 and Ba[N(SiMe3)2]2•(THF)2 display impressive a unique data set. The crystal structures were solved by direct methods, remaining atoms were located from difference Fourier synthesis followed by full-matrix least-squares refinement based on F2 (programs SIR97 and SHELXL-97). <ref type="bibr">[50]</ref> Carbon-and oxygen-bound hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions and forced to ride on the attached atom. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The locations of the largest peaks in the final difference Fourier map calculation as well as the magnitude of the residual electron densities were of no chemical significance. Relevant collection and refinement data are given in the Supporting information. Crystal data, details of data collection and structure refinement for 7-Ba (CCDC 1426816) are available from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational Methodology.</head><p>All calculations based on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[51]</ref> were performed by means of the program package TURBOMOLE <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref> employing flexible basis sets of triple- quality. The Becke-Perdew (BP86) <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref> generalised gradient approximation (GGA) functional within the RI-J integral approximation <ref type="bibr">[54]</ref> in conjunction with appropriate auxiliary basis sets was used for structure optimisation.</p><p>Empirical dispersion corrections by Grimme (D3 with Becke-Johnson damping) <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref> were used to account for non-covalent interactions. For alkaline-earth metals, we used the Stuttgart-Dresden scalar-relativistic effective core potential (SDD, 46 and 28 core electrons for Ba and Sr, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[56]</ref> in combination with the (7s7p5d1f)/[6s4p3d1f] (def2-TZVPP) valence basis set, <ref type="bibr">[57]</ref> whereas calcium was treated by the (17s12p4d)/[6s5p3d] (def2-TZVPP) allelectron basis set. <ref type="bibr">[57]</ref> All remaining elements were represented by Ahlrich's valence triple- TZVP basis set <ref type="bibr">[58a,b]</ref> with polarisation functions on all atoms.

As far as the vibrational partition function is concerned, all frequencies below 60 cm -1 were replaced by a value of 60 cm -1 to correct for the quantum-mechanical harmonic-oscillator approximation for such normal modes (the quasi-harmonic approximation), <ref type="bibr">[64]</ref> and thermochemical contributions to enthalpy and entropy were computed from the resulting partition function. The entropy contributions for condensed-phase conditions were estimated based on computed gas-phase entropies (without any scaling applied) by employing the procedure of Okuno. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[65]</ref> The mechanistic conclusions drawn in this study were based on the Gibbs free-energy profile of the catalytic cycle assessed at the B97-D3(COSMO-RS)/(SDD + def2-TZVP) level of approximation for experimental condensed phase conditions. Calculated structures were visualised by employing the StrukEd program, <ref type="bibr">[66]</ref> which was also used for the preparation of 3D molecule drawings.</p><p>Supporting Information: Structural characterisation of DFT optimised key species involved in the various examined pathways; crystallographic data (including CIF file) for 7-Ba; NMR and MS characterisation of all new silazanes; NMR for new complexes.</p><p>[66] For further details, see <ref type="url" target="http://www.struked.de">http://www.struked.de</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
