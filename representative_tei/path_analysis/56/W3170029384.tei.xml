<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is so broad and massive that it has completely changed the business's order. This change in business structure adapts to today's consumer behavior. The Hence, consumers reduce shopping offline and use more for online shopping. With Covid-19 transmission, consumers are reluctant to visit and get food that consumers prefer to take away or buy it using delivery services. In a study released Wednesday (8/4), Nielsen said that since adopting the stay-at-home appeal to prevent the spread of Covid-19, around 30% of consumers plan to shop online more frequently.</p><p>Nielsen's study also said that 80% of Indonesian consumers access information about Covid-19 through social media, followed by television news (77%), and online search engines (56%). These three mediums are the source of information most accessed by consumers to find out about the development of Covid-19.</p><p>As digital technology develops, many companies use social media as a sales promotion tool and disseminating this information is called digital marketing. The means of digital marketing are display marketing, web banner advertising, social media marketing, and email advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pawar, 2014)</ref>. Social</p><p>Media Marketing is one of the new and leading marketing efforts that aim to bring consumers as participants rather than observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Toor et al., 2017)</ref>. Marketing communications and advertising using social media have undergone a significant transformation over the last decade as new technologies make it more convenient for companies to contact customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hongcharu &amp; Eiamkanchanalai, 2009)</ref>. Social network marketing is part of Social Media Marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kim &amp; Ko, 2012)</ref>. Social networking functions through specific social media sites that allow users to create their profiles, share information, interact and communicate with other users on the same site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2012)</ref>. The social media that are currently developing are Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Marketers use Social Media Marketing as a marketing tool because social media is prevalent among individuals. Today's marketing communications present new challenges and opportunities for companies to generate purchases, as people rely more on social media when making purchasing decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hinz et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Toor et al., 2017)</ref> indicators to measure Social Media Marketing are (1) happy to use social media sites, (2) using social networking sites is fun, (3) the content of social media marketing is impressive, (4) it is easy to send opinions or comments on social networking sites.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Social Media Marketing</head><p>The development of social relations through communication in cyberspace is almost identical to the stages of social relations as it should be in the real world. Although there are some differences, the steps in social media are represented by several media systems that replace the role of verbal and nonverbal communication such as text, graphics, images, audio, and video. Nevertheless, there are no direct instructions relating to internet users such as facial expressions, gestures, voice intonation, appearance, or physicality from other users invited to communicate. It is challenging to interpret statements and responses from other users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Walther, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The development of social media has an impact on personal and organizational ways of communicating. The advent of Web 2.0 enabled people to build a business and social relationships and share knowledge. Marketing through social media usually important around creating content that grabs attention and encourages readers to share with their social networks. Social media is a platform that is easily accessible to anyone. Even today, someone regardless of the company's role and control can create their content that is interesting and seen by many <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zarrella, 2010)</ref>. Social media is media designed to facilitate interactive or two-way social interaction. Social media based on internet technology has changed the pattern of disseminating knowledge from one to many audiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Paramitha, 2011)</ref>. Social media can take many forms, including internet forums, message boards, weblogs, podcasts, pictures, and videos.</p><p>Social media marketing is a form of direct or indirect marketing used to build awareness, recognition, memory, and action for brands, businesses, products, people, or other parties. It is carried out using social Web tools, such as sharing blogging, microblogging, social networking, social bookmarking, and content <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gunelius, 2011)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gunelius (2011)</ref>, the most common goals of social media are (1) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Trust</head><p>Trust is a complex phenomenon, and multiple dimensions of trust operate at various levels of analysis in organizational settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McAllister, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McKnight et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ring &amp; van de Ven, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tsai &amp; Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. However, in its development, trust has been studied in various online contexts. The results show that trust lies in the level of ability, willingness, and integrity of others, which is related to the desire to give and receive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ridings et al., 2002)</ref> and improved performance in the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jarvenpaa et al., 1998)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chiu et al., 2006 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chow &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chan, 2008</ref> stated that trust is an individual's belief and expectations that community members can behave consistently by following the norms and principles that apply in the online community.</p><p>Social trust is one of the significant determinants of knowledge sharing in online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lin et al., 2009)</ref>. In an online community, trust between members is seen as a typical attitude towards other online community members. This concept reflects the relationship between members' depth and scope and can cause members to repeatedly visit the same community <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wu et al., 2010)</ref>. Online communities generally do not have special rules so that it requires all members to behave in general as expected in their social environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhang et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, trust is the most basic subjective alternative to establish a more friendly atmosphere of relationships in online communities.</p><p>The trust literature provides sufficient evidence that trusting relationships have led to a greater exchange of knowledge: when trust exists, people are more willing to provide useful knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Levin &amp; Cross, 2004)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Mayer et al., 1995, trust</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Online Knowledge Sharing Behavior</head><p>Online knowledge sharing behavior is unseparated from knowledge sharing activities. The presence of the internet through social media facilitates the speed of activities to share knowledge at any time.</p><p>Networks and social interactions are increasingly bonded to the sharing of knowledge. There are doubts among researchers about the role of online knowledge sharing behavior through social interactions using social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ma &amp; Chan, 2014)</ref> Referring to the four pillars of social media marketing proposed by Gunelius, 2011, sharing online content has two primary forms. First, sharing interesting and useful content found online during reading (first pillar). Using blog posts contains useful tips might help customers. Second, sharing the content created (second pillar). For example, the company was updating presentations through slide shares, videos on YouTube, and Flickr's images. This activity is still included in this activity, namely sharing content to publish online through social media tools, publishing a post on a blog, sharing via Twitter, and communicating through social networks.</p><p>Share is an essential measure of viral marketing success, especially on social networking sites and refers to the rate at which users exchange, distribute and receive content <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kietzmann et al., 2011)</ref>. In the form of social relationships, sharing behavior often involves exchanging content and knowledge between people. In some cases, sharing behavior is often associated with relationships between people <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Engeström, 2001)</ref>. Many terms have the same meaning as the online knowledge sharing behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Atherley, 2011)</ref> states that online knowledge sharing behavior is the same as engagement, which means a sharing activity in a group. In social media, engagement activities are shown only through all activities that occur in the online environment. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Siefert et al., 2009)</ref> said that engagement is about feelings and emotions. Emotional engagements are positively correlated with the amount of content uploaded, viewed, and comments given.</p><p>Several previous studies have examined the factors that influence the sharing viral messages and commercial emails <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(De Bruyn &amp; Lilien, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dobele et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Phelps et al., 2004)</ref>. These studies have identified several essential factors motivating someone to pass several written and commercial viral messages via email, namely, social advantages, self-enrichment, entertainment (amusement), and friends' attachment.</p><p>Based on the description, the hypotheses in this study are:</p><p>H1: Social media marketing will have a positive effect on online knowledge sharing behavior H2: Trust will have a positive effect on online knowledge sharing behavior H3: Online knowledge sharing behavior will have a positive effect on online shopping behavior </p></div>

It means that there is a positive influence on online knowledge sharing behavior on online shopping behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Based on the data analysis that has been done, it shows that social media marketing has a positive effect on online knowledge sharing behavior. It means that when social media marketing increases, online knowledge sharing behavior increases as well. Many marketers use sharing behavior such as sharing content, blogs, vlogs, and various posts on social media to market their business. Some customers may prefer marketing by online knowledge sharing behavior because it looks more real, natural and without exaggeration. Even some of us believe word of mouth more than advertisements.</p><p>When a consumer is exposed to or sees various information on social media, the consumer who is a group member or group will immediately share information with other members. This often occurs in a group or group whose members consist of housewives. Especially in the current pandemic season, all information on social media, especially those related to health products for individuals or families, will spread quickly among a group or group members.</p><p>According to Gunelius, 2011, online content sharing can be done in two ways. The first thing customers find while reading is a few helpful tips. Usually, it can be found on blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other social networking tools with basic writing. Marketer also could use visual content such as presentations on share slides, videos on YouTube, and images on Flickr. According to <ref type="bibr">Ghahtarani et al., 2020, his</ref> research results show that the social media dimension impacts knowledge sharing behavior. Besides, the study results indicate that interactions through social media and perceived benefits affect knowledge sharing behavior. Sophisticated social media has offered unique features by introducing new platforms where hundreds or even thousands of people worldwide can interact with each other and produce information or content online <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kwahk &amp; Park, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The influencer boom nowadays has a significant impact on marketing. Social media is used significantly in people's social activities. It has drastically changed users to contribute to public knowledge, share information and their experiences with friends, family and markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chang &amp; Chuang, 2011)</ref>. It is starting from an honest review of a product that gets a positive response from viewers. They believe that reviews could be more than advertisements that make marketers take advantage. Therefore, what initially obtained from one audience to many audiences can now be patterned <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Paramitha, 2011)</ref>. This is because the free interaction on social media makes the distribution of information very fast.</p><p>Furthermore, marketers are more likely to use influencers to persuade their audience, considering that they trust influencers more than advertisements.</p><p>Trust is an essential element for maintaining exchange relations between members in a group.</p><p>Members are more willing to interact and share or exchange knowledge if there is trust among themselves. In this case, trust is considered a belief in reliability and integrity among group members.</p><p>Based on the results of data analysis, it can be concluded that trust has a positive effect on online knowledge sharing behavior. It means that every trust has increased, the online knowledge sharing behavior will also increase. Social trust is one of the significant determinants of knowledge sharing in online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lin et al., 2009)</ref>. In the online knowledge sharing behavior, it is obligatory to have trust between them. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Levin &amp; Cross, 2004)</ref>, people are more willing to provide useful knowledge when there is belief. In the sharing information behavior, someone will receive information from those who are trusted and vice versa. Someone who is trusted in providing information will provide information that is useful for the audience's needs, from the trust that the audience places on influencers to make marketers see this as a marketing opportunity. The existence of trust makes the information provided by influencers readily accepted by the audience. For this reason, marketers use influencers to convey information about products to make it easier for the audience to arrive and understand.</p><p>Several previous studies have had mixed results on this research relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bakker et al., 2006)</ref> found a negative influence between trust and knowledge sharing in a group. Then, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Swift &amp; Hwang, 2013</ref> found positive but insignificant results in the impact of trust and knowledge sharing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ko, 2010</ref>) also found no positive influence between trust and knowledge sharing. Meanwhile, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Levin &amp; Cross, 2004)</ref>, the results of a positive impact between trust and knowledge sharing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rutten et al., 2016</ref> also state that there is a positive relationship between trust and knowledge sharing. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ghahtarani et al. (2020)</ref> clearly states that the relationship between trust and sharing behavior is rejected.</p><p>From the research results, it can be seen that online knowledge sharing behavior has a positive effect on online shopping behavior. It means that if online knowledge sharing behavior increases, it will encourage an increase in online shopping behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ghahtarani et al., 2020)</ref> knowledge sharing behavior has an impact on consumer shopping behavior. It is because sharing knowledge/information affects consumers' thinking, feelings and needs. Through social media platforms, users share their ideas and thoughts. Purchase intention or shopping behavior is a personal one that can be influenced through information and emotional processes. Sharing knowledge can impact purchase intentions because people can make wise decisions in making purchases with knowledge about products and services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION</head><p>In this study, the researcher proposes a research model integrating social media marketing, trust, information sharing and shopping behavior. Through empirical research, this study examines the effect of social media marketing and trust on information-sharing behavior and its impact on shopping behavior among, housewives who are members of an online group or group. Hypothesis testing results</p><p>show that: Hypothesis 1, which tests the effect of social media marketing on online knowledge sharing behavior, is fully supported. Hypothesis 2, which examines the impact of trust on online knowledge sharing behavior, is also fully supported. Hypothesis 3, which states that online knowledge sharing behavior affects online shopping behavior, is proven to be accepted.</p><p>The implications of this study are inseparable from several limitations or obstacles. First, the respondents of this study were limited to housewives and this occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic, so it cannot be generalized if this research is applied to normal conditions. Second, this study limits the use of specific measurement scales.

There are three research streams on trust: personality-based trust, institutionalbased trust, and cognition-based trust, which partly explain trust (McKnight et al., 1998). Each stream of research includes several factors: personality-based factors, institution-based factors and cognitionbased factors, which influence trust.</figDesc></figure>
