<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the well-established role of mutual-aid groups in addiction treatment, no research has yet explored the role of the 12-step pathway in spiritual growth and gratitude, or its direct and indirect relationships with well-being among individuals with compulsive sexual behavior disorders (CSBD). The purpose of the current study was to examine the number of 12 steps completed as an antecedent of spiritual growth and gratitude and its relationship with well-being among members of Sexaholics Anonymous (SA). The sample consisted of 80 individuals (72 men and 8 women) attending SA meetings in Poland. The study variables were measured using the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, Gratitude Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and a single question regarding the number of 12 steps completed. A path analysis showed that the number of 12 steps completed was negatively and directly related to negative affect. Moreover, the number of 12 steps completed was related to higher spiritual growth, which was directly related to higher levels of life satisfaction and lower levels of negative affect, and indirectly, through gratitude, to higher levels of life satisfaction and positive affect. The results suggest that spiritual growth, rooted in the 12-step program, and its ability to increase gratitude, may promote recovery from CSBD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction The 12-Step Program as an Antecedent of Spiritual Growth in Addictions</head><p>Although spirituality is a complex and broad construct, which makes it difficult to define, researchers have been trying to conceptualize it following the standards of scientific research and have reached some degree of consensus on the matter. Spirituality, as an inherent component of being human, is connected with the belief that there are aspects of human life that transcend physical reality and that there is more to life than what we see or fully understand <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Underwood &amp; Teresi, 2002)</ref>. A spiritual person seeks answers to fundamental questions about life and looks for meaning and purpose in their lives in connectedness with others, oneself, nature, and the sacred or transcendent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cook, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Spirituality might be considered within the context of a specific religion, it might be expressed as a profound and personal relationship with God / higher being, or it might have a more secular meaning for the ways in which it is associated with nature, arts, music, family, and community <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Puchalski &amp; Guenther, 2012)</ref>. Therefore, although for some people, spirituality overlaps with religion, for others, it has nothing in common with it. Conversely, religion may be deprived of spirituality when religious practices are done automatically or instrumentally without meaning and engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Worthington &amp; Aten, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we explored an aspect of spirituality-daily spiritual experiencesunderstood as an individual's experiences, awareness, and relationship with the divine or transcendent in daily life <ref type="bibr">(Underwood &amp; Tedeschi, 2002)</ref>. These are more secular expressions of spirituality not focused on beliefs or behaviors of a specific religious doctrine. Greater numbers of daily spiritual experiences may be understood to represent spiritual growth. Much previous research has shown that spirituality conceptualized in this way is associated with greater life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Skarupski et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rudaz et al., 2019)</ref> and positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ellison &amp; Fan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Van Cappellen et al., 2023)</ref>, and less negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brelsford et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Park &amp; Slattery, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The topic of spirituality and its effects on the recovery of individuals with addictions have been extensively explored, especially for those with alcohol dependence and their partners participating in mutual-aid groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dermatis &amp; Galanter, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Krentzman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wnuk, 2022b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wnuk, 2023)</ref>. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a non-professional, egalitarian, effective form of treatment for alcohol dependence, serving as a prototype for other mutual-aid groups focused on recovering from drugs, gambling, sex, and other types of addictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kelly et al., 2020)</ref>. AA philosophy considers alcoholism to be a progressive, chronic, incurable, and deadly disease rooted in spiritual decline and egocentrism, which can be overcome only through spiritual restoration and transformation as the result of following the 12-step program <ref type="bibr">(AA, 1953</ref><ref type="bibr">(AA, , 2001))</ref>. It also emphasizes the need to distinguish abstinence from sobriety, suggesting that abstinence by itself is not a sufficient factor for sobriety; sobriety is a broader concept understood as abstinence as well as leading a happy and satisfying life <ref type="bibr">(AA, 2001)</ref>. In previous studies, participation in mutual-aid groups for addictions correlated not only with longer abstinence <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Krentzman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Zemore, 2007)</ref> and reduced symptoms of addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Galanter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kaskutas et al., 2002)</ref> but 1 3 also with higher levels of subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gomes &amp; Hart, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schiff &amp; Bargal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wnuk, 2022a)</ref> and meaning in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Zemansky, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>As further support for the beneficial role of self-help groups in recovery from addictions, many studies have shown the positive effect of involvement in such groups on spiritual growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Galanter et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Krentzman et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Krentzman et al., , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Montes &amp; Tonigan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wnuk, 2022a)</ref>. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Zemore's (2007)</ref> longitudinal study, increases in 12-step involvement from baseline to follow-up predicted a higher probability of abstinence at follow-up, and increases in spirituality mediated this relationship. In another longitudinal study, spiritual growth, measured as gains in spiritual and religious practices, mediated the relationship between the frequency of AA attendance and the percentage of days abstinent <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Montes &amp; Tonigan, 2017)</ref>. Involvement in AA has been shown to be associated with increases in daily spiritual experiences, private religious practices, forgiveness of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Krentzman et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Krentzman et al., , 2017))</ref>, and with positive religious coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Krentzman et al., 2017)</ref>. The current study aims to investigate the role of the 12-step pathway in the spiritual growth, gratitude, and subjective well-being of individuals with compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD) who attend Sexaholics Anonymous (SA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of CSBD</head><p>Currently, there is no research regarding the role of spirituality and religiousness in the spiritual growth of patients with CSBD (also known as "sexual addiction," "sexual dependence," "hypersexuality," "problematic sexual behavior," or "sexual impulsivity"). Individuals with CSBD exhibit distress or significant impairment in various important areas of functioning for six months or more due to a persistent pattern of failure to control intense and recurrent sexual impulses, urges, and/or thoughts, resulting in repetitive sexual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kraus et al., 2018)</ref>. Behaviors such as masturbation, pornography use, cybersex, having multiple sexual partners and engaging in sexual fantasies are predominantly reported by patients with CSBD. Unsatisfying or unprotected sexual intercourse and having multiple sexual partners are most often indicated as problematic for this group <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Wéry et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Despite being categorized as an impulse control behavior in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), the psychiatric classification of CSBD is still debated since the CSBD shares many similarities with addictive behaviors, such as clinical symptoms, etiology, neurocognitive mechanisms, sociodemographic correlates, and therapeutic interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Efrati et al., 2021)</ref>. It is estimated that CSBD affects about 3-6% of adult population <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bőthe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Klein et al., 2014)</ref>, with men comprising around 80% of patients seeking treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kaplan &amp; Krueger, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The forms of treatment for CSBD include emotion-focused therapy, cognitivebehavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, or pharmacotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Efrati &amp; Gola, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Holas et al., 2021)</ref>. In Poland, mutual-aid groups are the leading form of treatment for patients with CSBD, and two 12-step recovery fellowships are active in the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Wnuk &amp; Charzyńska, 2022)</ref>: SA and Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA). These two groups are similar in their assumptions and the 12-step model of treatment. The main difference between them lies in the definition of sexual absti-nence, with SA being more restrictive than SLAA, counting only heterosexual sex with one's own spouse as acceptable sexual behavior constituting abstinence from sexual addiction.</p><p>Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between religiousness, spirituality, and CSBD. Research in this area has focused mostly on examining the role of religiousness in the course of CSBD, on exploring the function of moral incongruence in the relationship between religiousness and CSBD symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Grubbs et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Grubbs et al., , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jennings et al., 2021)</ref>, and on testing religiousness as a protective factor against internet pornography use <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baltazar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wright, 2013)</ref>. Studies on the relationship between spirituality and CSB are scarce, but those available have demonstrated the negative relationship between indicators of spiritual well-being and CSB and the positive relationship between CSB and aspects of spiritual struggles (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jennings et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gratitude and Addiction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spiritual Roots of Gratitude</head><p>Gratitude is a positive, pleasant emotion involving feelings of thankfulness related to appreciation for, or recognition of something positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Emmons &amp; Shelton, 2002)</ref>. Gratitude has three dimensions: state gratitude, which is a momentary feeling of thankfulness or appreciation; trait gratitude, which is an overall disposition toward noticing and appreciating life's positive aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Wood et al., 2010)</ref>; and gratitude practices, which are intentional behaviors designed to cultivate gratitude, such as writing a gratitude list <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Emmons &amp; Stern, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In many religious systems and spiritual paths, gratitude is treated as a desired value and virtue <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Carlisle &amp; Tsang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Emmons &amp; Kneezel, 2005)</ref>. In a religious context, human beings should be grateful to God as a source of all good <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Watkins et al., 2022)</ref>. A grateful attitude to God, who is perceived as a benefactor, is enhanced by a cultural reciprocity norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gouldner, 1960)</ref>. When a religious person feels the abundance of gifts received from God, their gratitude to God may magnify and amplify a grateful attitude toward other people by evoking the willingness to give back <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Nelson et al., 2023)</ref>. Moreover, spiritual experiences, which are often connected with a feeling of awe and beauty in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Büssing et al., 2014)</ref>, lead to the appreciation of life itself, other creatures, and material and immaterial gifts that a person receives from other people, nature, and the Universe <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Olson et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with the above theoretical premises, many studies have shown that religious and spiritual involvement is a source of gratitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Krause &amp; Hayward, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lambert et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Olson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Rosmarin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tsang et al., 2012)</ref>. For example, in a longitudinal study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hardy et al. (2014)</ref>, daily religious practices were positively associated with gratitude, forgiveness, and empathy through daily spiritual experiences. In four studies applying various methodologies, including longitudinal and experimental designs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lambert et al. (2009)</ref> noted the effectiveness of prayer for increasing gratitude. Using an experience sampling methodology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Olson et al. (2019)</ref> showed that prayer and meditation significantly contributed to an increase in gratitude during the three-week study period.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gratitude in 12-Step Programs</head><p>Mutual-aid groups, specifically, 12-step programs, provide a medium for learning about gratitude. The program's 10th step, which recommends a review of each day, suggests stopping to appreciate the daily "blessings received" (AA World <ref type="bibr">Services, 1953, p. 95)</ref>. A frequent recommendation in 12-step communities is to "make a gratitude list," especially when feeling negative emotions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Krentzman (2019)</ref> conducted a grounded theory study of the theme of gratitude in the writings of Alcoholics Anonymous' co-founder, Bill Wilson, and found that, when addressing gratitude in his writings, Wilson described the AA program and recovery as gifts that come not from one's own self, but from benefactors. The benefactors described in Wilson's writings are God, or one's higher power, and individuals who support a person's recovery including other AA members, medical professionals, clergy, and family members. Gifts from these benefactors inspire the AA member to reciprocate, to give back in a spirit of gratitude for what they have received, by seeking and doing their higher power's will and by carrying the message of recovery to others. In this way, in Wilson's writings, spirituality and gratitude are closely aligned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How Gratitude Supports Well-Being During Addiction Recovery</head><p>The theory of the maintenance of behavior change shows how gratitude can increase satisfaction with life in recovery and thereby support abstinence. This theory states that the maintenance of behavior change engages different psychological processes than the initiation of behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Rothman et al., 2016)</ref>. For the maintenance of behavior change, a person, whether they realize it or not, compares life now, after having made the change, to life before making the change. The person makes this comparison regularly and must repeatedly determine that "now" is better than "then" to continue the hard work of maintaining the change. A gratitude practice can amplify what is going right in recovery now, thereby increasing satisfaction with life in recovery, so that any comparison to active addiction results in the determination that now is better than then.</p><p>Gratitude can also enhance satisfaction with life in recovery in the ways that it enhances interpersonal relationships. Some scholars have stated that gratitude occurs when a person has benefited from the actions of another person or entity. Having received a gift, an individual is inspired to reciprocate <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Emmons &amp; Crumpler, 2000)</ref> and do something good for the benefactor or another person <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bartlett &amp; DeSteno, 2006)</ref>. This interpersonal reciprocity has led some scholars to conclude that gratitude is essential to everyday relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Algoe, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartlett &amp; DeSteno, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, a gratitude practice can improve interpersonal relationships, which are essential to satisfaction with life in recovery.</p><p>Gratitude can improve mood through physiological and psychological pathways. Scientists have found that changes take place in the brain as the result of active addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koob, 2008)</ref>. These changes persist into early recovery and make it harder for the individual to feel positive emotions and easier for them to experience stress. Therefore, in early recovery, a gratitude practice could help train the brain to feel positive emotions in response to everyday pleasures in the absence of addictive behavior.</p><p>Two psychological principles describe the human propensity toward negativity, which can worsen mood during recovery from addiction. The negativity bias explains the ways in which negative thoughts, emotions, and experiences have a greater impact on us than positive or neutral experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baumeister et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rozin &amp; Royzman, 2001)</ref>. This tendency is thought to have an evolutionary purpose, to aid survival; but in current times, it can result in a preponderance of negative focus, upsetting emotions, and fear. A gratitude practice can help a person in recovery give greater attention to what is going well in order to balance the negativity bias with positive thoughts and emotions.</p><p>The concept of the hedonic treadmill can also be applied to the role of gratitude in addiction recovery. The hedonic treadmill describes that each person has a set level of positive or negative mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Diener et al., 2006)</ref>. When good or bad things happen, in general, a person experiences a rise or fall in their average mood state. The person ultimately adapts to the new circumstance with a return to their baseline level of mood. This explains why improvements in short-term happiness are not lasting; individuals become accustomed to them. Gratitude can play a role here for the person in recovery -it can reawaken the original good feelings an individual experienced when a good circumstance was new, fostering a positive mood.</p><p>Gratitude's ability to improve mood via physiological and psychological pathways supports recovery from addiction in the ways that it counters negative emotions. Gratitude has been shown to be associated with less stress (LaBelle &amp; Edelstein, 2018) and less psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Krieger et al., 2023)</ref> among members of 12-step programs. Further, negative emotion in recovery has been found to be a significant trigger for relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Sliedrecht et al., 2019)</ref> including individuals with CSBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Wordecha et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Some authors have emphasized emotional dysregulation in individuals with CSBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Lew-Starowicz et al., 2020)</ref>. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wordecha et al. (2018)</ref> suggests that binge pornography use and masturbation are ways to regulate mood and stress and can be treated as a short-term mechanism of coping with negative emotions, which in turn lead to cumulative negative emotions, such as shame, loneliness, disgust, guilt, anger, sadness, or anxiety. Developing gratitude during SA meetings may help SA members to self-regulate emotionally without resorting to sexual acting out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>In the current study, we examine the direct and indirect relationships between the number of 12 steps completed, spiritual growth, gratitude, and subjective well-being among SA members. Based on the theoretical and empirical background, we expect that:</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1): In a sample of SA members, the number of 12 steps completed is positively related to life satisfaction and positive affect and negatively related to negative affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">3</head><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2): In a sample of SA members, the number of 12 steps completed is positively related to spiritual growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 3 (H3):</head><p>In a sample of SA members, the number of 12 steps completed is directly and positively related to gratitude, and this effect is partially mediated by spiritual growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 4 (H4):</head><p>In a sample of SA members, gratitude is positively related to life satisfaction and positive affect and negatively related to negative affect.</p><p>Furthermore, taking all of the above direct and indirect relationships together, we formulate the following hypothesis concerning the 12-step pathway of recovery:</p><p>Hypothesis 5 (H5): In a sample of SA members, the number of 12 steps completed is positively related to spiritual growth, which indirectly, through gratitude, predicts greater satisfaction with life, higher levels of positive affect, and lower levels of negative affect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spiritual Growth</head><p>Spiritual growth was measured with the short version of the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale (DSES; <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Underwood and Teresi, 2002)</ref>, which consists of 6 out of the original 16 items of this tool (example item: "I am spiritually touched by the beauty of creation."). The short version of the DSES has been successfully used in several studies with Polish samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Charzyńska et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wnuk, 2023)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Charzyńska et al. (2021)</ref> found the unidimensionality of the short version of the DSES in a Polish sample of young adults. In the current study, 6 items of the DSES explained 60.1% of the variance in spiritual growth. Each item of the DSES is assessed with a six-point Likert scale (1 = "many times a day," 2 = "every day," 3 = "most days," 4 = "some days," 5 = "once in a while," and 6 = "never or almost never"). The total level of daily spiritual experiences is calculated by summing up the responses, which need to be reverse-scored before. Higher scores reflect a higher frequency of daily spiritual experiences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Underwood, 2011)</ref>, which can be interpreted as a marker of spiritual growth.  <ref type="bibr">-6;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">McCullough et al., 2002)</ref>. The GQ-6 consists of 6 items (e.g., "I am grateful to a wide variety of people."), rated on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = "strongly disagree" to 7 = "strongly agree"). The scale is homogenous, measuring a single factor called "gratitude." Two items are reversescored before calculating the total score. The level of gratitude is obtained by summing up all the items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Well-Being</head><p>We assessed the overall concept of well-being by its two primary component parts: satisfaction with life and affect as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfaction with Life</head><p>The Polish version <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jankowski, 2015)</ref> of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Diener et al., 1985)</ref> was used to measure life satisfaction, defined as a cognitive component of well-being. This measure has a unidimensional structure and consists of five items (e.g., "In most ways my life is close to my ideal."), which are assessed using a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = "strongly disagree" to 7 = "strongly agree"). Higher scores indicate higher levels of life satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of the step Content 1</head><p>We admitted that we were powerless over lust-that our lives had become unmanageable. 2</p><p>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3</p><p>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. 4</p><p>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5</p><p>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6</p><p>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. 7</p><p>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 8</p><p>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. 9</p><p>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 10</p><p>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11</p><p>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out. 12</p><p>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to sexaholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. Positive and Negative Affect Affect was measured with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Crawford and Henry, 2004</ref>). In the current study, the short version of the PANAS was used by selecting the five strongest loading items for positive affect (e.g., enthusiasm) and negative affect (e.g., fear) out of the 20-item version of this tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wnuk &amp; Marcinkowski, 2014)</ref>. In the current study, the two-factor structure of the PANAS was supported by the results of the principal component analysis, which extracted two components, explaining 34.33% (negative affect) and 31.49% (positive affect) of the variance of the affectivity construct. The PANAS items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 = "a little or none" to 5 = "very frequently").</p><p>Higher scores indicate experiencing positive/negative affect more frequently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study was conducted between February 2020 and January 2021 in Poland. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was accepted by the Ethics Committee at the University of Silesia in Katowice (KEUS 123/05.2021). To collect a sample, the research team member sent an email to several members of SA in Poland that they were familiar with, requesting them to disseminate the information about the study along with the survey link to other SA members. The inclusion criteria involved being at least 18 years old and attending SA meetings in Poland. The online survey was preceded by information about the research purpose, anonymous and voluntary participation in the study, the approximate duration of the survey, and the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences. All participants gave their online consent before completing the survey. No incentives were offered to participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>Before testing the sequential mediation model, we assessed common method bias using Harman's one-factor test. The total variance extracted by one factor exceeding 50% indicates a serious common method deviation. In addition, we calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF) for the predictors to examine whether there were not too high correlations between predictors. Values of VIF higher than 5 suggest that multicollinearity occurs in data <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(James et al., 2017)</ref>. Next, we tested the assumption of multivariate normality by calculating Mardia's (1970) coefficient of multivariate kurtosis and its critical ratio. The value of a critical ratio lower than 5 suggests that the data can be deemed normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bentler, 2005)</ref>. In the last step of preliminary analysis, we calculated descriptive statistics, reliability coefficients, and zero-order correlations between the study variables.</p><p>The mediation model was tested using a path analysis based on the maximum likelihood estimation of structural equation modeling (SEM). Model fit was assessed using several fit indices: the model χ 2 , the minimum discrepancy/degrees of freedom (χ 2 /df), the comparative fit index (CFI), goodness-of-fit index (GFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), normed fit index (NFI), incremental fit index (IFI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized RMR (SRMR). P-value for χ 2 &gt; 0.05, χ 2 /df &lt; 3, CFI, GFI, TLI, NFI, and IFI ≥ 0.95, and RMSEA and SRMR &lt; 0.08 suggest a good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hair et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kline, 2005)</ref>. In addition, we used the Bollen-Stine bootstrapping procedure to calculate a bootstrap-adjusted p-value of an empirical SEM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bollen &amp; Stine, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>To test the significance of the indirect effects in the mediation model, we used the bootstrapping method, which is widely acknowledged as the best available option to test the indirect effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004)</ref>. We used 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on 5,000 bootstrap replications. If a coefficient does not include 0 in its 95% confidence interval, it can be deemed statistically significant. The effect size for indirect relationships was calculated as a completely standardized indirect effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Preacher &amp; Kelley, 2011)</ref>. The model was controlled for age, considering previous findings supporting the predictive role of this variable in subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baird et al., 2010)</ref>, gratitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chopik et al., 2019)</ref>, and spirituality <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Zimmer et al., 2016)</ref>. We used the criterion of p &lt; .2 for the inclusion of covariates, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Maldonado and Greenland (1993)</ref>. All calculations were performed using AMOS version 27.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arbuckle, 2020)</ref> and IBM SPSS version 27.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(IBM Corp., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Analysis</head><p>The value of Harman's single factor test (29.45%) suggested that the problem of common method bias did not occur in our data. There were no predictors with the values of VIF exceeding 5 (maximum VIF, noted for spiritual growth, was 1.56); thus, the multicollinearity problem was not likely to exist for our data. The value of the critical ratio was -0.46, which indicates that the assumption of multivariate normality was met.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the descriptive statistics, reliability of the measures, and correlations between the variables. On average, SA members completed 7 of the 12 steps (M = 6.99, SD = 4.17). The number of 12 steps completed correlated positively with spiritual growth (r = .24; p = .036), life satisfaction (r = .28; p = .012), and inversely with negative affect (r = -.38; p &lt; .001). Spiritual growth was positively related to gratitude (r = .54; p &lt; .001), life satisfaction (r = .45; p &lt; .001), and positive affect (r = .35; p = .002), and inversely to negative affect (r = -.32; p = .003). Life satisfaction was positively related to positive affect (r = .56; p &lt; .001). Reliability measured with McDonald's omega was satisfactory for all measurement tools (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Analysis</head><p>The values of model fit criteria indicated that the model has a good fit to data: χ 2 (5) = 5.27; p = .38; CMIN/df = 1.05; CFI = 0.997; GFI = 0.982; TLI = 0.989; NFI = 0.957; IFI = 0.998, RMSEA = 0.026 (90% CI [0.000, 0.160]), and SRMR = 0.038. Although the upper CI for the RMSEA exceeded the recommended value of 0.08, this is a common issue in models with low degrees of freedom and small sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kenny et al., 2015)</ref>. The good model fit was further supported by the insignificant bootstrap-adjusted p-value (0.43).</p><p>The standardized coefficients for the path model are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As for direct effects, the number of 12 steps completed was positively related to spiritual growth (β = 0.24; 95% CI [0.010, 0.466]; p = .036) and inversely to negative affect (β = -0.32; 95% CI [-0.528, -0.097]; p = .004), but not to gratitude (β = 0.07; 95% CI [-0.153, 0.253]; p = .561), life satisfaction (β = 0.18; 95% CI [-0.007, 0.372]; p = .061), or positive affect (β = 0.11; 95% CI [-0.086, 0.301]; p = .273). Spiritual growth correlated positively with gratitude (β = 0.52; 95% CI [0.319, 0.723]; p &lt; .001) and life satisfaction (β = 0.27; 95% CI [0.047, 0.485]; p = .015) and inversely with negative affect (β = -0.28; 95% CI [-0.510, -0.058]; p = .014). The relationship between spiritual growth and positive affect (β = 0.14; 95% CI [-0.131, 0.363]; p = .301) was insignificant. Gratitude was positively related to life satisfaction (β = 0.25; 95% CI [0.047, 0.416]; p = .016) and positive affect (β = 0.33; 95% CI [0.058, 0.568]; p = .024) but not to negative affect (β = 0.06; 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.192, 0.330]</ref>; p = .661).</p><p>All indirect effects with 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The number of 12 steps completed was indirectly related to gratitude through spiritual growth (β = 0.12; 95% CI [0.016, 0.287]; p = .023). Moreover, the significant indirect effects through spiritual growth were noted for the relationships between the number of 12 steps completed and life satisfaction (β = 0.06; 95% CI [0.007, 0.176]; p = .023) and between the number of 12 steps completed and negative affect (β = -0.07; 95% CI [-0.202, -0.008]; p = .020).</p><p>In the last step, we tested the chains of relationships between the number of 12 steps completed as an antecedent of spiritual growth, gratitude, and well-being indicators.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The 12-Step Pathway to Well-Being</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the number of 12 steps completed and well-being and to test the role of spiritual growth and gratitude in these relationships. Partially consistent with H1, the number of 12 steps completed was inversely related to negative affect but was not related to either life satisfaction or to positive affect. This result may suggest that the 12-step program directly helps the SA members decrease the intensity of negative feelings. The explanation of this result may lie in the content of the 12-step program for addictions, in which the need to let go of resentment, bitterness and grudges for recovery is emphasized <ref type="bibr">(AA, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">SA, 1989)</ref>. In accordance with H2, the number of steps completed was positively related to spiritual growth, suggesting that with the completion of steps, SA members start to experience spirituality in everyday situations.</p><p>Although the number of 12 steps completed was not directly related to gratitude, it was indirectly related to this moral virtue through spiritual growth (H3 partially supported). This result supports the findings of previous studies, which noted the beneficial role of spirituality in increasing gratitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hardy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Krause &amp; Hayward, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Olson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Rosmarin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tsang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lambert et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Gratitude correlated positively with positive affect and life satisfaction but was not related to negative affect (H4 partially supported). This result is consistent with previous research, in which gratitude has been noted to be positively related to positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Sun &amp; Kong, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wood et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Wood et al., , 2010))</ref>. Our finding corroborates with the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, which views gratitude as broadening thought repertoires and building a variety of personal and social resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fredrickson &amp; Joiner, 2018)</ref>. Gratitude may also promote life satisfaction by deepening relationships, providing social support, improving optimism and self-efficacy, and helping individuals to cope with adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Grant &amp; Gino, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Puente-Díaz &amp; Cavazos-Arroyo, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Robustelli &amp; Whisman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wood et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Wood et al., , 2010))</ref>. Our findings show that gratitude provides benefits to SA members-benefits that support their recovery.</p><p>The lack of a significant relationship between gratitude and negative affect is not surprising given the fact that previous research on this topic is inconclusive; some studies noted an inverse relationship between gratitude and negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Froh et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">McCullough et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wood et al., 2008)</ref>, whereas others demonstrated that these two variables are not significantly related to each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Datu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Froh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Grant &amp; Gino, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Puente-Díaz &amp; Cavazos-Arroyo, 2019)</ref>. In the context of SA, many individuals with CSBD may suffer from serious trauma and have a history of parental neglect or abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Slavin et al., 2020)</ref>, which may be connected with high levels of grudges and revenge in this population. The relationship between gratitude and negative affect in individuals with CSBD may be thus moderated by the levels of forgiveness of others. Specifically, gratitude can be related to lower negative affect, but only if the person forgives their perpetrators. Otherwise, the disposition to gratitude may be insufficient to alleviate the negative emotions that SA members combat. Some individuals with CSBD may involve in upward counterfactual thinking (e.g., How much my life could have been better if I had not been harmed by others?), which can increase negative emotions connected with holding grudges against perpetrators, in this way blocking the potential of gratitude for reducing negative emotions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bernabe-Valero et al., 2021)</ref>. This topic needs further investigation, as it may be a fruitful avenue of exploration of the interactions between gratitude and forgiveness.</p><p>The results of testing H5 showed the significant effects of the number of 12 steps completed on life satisfaction and positive affect (but not on negative affect) through the paths of spiritual growth and gratitude, respectively (H5 partially supported). Involvement in a 12-step program can be considered a meaning-making system <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wnuk, 2021)</ref> consisting of a cognitive-emotional-behavioral framework that determines one's perception, interpretation, and behaviors, and creates a ground for spiritual growth. As a result of this meaning-making system, the appreciation of the gift of recovery, which is perceived as coming from a higher power and other members of mutual-aid groups, appears <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Krentzman, 2019)</ref>. Gratitude, in turn, encourages each SA member to carry the message of recovery to other SA members and to serve as a sponsor to repay their higher power and other SA members for all intangible goods and support they receive during the recovery process. Involvement in this process of feeling grateful and then being inspired by gratitude to serve others may foster a feeling of usefulness and good self-esteem; it may strengthen interpersonal bonds and help people in SA stay abstinent and have a happy and good life in recovery.</p><p>The results of the study also suggest that for improving life satisfaction and increasing and sustaining positive emotions, nurturing the moral virtue of gratitude of individuals with CSBD is recommended. Indeed, in the current study, gratitude directly predicted life satisfaction, positive affect but not negative affect. By contrast, the number of 12 steps completed was directly and negatively related to negative affect, but it was only indirectly (i.e., through spiritual growth and gratitude) related to positive well-being indicators (i.e., life satisfaction and positive affect). These findings corroborate with those of positive psychology when it postulates that the lack of pathology is not the same as well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jans-Beken et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Keyes, 2005)</ref>: the mechanisms leading to reducing harmful behaviors like CSB, or diminishing negative affect that may trigger CSB, differ from the mechanisms underlying positive and desirable states.</p><p>From the practical point of view, since benefits were found for practicing the 12 steps, individuals with CSBD using other forms of treatment, such as pharmaco-therapy or psychotherapy, should be encouraged to attend SA meetings as a supplementary form of support, which can help them live a more satisfying and happy life. Therapists should consider incorporating parts of the 12-step program, such as spirituality and gratitude, into the psychotherapeutic programs and interventions to support sexual abstinence and prevent relapse. Moreover, more information about SA as an effective support method for CSBD patients should be distributed among patients, regardless of their religious beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The study has some limitations that should be discussed. First, due to the crosssectional character of the data, no unambiguous conclusions about the directionality of the relationships can be drawn from the study. Longitudinal studies monitoring the cascading effects of involvement in SA and other mutual-aid groups for CSBD on spiritual growth, gratitude, and their relationships with subjective well-being are highly recommended. Nevertheless, the model was based on well-grounded empirical and theoretical premises, mostly from the fields of psychology of religion and spirituality and positive psychology.</p><p>Second, due to the snowball method, we could not calculate the response rate, which limits the generalizability of the results. However, reaching out to SA members in other ways would have been difficult, especially due to the large dispersion of SA groups across the country and the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, most of our respondents were men with a higher education level. Studies in other mutual-aid groups for CSBD with more sociodemographically diversified samples are needed.</p><p>Third, the exogenous variable in our model (i.e., the number of 12 steps completed) was measured only with a single item, which may have limited the variability of responses to some degree. The number of 12 steps completed as an indicator of the advancement in the SA program has been used in previous research, e.g., in a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Efrati and Gola (2018)</ref>, and we considered it adequate for the purpose of the current study. Nevertheless, future studies may benefit from using more complex measures of SA involvement.</p><p>Moreover, the content of one of the six items in the short version of the DSES ("I feel deep inner peace or harmony") suggests that this measure is confounded by mental health indicators, which may have influenced the relationship between spiritual growth and well-being to some degree. Therefore, future studies exploring this relationship should consider using more pure measures of spiritual growth or the full version of the DSES.</p><p>Finally, our study was conducted in a highly religious context since more than 85% of respondents declared themselves to be religious, mostly Roman Catholic. Given that one of the roots of spiritual growth is religiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Puchalski &amp; Guenther, 2012)</ref>, a high number of religious individuals could have affected the results to some degree because being religious in a highly religious country is more beneficial for the individual than being religious in a more secular country <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Stavrova et al., 2013)</ref>. This shortcoming can be addressed by conducting cross-cultural studies involving more secular cultures and countries in which other religious denominations than Roman Catholicism are more common.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This is the first study to examine the 12-step pathway to spiritual growth and gratitude and its relationships with subjective indicators of recovery in individuals attending SA meetings. Our study showed the direct relationship between the number of 12 steps completed and negative affect and the indirect relationships between the number of 12 steps completed, greater levels of spiritual growth and gratitude, and better well-being indicators. These findings support the beneficial role of the 12-step pathway through spiritual growth and gratitude in recovery from CSBD.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Results for path analysis: Sequential mediation model with standardized coefficients.
