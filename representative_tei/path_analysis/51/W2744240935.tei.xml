<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The problem of heterogeneity represents a very important issue in the decision-making process. Furthermore, it has become common practice in the context of marketing research to assume that different population parameters are possible depending on socio-demographic and psychodemographic variables such as age, gender and social-status. In recent decades, numerous approaches have been proposed with the aim of involving heterogeneity in the parameter estimation procedures. In partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM), the common practice consists of achieving a global measurement of the differences arising from heterogeneity. This leaves the analyst with the important task of detecting, a posteriori, which are the causal relationships (i.e., path coefficients) that produce changes in the model. This is the case in Pathmox analysis, which solves the heterogeneity problem by building a binary tree to detect those segments of population that cause the heterogeneity. In this article, we propose extending the same Pathmox methodology in order to asses which particular endogenous equation of the structural model and which path coefficients are responsible of the difference.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>It is a known fact that consumer needs evolve very quickly and that good marketing strategies are closely linked with providers' capacity "to tailor" a "custom-made suit" for their own clients. This modern point of view has given heterogeneity analysis top priority in the field of research. Not surprisingly, many techniques in the context of partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) have been proposed with the principal aim of involving heterogeneity in parameter estimation procedures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>).</p><p>In general, the principal approaches focus on identifying the significant presence of any heterogeneity, leaving the analyst with the task of researching the causal relationship that produces the changes in the model. This task can be difficult, depending on the complexity of the model. From this perspective, it is fundamental to detect differences among segments of customers while, at the same time, to identify the reasons behind such differences <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p><p>The Pathmox algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> detects significant partitions in the presence of heterogeneity. However, it does not provide any information about the endogenous equations and the path coefficients that cause differences between two subgroups.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to present two tests that overcome this limitation: the F-block test and the F-coefficient test.</p><p>In Sections 2 and 3, we provide a literary review of the principal techniques and a brief description of the Pathmox algorithm. In Section 4, we present an application to illustrate and justify the proposed extensions. In Section 5, we discuss our contribution: the F-block test and the F-coefficient test. In Section 6, we show a simulation study with artificial data in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the tests. In Section 7, we present the results from applying the two tests in the Pathmox analysis. The paper closes with conclusions on the suitability of the proposed approach (Sections 8 and 9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Literary review</head><p>To the extent of our knowledge, the techniques that identify significant coefficients responsible for differences arising from the presence of heterogeneity, are related to PLS-based multi-group analysis (MGA). In MGA, a population parameter, b, is hypothesized to differ for two subpopulations: b 1 = b 2 . This focus consider heterogeneity (i.e., two sub-models are estimated by considering segmentation variables) by testing differences in the PLS-PM path coefficients of the two models.</p><p>The primary approach for group comparisons is a t-test, as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This test is used in the resampling parametric approach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The procedure consists of separating the data into groups (i.e., segments) and running bootstrap resamplings for each group. Path coefficients are calculated in each resampling, and the standard error estimates are treated in a parametric sense via t-test. As stated by the author, this approach works reasonably well if the two samples are not too non-normal and/or the two variances are not too different from one another; the principal limitation is bound to the use of a parametric test in a PLS-PM context, where no distributional assumptions are made.</p><p>In 2003, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed the resampling non-parametric approach as an alternative for overcoming the problem of the parametric assumption of the t-test. This approach seeks to scale the observed differences between groups by comparing these differences to those that exist between groups that have been randomly assembled from the data. The procedure starts by calculating PLS-PM models separately for each group (population parameters); it then permutes the data and, for each obtained group, it fits the parameter estimates (permutation parameter). Finally, it computes the differences in the permutation parameter estimates and tests the null hypothesis that the population parameters are equal across the two groups.</p><p>A more recent proposal was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This approach is based on bootstrapping, and it consists of obtaining the empirical cumulative distribution of the parameters under consideration. First, the subsamples to be compared are exposed to separate bootstrap analyses, and the bootstrap outcomes serve as a basis for the hypothesis tests of group differences. Instead of relying on distributional assumptions, the new approach estimates the probability that one path coefficient exceeds the other. However, as remarked by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, this approach only tests the one-sided hypotheses.</p><p>As an answer to the deficiencies of prior methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed the confidence set approach, which builds conceptually on <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>'s parametric test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>'s approach is a modified version of the two independent samples t-test, which accounts for the fact that the standard deviation is obtained through bootstrapping. In accordance with this test, researchers can directly compare the groupspecific bootstrap confidence intervals, regardless of whether the data are normally distributed or not. If the parameter estimates fall within the corresponding confidence interval, it can be assumed that there are no significant differences between the group-specific path coefficients.</p><p>A comparison of these approaches is made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As he points out, the resampling parametric approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is the most liberal of the procedures, as it generally yields higher t-values when compared to the permutation test of the resampling non-parametric approach ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). By not relying on distributional assumptions, the resampling non-parametric approach overcomes a key disadvantage of the resampling parametric approach and thus, fits with the characteristics of the PLS path modeling method. However, the permutation-based approach requires group-specific sample sizes to be fairly similar, which is a considerable limitation. The procedures of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> appear to be very conservative, as they indicate fewer significant differences vis-à-vis alternative multi-group comparison tests.</p><p>Without entering into the debate about what is the best technique and which differences are the most significant, we can consider more generally the way in which these authors analyze heterogeneity. In our opinion, the multi-group approach represents a good option when we know the effect we wish to prove is significant. In practice, this implies that the number of groups is known a priori and there is a limited number of segmentation variables: two or a maximum of three. It is also a viable option when there is previous knowledge regarding which available factors produce significant differences in the analysis results. However, very often there are more than two segmentation variables, and we do not have previous knowledge about the factors defining the heterogeneity.</p><p>In such situations, fitting for each cross-level of the segmentation variables in a different model will make it rather difficult for the analyst to find the significant partitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Pathmox approach</head><p>The Pathmox approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> represents a viable alternative for working with survey data for which there are numerous segmentation variables and there is no previous knowledge about the factors. This algorithm is proposed with the aim of developing a new segmentation approach for observed heterogeneity in PLS-PM. This technique adapts the principles of the binary segmentation process by producing a segmentation tree with different path models in each of the obtained nodes. The goal of Pathmox is not prediction but rather identification; i.e., its purpose is to detect different path models present in the data. Thus, Pathmox identifies the set of splits (based on the segmentation variables) with superior discriminating capacity, in the sense that it separates PLS-PM models as much as possible. Here, we have adapted a split criterion based on Fisher's F for testing the equality of regression models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). This allows us to decide whether two structural models calibrated from two different segments (successors of a node) can be considered as different. We call this the F-global test. To identify the existence of different path models, the technique performs a procedure that can be summarized in the following algorithm:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Algorithm 1 Pathmox Algorithm</formula><p>Step 1. Start with the global PLS path model at the root node Step 2. Establish a set of admissible partitions for each segmentation variable in each node of the tree Step 3. Detect the best partition by: 3.1. Forming all binary partitions in all segmentation variables 3.2. Applying the F-test, calculating a p-value for each partition 3.3. Sorting the p-values in descending order 3.4. Choosing, as the best partition ,the one associated with the lowest p-value The algorithm starts by estimating the global PLS path model (over all the observations) at the root node. Then, the explanatory external variables are used to produce all possible binary splits. Among all the possible splits, the best one is selected by means of an F-test for comparing inner models. This process is recursively applied for each child node. The stop criterion is based on the significance level of the p-value associated with the F statistic. Additionally, two stop parameters are also considered: (1) the number of individuals in a node and (2) the depth of the tree's growing level.</p><p>Before discussing the extension of the Pathmox approach in Section 5, we illustrate how Pathmox works in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Pathmox application: estimating the customer satisfaction of a Spanish bank</head><p>To illustrate how Pathmox deals with the problem of heterogeneity, we use an example based on customer satisfaction measurement, which is the most typical application of PLS-PM in marketing research ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>).</p><p>The objective is to elucidate the presence of heterogeneity and establish its potential causes. In particular, our aim is to investigate whether there are any differences in Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty for one of Spain's leading providers of retail financial services.</p><p>For this approach, we need to differentiate between two sets of variables: one is made up of the manifest variables that will define the PLS-PM model and the other consists of the segmentation variables. Our case study includes manifest variables measured on an 11-point ordinal scale, ranging from very satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> to very dissatisfied (0) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and 4 segmentation variables: Gender, Age, Education Level and Occupation (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), all of them measured from 420 individuals.</p><p>The model includes six constructs: Image, Expectations, Perceived Quality, Perceived Value, Customer Satisfaction, and Loyalty. It is designed to measure the cause-effect relationships between the antecedents and consequences of Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty. The antecedents of Customer Satisfaction are Image, Expectations, Perceived Quality, and Perceived Value, while those of Loyalty are Customer Satisfaction and Image. The definitions of the theoretical constructs of the model are given in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. We assume that all latent variables are reflective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Global PLS-PM analysis</head><p>We begin with the calculation of the global PLS model for all customers (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In order to simplify the interpretation, we merely present the results of Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty. As indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> we analyze (in order): unidimensionality, reliability (for validating the outer model and the path coefficient estimates), their significance, and the predictability of the model (for understanding the causal relationships that determine Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty). All the results were obtained with the R package "plspm" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The results were:</p><p>1. The unidimensionality of the reflective latent constructs (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). All Crombach's α are higher than 0.82.</p></div>

We can see that the main (direct) drivers for Customer Satisfaction are Perceived Value and Perceived Quality, whereas Customer Satisfaction is the main antecedent for Loyalty.</p><p>4.

These are normal values in customer satisfaction studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Pathmox analysis</head><p>Despite the reduced sample size of the study, it seems that the obtained model is good enough to draw conclusions about how Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty are formed among the banks' customers. However, the question remains about whether the effects we have detected are valid or if they are artificial averages of underlying subpopulations. To answer that question and discover potential sources of heterogeneity, we performed a Pathmox analysis 2 using the segmentation variables of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The tree we are interested in has a moderate final number of segments, which can be interpreted and made operational for marketing purposes. In this case, we have limited the tree by imposing: a maximum depth of one level for the sake of interpretability; a minimum admissible size of 10% for splitting nodes; and a threshold significance that is set at 0.05 for the split criterion.</p><p>The obtained Pathmox tree is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It is a tree with a total number of two terminal nodes. The root node corresponds to the previous global model that was calculated over the entire sample size. The split results from the segmentation variable Education, which has a corresponding F statistic p-value of 0.001. This split divides the 420 customers of the root node into two subsets. One subset is made up of 391 "non-graduate" customers (node 2). The other subset consists of 29 "graduate" customers (node 3).</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, we present the PLS-PM models corresponding to the two segments. To better appreciate the differences, we marked in red the arrows of coefficients that are most significantly different in both segments. As we can see, there are two path coefficients that have very different effects in the two models: Perceived Quality on Customer Satisfaction, Perceived Value on Customer Satisfaction. In the model of "non-graduate" customers (node 2), we can see that Perceived Quality presents a positive effect on Customer Satisfaction (path coefficient: 0.294) and Perceived Value a positive effect on Customer Satisfaction (path coefficient: 0.375); whereas in the model of "graduate" customers (node 3), the effect of Perceived Quality on Customer Satisfaction is negative (path coefficient: -0.256) and the effect of Perceived Value on Customer Satisfaction is strongly positive (path coefficient: 0.764).</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, we show the direct, indirect and total effects among the constructs, where we corroborate the importance of Image, Expectations, Perceived Quality, and Perceived Value, for the "non-graduate" customers in defining Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty. On the other hand, Perceived Quality appears not to be relevant for the "graduate" customers.</p><p>Finally, we also provide validation of the path coefficients (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">8</ref>) by calculating the bootstrap intervals for each path coefficient of the model, which is useful for understanding whether the identified differences are significant. Starting with the model of "non-graduate" customers (node 2) we observe that all path coefficients are significant, except for Expectations on Customer Satisfaction. Looking at node 3 (model of "graduate" customers), we have only two path coefficients that are significant: Perceived Value on Customer Satisfaction and Customer Satisfaction on Loyalty, meaning that this target considers only Perceived Value as significant in defining their Customer Satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Extending the Pathmox analysis</head><p>The F-test used as a split criterion in Pathmox is a global criterion: it assess whether all the path coefficients of all the equations in the structural model are equal when comparing two groups, but it does not indicate which particular structural equation or which path coefficients are responsible for the difference. We need an a posteriori comparison of the child nodes to understand the reason (i.e., causal relationships) of such a difference. For instance, when Pathmox detects a difference between the two groups (the "graduate" customers and the "non-graduate" customers), we do not know which of the six structural equations (one for each endogenous latent variable) is responsible for the detected difference. In the case where we have a significant difference in one structural equation (for instance in Customer Satisfaction), we do not know which path coefficient is responsible (Image, Expectation, Perceived Value, or Perceived Quality). In order to distinguish the equation and the path coefficients that are responsible for the split, we introduced the F-block test and the F-coefficient test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">F-block test</head><p>To detect which regression (i.e., structural equation) is responsible for the global difference, we extended the F-global test. We will call the statistic of this comparison the F-block (or blocktest). Let us consider a structural model (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) with two endogenous variables, η 1 and η 2 , and one exogenous variable ξ 1 . The structural equations for both endogenous constructs are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η 1 = β 1 ξ 1 + ζ 1 (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">η 2 = β 2 ξ 1 + β 3 η 1 + ζ 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The disturbance terms ζ 1 and ζ 2 are assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and finite and equal variance: that is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">E(ζ 1 ) = E(ζ 2 ) = 0 and Var(ζ 1 ) = Var(ζ 2 ) = σ 2 I. It is also assumed that Cov(ζ 1 , ζ 2 ) = 0.</formula><p>We define the following matrices:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">X 1 = [ξ 1 ]</formula><p>a column matrix with the explicative latent variables of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">η 1 B 1 = [β 1 ]</formula><p>a vector of path coefficients for the regression of η 1 X 2 = [ξ 1 , η 1 ] a column matrix with the explicative latent variables of η 2 B 2 = [β 2 , β 3 ] a vector of path coefficients for the regression of η 2 Then, the structural equations are expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">η 1 = X 1 B 1 + ζ 1<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">η 2 = X 2 B 2 + ζ 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We assume that the parent node is divided into two child nodes or segments, one containing n A elements and the other containing n B observations. For each segment, we compute its own structural model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">SegmentA : η A 1 = X A 1 B A 1 + ζ A 1 and η A 2 = X A 2 B A 2 + ζ A 2 (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">SegmentB : η B 1 = X B 1 B B 1 + ζ B 1 and η B 2 = X B 2 B B 2 + ζ B 2 (6) with ζ A 1 ∼ N(0, σ 2 I) and ζ A 2 ∼ N(0, σ 2 I), ζ B 1 ∼ N(0, σ 2 I) and ζ B 2 ∼ N(0, σ 2 I).</formula><p>Let us assume that the F-global test gives a significant p-value. We wish to investigate which equation (η 1 or η 2 ) is responsible for the difference. For the sake of simplicity, we wish to validate whether the first equation is equal in both segments while letting equation two vary freely. In this case the null hypothesis, H 0 , is that the equation shown in (1) is equal for segments A and B, while the alternative hypothesis, H 1 , is that all equations are different. Following the rationale of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, both hypotheses can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">H 0 :     η A 1 η A 2 η B 1 η B 2     [2n,1] =     X A 1 0 0 0 X A 2 0 X B 1 0 0 0 0 X B 2     [2n,p 1 +2p 2 ]   β 1 β A 2 β B 2   [p 1 + 2p 2 ,1] +     ζ A 1 ζ A 2 ζ B 1 ζ B 2     [ 2n,1]<label>(7)</label></formula><p>H 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">    η A 1 η A 2 η B 1 η B 2     [ 2n,1] =     X A 1 0 0 0 0 X A 2 0 0 0 0 X B 1 0 0 0 0 X B 2     [ 2n,2p 1 + 2p 2 ]     β A 1 β B 1 β A 2 β B 2     [2p 1 + 2p 2 ,1] +     ζ A 1 ζ A 2 ζ B 1 ζ B 2     [ 2n,1]<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where n = n A + n B is the number of elements in the model containing the two nodes and p j is the number of explicative latent variables for each j-th endogenous construct j = 1, . . . , J (in this example J = 2). We can define the design matrices X 0 , with X corresponding to both hypotheses as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">X 0 =     X A 1 0 0 0 X A 2 0 X B 1 0 0 0 0 X B 2     [ 2n,p 1 + 2p 2 ] X =     X A 1 0 0 0 0 X A 2 0 0 0 0 X B 1 0 0 0 0 X B 2     [ 2n,2p 1 + 2p 2 ]<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Then we can write that X 0 = XA, defining matrix A as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">A =     I p 1 0 0 0 I p 2 0 I p 1 0 0 0 0 I p 2     [ 2p 1 + 2p 2 ,p 1 + 2p 2 ] (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>where I P j is the identity matrix of order p j . Then, according to lemma 2 of Lebart <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we can test the H 0 hypothesis by computing the following F statistic with (p 1 ) and 2(np 1p 2 ) degrees of freedom.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">F Block = (SS H 0 -SS H 1 ) p 1 SS H 1 2(n -p 1 -p 2 )<label>(11)</label></formula></div>

The two hypotheses are now written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">H 0 :     η A 1 η A 2 η B 1 η B 2     [2n,1] =     ξ A 1 0 0 0 0 0 ξ A 1 η A 1 0 0 ξ B 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ξ B 1 η B 1     [2n,2 ∑ P j=1 p j -1]        β 1 β A 2 β A 3 . . . β B 3        [2 ∑ P j=1 p j -1,1] +     ζ A 1 ζ A 2 ζ B 1 ζ B 2     [ 2n,1]<label>(12)</label></formula><p>H 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">    η A 1 η A 2 η B 1 η B 2     [ 2n,1] =     ξ A 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ξ A 1 η A 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ξ B 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ξ B 1 η B 1     [ 2n,2 ∑ P j=1 p j ]        β A 1 β A 2 β A 3 . . . β B 3        [2 ∑ P j=1 p j ,1] +     ζ A 1 ζ A 2 ζ B 1 ζ B 2     [ 2n,1]<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Repeating the same rationale, of calling X 0 the design matrix of the null hypothesis and X the design matrix of the alternative hypothesis, we have X 0 = XA, where matrix A is now defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">A =                </formula><p>1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">                [ 2 ∑ P j=1 p j ,∑ P j=1 p j -1]<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Then, as before, we can test the H 0 hypothesis by computing the following F-coefficient statistic with 1 and 2(n -∑ P j=1 p j ) degrees of freedom.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">F Coe f f icient = (SS H 0 -SS H 1 ) 1 SS H 1 2(n -∑ P j=1 p j )<label>(15)</label></formula><p>6 Simulation study</p><p>In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the split criterion used in the F-global, F-block, and Fcoefficient tests, we run a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Our simulations are based mainly on the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. We have varied the data generating conditions: the sample size, the path coefficients for each segment, and the disturbance term for the endogenous construct.</p><p>We have tried to reproduce similar conditions to those encountered in real-life applications of customer satisfaction studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Simulated models</head><p>The first step of our simulation study is the definition of the PLS model. In our model, data were generated according to the structural model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>, which we performed by following a two-step procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>: first, we generated the latent variable data by following the relationship specified in the structural model; then, we reproduced the manifest variable data from the latent variables.</p><p>The PLS model consists of one exogenous (ξ) and two endogenous (η 1 and η 2 ) latent variables. The inner structure is defined as: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> where β are regression coefficients and ζ are the error terms associated to the endogenous latent variables. The manifest variables are denoted by x for ξ and by y for η. The measurement models, for ξ, η 1 and η 2 are reflective and defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">η 1 = β ξη 1 ξ + ζ η 1 η 2 = β ξη 2 ξ + β η 1 η 2 η 1 + ζ η 2</formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">x 1 = λ x 1 ξ 1 + ε x 1 y 1 = λ y 1 η 1 + ε y 1 y 4 = λ y 4 η 2 + ε y 4 x 2 = λ x 2 ξ 1 + ε x 2 y 2 = λ y 2 η 1 + ε y 2 y 5 = λ y 5 η 2 + ε y 5 x 3 = λ x 3 ξ 1 + ε x 3 y 2 = λ y 3 η 1 + ε y 3 y 6 = λ y 6 η 2 + ε y 6 (17)</formula><p>The λ terms are coefficients, and the ε terms are random errors. We set the λ values for the three constructs equal to 0.85, 0.80, 0.75 for i = 1, • • • , 3 respectively. We used a Beta distribution B ∼ (6, 3) for the exogenous latent variable ξ, in order to reproduce the asymmetry that characterizes the way respondents answer in satisfaction studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Experimental factors</head><p>The levels of all factors in the experimental design were selected according to the following conditions:</p><p>1. Size. We consider three sample sizes as the total number of cases: {100, 400, and 1000}.</p><p>2. Standard deviation of measurement errors. We assume that the error terms, ε, follow a Normal distribution with zero expectation and three levels of standard deviation: small noise (σ = 0.05), moderate noise (σ = 0.2) and high noise (σ = 1).</p><p>3. Difference between coefficients. The model was estimated in two segments, A and B, while varying the level of difference between path coefficients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>): that is, they could be equal in both segments, or the difference could be small, medium or large. This means that we have a difference of 0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, for the corresponding path coefficients of segments while always respecting the admissibility conditions of path coefficients.</p><p>In total, we have 3 × 3 × 4 = 36 scenarios, which are the number of possible combinations of sample sizes, noise levels and differences between coefficients. We ran 50 repetitions for each experimental condition, and we present the mean of all 50 repetitions as an aggregate result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Simulation study results</head><p>The results of the simulation study are graphically illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. We present only the marginal effects of the three experimental factors (sample sizes, noise levels, and differences between coefficients) which were used in the three compared F-tests (F-global, F-block, and F-coefficient test). In the nine plots, we graph from left to right first the F-global's p-values, second the F-block and, finally, the F-coefficient's p-values. This allows us to obtain a direct comparison of the three tests. We use a black circle to indicate the F-global's p-values, a blue circle and red triangle to differentiate between the F-block's p-values from the first equation and the p-values from the second equation, and a blue circle, red triangle and green plus sign to differentiate the F-coefficient's p-values for path coefficients β 1 , β 2 and β 3 . For the sake of interpretation, we have included in each plot the LOWESS regression line of the p-values as they relate to the evaluated experimental condition. In red, we show the LOWESS line representing the F-global trend. Again, to illustrate the F-block and F-coefficient trends, we use the same colors for the p-value points in order to differentiate between the p-value trend of the first latent equation and that of the second, and also to differentiate the p-values of the first path coefficient from the second and from the third. In the first three plots, it is possible to observe how the p-values decrease (i.e., they become more significant) as the sample size increases. In the second set of plots, we can see that sensitivity becomes lower when the level of noise for the error term grows higher. Finally, the influence of the difference between the path coefficients can be clearly appreciated in the last three plots, in which the p-values decrease as the difference between path coefficients increases. Hence, we can conclude that:</p><p>1. There is a clear effect of sample size: the larger the sample size is, the more sensitive the tests are.</p><p>2. There is a clear effect of the level of noise: the greater the level of noise is, the less sensitive the tests are.</p><p>3. There is a clear effect of the difference in the path coefficients in the two segments: the more different the path coefficients are, the more sensitive the tests are.</p><p>Finally, we present the results obtained in the simulation by varying only the β 1 coefficient (hence the η 1 equation) while keeping the other two coefficients constant. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>, we can see that the F-global detects the difference, as well as the F-block of η 1 and the F-coefficient of β 1 . However, as expected, this does not occur with the F-block for η 2 and the F-coefficient for β 2 and β 3 .</p><p>7 F-block and F-coefficient results for the split partition identified by Pathmox for the Spanish bank customers</p><p>At this point, it is interesting to use the F-block and the F-coefficient statistics to verify the improvement in the results, specifically in terms of our interpretation of the identified split between the "non-graduate" customers and the "graduate" customers.</p><p>In Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">9</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">10</ref>, we present the results of the F-block and the F-coefficient tests, which are obtained by the R package "genpathmox" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Starting with Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">9</ref>, we can see that the F-block identifies the equation of Customer Satisfaction as responsible for the split between the "non-graduate" customers and the "graduate" customers, with a p-value of 0.010.</p><p>Regarding the path coefficients responsible for the difference, we can observe in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">10</ref> that the F-coefficient identifies the effect of Perceived Quality on Customer Satisfaction (F-statistic 7.514 and p-value: 0.006) and of Perceived Value on Customer Satisfaction (F-statistic 4.028 and p-value: 0.045).</p><p>Finally, we can conclude that the difference between the models of nodes 2 and 3 depends on the effects of two path coefficients: Perceived Quality on Customer Satisfaction and Perceived Value on Customer Satisfaction. Furthermore, as we expected, these two path coefficients are the same ones that we detected as most different when comparing a posteriori the inner models of the terminal nodes in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Discussion of findings</head><p>We have succeeded in detecting heterogeneity while also being able to identify the relationship of the variables responsible for such differences. This represents an important achievement in the decision making process particularly when dealing with complex models as in the case of PLS-PM. The extended version of the Pathmox approach does a step further by going deeper into the analysis of heterogeneity. The F-block and F-coefficient tests overcome an important limitation in the F-global test by revealing the reason for the obtained partitions. Pathmox currently offers two practical tools for identifying both the equations and the path coefficients that cause differences between two specific partitions. We tested the relative coherence between the F-block and the F-coefficient statistics in respect to the F-global, specifically when two path models are compared while taking into account: different sample sizes, different error levels in terms of the standard deviation of the manifest variables, and the various levels of difference between the path coefficients. In all cases, we have obtained very similar results with respect to the simulation study presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Finally, we have seen the suitability of the two statistics in a practical marketing application. However, some aspects of the algorithm discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> are not solved yet. As with the F-global, the F-block and the F-coefficients use a parametric test based on a classical parametric statistic: the F statistic. This supposes the normality assumption of the perturbation terms with equal variance in all endogenous constructs, even though the assumptions are rarely met in practice. Nevertheless the sensitivity of the F statistic is guaranteed by larger sample size, lower levels of random perturbations and clearer differences in the segments as shown by the simulations that were undertaken.</p><p>Pathmox focuses only on the problem of detecting the path coefficients that are responsible for a difference between PLS-PM models by adapting the measurement model to every segment. This leads to the problem of invariance case that greatly increases in importance when we analyze data by considering potential sources of heterogeneity and fitting one model for every segment. In this situation, it becomes difficult to guarantee that each construct in each segment is measuring the same latent concept, and it is not reliable to compare the latent variables for individuals belonging to different segments. This is an important issue which we shall continue to investigate <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and which deserves further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have extended the performance of the Pathmox approach in order to detect the equations (F-block test) of a structural model and the path coefficients (F-coefficient test) responsible for an observed difference. We have seen how the F-test of the model comparison made by <ref type="bibr">Lebart ([10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) can be adapted to these purposes.</p><p>In the performed simulation, we have illustrated that the three tests mentioned above(Fcoefficient, F-block and F-global) produce very consistent results and serve to detect the coefficients responsible for a split under the different experimental conditions. Furthermore, we have shown the advantages of using the F-block and F-coefficient tests in real data applications.</p><p>The results revealed the existence of a niche of customers with specific drivers for Customer Satisfaction: "graduate" customers, for whom Customer Satisfaction is affected positively only as a result of the Perceived Value that is obtained. These findings can be explained as a consequence of graduates having greater financial knowledge. In contrast, for the majority of customers (the "non-graduate" customers) Customer Satisfaction is a holistic construct affected by all its drivers. Regarding Loyalty, no significant differences were discovered between the two groups of customers. Hence, we consider the global model to be valid for Loyalty.          </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Step 4 . 1 .</head><label>41</label><figDesc>If (stop criteria 1 = false) then repeat step 3 Possible stop criteria: a.
