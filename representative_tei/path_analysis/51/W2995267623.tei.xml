<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The complexity of data and decision-making environments create the need for computerized decision support systems. Theoretical research and case studies ensure that a well-designed and appropriate Decision Support System (DSS) can improve the decision quality and the effectiveness of decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Nowadays, organizations seek for more analysis and specific relevant decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To do so, the goal of current DSS is to enhance the use of data to produce knowledge. In fact, such knowledge can be extracted using data mining technology.</p><p>Applying data mining algorithms automatically helps in finding hidden but relevant patterns from raw data. Validated patterns generate knowledge valuable for decision-making tasks. In this context, data mining integration makes decision support as an intelligent process. Such process begins with the problem definition and ends with best alternative generation.</p><p>To improve the quality of the extracted patterns and decision-making, visualization integrates the human intelligence to the machine intelligence. Literally, visual data mining technology addresses the interaction between the two. It inspires solutions from data mining, as well as information, representation and interaction paradigms for supporting decision-making processes. In this context, our research focuses on the visual data mining based decision-making support. We name these systems as Visual Intelligent Decision Support systems (VIDSS); where the visual intelligence refers to the visual data mining technology integration in the decisionmaking activities.</p><p>The visual data mining allows us to visually discover patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These patterns, if validated, will be considered as knowledge useful for decision-making.</p><p>The transition from extracted patterns to knowledge must follow a transfer process. This process must allow the creation and transfer of knowledge, which is one-step further of these patterns. An interesting solution introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is to use visualization for knowledge acquisition and communication.</p><p>Knowledge acquisition from data mining patterns is a delicate task. It is in this context that we propose to apply a visual analytics approach to analyse and interpret the extracted patterns visually in order to generate associated knowledge. It is a visual analytics of visual data mining results for knowledge generation.</p><p>Our paper aims to elaborate and complement the existing frameworks focusing on the visual analytics process <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> [10] <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We deem that this work will be useful for visual analytics research and practice, since it aims at facilitating the whole analytical process in a comprehensive manner. As we present in this paper, our contribution can be stated as follows:</p><p>-We introduce a generic conceptual framework for considering the visual analytics process as a cognitive modelling approach of IDSS.</p><p>-On this basis, we apply the proposed process to a medical case study in order to validate its sustainability. It is an example of case study that illustrates decisional benefits. Further case studies can be planned in future work.</p><p>-We evaluate the developed VIDSS prototype according to the utility and the usability dimensions. We aim by this evaluation to prove the applicability of our approach.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the summary of our research work process. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the background of this study including visual data mining based decision-making, knowledge visualization and visual analytics concepts. Section 3 suggests a new adapted cognitive approach for knowledge generation from extracted patterns. In section 4, we show the implementation of the proposed approach in the context of medical informatics. Section 5 evaluates the approach application. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary of our contribution and areas of future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background of the study</head><p>In this section we aim to introduce and describe the concepts related to the research problem under study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Intelligent decision-making</head><p>Decision-making plays a major role in information systems, particularly because of the changing environment where relevant information is of increasing value <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The purpose of a decision-making system is to generate answers to decisional questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In this sense, DSS should be used as often as possible.</p><p>Before taking each important decision, the organization must analyse the situation and understand the impacts of its decisions. In order to avoid the need for rigorous analyses, which require the input of experts (who must take over the calculations and analyses for each scenario under consideration), the system must integrate intelligent analysis techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This has led to methodological approaches that attempt to extract not only valid and reliable information, but also generally more patterns to support the decision-making.</p><p>Two main types of approaches can be distinguished in the analysis of data: the first one is decision-making that most often focuses on modelling; the other one is exploratory and aims to synthesize a more or less heterogeneous set of information (this approach is then essentially descriptive). Moreover, the logic of data analysis evolves and changes of perspective. The tools for data science are clearly part of the exploratory side of statistical and machine learning studies but are also rooted in the predictive type of logic.</p><p>Data science is the field of study that includes everything from big data analytics, predictive modelling, data visualization and data mining. Data mining is defined as "the acquisition of new, intelligible and potentially useful knowledge from hidden facts in large quantities of data" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This knowledge is communicated in the form of more or less complex models: a series of coefficients for a numerical prediction model, logical rules of the type "if condition then conclusion" or instances.</p><p>For these models to acquire knowledge status, they must be validated. This involves implementing a series of socalled post-processing operations aimed at assessing the validity of models, making them intelligible if they are to be used by human beings, or expressing them in an appropriate formalism understandable by a machine. Indeed, a model understood by the user will be utilized and therefore criticized and perfected. Users generally do not like to use patterns in the form of "black boxes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The principal problem in the exploration of data mining models is the development of methods allowing experts to quickly select the most relevant models according to their perception of the domain. In order to avoid this tedious and difficult phase, the information visualization allows the experts to select in a very intuitive way the models most likely to interest them <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> [18] <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In this way, the visual search of data implicitly employs the user's view as a means of exploring the many solutions and converging very naturally towards those which appear to him or her to be the most interesting or the most promising: visual data mining.</p><p>There are three visual data mining paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>:</p><p>(1) The preceding Visualization: the data is visually explored before an algorithm is implemented. This makes it possible to discover interesting motifs;</p><p>(2) The Subsequent Visualization: an algorithm is used to extract patterns. They are then visualized to be analysed by the user. Depending on this visualization, the user may have to modify the parameterization of the algorithm to re-execute it; and</p><p>(3) The Tightly Integrated Visualization: the intermediate results of the data-mining algorithm are visualized and allow the user to interactively detect interesting patterns, according to his or her knowledge domain. As an algorithm cannot be suitable for all situations, its choice is made by the user, and the results are thus adapted to his or her domain. This process can be repeated until the desired result.</p><p>The transition from data mining results to knowledge is within the scope of the knowledge visualization framework. The Tightly Integrated Visualization allows an iterative visualization of patterns to visually obtain knowledge by experts without applying any analytical judgment. This is the context in which our contribution fits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Knowledge visualization</head><p>Knowledge is recognized as an important resource for organizations. The status of knowledge in the organization's strategy is a key factor that promotes the continuity of knowledge management in organizations. Thus, knowledge representation is a major concern of knowledge management projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Therefore literature has shown the important impact of applying visual representations for reasoning, communicating and facilitating knowledge acquiring in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Burkhard <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduces the knowledge visualization as a new research field. It is an interesting part in knowledge management that allows to effectively create and transfer new knowledge through using visualizations. According to Eppler <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, visualization can improve the productivity of knowledge sharing radically. Visualization is beneficial for decision-makers' communication, collaboration and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Admittedly, Burkhard <ref type="bibr">[6] [7]</ref> differentiates between knowledge visualization and information visualization. Information visualization is the use of visual representations of abstract data to increase human cognition. In counterpart, knowledge visualization is the use of visual representations of knowledge for the purposes of creation and sharing. Nevertheless, these two communities claim the same paradigms.</p><p>Burkhard <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proposed a knowledge visualization framework based on four perspectives: (1) function type perspective, which refers to the objective to be achieved; (2) knowledge type perspective, which focuses on the suitable type of knowledge to be transferred; (3) recipient type perspective, which focuses on the target group; and (4) visualization type perspective, which focuses on the visualization categories.</p><p>This framework aims to provide a support for the selection of appropriate visualizations for individual and collaborative decision-making processes. Furthermore, Burkhard <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduces a knowledge visualization model based on the insight, that knowledge cannot be transferred directly from a sender to a receiver. The knowledge recipient has to integrate it into his/her own cognition knowledge depending on his/her individual background and experience. This model is divided into three components (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>):</p><p>(1) The mental model of the sender to externalize his/her knowledge into visualizations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.A and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.B), which are the source for the recreation process of the receiver (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.C). In case of misunderstandings, the receiver can make or send feedback to the sender to modify existing visualizations or create new ones corresponding to his or her needs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.D, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.E, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.F).</p><p>(2) The medium component that is built from the external visual representation of the knowledge. As a matter of fact, complementary visualizations are needed in transferring knowledge. The visualization must catch the attention of the receiver (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.B.1) in order to make him/her open for the knowledge from the sender (using an attractive interactive dashboards for example).</p><p>(3) Then, the knowledge context must be illustrated to show the relevance of the sent knowledge importance to the receiver (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.B.2). Then an overview must provide all the aspects of the idea followed by some options to act (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.B.2) and allow the receiver to interact with it by focusing on details of interest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.B.3) for recognizing relationships between ideas to understand.</p><p>(4) The recipient's mental model to internalize the visualizations into his/her knowledge. This model presents general guidelines for using knowledge visualization to transfer knowledge from a sender to a recipient. However, we can identify two limits:</p><p>(1) It does not take into account the data mining patterns specificities and transformations.</p><p>(2) It does not take into account that humans have different abilities to interpret visual stimuli.</p><p>It is within this context that we propose to overcome these limitations by leveraging the visual analytics principles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Visual analytics</head><p>By representing data in the form of rapidly accessible and exploitable information, visual data analytics platforms act as decision support tools. This feature makes visual analytics an efficient solution to gain knowledge useful in generating decisional recommendations.</p><p>The visual analytics is the process of combining visual intelligence and automatic analysis techniques with interactive technology to get relevant information out of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Visual intelligence enables the interpretation of what is constructed, based on user's prior experience. It is an interactive technology that allows users to not only visualize data but to also zoom in and out between the details and the big picture at about the same speed as our thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It takes advantage of the human eye's broad bandwidth pathway into the mind ability. Thus, it allows decision-makers to see, interpret, explore, and comprehend wide range of data at once.</p><p>Several research works proposed visual analytics processes. We begin by presenting the Wijk pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). It consists of producing visual representations from data to generate knowledge. This pipeline begins by applying initial analysis methods to derive visualization. Based on this visualization, the user enters a loop to visually gain knowledge on the data. The interaction with visualization allows the user to acquire a better comprehension of the visual representation itself by ordering diverse insights to help him/her to go beyond the visual and to confirm the previously extracted results.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The Generic Visual Analytics process (inspired from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>)</p><p>Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Keim et al. (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed the visual analytics process visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. It begins with the data transformation to derive graphical representations for exploration purposes. Then, the human analyst can apply automatic analysis or visual methods.</p><p>The automatic analysis involves data mining methods to extract interesting patterns from original data <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Once a pattern is created, the analyst has to interactively assess it and refine its parameters using visualization. Patterns' visualization can subsequently be used in evaluating the previously generated data mining results. Interacting with the visualization is required to better understand these results.</p><p>Alternating between visual data exploration and automatic data analysis leads to a continuous refinement and verification of the data mining results in order to gain knowledge. The capital gain of this model is in the reasoning process. This process is composed of three loops: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> exploration that grants the taking of appropriate actions on the visualization based on the findings, (2) verification of the insights to automatically formulate hypotheses about the data analysis from findings, and (3) knowledge generation.</p><p>Authors think that automating the steps, from insights to knowledge or from knowledge to new hypotheses, is not possible <ref type="bibr">[8] [9]</ref>. Veritably, analysts gain new knowledge when the evidence gathered with a visual analytics system is convincing (Knowledge Generation loop). The best way to support knowledge generation through visual analytics is to use systems that can look at data treated by computer from different angles (Exploration loop). This gives analysts the opportunity to collect versatile evidence and increases the level of confidence in results or insights (Verification loop) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Additional related work on knowledge assisted visual analytics is by Federico et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and model building by Andrienko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The first one suggested an extension of the model of van Wijk <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> by integrating the function and role of tacit and explicit knowledge in the analytical reasoning process. Such extension aims at designing a broad range of analytics systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The second one extended the model of Keim <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to propose a comprehensive conceptual framework considering the visual analytics process as a goal-oriented workflow and providing a model as a result <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>We can see after the non-exhaustive but representative study of the models of knowledge visualization and those of visual analysis that the two domains complement each other in improving the decision-making process. It is in this context that our contribution fits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Proposed adapted visual analytics process: From extracted patterns to knowledge</head><p>We aim in this section to present how VA process can efficiently generate knowledge from data mining extracted patterns. Using knowledge visualization is not sufficient. In fact, what is needed is to make such visualization analytic and interactive so that the decision-makers can manipulate the patterns during the decisionmaking process.</p><p>From this perspective, we based our proposal on the commonly accepted visual analytics model of Keim <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We have extended it with additional details. These details are related to human cognition concepts and knowledge visualization activities.</p><p>The extended model is a form of a cognitive visual analytics process for decision-making (visible in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). It aims at supporting the understanding of a holistic process from data to decisions. It is structured in three main levels: Patterns, Analysis and Knowledge.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Adapted cognitive visual analytics process for decision-making</p><p>In the following sub-section, we present our cognitive process in detail through its three levels: patterns level, analysis level and knowledge level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Patterns Level</head><p>This level begins with applying one or several data mining algorithms. It is a fully automatic approach aiming at extracting interesting patterns from a set of prepared data in order to make predictions and decisions. These patterns are presented in a symbolic form (probabilities, association rules, etc.).</p><p>Visualization is effective for transforming the symbolic into geometric. It allows gaining insight into data <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The visual mapping creates graphical view using information, having a displayable format <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Combining visualization with data mining has an important influence in improving the quality of the extracted patterns. It supports human intelligence with machine intelligence to assist in solving decision problems. The results derived in this level are: (1) extracted patterns in their automatic form (such as probabilities, association rules), and (2) image representing these patterns in a visual form. For each representation, a specific analysis will be applied in the second level of the proposed process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Analysis Level</head><p>At this level, we are interested in the extracted patterns' computational and interactive analysis. Two parallel analysis procedures of the automatic and visual patterns2 will be carried out. The interplay between the two procedures aims at ensuring and enhancing the quality of knowledge generation from the patterns (combination step in the Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Automatic analysis: computer interpretation</head><p>It consists of the exploration and the analysis of the automatic prediction patterns. It applies a set of analytics' algorithms and metrics to assess the prediction ability of these patterns to eventually obtain the desired result. It is based on an automatic reasoning that aims at retrieving the patterns' occurrences and interpretations.</p><p>If an exact analytics algorithm does not derive enough satisfying results, a fuzzy analytics algorithm can be used to return similar patterns based on the fuzzy logic theory <ref type="bibr">[24] [25]</ref>. These similar patterns can give more adapted and satisfying results. The nature and complexity of the used algorithm depends on the data mining patterns category (IF-THEN rules, decision tree, neural Network, probabilities, etc.).</p><p>This computational analysis must produce the validation of the learned patterns. It aims to detect the expected in these patterns (what we think is there). The results of this phase must be combined with those of patterns' visual analytics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Visual analysis: human interpretation</head><p>The principal objective of this phase is to visually analyse the image representing the extracted patterns (produced by the first level of the process). In this phase, we propose to integrate cognitive activities. It must enable the discovery of the unexpected in these patterns. To do so, users (i.e. decision-makers) must better understand the links between these elements.</p><p>Visual analytics is the key solution to really make sense and understand the displayed patterns. Decision-makers will be able to visually build knowledge structures that can be used to make decisions. This phase aims to improve the patterns' analysis by putting the human in charge of the analysis loop. It consists of four cognitive steps:</p><p>a) Perception: it relies on the human mind's ability to perceive shapes, colours, lines, spaces, motions and interactions. These graphic elements form how decision-makers perceive what composes the display <ref type="bibr">[26] [27]</ref>. The human perception affects the way that the decision-maker should structure the visualized patterns. The human mind looks at the visualization in its entirety, before or in parallel, with perception of its individual parts. The idea here is that the human mind has the ability to perceive differences and similar relationships and brings them together. The purpose is to perceive the specific story behind the displayed patterns by matching their properties and thinking about them. b) Recognition: after perceiving the graphic elements of the displayed patterns, the decision-maker recognizes them by comparing their appearance with the representation in his/her memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It is a representation whose nature raises many interpretations. It must lend itself to a matching with various and multiple appearances of the display (variations in size, orientation, lighting, etc.). The recognizable elements of the patterns increase their memorability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. c) Comprehension: this step proposes an adaptation of the knowledge visualization model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. To understand the displayed patterns, the decision-maker cannot interact only with one type of visualization but with a set of complementary visualizations for different purposes.</p><p>The process of comprehension begins after the recognition of the visual patterns elements that catch his/her attention. This latter makes him/her open for the knowledge from the displayed, perceived and recognized patterns. Then, the knowledge context must be illustrated to make the decision-maker focused on the importance of the knowledge according to him/her. An interaction with the visualization may require a combination of an overview and local views (details).</p><p>A local view can be seen as the result of a query on the overview, in which case it is of interest to authorize a dynamic and interactive control of the query through advanced interaction techniques (Options to act). All these actions allow comprehending / understanding the visualized patterns.</p><p>If the user understands what has been perceived, he/she will explore building trust for the visual creation of knowledge. Trust grants the decision maker the ability to build strong confidence in every step of the decisionmaking process <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It is essential in cognitive analysis to comprehend the perceived data, to reduce complexity and to resolve uncertainty in decision-making. d) Reasoning: it is based on the decision-maker's visual thinking. It is a part of the decision-maker's nonverbal intelligence. The decision-maker looks at the patterns' visualization, determines what kind of information is displayed and then analyses the information using his/her visual reasoning skills. Visual reasoning on perceived and understood information permits the visual building of knowledge.</p><p>Combination: as automatic analysis algorithms can learn through experience from data in order to gain knowledge and then to make appropriate decisions and predictions, visual analysis generates visual knowledge that improve human expertise of the decision-maker. This latter optimizes the automatic learning behaviour. Combining automatic and human knowledge allows integrating human in the decision-making loop. In this context, automatic analysis that selects unlabelled data collaborates with visual analysis for interactive labelling. Such collaboration leverages our innate ability of reasoning as humans to improve automatic data exploration for better knowledge-based decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Knowledge Level</head><p>At this level, the question is how to integrate automatically and visually discovered knowledge in the decisionmaking process. Knowledge is judged as interesting if it is relevant to the decisional analysis goal. Therefore, the outcome of visual analytics activities is not only a reliable insight but also a knowledge product that meets the purpose of the analysis.</p><p>Human decision-maker and the VIDSS, on which he/she wants to intervene, define a cognitive situation where the human operator must adapt to the situation, that is to say, to give his/her cognitive structures to the situations of the validated knowledge (the object of his/her action) in order to make relevant provisions to achieve the intended purpose (the draft action). The idea is to focus on the understanding and evaluation of knowledge. On the basis of a diagnosis (related to the application domain), the decision-maker is generally able to adapt his/her action plan or anticipate the reaction of the system on which he/she is working.</p><p>To do so, when designing the VIDSS, it is necessary to collaborate with the domain's experts to generate the different possible solutions (i.e. recommendations) to the decision problem, based on the knowledge generated from the data mining patterns. The decision-maker can thus interactively validate one or more solutions to make the appropriate decision. Otherwise, he/she can propose a subjective solution, as a domain expert. The system learns such information and considers it as tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p></div>

To validate our proposal, we present in this section our case study showing how it can be used to guide the designing process of VIDSS in healthcare application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Context</head><p>The purpose of our case study is to fight against Nosocomial Infections (NI) in a hospital's Intensive Care Units (ICU). NI constitutes a major public health problem due to the morbidity and mortality that they generate, as well as their cost of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The prevention of these infections has become a priority for several years in The Teaching Hospital Habib Bourguiba -Sfax, Tunisia <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. This work falls within the framework of a research project realized by our research team since 2016 in collaboration with the ICU physicians of the Teaching Hospital Habib Bourguiba -Sfax, Tunisia. We aim to apply our research for real-world impact in health. Hence, we aim to design and develop a Visual Intelligent Decision Support System (VIDSS) for the fight against NI. To implement such VIDSS, we apply our proposed visual analytics based knowledge generation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Process Application</head><p>In this section, we present the medical application of our adapted visual analytics process according to its three levels described above (cf. Section 3). Input data have been processed as described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>: In this section, we begin by explaining how we have applied the proposed sub-process of pattern level to our case study (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>). In fact, we remind that, according to our generic proposed approach, we can apply any data mining technique depending on the data to be processed and the decisional context (such as the association rules to analyse green manure decomposition parameters in the food sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> or the decision tree technique to mine gene expression data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>). In our case study, we have applied the Dynamic Bayesian Networks technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The NI occurrence prediction concerns all new entrants to the ICU <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Algorithm: the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) is an appropriate predictive data mining technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> for automatic prediction. Our choice considered the criteria of uncertainty and the dynamic aspect of the learning process as well as the temporal aspect of the ICU data. It determines the joint probability distribution of a dynamically ordered set of variables.</p><p>It is a long-term medical project for the fight against nosocomial infections in Intensive Care Units. The first prototypes were published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In this paper, we have improved the last one <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> by: (Point 1) refining the developed algorithm for the dynamic structure learning, and (Point 2) making the DBN learning structure interactive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(Point 1):</head><p>A DBN is a specific Bayesian Network that is used for stochastic dynamic process models. It is based on the following constraints: (a) it has the same structure at any time (Time-invariant) (b) at each period of time (a day of the hospitalization stay), it is extended from a time slice t to a time slice t+1, and (c) the variables in each time slice are connected in the same way.</p><p>In fact, the estimation of the NI occurrence probability at a dayi (i.e. resulti) is based on the following variables: calculated NI occurrence probability at a dayi-1, acts carried out at a dayi, and infectious examination at a dayi. The decision to be made is based on this probability. Learning the DBN structure consists of two types of arcs:</p><p>(1) Intra-slice arcs representing the interdependence between the variables of a time slice, and (2) Inter-slice arcs representing the arcs of time and symbolizing the interdependencies between a variable for different and successive time slices.</p><p>For the construction of intra-slice arcs, we developed the K2 dynamic algorithm to learn the structure of DBN by adapting it to our medical database. Following the subsequent algorithm: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Inputs</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">[t] = score (i, πi[0] U {z}) End If Scorenew [t] &gt; Scoreold Scorenew [t] = Scoreold πi[t]= πi[0] U {z} Else OKToProceed=False End End If xi[t] xj[t+1] xi xj End if End</formula><p>For the construction of inter-slice arcs, it is necessary to detect the dependencies between time slices t-1 and t, by using the joint probability distribution. It is calculated as follows:</p><p>Let X[t] = {X1[t],…, XN[t]} the set of the DBN variables with T time slices and N variables. The applied joint probability of XT is P(XT), which is equal to P(X <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>,…, X[N]) is calculated by Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P(XT) = P(Xi[t] | Pa(Xi[t]))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where Pa(Xi[t]) is the parents of Xi[t]</p><p>More details about this calculation are provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>( Each sub-graph represents the dependence between the variables of our datasets. The visualized links indicate the causality between medical variables, such as acts (Catheter VC, Urinary Probe, Art-Ventilation, Tracheotomy, Perf-Intra-Ven…), infectious exams, taken antibiotics at day i, and being infected or not (result i).</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, at the third day, five interventions are introduced which are Catheter, urinary probe and three infectious exams representing the causes of the predicted result.</p><p>Our improvement consists of involving the expert (i.e. physician) for the DBN learning structure. We aim to allow him/her to make different modifications based on his/her prior knowledge. He/she can intervene to add one or more arcs or nodes that seem logical or to remove illogical arcs or nodes. The use of expert-visualization interaction tools, such as zoom, facilitates the analysis, understanding and correction of the resulting learning structure.</p><p>Our objective is to improve the structure of DBN because its importance in result prediction. For instance, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>, we present the case of deleting the node CV4. The expert indicated that the act "Catheter VC" has no longer an influence on the result. On the other hand, the automatic learning of the structure showed that it was a factor to consider. This refinement allows improving the visualization (graph of the structure). This latter can be re-used to further analyse the patient's state for new knowledge generation.</p><p>Visual mapping: the developed DBN allowed building a temporal predictive model that meets the needs of ICU physicians. It is based on patient temporal data and predicts the NI occurrence probability (pi) at each day during the patient's hospitalization period. The decision to be made at a current stage takes into account the taken decisions at previous stages, when a new discovered knowledge (pi+1) should be addressed.</p><p>This link repeats itself during the decision process. The learn-to-decide-then-learn-to-decide model describes how the decision-maker learns the new extracted knowledge for making a new decision.</p><p>The visual mapping of our DBN is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. We aim by this visualisation to represent dependant medical variables using a set of coloured nodes and arcs. The relationships between the linked nodes and the result make it possible to visualize the causes of the predicted probability (infected or not). As a matter of fact, to make the extracted patterns more effectively communicated to decision makers, we used the histogram technique to represent the patterns.  The edges and the distribution of probabilities extracted using the BN algorithm actually represent the patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. For instance, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>, subparts of DBN (three days: from 20/10 to 22/10) are shown to describe the dependence relations between medical variables. In the first day, two acts that are Catheter and Artificial ventilation and an infectious exam influence the NI appearance (is not an urgent case). Then in the second day, the case is also not urgent and it depends on the previous result, the use of artificial ventilation and infections test.</p><p>As shown, the previous tests act on the infectious exams and on the applied acts. For example: if the test indicates that the germ X resists to an antibiotic, the physician should propose another antibiotic to reduce the probability of acquiring NI. Accordingly, in the third day, a new infectious test and new antibiotic have been added in order to influence the result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Analysis Level</head><p>The analysis is based on combining human interpretation (visual analysis via interaction) and automatic analysis using association rules tool (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">12</ref>. Application of analysis level sub-process</p><p>In the literature, an improved non-temporal version of the AR mining technique named Association Rule Networks (ARN) has been proposed. The ARN offers a synthesizing method of obtained association rules in a structured manner (graph representation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>To automatically explore and analyse the calculated NI occurrence probability, we have re-used the existing developed association rules technique, previously applied for extracting patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of using this technique, in this paper, is to confirm the elements that are found together and then to confirm or refute the discovered patterns by the DBN in the patterns Level. It is used to validate the patterns already extracted by the DBN technique. Combining DBN with association rules can be considered as a hybrid approach for automatically manipulating patterns before and after their extraction.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>, extracted patterns (obtained by applying DBN tool) and medical data (cited in the previous section) form the learning datasets of the association rules technique in order to generate a set of rules.</p><p>Our proposal of the automatic pattern analysis process is based on association rules mining technique. The objective is to analyse and explore patterns by discovering hidden and significant rules that are useful for fighting against the nosocomial infections. By employing AR for patterns analysis, we aim to determine the most relevant information from the information considered a priori as useful. Accordingly, the user can gain more and more optimized knowledge. Based on the extracted rules he/she can discover the factors, which cause the NI.</p><p>The rules are of the form: "If variable(s) X then being Infected or Not infected in time T" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. A variable can be an antibiotic, act or infectious examination. The condition of the rule can be a conjunction of variables. An example of rule is the following: "If Artificial Ventilation then probability of NI in 8 days".</p><p>The strength of an association rule is measured by its support and confidence indices. We define the support of the rule as the probability of observing both the premise X and the conclusion Y: P (X∩Y) and the confidence as P (Y / X). We used the temporal version of the Apriori algorithm as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. For each patient, we treat the list of transactions at every day as a subset and we eliminate the temporal factors (day). Then we determine the list of frequent itemsets (Lk) that consists of the frequent subsets having support greater than the min_support. Finally, after the generation of temporal association rules using Lk and adding the temporal factor, we calculate the confidence values. The algorithm allows discovering the rule sets that satisfy minimum support and confidence thresholds in the database.</p><p>Actually, the values of minimum support and confidence (respectively 20% and 5%) are obtained after several experiments in which we analysed the obtained temporal association rules importance. In our research team, a specific group collected and prepared the 165 patients' data that were reported in the relational database format. Each record includes the following attributes: folder number, day, acts (act1, act2 ... actn), given antibiotics (ant1, ant2, ... , ant10), infectious examinations (ie1, ie2, ... ie30) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> and the attribute NI (Nosocomial Infection) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> .</p><p>In addition, we have developed the 3D visualization technique to complete the VIDSS platform. The development of this technique required the consideration of three main dimensions: Items, Time and Metrics (Support and Confidence). The value of a temporal variable (e.g. act, antibiotic or infectious examination) at a time t is expressed by the intersection of the X axis and the Y axis in a 2D matrix.</p><p>Each box in the matrix represents a rule. The metrics (Support and confidence) are represented at the bottom of the matrix, and their sizes are proportional to their values (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13(a)</ref>). We use these two metrics for the automatic exploration and analysis. Using interaction techniques like rotation, labelling and zoom in/out/to-fit, the analyst can choose the adequate view to analyse (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13 (b)</ref>).</p><p>The VIDSS prototype calculates these two metrics for each extracted pattern to check its relevance. A minimum value for these two metrics is presented to the physician (i.e. decision-maker) to ensure the validity of the pattern in question (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 13. Association rules user interface for patterns validation</head><p>The example presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> shows the rule: "If Arterial Catheter and examinf5 then Not Infected in day 04/01 with support = 20% and confidence = 50%".</p><p>As shown, the Association Rules method enables the physician to analyse extracted patterns thoroughly. The goal is to discover hidden relationships between all the stored variables (including transformed patterns) of interest to the doctor in order to accomplish his or her task. Thus, as a complement to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, this representation explains, in a simple and interactive manner, the factors such as the acts taken and the given antibiotics causing such situation (being infected or not infected). The evolution of the patient state must be controlled daily. For this reason, it is necessary to support decision-maker in data analysis by offering the possibility have daily and overall view to make the right decision.</p><p>The support and confidence values 5 are above the minimum thresholds (min support =20% and min confidence = 5%), which ensure the rule's validity. Once the automatic analysis has confirmed the relevance of the extracted pattern, it comes to question its visual analysis. To do so, we explain following the application of its cognitive activities.</p><p>The visual interface (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>) is a graphic representation that structures and explores causal relationships between data parts. It shows an example of the application of the encoding scheme of several node attributes (acts, antibiotics and infectious examinations) in the force-directed graph. It displays temporal data that influenced the NI probability at a specific day of the hospitalization period.</p><p>The nodes' colours encode the case urgency of the temporal variables. The fill colour of the node encodes a continuous variable while referring to the legend in the lower right corner of the main canvas. The colours become stronger towards the nodes of risk variables. At the bottom, the bar chart below the force-directed graph shows the evolution of the NI probabilities during the patient's hospitalization. Physicians may want to study this evolution and determine how to minimize the probability of NI occurrence. The physician can recognize the visual elements of the user interface. 5 Support and confidence are evaluation criteria of association rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The support is the indicator of the rule reliability while the confidence is the indicator of the rule precision. The interaction mechanisms (zoom in, zoom out, filtering and node labelling) support the flexibility of the visualization, allow physicians to highlight a part of the force-directed graph following user attention and show in-depth information only on demand (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">14</ref>). These mechanisms aim at keeping the overall visualization experience from over-crowdedness. To understand the displayed pattern, the physician can repeat the application of the interaction mechanisms as needed, which can catch his/her attention. In fact, he/she dynamically interplays between global and local views of the different data displayed on the visual tool.</p><p>The physician can click over nodes to display related information (labelling mechanism) and filter out variables. Moreover, the physician interacts with the visual tool: (1) to acquire knowledge related to the NI probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> to retrieve data (acts, antibiotics and infectious examinations) associated with the displayed patterns from the database using the labelling technique, and (3) to visually interpret the differences and/or similarities between these related data each day during the patient hospitalization.</p><p>In addition, it is possible to allow physicians to move a certain number of nodes by drag-and-drop technique. However, such displacement interaction is not possible for rigid representation such as bar chart. Nevertheless, the user can change the layout of the bar chart to a curve (LineChart 3D). Another example is the zoom, which is a necessary mechanism that makes visualization in an unlimited area where some nodes can be pushed to a distant location. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">14</ref> shows a box that appears when the user needs to get a detailed view of the infection examinations that had been carried out. In fact, he/she can see if the germs are resistant to the antibiotics given for each exam (positive-Green or negative-Red). All these examples of interactivity assist the physician to understand the force-directed, bar chart and curve graphs.</p><p>The physician can take different positions of viewing while the visualization can reveal further significant information. In addition, we allow physicians to visually inspect the impact of temporal variables on the NI appearance by navigating in the timeline and dynamically adding/deleting nodes in the network.</p><p>Such visual analysis facilitates the understanding of the critical variables influencing the patient's condition and then exploring building trust for visually creating knowledge about the NI occurrence, its causes and its evolution. The physician, looking at the dynamically displayed force-directed, bar chart and curve graphs, can analyse the displayed information using his/her visual reasoning skills.</p><p>Based on the calculated metrics for the automatic analysis and the visual knowledge generated by the visual analysis, the physician validates the NI probability at the current day of hospitalization (the 6th day of hospitalization for the example presented by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref>). He/She understands the reasons why probability had this specific value. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Knowledge Level</head><p>After acquiring knowledge on the NI occurrence, the physician builds new knowledge through the synergy between the explicit knowledge generated by the VIDSS (through the analysis level and corresponding to the NI occurrence probabilities during the ICU hospitalization stay), and his/her tacit knowledge 6 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(corresponding to the history of the decisions taken based on the previous values of NI occurrence probabilities).</head><p>There is constant back and forth between tacit and explicit modes. Thus appears this virtuous circle: All extracted and validated knowledge is at first explicit, it then becomes tacit to become explicit and to become tacit once again.</p><p>Based on the explicit knowledge at dayi, a set of possible recommendations will be displayed to the physician, who can select a solution or propose another one. It is the main purpose of the performed automatic and visual analysis. These recommendations are generated automatically by the VIDSS based on the following reasoning: 6 Tacit knowledge is intrinsic to each of us and cannot be explicit. According to physicians, experts in nosocomial infections in the Teaching Hospital Habib Bourguiba -Sfax, Tunisia, if the probability of its occurrence is higher than 50%, three possible sampling are always recommended based on the patient state (i.e. PTD Sampling, HC Sampling and ECBU Sampling) for accurate diagnosis. Subsequently, it is important to verify if the probability is lower than 70%, where an Rx Exploration is recommended. If greater than 70% then two other solutions are recommended (antibiotic change and Surgery).</p><p>After validating one or more solution by the physician (decision-maker), the choice will be stored in the database as a historical data for future decision-making task.</p></div>

For this reason, we introduce in this section the theoretical validation of the proposed visual analytics process and the practical validation of the developed prototype using such process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Theoretical validation of the contribution</head><p>The main contribution of this work is the proposed holistic cognitive visual analytics process to design and develop visual intelligent DSS. It is an extension of the existing framework of Keim <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, aspiring to assist decision-makers in transforming extracted patterns (by data mining algorithm(s)) to knowledge and then decision. Usually, in such systems, users think about the efficiency of the data mining results, rather than about their transformation into knowledge/decision.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to design a VIDSS following three levels: (1) patterns level to treat data and apply data mining algorithm(s), (2) analysis level that combines automatic and visual analysis to discover validated and appropriate <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref> knowledge, and (3) Knowledge Level to integrate it in the decision making process. These three levels endeavour to facilitate the whole decisional process in a comprehensive manner. It views such process as cognitive transformation of patterns, evaluation and improvement of resulting knowledge to resolve a decisional problem (Section 3).</p><p>To show that the proposed process contributes to the literature, we classify it in relation to related works, which are (1) the data science <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> the Generic Visual Analytics model by <ref type="bibr">Van Wijk [11]</ref>, (3) the Conventional Visual Analytics Model by Keim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">4</ref>) the knowledge generation model by Sacha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, (5) the knowledge-assisted visual analytics by Federico et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and (6) model building by Andrienko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (cf.

Constructing a DBN starts with the establishment of the important hypothesis to be resolved. The hypothesis H is that the patient was hospitalized in the ICU with a previously calculated NI probability to predict the NI occurrence at each day during the patient hospitalization.</p><p>Hypothesis H represents the DBN's root, which is the ancestor of the remaining nodes of the network. Unconditional probabilities are: P (H = Yes) = 0.5 and P (H = No) = 0.5. The main hypothesis H directly influences five other dependent sub-hypotheses that are events triggered following the hospitalization of the patient in question. The sub-hypotheses (Yes/No states) are:</p><p>H1: The linkage between the hospitalization at day i-1, with a NI occurrence probability Prob i-1, and the infectious examinations at the day i.</p><p>H2: The linkage between the hospitalization at day i-1, with a NI occurrence probability Prob i-1, and act carried out at the day i H3: The linkage between the infectious examinations at the day I, with a NI occurrence probability Prob i-1, and act carried out at the day i H4: The linkage between the hospitalization at day i-1, with a NI occurrence probability Prob i-1, and Antibiotic taken at day i H5: The linkage between act carried out at the day i and Antibiotic taken at day i Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> describes the digital evidence DEi (states: Yes, No and Uncertain) related to the five sub-hypotheses. As there are no occurrences of the 5 sub-hypotheses, common approaches are not sufficient to predict their conditional probability values. For this purpose, an expert, who has more than 15 years of experience, was invited to subjectively assign the probability values produced by this study (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> shows the conditional probability values of the DE given the related sub-hypotheses. The technique of sensitivity value analysis is demonstrated by evaluating the sensitivity of sub-hypothesis H1 (The link connecting the hospitalization at day i-1 and the infectious examinations at the day i) to the likelihood value of evidence DE1 (Patient hospitalized at date i-1 has performed infectious examinations at the day i).</p><p>The analysis of sensitivity value assesses the probability of interest, P(H1|DE1)P(H 1 |DE 1 ), for a variation in the likelihood value of P(DE1|H1). This needs a sensitivity function, which defines P(H1|DE1) in terms of x = P(H 1 |DE 1 ) (cf. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>)). Since P(H 1 ) = 0.5 and 𝑃(𝐷𝐸 1 ∖ 𝐻 1 ̅̅̅̅ ) = 0.2 (from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>), the coefficients of the sensitivity function are: a = 0.5, b = 0, c = 0.5 and d=0.2*0.5=0.1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝑃(𝐻</head><p>The application of the Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">6</ref>), gives the sensitivity value of P(H1|DE1),..., P(H5|DE5) against P(DE1|H1), ..., P(DE5|H5) visible in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>: As presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, if the sensitivity value is less than 1, then a small change in the probability value has a negligible consequence on the hypothesis posterior output. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> describes sensitivity values showing the consequences of small changes in evidence likelihood values on the sub-hypotheses posterior outputs. It is clear that all the sensitivity values are less than 1. Hence, we can conclude that our DBN is robust to small variations in the evidence likelihood values in the elicited conditional probabilities.</p><p>Major headings should be typeset in boldface with the first letter of important words capitalized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Usability evaluation</head><p>Usability evaluation becomes increasingly crucial in the visualization literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. To measure our visual tool usability, we have conducted a usability test with 30 participants. In this study, we have designated 3 groups of participants: novice, knowledge-intermittent and expert. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> shows the summary of user profile involved in the evaluation task. We have conducted this evaluation in three phases:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 1: general feedback</head><p>We have received a general feedback on our tool from the 30 participants. It concerns the fundamental principles of the visual analytics design. Their main suggestions concerned a more clearly graphical representation of edge directionality as well as more simple view transition abilities. We have revised our tool based on these suggestions by making nodes interactive in presenting more information about orientation proposal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 2: experts' feedback</head><p>We have planned a specific interview session integrating the 10 experts. Based on their experience in participating in decisional systems development and taking care of patients, we were expecting to get constructive comments on our tool from an expert's perspective.</p><p>The experts confirmed that: (1) our interactive visual tool provides insight into the evolution of the patient's state in the fight against nosocomial infection, and (2) it would represent a rewarding increment if it were situated as a visual decision-making. They emphasized that there is an increasing request for decisional systems in the medical domain to be improved by automatic and visual analysis, particularly given the complexity of decisionmaking issues and the wide range of data to be analysed. The provided experts' feedback revealed additional assurance of the practical value of our visual tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 3: user study</head><p>In this final evaluation phase, we have conducted a user study. We have adopted the value-driven evaluation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, which is applied in DSS and information visualization literature <ref type="bibr">[50] [51]</ref>. This approach aims at assessing whether a tool was successfully developed and guaranteed integrated fundamental values. We have considered that the participant's verbal response is a part of our tool evaluation. It is a common way to validate our tool's value <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>This user study integrates the participants with the three profiles (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>). In this context, we have developed: (1) specific tasks that articulate several goals of several visual representations, and (2) post-use surveys to evaluate our tool usability in a quantitative way. We have generated a set of questions for assessing our VIDSS tasks' performance based on the evaluation approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Questions are visible in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> presents the tasks that our participants were asked to achieve using our VIDSS prototype and their interaction techniques. We have developed four sets of tasks labelled from T1 to T4. Each set of tasks is relative to the goal of a specific level of our Visual analytics approach.</p><p>T1 required managing the data of the patient, automatically applying the DBN algorithm and generating their visual representations. It is designed to be sure that participants understand the VIDSS structure and objective as well as the visual data mining application. Most participants achieved correctly the T1 subtasks (the score is between 9 and 10). They were able to understand and identify the relationships in the force-directed and bar chart graphs.</p><p>Each of T2, T3 and T4 subtasks attempted to assess the utility of the generated interactive visual representations. Some participants failed at reading confidence and support metrics for the automatic analysis ((T2(1)). This is due to the difficulty of non-data mining experts face in understanding such measures in quantifying the importance of the analysis association. As a matter of fact, it requires several attempts for users to easily assimilate and interpret them.</p><p>The scores for T3(5) and T4(2), show that several participants did not seem to understand how to perform the task based on their tacit knowledge. The reason the scores' value is pretty low is due to the fact that the majority of our participants are not experts in the fight against nosocomial infection (for the three groups). In fact, interpreting the patient's condition or selecting the best decision requires, in addition to our proposed visual and automatic analysis, a specific background and experience in this decisional domain in order to be able to control and question the recommendations generated by the system. Since few of our participants have a good idea on nosocomial infections, the scores for these two tasks are low. Perspectives related to the user experience are planned in future work.</p><p>Finally, T5 requested participants to freely use and explore the VIDSS. We have received a set of comments. In general, the physicians thought that: (1) the visual association rules technique is well selected to give an idea about the NI probability relevance, (2) the force-directed and bar chart graphs indicate clearly the temporal data relationships and simplify the visual analysis of the discovered patterns. By inspecting these visualizations, physicians can easily make comparisons to interpret the evolution of temporal data and patterns and can intuitively detect the recommended solution to fight nosocomial infections (based on his/her tacit knowledge).</p><p>Furthermore, they appreciated the use of interaction modes with the visualization interfaces to focus on what they thought was interesting. While one physician indicated that he/she was not sure about the bar chart graph usefulness, the rest of participants said that this was an interesting visual representation and they liked it.</p><p>A final comment provided by two physicians, who were not sure about using the current VIDSS indicating that they were familiar and satisfied with the traditional system used for 6 years (which allows automatic analysis using Bayesian Networks but not visual analysis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p><p>The others thought that it would positively save time compared to the traditional system. After the evaluation of the tasks' performance, participants have gone to the value-driven evaluation for a post-use survey. They were asked to answer 8 questions based on 5-point Likert scale (1 for "Strongly Disagree" and 5 for "Strongly Agree"). The VIDSS was easy to learn. 2 5 3,6 Q3</p><p>The VIDSS enables discovering insights about the temporal data. 3 5 3,9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q4</head><p>The VIDSS enables asking insightful questions about the temporal data. According to the results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">9</ref>, Participants assigned relatively high scores to VIDSS usability, generated insight about temporal data and tasks completion (Q1, Q3 and Q7). The mean scores to questions Q2, Q4, Q5 and Q6 are between <ref type="bibr">[3,2 -3,8]</ref>, which are all above the middle of the scale. Q8 asked participants to rate the VIDSS. Most physicians gave high scores. The rest of them thought they would not be able to attribute a precise score without using intensively the proposed VIDSS.</p><p>Generally, our VIDSS was very well accepted by users and their feedback suggested that we have a practical basis for deploying this system into real-world settings. Especially in the medical field and due to the fact that one error can cause death, it was vital to combine the expert capability with the automatic analysis <ref type="bibr">[19] [24]</ref> [54] <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Accordingly, we present in this paper the visual analytics process to exhibit the cognitive activities exerted for knowledge generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Decision support systems involve data mining and visualization techniques to combine human intelligence with computational intelligence in order to enhance decision-making quality. Data mining produces automatic patterns extracted from prepared data. Several research works introduced systems for visualizing data, data mining algorithm and extracted patterns.</p><p>Due to this fact, we introduced an adapted visual analytics model for acquiring knowledge behind these patterns to finally generate actionable recommendations for making appropriate decisions. It is a generic design framework that can be applied to different domains of application and to a large class of decision-makers. The proposed process of knowledge generation occurs on three main levels: patterns, analysis and knowledge. It allows to automatically and visually studying the displayed data mining patterns to generated associated knowledge.</p><p>We have applied this process to fight against nosocomial infections in the Intensive Care Unit of the Teaching Hospital Habib Bourguiba -Sfax, Tunisia. We have developed the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique to extract patterns from temporal medical data. These patterns are displayed using interactive force-directed and bar chart graphs to be automatically analysed (using the association rules technique) and visually interpreted (perceived, recognized, comprehended and reasoned) in obtaining associated knowledge.</p><p>We have conducted two evaluation studies: (1) utility evaluation to assess the VIDSS prediction ability and (2) usability evaluation based on three phases (general feedback, experts' feedback and user study). These studies were designed to provide valuable feedback from selected experts. The evaluation results confirm positively the value of the developed VIDSS. Such evaluation reflected the feasibility of the suggested visual analytics process.</p><p>From a managerial perspective, the developed VIDSS suggests several levers of action for ICU physicians who wish to ensure the management of medical files, to improve the continuous monitoring of their patients as well as to minimize the risk of nosocomial infections. Physicians, decision makers and experts in nosocomial infections, can indeed recommend one or more solutions generated by the VIDSS after intelligent and visual analysis of patients' data which would save time and make urgent decisions in real time. This system aims at minimizing the mortality risk of patients caused by these infections. In consequence, patients in ICU are better handled and the reanimation quality is improved.</p><p>From a policy perspective, by using the developed VIDSS, physicians can influence ICU policy making in three ways: (1) they can predict NI mortality risk and thus identify critical problems, (2) analyse the cost-benefit of the action execution and facilitate the development of cost effective action plans, and (3) actively participate in the ICU policy process through the real-time decision making.</p><p>Indeed, our adapted visual analytics model grants knowledge generation for intelligent decision-making. However, our research can be improved by considering the collaboration that must exist between the domain expert and the visual analytics expert. In fact, without domain knowledge, visual analytics experts are able to generate findings and information about the data, not the domain. Domain experts are responsible for formulating problem hypotheses, detecting and interpreting patterns. They must be familiar with visual analytics methods and systems. Likewise, visual analytics experts have to learn about the problem domain. Another limitation is related to history tracking.</p><p>Our model can be enhanced by automatically recording the knowledge exploration process. A possible approach is to capture the actions of the user in order to provide a history. The user can revisit the history for recovery and reversal operations. All these limitations will be considered, in future research, for improving our VIDSS.</p><p>An immediate extension of our study would be to improve our K2 algorithm by proposing a new node-ordering algorithm and introducing a new search method for causality detection. We aim also to apply the proposed visual analytics process to other data mining techniques (such as Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic) and then provide a comparative study between these techniques and our DBN. Another extension would be to develop and integrate other advanced visual representations and interactions in our VIDSS prototype. In addition, we can improve the ARN technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> to produce direct pattern visualization for exhibiting more the relationships between items.</p><p>We also plan to improve our VIDSS by studying its users. It aims at understanding how users think and feel, what they need and want, and why. We propose to use that information to analyse VIDSS users' behaviour and experience in order to enhance their training. Lastly, our current prototype analyses the problem of ICU nosocomial infections. A future study could expand this case study by integrating various hospital services.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
