<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY</head><p>This study aims to determine and analyze the direct and indirect influence of transformational leadership of school principals, work ethic and motivation on the performance of elementary school teachers in Kertak Hanyar District. This study used a quantitative descriptive approach with correlational techniques. The population of the study was 150 teachers in 17 schools. The sample of this study was 110 people. The number of samples was taken using rumus proportional random sampling. The data collection technique that is considered appropriate to obtain data using questionnaires is to use the Likert scale which provides alternative answer choices from a scale of 1 to 5 for data collection of transformational leadership, motivation and work ethic. Each questionnaire of each variable was tested for validity using Correlation Product Moment, as well as reliability using the Cronbach Alpha formula. After this stage, data collection was carried out, valid and reliable instruments were produced from the principal's transformational leadership variables (41 items), work ethic variable instruments (34 items), motivation variable instruments (32 items) and teacher performance variable instruments (24 items). Before hypothesis testing is carried out in order to prove the influence of the principal's transformational leadership, motivation, work ethic and on teacher performance, researchers first conduct a prerequisite test which includes normality tests, linearity tests, and multicollinearity tests. After the prerequisite test of the analyst is declared complete, then proceed to analyze the data of this research using path analysis or Path Analysis. The results showed that there is a direct influence of the principal's transformational leadership, work ethic and motivation on teacher performance, there is an indirect influence of the principal's transformational leadership, work ethic on teacher performance through motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Based on the results of data analysis and using path analysis, direct and indirect relationship coefficients were found. as illustrated below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Path Analysis Model Table 1. Summary of Hypothesis Testing Decisions H1 H2 H3 H4 H5</head><p>Hypothesis p Decision H1 There is a positive and significant influence of transformational leadership on motivation 0.006 Accepted H2 There is a positive and significant influence of work ethic on motivation. 0.006 Accepted H3 There is a positive and significant influence of transformational leadership on teacher performance 0.001 Accepted H4 There is a positive and significant influence of work ethic on teacher performance 0.003 Accepted H5 There is a positive and significant influence of motivation on teacher performance. 0.001 Accepted Based on the results of the analysis in Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> above, in this study managed to find relationships between variables that can be explained as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Direct Relationship of Transformational Leadership to Motivation</head><p>The results of the path analysis show that directly the transformational leadership of the principal has a positive and significant influence on the motivation of teachers at SDN Kertak Hanyar District. This can be seen from the regression coefficient value of the principal transformational leadership variable of 0.352, which means that if the principal's transformational leadership variable increases by 1 point, teacher motivation will increase by 0.352 points. The better ofprincipal's transformational leadership will increase or increase work motivation, and vice versa. Burns <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rinaldi, 2021)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Direct Relationship of Work Ethic to Motivation</head><p>The results showed that work ethic directly had a positive and significant effect on teacher motivation in Kertak Hanyar District. This can be seen from the value of the regression coefficient of the work ethic variable of 0.351, which means that if the work ethic variable increases by 1 point, work motivation will increase by 0.351 points. So the better the teacher's work ethic will increase or increase motivation, and vice versa. Motivation and work ethic are a unity that functions to realize and achieve in each individual in his job role. Teachers with a good work ethic will be seen in behavior in teaching activities. This good work ethic will be reflected in an attitude of responsibility, honesty, integrity, being able to work together. The attitude that teachers have for their ability to carry out tasks is based on a willingness to improve results, a willingness to develop themselves and morale, and oriented towards improving quality and efficiency as a teacher. Motivation is an obvious part of the high work ethic of a teacher. This research is in line with the results of research (Pratiwi, Wahyu: 2022) stating that there is a significant contribution of work ethic to motivation, meaning that the higher the work ethic variable will increase motivation, in line with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rinaldi, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Direct Relationship of Transformational Leadership to Performance</head><p>The results of the path analysis show that the transformational leadership of the principal directly has a positive and significant influence on teacher performance in Kertak Hanyar District. This indicates that to be able to improve the performance of elementary school teachers in Kertak Hanyar District, it can be pursued by increasing the transformational leadership of the principal, as seen from the regression coefficient value of the principal transformational leadership variable of 0.201, showing that the principal's transformational leadership variable increases by 1 point, then teacher performance will increase by 0.201 points.</p><p>Seeing the results of research on the influence of transformational leadership of school principals on teacher performance which is quite high significantly, this confirms that the figure of a leader is very influential on the performance of his subordinates on their work. The findings of this study are in line with research (Rachmat, Aslamiah, 2022; Mahdiana, Saleh.,2022) states that leadership affects teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Direct Relationship of Work Ethic to Teacher Performance</head><p>The results of the path analysis show that work ethic directly has a positive and significant influence on teacher performance in Kertak Hanyar District, which is 0.247. This can be seen from the value of the regression coefficient of the work ethic variable of 0.247, which means that if the work ethic variable increases by 1 point, teacher performance will increase by 0.247 points.</p><p>According to Anogara (2014: 31) explained that work ethic is the view and attitude of a nation or people towards work. If individuals in the community view work as a noble thing for human existence, then their work ethic will tend to be high. Conversely, attitudes and views towards work as something of low value for life, then the work ethic will naturally be low, so the better the teacher's work ethic will increase or improve teacher performance, and vice versa. This research is strengthened by research (Pratiwi, Wahyu, 2022; Sunaryo, 2021) stated that there is an influence of work ethic on teacher performance, so that the higher the work ethic will improve teacher performance with the environment. These learning activities foster new ideas and ideas from students</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Direct Relationship of Motivation to Teacher Performance</head><p>The results of the path analysis show that work motivation directly has a positive and significant influence on the performance of elementary school teachers in Kertak Hanyar District. This can be seen from the value of the regression coefficient of the work motivation variable of 0.378, which means that if the work motivation variable increases by 1 point, teacher performance will</p><p>The Effect of Transformational Leadership, Motivation, Work Ethic with Teacher Performance at Public Elementary School in Kertak Hanyar District, Banjar Regency increase by 0.378 points. So the better the teacher's work motivation will increase or improve teacher performance, and vice versa. Thus, motivation is seen as a motor that generates energy in a person and with that energy a person can do something. To optimize the achievement of performance owned by employees need leader support in its implementation, one of which is by providing motivation to teachers, so that teachers can improve their abilities as desired by the leader, so that their performance will increase, in accordance with the goals of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pradana, et al, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ali, 2020)</ref> said that work motivation affects teacher performance. This research is in line with research (Vienna, Sulaiman, 2022) stating that motivation has a significant direct influence and there is a positive correlation with teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Indirect Relationship of Transformational Leadership to Teacher Performance, Through Motivation</head><p>The results showed that indirectly the transformational leadership of the principal had a positive and significant influence on the performance of teachers of SDN Kertak Hanyar District. This can be seen from the regression coefficient value of the principal transformational leadership variable of 0.133, which means that if the principal's transformational leadership variable increases by 1 point, teacher work motivation will increase by 0.133 points. Burns <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rinaldi, 2021)</ref> describes transformational leadership as a process in which leaders and followers elevate each other to higher levels of morality and motivation. Transformational leadership can improve teacher performance, by generating an educator's motivation to achieve the best results in his work.</p><p>Transformational leadership can improve teacher performance, by generating an educator's motivation to achieve the best results for his work. This is in line with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kusrini., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rifki, 2022)</ref> which states that the transformational leadership of school principals affects teacher performance through motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Indirect Relationship of Work Ethic to Teacher Performance through Motivation</head><p>The results showed that indirectly work ethic has a positive and significant influence on teacher performance through work motivation The indirect relationship of transformational leadership of school principals through teacher work motivation with teacher performance at SDN Kertak Hanyar, Banjar Regency seen from the magnitude of the value of the indirect relationship between work ethic variables and teacher performance through work motivation variables is 0.133. The value indicates that the value is positive, meaning that there is a positive relationship from the variable. Teacher performance is a work effort made to be carried out efficiently and effectively and achieve the goals that have been set. A teacher's work ethic will be even greater if he understands and understands his goals as an educator. Darodjat (2015) states that someone who has a high work ethic will be seen from his work motivation, future orientation, seriousness in work, hard work and respect for time, discipline in work, responsible, thrifty and simple, diligent and tenacious. Coupled with his desire to get an award for the best things given, thus motivating and improving the quality of his work to achieve good performance. That way the quality of a person's performance will greatly affect the results of his work. Based on the explanation above, it is suspected that there is a positive influence between work ethic on teacher performance through motivation. This opinion is in line with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rinaldi, 2021 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rifki, 2022</ref>) stated that work ethic can affect teacher performance with intermediate variables, namely work motivation.</p></div>
