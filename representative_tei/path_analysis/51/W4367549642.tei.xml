<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The soil freeze-thaw cycle in the permafrost regions has a significant impact on regional surface energy and water balance. Although increasing efforts have been made to understand the responses of spring thawing to climate change, the mechanisms controlling the global interannual variability of the start date of permafrost freezing (SOF) remain unclear. Using long-term satellite observations of SOF between 1979-2020, and analytical techniques, including partial correlation, ridge regression, structural equation modelling (SEM), and machine learning, we explored the responses of SOF to multiple climate change factors, including warming (skin and air temperature), start date of permafrost thawing (SOT), soil properties (soil temperature and volume of water), and the snow depth water equivalent (SDWE). Overall, climate warming exhibited the maximum control on SOF, but SOT in spring was also an important driver of SOF variability; among the 65.9% significant SOT and SOF correlations, 79.3% were positive, indicating an overall earlier thawing. The machine learning analysis also suggested that apart from warming, SOT ranked as the second most important determinant of SOF. Therefore, we identified the mechanism responsible for the SOT-SOF relationship, and SEM analysis revealed that soil temperature change exhibited the maximum effect on this relationship, irrespective of the permafrost type. Finally, we analysed the temporal changes in these responses using the moving window approach and found increased effect of soil warming on SOF. Therefore, these results provide important insights into understanding and predicting SOF variations with future climate change.</p></div>

The soil freeze-thaw cycle has significantly changed due to permafrost degradation, which has impacted the surface energy and water balance by influencing the hydrothermal properties of the soil; therefore, it has been considered as an indicator of the interactions between permafrost and climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Smith et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Permafrost thawing triggers emission of soil organic carbon (SOC), which accelerates global warming and impacts soil nutrients, river flow, and vegetation productivity <ref type="bibr">(Grosse et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Olefeldt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Liu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rößger et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the impact of climate change on the start date of permafrost thawing (SOT) in spring <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chen et al., 2022)</ref>, based on the importance of SOT in characterising land surface change and its effect on climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Miner et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Domine et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, permafrost thawing causes a significant decline in water level, which could restructure the regional energy balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Webb, et al., 2022)</ref>. However, compared to the data on available on spring thawing, the start date of permafrost freezing (SOF) has not been substantially investigated. Therefore, research on SOF as an important permafrost-related factor will help in the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms and factors causing permafrost degradation. Moreover, the link between vegetation growth and SOF suggests that SOF plays an important role in bridging climate change and carbon uptake by the permafrost regions <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2022b)</ref>. Therefore, to understand the impact of climate change on SOF on the permafrost regions of the northern hemisphere, we used long-term satellite-observed SOF data between 1979-2020 and data pertaining to various climate change variables, including skin temperature (Tskin), air temperature (Tair), SOT, soil temperature (Tsoil), volume of water in soil (SWV), and the snow depth water equivalent (SDWE), to comprehensively analyse the response of SOF to climate change over the past four decades. The key objectives of our study were (1) to understand the impacts of climate change on the interannual variability of SOF;</p><p>(2) to explore potential carry-over effects between thawing and freezing and their mechanisms; and (3) to analyse the temporal evolution of the strength of these climate change factors on SOF variability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Spatial and temporal patterns of SOF</head><p>We observed spatial variations in SOF over northern lands, with 75% SOFs ranging between day of year (DOY) 260 and 290 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4a</ref>). SOFs earlier than DOY 260 were observed in the northern Tibetan Plateau, whereas SOFs later than DOY 290 were mostly found in the boreal regions of Canada. Overall, the regions with earlier SOFs exhibited smaller standard deviations (SD). For example, large areas in Eurasia with an SOF between DOY 260-280 exhibited a lower SD of &lt;15 days (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4b</ref>). Moreover, 7.7% of the region exhibited significantly delayed SOF dates, whereas 8.6% of the region exhibited earlier SOFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4c</ref>). Nevertheless, high-latitude permafrost regions exhibited delayed SOFs over the past four decades.</p><p>We also analysed climate change factors from to 1979-2020 and found warming in all permafrost regions analysed in this study based on significant increase in both Tskin (59.2%) and Tair (67.4%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4d-e</ref>). However, 91.8% of all regions exhibited earlier SOT, among which data for 66.1% regions were significant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4f</ref>). Moreover, Tsoil significantly increased in 70.5% of the regions that underwent significant soil warming (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4g</ref>). The SWV exhibited an overall declining trend, with significant proportions for negative and positive trends of 16.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Similar results were observed for SDWE; 19.2% of the regions exhibited significant decrease in SDWE, whereas 4.7% of the regions exhibited an increasing trend (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4i</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Relationship between SOF and climate change</head><p>We elucidated the relationships between SOF and climate factors using partial correlation analysis and found that Tskin was negatively correlated with SOF, and among the 89.3% negative correlations, 77.8% were significant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5a</ref>). However, Tair was positively correlated with SOF (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5b</ref>). An overall positive correlation was also observed between SOT and SOF; 52.3% (out of 72.3%) of the regions exhibited a significant positive relationship between SOT and SOF (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5c</ref>). Significant positive correlations were also found between SOF and Tsoil, but both SWV and SDWE were negatively correlated with SOF (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5d-f</ref>). We also determined the sensitivity of SOF to these factors using ridge regression analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5 g-l</ref>). The signs of the sensitivity values were consistent with those obtained through partial correlation analysis. For example, the slopes of the SOT-Tskin correlations were mostly negative, whereas an increase in Tair implied a later SOF, as shown by a positive sensitivity value. Moreover, we used machine learning techniques and found that Tskin-dominated SOF changed in 42% of the areas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5m</ref>). However, SOT was the second-most important determinant of SOF;</p><p>SWV exhibited the least effect on SOF among all variables. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Underlying mechanisms of the correlation between SOT and SOF</head><p>We used structural equation modelling (SEM) path analysis to elucidate the underlying reasons for the correlation between SOT and SOF in different permafrost types to elucidate the changes expected in SOF in the future (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>). We found that among the four paths through which SOT can be connected to SOF, the most important path was the positive correlation of SOT with Tsoil, and because Tsoil was positively correlated with SOF, SOT was positively correlated with SOF. These linkages were dominant in all paths and were independent of the permafrost type. Although changes in SWV explained changes in SOF, the overall impact of this path was minor. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Temporal changes in the response of SOF to climate change</head><p>We further analysed the temporal trends in the effect of these factors on SOF and changes in their sensitivity towards SOF (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>). Overall, we found divergent patterns among (66.7%) regions where Tskin had a significant impact on SOF and 33.9% regions exhibited increased effect of Tskin; this proportion is comparable with that of the regions with reduced effect of Tskin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7a</ref>). Most of the regions exhibiting enhanced control of warming were located in the highlands of Eurasia (e.g. Siberia), whereas mid-latitude regions exhibited weakened control. Similar results were observed for Tair, SOT, SWV, and SDWE, but the proportion of the regions where these factors exhibited enhanced and weakened control varied. For example, Tair exhibited enhanced control of SOF in 34.8% of permafrost regions and 31.7% of counterparts. However, we found that the overall Tsoil exhibited increased control over SOF, and among the 67.2% of regions where Tsoil trends were significant, 42.8% exhibited enhanced control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7d</ref>). We further grouped the enhanced/weakened trends by permafrost type (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>). We found that most of these factors, including Tskin, Tair, Tsoil, and SWV, exhibited enhanced control on SOF for continuous permafrost, whereas SOT and SDWE exhibited the opposite effect. For the other three types (discontinuous, isolated, and sporadic), weakened control was more evident. However, Tsoil was an exception, as it exhibited enhanced control in case of all permafrost types.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The timing of freezing represents a significant transition of the status of permafrost soil, and changes in the frozen/thawing processes significantly influence the hydrothermal properties of the soil, resulting in significant changes in the surface energy and water balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Guo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Smith et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Webb et al., 2023)</ref>. Previous studies have reported that permafrost thawing is highly sensitive to climate change, with far-reaching implications on regional climate and vegetation that can mitigate or amplify permafrost thawing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jafarov et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Polvani et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heijmans et al., 2022)</ref>. Here, we elucidated the impacts of climate change factors on SOF in late autumn and winter, which has received much less attention than spring thawing in previous studies. We found that that the proportion of regions with significantly delayed and advanced SOF was comparable (8.6% vs. 7.7%, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4c</ref>), but with clear spatial distribution. Delayed SOF was mostly observed in the highlands and the Tibetan Plateau, i.e. in areas with more pronounced warming, whereas earlier SOF was observed in the western boreal regions of Canada. Several climate change indicators were analysed in this study, which exhibited substantial impacts on SOF variability. These results contribute to a better understanding of permafrost change, given that the timing of freezing could impact snow-related soil warming in winter through biogeophysical feedbacks, such as changes in albedo and soil moisture <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2022b)</ref>; this could cause uncertainty in the evaluation of consequences of thaw-related disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Heijmans et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, SOF responded differently to these climate factors, and complicated patterns were observed; besides warming, other environmental cues (e.g. SWC, soil temperature) could also be responsible for SOF variability in the changing climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Guo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Koven et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Global warming is the main driver of permafrost change, as it deepens the thickness of the active layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Peng et al., 2018)</ref> and collapses the ground or thermokarst <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Farquharson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Turetsky et al., 2020)</ref>. Our results confirm the importance of global warming, as per the sensitivity of SOF to Tskin. Moreover, we identified the importance of SOT in regulating SOF variability. The overall positive correlation between SOF and SOT implies that an earlier thawing in spring could be associated with an earlier timing of freezing. These carry-over effects have been reported in previous phenological analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shen et al., 2022)</ref>; in accordance with these results, we observed a linkage between the thawing/frozen phenology of permafrost, which will be useful to obtain a comprehensive view of permafrost degradation. Using machine learning analysis, we found that SOT in spring was ranked as the second most important driver of SOF in the later years (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5m</ref>), and this linkage can be explained by the changes in soil temperature, using the SEM path analysis for all permafrost types. Although the specific mechanism underlying this correlation is unclear, these results support previous reports on the importance of complex soil hydrothermal processes underlying permafrost degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lawrence et al., 2005)</ref>. Moreover, the positive correlation between SOT and SOF established in this study demonstrates that freezing/thawing cycle of a permafrost region can be understood based on soil warming and moisture changes throughout the year (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>). Moreover, we observed increased effect of SOT on SOF at mid-low latitudes, where warming might not be that strong compared with highlands. This is important because mid-low latitude ecosystems have larger productivity, and including the SOT-SOF correlation could be useful in understanding the interaction between permafrost degradation and vegetation change.</p><p>We further identified the temporal evolution of the effects of different climate change factors on SOF variability; this will provide insights into the sensitivity of SOF to future climate change, although our current prediction of future scenarios regarding permafrost degradation could be biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Webb and Liljedahl, 2023)</ref>. We found differential changes in the sensitivity of SOF to most factors, but the differences were spatially distributed. Moreover, we observed a consistently increased control of Tsoil on SOF, indicating an urgent need to investigate soil warming trends with respect to future climate change. Since warmer soil delays SOF (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5d</ref>), the enhanced effect of Tsoil on SOF could aggravate later freezing and accelerate permafrost degradation in the future. Our results are in line with the reported fast response of cold ice-rich permafrost to global warming <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nitzbon et al., 2020)</ref>, considering that the enhanced regions are more in continuous permafrost (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8d</ref>). Moreover, future studies should characterise soil types <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fisher et al., 2016)</ref>, soil nutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mao et al., 2020)</ref>, and soil age <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tanentzap et al., 2021)</ref> to understand permafrost degradation under a changing climate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4 Spatial and temporal patterns of the start date of permafrost freezing (SOF)</figDesc><graphic coords="7,95.08,76.20,405.10,365.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
