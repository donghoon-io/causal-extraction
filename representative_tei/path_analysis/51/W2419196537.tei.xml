El conocimiento de la relación entre aspectos fenotípicos y genotípicos de la producción y sus componentes es un paso importante para desarrollar criterios de selección en ambientes con estrés hídrico. Con el objetivo de conocer la utilidad de algunas variables agronómicas como indicadores del rendimiento de grano se evaluó 18 genotipos bajo condiciones de estrés hídrico inducido en tres etapas de crecimiento manteniendo un control positivo irrigado durante las estaciones de cultivo 2006/07. Los tratamientos de estrés hídrico fueron de la siembra a la madurez fisiológica (M1), de la floración a la madurez fisiológica (M2) y del llenado del grano a la madurez fisiológica (M3). .Los niveles de agua se mantuvieron en el rango de 35 a 50% de la capacidad de campo para los tratamientos de estrés hídrico y arriba del 75% para el control. El índice de cosecha y llenado de grano estuvo positivamente asociado con el rendimiento de grano en todos los tratamientos y el número de granos por espiga y la biomasa aérea estuvieron asociados con el rendimiento del grano en tratamientos con estrés hídrico. La tasa de llenado de grano y el período de llenado tuvieron un efecto positivo directo en el rendimiento en condiciones de estrés continuo de la siembra a la madurez, así como en condiciones de riego suficiente (control). La biomasa aérea y el índice de cosecha tuvieron un efecto positivo directo en el rendimiento en condiciones de estrés de la floración a la madurez. De manera similar, la tasa de llenado y el índice de cosecha tuvieron un efecto positivo directo en rendimiento, mientras que la biomasa y el número de granos por espiga tuvieron un efecto positivo indirecto en el rendimiento de grano en condiciones de estrés del llenado de grano a la madurez. Por lo tanto, la selección para mayor tasa de llenado de grano, períodos de llenado de grano más largos en condiciones de aporte óptimo de humedad a estrés severo en contraste con mayor biomasa, índice de cosecha y número de granos por espiga son los indicares para un mayor rendimiento del trigo durum en condiciones de estrés hídrico moderado.</p><p>Palabras clave: trigo durum; estrés hídrico; tasa de llenado de grano.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Both bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. durum) are widely cultivated in Ethiopia. The total area for both crops is about 1.685 million hectares with a corresponding production of 3.08 million tons annually <ref type="bibr">(CSA, 2010)</ref>. Durum wheat is an indigenous crop with a wide genetic diversity in the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hailu et al, 1991)</ref>. It occupies 40% of the total wheat area and the country is one of the largest producers of durum wheat in sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr">(Efrem et al. 2000)</ref>. However, the bulk of durum wheat is produced under rainfed condition, often in places where rainfall is infrequent in distribution and scarce during the grainfilling period. The random variations of rainfall from year to year and across locations in Ethiopia usually affect crop yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Simane et al., 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Deselegn et al., 2001)</ref>. Selection of wheat genotypes with better adaptation to water stress increases the productivity of rainfed wheat <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Rajaram, 2001)</ref>. Selection for yield under drought stress conditions is, however, complicated by low heritability and large genotypeenvironment interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(van Oosterom et al, 1993)</ref>. This interaction can occur as a consequence of differential responses by genotypes to yearly variation in quantity of rainfall or its distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(van Ginkel et al., 1998)</ref> and thus, it limits the breeding efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ceccarelli et al., 2000)</ref>. The efficiency of a breeding program, therefore, can be increased by selection for traits associated with performance under stress, which are less prone to show significant genotype x environment interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gonzalez et al., 2007)</ref>. Phenological and agronomic characteristics are generally attractive to breeders because they are easy and cheap to measure.</p><p>In environmental conditions that are characterized by exposing plant growth to drought developing increasingly during the late reproductive and grainfilling phases, the natural outcome of breeding for adaptation has been the selection for earliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Loss et al., 1994)</ref>. The duration of grain filling and the growth cycle also contribute greatly to wheat yield under these conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Simane et al., 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Gracia del Moral et al., 2003)</ref>. Increase in crop biomass contributes to the improvement of cereal yield under water stress conditions. At grain filling stage, a proportion of this biomass is available to the grain development <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Shakhatreh et al., 2001)</ref>. It is also desirable that this proportion is high to obtain better yields and a higher harvest index <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Siddique et al., 1989)</ref>. Harvest index also depends on the availability of water during grain filling and the partitioning of carbohydrates that stored before anthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Richards et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>For improvement in yield, study of yield contributing components in respect of their genetic mechanism is very important. Information regarding genotypic and phenotypic correlations between quantitatively inherited plant characters and their direct and indirect effects on grain yield as a result of varietal response proved to be a useful tool for increasing the yield per unit area through selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Khan et al., 2010)</ref>. However, there is little information that shows the relationship between grain yield and its various components of the Ethiopian durum wheat genotypes under different water stress conditions. This experiment was, therefore, conducted to determine the direct and indirect relationship between yield and different traits of durum wheat genotypes that have different origin under different water supply conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plating materials and design</head><p>The study was conducted in a lathhouse at Sinana Agricultural Research Center (SARC) during the 2006/07 main season. It is located at 7° 7'N latitude, 40° 10' E longitude and 2400 m.a.s.l altitude in Bale Zone of Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Eighteen durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. durum) genotypes consisting landraces [B5-5B, S-17B, and WA-13], commercial cultivars <ref type="bibr">[Asassa,</ref><ref type="bibr">Bekelcha,</ref><ref type="bibr">Boohai,</ref><ref type="bibr">Egersa,</ref><ref type="bibr">Foka,</ref><ref type="bibr">Gerardo,</ref><ref type="bibr">Ilani,</ref><ref type="bibr">Kilinto,</ref><ref type="bibr">Obsa,</ref><ref type="bibr">Oda,</ref><ref type="bibr">Quamy,</ref> and advanced lines from the breeding program <ref type="bibr">[CDSS93Y107 and CD94523]</ref> were used for this study. Plants were grown in 21 cm diameter and 18 cm length plastic pots filled with a textural class of clay (49.7% clay, 27.3% silt and 23% sand). Each pot was filled with 4 kg uniformly airdried soil (17.1% moisture). The field capacity and permanent wilting point of the soil were 47.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Pots were arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) in factorial combination of the eighteen genotypes and four water regimes with three replications. A total of 216 pots, 12 pots were assigned to each genotype. 2g N and 2 g P2O5 fertilizers were applied to each pot during planting and additional 0.5 g N was applied at the first tillering. Planting was done on August 10, 2006. Eight seeds were sown per pot and the seedlings were thinned to four at two leaf growth stages. Five hundred ml of water was added to each pot every other day for a period of a month until the plants reach four leaf growth stages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Water Stress Treatment</head><p>Following the Zadock's scale <ref type="bibr">(Zadoks et al., 1974)</ref>, plants were subjected to water stress at different growth stages: stress continuously from tillering to physiological maturity (M1), stress from anthesis to physiological maturity (M2), and stress from grainfilling stage to physiological maturity (M3) and wellwatered control (C) treatments. The water levels were maintained in the range of 35-50% field capacity in the stress treatments while above 75% in the control treatment. These water stress conditions are designed to simulate the environments that experience very low water supply after crop establishment in different parts of the country. During the stress period, plants were left without water for 12 days by withholding irrigation until early morning wilting is observed. Then pots were weighted and irrigated until the weight of every pot became equal to the weight of the predetermined water level. The amount of water depleted from pots was obtained by weighing pots every two to three days, and the loss in weight was restored by watering pots with the amount of water equal to the loss in weight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Analysis</head><p>Data were collected for mature plant height (cm), days to heading (DH) (when spike completely emerged from the flag leaf ligule) and days to physiological maturity (DM) (when the entire plant turns to yellow). The length of vegetative period (VP) was calculated as days from sowing to anthesis (growth stage 65 according to <ref type="bibr">Zadoks et al. (1974)</ref>. Duration of grain filling period (GFP) was considered to be the days from anthesis to physiological maturity (growth stage 91). Grain-filling rate (GFR) was determined as the ratio of final dry grain yield (mg/plant) to the duration of grain-filling period.</p><p>Data were also collected for number of kernels per spike, 100 kernel weight, spike length, air-dried aboveground biomass and grain yield per plant. Harvest index was determined as the proportion of grain yield to the overall aboveground biomass per plant.</p><p>Linear correlation and stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between grain yield and yield components and their relative contribution in predicting the grain yield of durum wheat genotypes under different water regimes, respectively. Path coefficient analysis was also performed to partition the correlation coefficient into direct and indirect effects of component character on grain yield as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dewey and Lu (1959)</ref>. Sets of simultaneous equations were used to calculate the direct and indirect effects of traits based on the crop ontogeny for the following characters using a method described by Gracia del Moral et al ( <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) :</p><p>(1) duration of vegetative period (VP), (2) duration of grain filling period (GFP), (3) biomass yield (BY), (4) harvest index (HI), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) number of kernel per spike (KS), (6) kernel weight (KW) , ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) grain-filling rate (GFR) and (8) grain yield (GY). r58= P58 + r57P78 + r56P68 r78= r57P58 + P78 + r76P68 r68= r56P58 +r76P78 +P68 r56=P56 + r52P26 + r57P76 r26=r52P56 + P26 + r27P76 r76= r57P56 +r27P26 +P76 r17=P17 +r15P57 +r12P27 r57=r15P17 +P57 + r52P27 r27=r13P17 + r52P57 + P27 r12= P12 + r15P52 r52= r15P12 + P52</p><p>In equation: r12= P12 + r15P52, P12 = direct effect of character 1 on 2 (path coefficient) r15P52 = indirect effect of character 1 on 2 via 5. Similar definitions apply to other equations. The causal system assumed was based on the ontogeny of the cereal plant, and it is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation studies</head><p>The Pearson correlation coefficients between grain yield and the major yield components under different water stress treatments are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Although the correlation coefficients were nonsignificant, days to heading, days to maturity and vegetative period were negatively correlated with grain yield under all water treatments. The negative association between grain yield and days to heading and maturity indicates the importance of earliness under water deficit condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gonzalez et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, Solomon et al., 2003a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Slafer et al. (2005)</ref> stated that selection for earliness has two important consequences on the physiology of cereal yields: first, it increases the likelihood to escape drought, and second, it improves the partitioning of the total water used by the crop actually absorbed and transpired after anthesis.</p><p>Grain yield showed a positive significant correlation with plant height under water stress from tillering to crop maturity, which suggests that under this condition the yield depends on the achievement of better vegetative development and larger stem reserve mobilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Khan et al., 2010)</ref>. However, the correlations were negative and non significant under late stress and well-watered conditions because of the fact that stress were induced when plant approached to its maximum growth. Spike length showed positive but non-significant correlation with grain yield across all water regimes. Number of kernel per spike and aboveground biomass were positively significantly correlated with grain yield under all water stress treatments while harvest index and grain-filling rate were positively associated with grain yield under all the water regimes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). Several authors also reported the positive correlations between grain yield and spike length <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Villegas et al., 2007)</ref>, grain yield and kernel weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Simane et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Leilah et al., 2005)</ref> and number of kernels per spike and grain yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Simane et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gracia del Moral et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Slafer et al., 2005)</ref>. Such positive relationship between number of kernels and grain yield seems to be derived from the fact that grain yield in wheat is frequently sink limited <ref type="bibr">(Slafer et al., 2005)</ref>, and for this reason, the number of kernels per spike has been reported as a promising trait in increasing wheat grain yield, especially under drought conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Simane, et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dencic et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Slafer et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Positive and significant associations were noted between aboveground biomass and grain yield and between harvest index and grain yield per plant under all water stress treatments. This result agrees with the previous findings of several researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Simane et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Elias, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Solomon et al., 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Misra et al., 2006)</ref>. The significant correlation between grain yield and biomass is expected under water deficit conditions because assimilates are available to the grain development through dry matter re-allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Shakhatreh, et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Grain yield under continuous stress from tillering to crop maturity (M1) was not strongly correlated with the grain yield in the M2 (r = 0.37), M3 (r = 0.09) and C (r = 0.12) treatments. On the other hand, a positive and significant relationship (r = 0.69; p &lt;0.01) was noticed between the grain yield of mild-stressed (M3) with that of the grain yield of the control treatment. The lack of correlation between the grain yield under continuous stress from tillering up to crop maturity with that of the grain yield recorded under late-season stress and well-watered treatments indicated that specific adaptation strategy is employed by studied genotypes.</p><p>This result suggested that different breeding strategy will be followed for durum wheat improvement under severe water stress, mild-stressed and non-stressed environmental conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ceccarelli et al. (1987)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ceccarelli and Grando (1991)</ref> indicated that progress in yield and adaptation in drought-affected environments can be achieved only by selecting genotypes under prevailing conditions in the target environments. On the other hand, a positive and significant relationship noticed between the grain yield of late-stress treatments with that of the grain yield of the control treatment indicates the possibility of selecting superior genotypes under favorable condition that could give relatively high yield under terminal stressed environments. This supports the ideas of van Ginkel et al. (1998)], <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Araus et al. (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Richards (2000)</ref> and that selection for yield under near optimum condition would be acceptable method for selecting crops grown under mild-moisture stress conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path coefficient and stepwise regression</head><p>The phenotypic correlation coefficients and the relative contribution (partial and cumulative R2) of selected yield components in predicting the yield of durum wheat genotypes under different water stress treatments are given in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, 4 and 5. Results of path analysis at phenotypic level in the M1 treatment showed that grain-filling rate (0.818) and grain-filling period (0.227) had high positive direct effects on grain yield per plant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). The highest positive indirect effect on grain yield was observed from number of kernels per spike via grain-filling rate (0.701) followed by kernel weight and biomass via grain-filling rate. Similarly, the genotypic path indicated that grain-filling rate followed by grainfilling period had maximum positive direct effect on grain yield (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). Kernel number per spike, biomass yield and harvest index had maximum positive indirect effect on grain yield via grain-filling rate. This result shows that selection of genotypes with high grain-filling rate and relatively longer grain-filling period would increase grain yield in durum wheat under limited water supply condition from tillering to crop maturity. Grain filling period is an important trait in wheat that ultimately affects the overall grain yield by increasing seed weight and used as selection criteria in wheat breeding program <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Masood et al., 2005)</ref>. However, in terminal waterstressed environment, it would be better to select for high grain-filling rate rather than longer grain-filling period since the latter is more subjected to the influence of environmental conditions such as high temperature that could prematurely stop grain growth and accelerate physiological maturity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gonzalez et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Maximum positive phenotypic direct effect on grain yield was exerted by aboveground biomass (0.438) followed by harvest index (0.371) in the M2 treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). However, grain filling rate and kernel number per spike exerted the maximum positive indirect effect on grain yield per plant via biomass yield and HI. Genotypic path also indicated that biomass yield followed by harvest index and grain-filling rate had maximum positive direct effect on grain yield per plant. Maximum positive indirect effects were also exerted by grain-filling rate and number of kernel per spike via biomass and harvest index (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). These traits are also showed positive relationship with grain yield and thus direct selection for higher biomass and harvest index would be helpful to increase yield under water stress that started from flowering periods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reynolds et al. (2007)</ref> have also established the importance of total biomass for the yield increase in wheat especially under drought stress conditions. A higher biomass production under drought stress conditions, particularly during grain filling period, would have an advantage because the translocation of assimilates from the vegetative parts of a plant to seeds contribute significantly to yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Royo et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Pearson correlation coefficients of grain yield with different pheno-agronomic characters of durum wheat genotypes grown under water stress induced at three growth stages and well-watered condition.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> Grain-filling rate followed by biomass yield and grain-filling period exerted the highest positive direct effect on grain yield per plant in the M3 treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). While the highest positive indirect effect was exerted on grain yield by aboveground biomass and harvest index via grain-filling rate (0.513).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characters</head><p>Kernel number per spike also exerted high indirect effect on grain yield through grain filling rate (0.311) and HI (0.136). The highest genotypic direct effect on grain yield was observed from grain-filling rate followed by biomass and harvest index. Grain-filling rate and number of kernel per spike had relatively higher genotypic indirect effect on grain yield via harvest index as compared to the rest of the traits considered (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>).</p><p>Similarly, grain filling rate (0.672) and grain filling period (0.346) had maximum positive phenotypic direct effect on grain yield of wheat under wellwatered condition (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). HI followed by aboveground biomass also exerted maximum positive indirect effects on grain yield through grain-filling rate. On the other hand, genotypic path indicated that harvest index followed by grain-filling rate, biomass and grain filling period had the maximum direct effect on grain yield (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). As the direct effect as well as the correlation is positive, therefore, direct selection for higher grain filling rate, higher harvest index, biomass yield and longer grain filling period is recommended for obtaining higher yield under moderate water supply environments. The total biomass production and the proportion of the biomass allocated to the grains (HI) determine the final grain yield in wheat <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Royo et al., 2000)</ref>. The grain weight is also determined by the rate at which the grain accumulates the dry matter and the duration over which it occurs <ref type="bibr">(Villegas et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Phenotypic residual= 0.0040 and genotypic residual= 0.0013 b Symbols are the same as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> Stepwise regression analysis revealed that 99.2% of the total grain yield variation was explained by grainfilling rate (92.2%) and grain-filling period (7%) under continuous water stress from tillering to crop maturity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>). As shown from the same table, grain-filling rate together with grain filling period explained more than 95% of the grain yield variation of the tested genotypes across water regimes. This shows that these two traits are the major yield determining parameters of durum wheat across different water supply environments, and can be used as suitable selection criteria for improving the grain yield of durum wheat in different water supply environments. The contribution of grain-filling period to the total grain yield variation increased relatively as the moisture availability increased. Therefore, selection of genotypes with longer grain-filling duration would increase grain yield under mild-water stressed conditions. The positive effect of long grainfilling period on grain yield has been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Simane et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Royo et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Villegas et al., 2005)</ref>. Longer grain-filling period allows high accumulation of assimilates into the grain, which results in heavier kernels and higher yields. Nevertheless, longer grain-filling period should increase grain yield, provided that the later stages of grain filling do not occur under terminal drought stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gebeyehu et al., 1982)</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Therefore, selection for high grain filling rate and longer grain filling period under optimal moisture supply to severe water stress environments and higher biomass yield, harvest index and large kernels per spike are expected to improve the yield of durum wheat under moderate water stress environments. These traits, thus, can be used as indirect selection criteria for higher grain yield of durum wheat under different water supply environments.Zadocks, J.C., Chang T.T, Konzak C.F. 1974.
