<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Three relationships between learning mathematics and general cognitive ability have been hypothesised: the educational hypothesis that learning mathematics develops general cognitive skills, the psychometric hypothesis that differences in general cognitive ability cause differences in mathematical attainment, and the reciprocal influence hypothesis that developments in mathematical ability and general cognitive ability influence each other.</p><p>These hypotheses are assessed with a sample of 948 children from the Twins Early Development Study who were assessed at 7, 9, and 10 years on mathematics, English and general cognitive ability. A cross-lagged path analysis with mathematics and general cognitive ability measures supports the reciprocal influence hypothesis between 7 and 9 and between 9 and 10. A second analysis including English assessments only provides evidence of a reciprocal relationship between 7 and 9.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The relations between learning mathematics and general cognitive ability in primary school Children develop considerably in mathematical knowledge and skills and general cognitive ability during their time in primary school. Classical educational theory asserts the influence of what they learn on how they think: mathematics learning is supposed to develop reasoning and problem-solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Smith, 2004)</ref>. Reasoning and problem-solving are general cognitive abilities that are supposed to affect learning and performance of more than just mathematics. Becoming better at mathematics should therefore improve general cognitive abilities. By contrast, much recent psychological research emphasizes causal influence in the opposite direction: how general cognitive abilities may affect the learning of school mathematics, for example intelligence and speed of processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Geary, 2011)</ref> and reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fuchs, Geary, Fuchs, Compton, &amp; Hamlett, 2016)</ref>. A third hypothesis is that the relationship between general cognitive skills and mathematical achievement is reciprocal with each influencing the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brody, 1992)</ref>. The present study uses longitudinal data with repeated measurements to assess the relationships between general cognitive ability and mathematics attainment during the second phase of primary school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The present study</head><p>To investigate the relations between mathematics and cognitive ability in primary school, we use a cross-lagged path analysis approach which includes measurements of mathematics and general cognitive ability at three ages (7, 9, and 10 years). If mathematics does develop cognitive ability, then earlier mathematics should make a statistically significant unique contribution to explaining variance in later cognitive ability even when earlier cognitive ability is included. If general cognitive ability does directly influence later mathematics then it should make a statistically significant unique contribution independently of earlier mathematics ability. If the relationship is reciprocal then both mathematical and general cognitive ability should influence later performance.</p><p>We also report a cross-lagged path analysis which includes measures of English at these three ages. This is because both mathematics attainment and general cognitive ability are correlated with reading and spoken language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cowan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Durand, Hulme, Larkin, &amp; Snowling, 2005)</ref>. Previous studies indicate reading contributes to growth in general cognitive skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cain &amp; Oakhill, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ferrer, McArdle, Shaywitz, Holahan, Marchione, &amp; Shaywitz, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Richie, Bates, &amp; Plomin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Verhoeven, van Leeuwe, &amp; Vermeer, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The inclusion of the measures of English in the second cross-lagged path model is an attempt to control for the covariation of mathematics and general cognitive ability with reading and language skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were selected from the publicly available SRCD Monograph dataset for children in the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). Some children with specific medical syndromes such as Down syndrome, extreme low birth weight and autism spectrum disorder had been excluded from this data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kovas, Haworth, Dale, and Plomin, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>There were two further principles of selection in the analyses reported here: only children with complete data were included and only one child per family was selected. To be included a child had to have complete data on reading, mathematics and general cognitive ability at 7, 9, and 10 years old. The selection of one child per family was made to avoid the risk of clustering at the level of family if both twins were included as clustering can lead to inflated significance levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003)</ref>. The random variable in the data set for single child selection was used. The resulting sample comprised 948 children, 409 male, 539 female. Of these children, 325 had an MZ twin and 311 had a same sex DZ twin, and 312 had an opposite sex DZ twin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Fuller details of the measures are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kovas et al. (2007)</ref>.</p><p>English. The measures of English at 7, 9, and 10 were standardized composites of teacher ratings on five point scales of children's National Curriculum (NC) Levels in the three areas of English: Reading; Speaking and Listening; and Writing (QCDA, 2010).</p><p>In rating 7-year-olds, teachers used the Key Stage 1 criteria and guidance. At 7, the children were also assessed using a telephone administered version of the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 1999)</ref>. Teacher ratings of NC Levels for English correlated strongly with composite TOWRE scores, r (935) = .62, p &lt; .001. This indicates substantial validity.</p><p>For 9-and 10-year-olds, teachers used the Key Stage 2 criteria and guidance. At 10 the children's reading comprehension was also assessed using a web-based version of the reading comprehension subtest of Peabody Individual Achievement Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Markwardt, 1997)</ref> at home. Performance on the web-based reading comprehension test correlated moderately with composite teacher ratings of NC Levels for English at 9 and 10: NC Levels for English at 9, r (948) = .44, p &lt; .001; NC Levels for English at 10, r (948) = .47, p &lt; .001.</p><p>Mathematics. The measures of mathematics at 7, 9, and 10 were standardized composites of teacher ratings on five point scales of children's National Curriculum Levels in the three areas of Mathematics: Numbers (and Algebra for Key Stage 2); Using and Applying Mathematics; Shapes, Space, and Measures. In rating 7-year-olds, teachers used the Key Stage 1 criteria and guidance. For 9-and 10-year-olds, teachers used the Key Stage 2 criteria and guidance. At 10 the children's mathematical skills were also assessed using a web-based measure derived from the NFER 5-14 series. Performance on this web-based measure correlated moderately with composite teacher ratings of NC Levels for Mathematics at 9 and 10: NC Levels for Mathematics at 9, r (948) = .45, p &lt; .001; NC Levels for Mathematics at 10, r (948) = .47, p &lt; .001. General cognitive ability. At 7 children were tested over the telephone using the Vocabulary, Similarities, and Picture Completion subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III-UK; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wechsler, 1992)</ref> and the Conceptual Grouping subtest from the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(McCarthy, 1972)</ref>. Test stimuli and instructions to prevent cheating were sent to parents in advance. A validation study of telephone-administered cognitive measures with 6-8 year olds reported a correlation of r = .65 with in person tests. This correlation increased to .72 when corrected for range restriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Petrill, Rempell, Oliver, &amp; Plomin, 2002)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Raven, Court, &amp; Raven, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>For each age, standardized composites were formed from the four subtests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The means for the composite measures ranged from 0.15 to 0.22 and the standard deviations ranged from 0.88 to 0.95. There was no evidence of variation in composite measures with age (7, 9, &amp; 10) or domain (English, Mathematics, General Cognitive Ability) according to a two within -subjects factor ANOVA: age, F (2, 3038) = 0.38, p = .68; domain, F (2, 3038) = 2.49, p = .08; age X domain, F (3.2, 3038) = 2.49, p = .06.</p><p>Zero-order correlations between measures are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Correlations within domains are generally higher than correlations across domains apart from the ratings of English and Mathematics at the same age where the same person is rating both domains.</p><p>Cross-lagged path analyses were run in MPlus Version 7.4 <ref type="bibr">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">-2015)</ref> using Maximum Likelihood estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-lagged Model 1.</head><p>The first path model was specified to estimate the crosslagged effects of mathematics and general cognitive ability (measured as manifest rather than latent variables) between ages 7 and 9, and between ages 9 and 10, while allowing for the stability of both mathematics and general cognitive ability over time. It also allowed for residual covariances of mathematics and general cognitive ability within time point. All coefficients are reported in standardized units. As summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, all paths between the abilities at adjacent ages were significant. The cross-lagged path between mathematics at 7 and general cognitive ability at 9 is stronger than the cross-lagged path between general cognitive ability at 7 and mathematics at 9. Between 9 and 10 both the cross-lagged paths were of a similar strength, and slightly weaker than the corresponding paths between 7 and 9. This reduction in the predictive power across domains may reflect the increased strength of the within domain paths: the within domain paths between 9 and 10 are stronger than the corresponding paths between 7 and 9. This is consistent both with the shorter time intervals and the greater similarity of the underlying constructs.</p><p>Cross-lagged Model 2. This analysis included the measures of English at ages 7 and 9 predicting their adjacent measures of mathematics and general cognitive ability. Therefore, English achievement was adjusted for in each cross-lagged path. The results are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The effect of including English is to reduce the sizes of all the coefficients. The path from mathematics at 7 to general cognitive ability at 9 is still slightly stronger than the path between general cognitive ability at 7 to mathematics at 9. However, there is no longer a significant path between mathematics at 9 and general cognitive ability at 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>As mentioned in the Introduction, evidence exists to support the psychometric hypothesis that general cognitive ability enhances mathematical attainment and this is confirmed in the analyses presented here. The analyses add to our knowledge about the relation between learning in primary school and general cognitive ability in two important ways. They provide support for the claim that learning mathematics improves general cognitive abilities and they indicate that the relationship between general cognitive ability and mathematics learning is reciprocal, at least between the ages of 7 and 9.</p><p>Using longitudinal repeated measures data to establish reciprocal relationships is wellestablished in the investigation of causal relationships, for example in studies of the relationship between academic self-concept and educational achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Marsh &amp; Martin, 2011)</ref>. However, in longitudinal data sets with large sample sizes, measurements of specific variables tend to be time efficient rather than exhaustive. In the present study, phone and web-based testing of cognitive abilities and teacher ratings of mathematics ability offer satisfactory, conventional measurement within the context of large scale studies but having multiple measures of the constructs would improve confidence in the results reported here.</p><p>A further limitation of the present study is that the cross-lagged model we utilised does not explicitly consider the passage of time, and that the window of time between time points may be too short to capture the reciprocal effects of mathematics and general cognitive ability. The short period between age 9 and 10 measurements may be a reason why we did not find reciprocal relationships across age 9 to 10.</p><p>Even if there were multiple measures and knowledge of what intervals between measurements would be appropriate, the evidence would be just longitudinal and it would still be important to establish the relationships with experiments. While maintaining that a reciprocal relationship between education and intelligence was most likely, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brody (1992)</ref> pointed to shortcomings in previous experimental evidence. One problem is that the training may not transfer. Early intelligence training did not improve educational achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brody, 1992)</ref> and working memory training does not result in improved reading and arithmetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Melby-Lervåg &amp; Hulme, 2013)</ref>. Educationists have also acknowledged that some forms of mathematical education may not enhance intellectual development <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hamley, 1939)</ref>, for example when they concentrate on rote memorizing as the method of learning.</p><p>Contemporary high stakes testing, where schools are held accountable for their pupils' achievements on tests, is suspected of reducing the benefits of classroom instruction by focusing teaching on the specific skills required to pass the test rather than on deeper conceptual understanding which supports transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Popham, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Another challenge is that individual differences in response to treatments may obscure the overall effects. Reading researchers have identified complex relationships between initial competence and response to intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hurry &amp; Sylva, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Stanovich, 1986)</ref>. It is likely that similar patterns will be observed in relation to mathematical interventions.</p><p>Overall then, while this study does indicate a reciprocal relationship between mathematics learning and general cognitive development at least between 7 and 9, there is much more to be done to establish it and whether it can be used to enhance mathematical achievement or cognitive development.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>At 9, children completed a test booklet under parental supervision.
