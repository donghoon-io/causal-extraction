Upregulation of glycolysis corroborated with a de novo glucose uptake mediated by the glucose transporter (GLUT) GLUT1, in response to microcrystals.

Moreover, both inhibition of GLUT1 and glycolysis inhibition by 2-DG decreased MSU and m-CPPD crystal-induced inflammation in an in vivo mouse model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MSU and m-CPPD crystal-induced inflammation depends on glucose metabolism</head><p>To assess the role of glucose metabolism in crystal-induced inflammation, we stimulated cells with media containing increasing concentrations of glucose (0-4 g/L) or supplemented with the glucose analogue 2-DG, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Both glucose deprivation and glycolysis inhibition drastically decreased IL-1β production by primed THP-1 cells or mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated by either MSU or m-CPPD crystals (glucose deprivation decreased by more than 90% the crystal-induced IL-1β production by BMDMs) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>; online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>). In contrary, increasing concentrations of glucose-enhanced IL-1β production (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Nevertheless, prostaglandin E2 and CXCL1 production, two proinflammatory mediators involved in crystal inflammation, did not depend on glucose availability (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E-F</ref>). Suppression of IL-1β production is secondary to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. <ref type="bibr">1 3</ref> Here, we demonstrated that glucose deprivation suppressed ASC oligomerisation and speck formation induced by either MSU or m-CPPD crystals (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). We confirmed, in vivo, the central role of glycolysis and observed that mice treated with 2-DG displayed mild inflammatory response compared to untreated mice 6 hours after MSU or m-CPPD crystal stimulation. Indeed, 2-DG abrogated crystal-induced IL-1β production and prevented crystal-induced neutrophil infiltration assessed in the air pouch lavages (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E-H</ref>). Histology analysis of air pouch membranes after H&amp;E staining further evidenced that glycolysis inhibition suppressed neutrophil infiltration with a major decrease in inflammation score in mice treated by 2-DG (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1I,</ref><ref type="figure">J</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MSU and m-CPPD crystals induce modifications in the glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways</head><p>To better understand the involvement of glucose and cell metabolism in the microcrystal inflammatory response, we performed a metabolomics study and observed in partial least squares discriminant analysis that cells stimulated by either MSU or m-CPPD crystals had robust distinct metabolic profiles without overlap components compared with unstimulated cells. Metabolomics data are available in online supplementary table <ref type="table">S1</ref>. Specifically, we observed modifications of the abundance of multiple metabolites (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref>). Crystals induced perturbation of multiple metabolic pathways, including amino acids and glucose metabolism (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). We observed modifications in both glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle with a slight increase of fructose-6 phosphate and a strong decrease of phosphoenolpyruvate, α-ketoglutarate and malate (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>). Beside glycolysis and TCA cycle components, there was also a decrease of glutamate and glutamine, two amino acids able to refuel the Krebs cycle in the absence of pyruvate. <ref type="bibr">22 23</ref> Interestingly, the intracellular ATP was very low in crystal-stimulated cells, suggesting either an alteration of its production or an increased turnover. Then, we evaluated whether these crystals also modulated the expression of genes encoding enzymes or transporters involved in the glycolysis pathway and Krebs cycle. We did observe variations in expression of genes encoding HK-2, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 and 2, monocarboxylate transporter 4, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 2, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 and 3 (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A-D</ref>). Altogether, these results suggested that crystals altered glycolytic activity and mitochondrial function. We assessed this hypothesis with Seahorse experiments that permit analysis of real-time changes in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>), as surrogates of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, respectively. We observed that only MSU crystals increased macrophage basal glycolysis (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>), glycolytic rate and glycolytic activity (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>) while both MSU and m-CPPD crystals did not affect the OXPHOS (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>; online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). Analysis of OCR suggested that MSU crystals increased only non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3F</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MSU and m-CPPD crystals increase glucose uptake associated with GLUT1 expression at the cell surface</head><p>As crystal-induced IL-1β production relied on glucose availability, we quantified the variation of glucose concentrations in cell culture media. By doing this, we observed that glucose concentrations were significantly lower in culture media of macrophages stimulated by either MSU or m-CPPD crystals than in culture media of unstimulated cells (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Then, we confirmed the de novo glucose uptake by showing that MSU and m-CPPD crystals enhanced the intracellular level of radiolabelled [ 18 F]-FDG by 152% and 148%, respectively (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). Glucose uptake has been reported in gouty joint flare in patients <ref type="bibr">18 19</ref> ; we reproduced this observation in the air pouch model using [ 18 F]-FDG. By PET/CT imaging, glucose uptake in response to MSU and m-CPPD crystals was evidenced by a higher labelling of the air pouch where crystals were injected, as well as higher maximum standardised uptake value (SUV max ) and ratio of radiolabelled tracer found in air pouch compared with air pouch injected by saline solution (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C-E</ref>). Moreover, after in vivo acquisition, quantification of the radiotracer showed that the level of [ 18 F]-FDG was higher in air pouch membranes isolated from crystal-stimulated mice than from saline-stimulated mice (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>), which was strongly correlated with IL-1β production in the air pouch (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>).</p><p>Glucose enters the cells through GLUTs that belong to solute carrier family 2 (SCL2A), which encompasses 14 members. SLC2A proteins are overexpressed in tumour cells, and SLC2A1 (GLUT1) is rapidly upregulated in inflammatory macrophages and contributes to glycolytic phenotype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> GLUT6 has been previously reported as not being involved in glucose uptake and glycolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> ; therefore, we focused on GLUT1 expression. We first showed that both MSU and m-CPPD crystal stimulation in vitro upregulated the GLUT1 gene expression on BMDMs (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4B</ref>) and the GLUT1 protein expression on THP-1 cells (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-D</ref>; see also figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). By confocal microscopy, we observed that microcrystals induced a higher expression of GLUT1 at the cell plasma membrane compared with unstimulated cells (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>). Moreover, the analysis by flow cytometry showed that both crystals, as well as the NLRP3 activator LPS, induced an increase in mean of GLUT1 expression intensity at the cell surface (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). The increased GLUT1 expression in response to crystals was confirmed in vivo (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E-G</ref>). First, we observed by immunofluorescence an increased expression of GLUT1 in the air pouch membrane (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>). Second, the infiltrated cells into the air pouch expressed a higher level of GLUT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>) after crystal injection compared with saline injection, and between 50% and 70% of the recruited cells were positive for GLUT1 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref>). The percentage of GLUT1-positive cells was also correlated with the inflammatory response and glucose uptake measured by IL-1β concentration and SUV max , respectively, in the air pouch (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H1</ref>). Finally, we validated these in vivo data by GLUT1 expression analysis on inflammatory cells isolated from gout flare patients. We observed that the ratio of GLUT1-expressing cells among the neutrophils was higher in the synovial fluid than in blood (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4J</ref>), suggesting that cells increased their GLUT1 expression at the site of inflammation where MSU crystals are present (MSU crystals were observed in 100% of the synovial fluid samples).</p><p>Altogether, these results suggested that MSU and m-CPPD crystal inflammation is supported by a de novo increase in GLUT1 expression and its relocalisation to the plasma membrane, required for glucose uptake and metabolic reprogramming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GLUT1 regulates crystal-induced inflammation</head><p>To assess the role of GLUT1 in MSU and m-CPPD crystalinduced inflammation, we adopted pharmacological (STF-31: iGLUT1) and genetic knock-down approaches (SLC2A1 small interfering RNA: siGLUT1; see validation in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>) of GLUT1 inhibition. First, iGLUT1 suppressed the glucose uptake induced by MSU and m-CPPD crystals (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>), positioning GLUT1 as the main GLUT involved in the microcrystal response. Then, we demonstrated that GLUT1 inhibition by either of the two technical approaches led to a 50% inhibition of IL-1β production in response to MSU and m-CPPD (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). This IL-1β reduction under iGLUT1 was due to an inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation as GLUT1 inhibition prevented by 75% the ASC speck formation (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>). Partial inhibition of NLRP3 activation and subsequently IL-1β production by iGLUT1 suggested that GLUT1 was involved in an amplification loop but not an initial signal of IL-1β production. Nevertheless, we observed that glucose depletion and GLUT1 inhibition decreased both NLRP3 and IL-1β gene expression and pro-IL-1β synthesis induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) priming, suggesting that glucose also played a role in the first signal (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the iGLUT1 efficiency on microcrystal inflammation in vivo. iGLUT1 delivered by intraperitoneal injection allowed to drastically inhibit all signs of local inflammation induced by MSU and m-CPPD into the air pouch, namely, a decrease in IL-1β production (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5G</ref>), a reduction of cell infiltration (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5H</ref>) associated with neutrophil recruitment (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>) and a global alleviation of the inflammatory score observed from HE staining of air pouch membrane (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5I</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>We found that MSU and m-CPPD crystal-induced macrophage production of IL-1β, which orchestrated the recurrent inflammatory flares in gout and m-CPPD deposition disease, respectively, relied on glucose uptake through GLUT1 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Glucose deprivation and glycolysis inhibition decreased NLRP3 and IL-1β gene expression and suppressed ASC speck formation (ie, NLRP3 activation), IL-1β production and neutrophil infiltration induced by MSU and m-CPPD crystals. Crystals induced GLUT1 de novo expression and its localisation to plasma membrane, along with gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis such as HK-2. Increase glucose uptake during MSU and m-CPPD crystal-induced inflammation has been reported in patients using [ 18 F]-FDG PET/CT. <ref type="bibr">18 19</ref> We reproduced these observations in a mouse model, and we identified for the first time the key role of GLUT1 in both MSU and m-CPPD crystal-induced inflammation in mice and in human samples harvested during gout flare. Interestingly, we discovered that MSU crystal-induced glucose uptake favoured glycolytic activity, while m-CPPD crystals induced glucose uptake without modulation of glycolytic activity. Surprisingly, both microcrystals did not modulate OXPHOS. These results were distinct from the Warburg effect described in cancer cells and LPS-stimulated macrophages, where metabolic switch enhanced aerobic glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial respiration. <ref type="bibr">8-10 12 26</ref> Also reported, MSU crystals increased both OXPHOS and glycolytic activity on human neutrophils. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> These findings further supported the complexity of cellular metabolic programmes and responses, which varied with the type and concentration of stimuli, cell type and cell species and tissue environment. <ref type="bibr">13 28-30</ref> For example, LPS stimulated Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming in human monocytes at concentrations between 1 and 100 ng/mL but increased OXPHOS at a low dose of 0.1 ng/ mL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Likewise, monocytes stimulated with TLR2 agonist Pam3CysSK4 (P3C) or by whole microorganisms activated both glycolysis pathway and OXPHOS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Finally, analysis of monocyte transcriptomic responses under 28 different stimuli identified 10 clusters that represented distinct activation states with distinct metabolic responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> These data suggested that a specific stimulus would trigger metabolic responses corresponding to a specific and functional requirement of the cells. For instance, MSU and m-CPPD crystal-induced metabolic reprogramming might increase either the phagocytosis capacity (as shown in monocytes stimulated by P3C) or the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (as shown in neutrophils stimulated by MSU crystals), <ref type="bibr">27 29</ref> two well-known mechanisms of crystal-induced NLRP3 activation. <ref type="bibr">1 31</ref> In parallel, we found that MSU crystals activated macrophage glycolysis pathway to produce IL-1β as well described in macrophages stimulated by LPS, in activated T cells and cancer cells. <ref type="bibr">8-10 12 17 26 28</ref> However, how MSUinduced and m-CPPD crystal-induced glucose uptake activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remained unknown. One explanation could come from the induction of HK-2 by MSU and m-CPPD. Indeed, in LPS-stimulated macrophages, IL-1β production can be modulated by metabolites and enzymes involved in the glycolysis pathway, including HK-1 and HK-2, which can both interact with mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel to activate NRLP3, 32 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and inactive PKM2. <ref type="bibr">14 34</ref> Cancer cells and LPS-stimulated macrophages overexpress inactive dimer PKM2, which promotes HIF-1α activation and transcription of HIF-1α-dependent genes, including IL-1β and glycolytic enzymes. <ref type="bibr">14 34</ref> Alternatively, MSU and m-CPPD crystal-induced glucose uptake might stimulate IL-1β production through Akt pathway and ROS production. <ref type="bibr">27 35 36</ref> PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase)/Akt pathway is commonly activated by MSU and m-CPPD crystals. <ref type="bibr">27 36 37</ref> Akt activation enhanced IL-1β production through induction of ROS and glucose metabolism. Akt promoted glycolysis through stimulation of HK-2 and glucose uptake via translocation of GLUT1 to cell surface membrane and activation of its downstream mTORC1. This later stimulated HIF-1α, which enhanced expression of genes involved in glycolytic reprogramming, such as SLC2A1 (GLUT1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Glucose is a critical nutrient component for inflammatory macrophages, and GLUT1 is the main GLUT expressed in LPS-stimulated macrophages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Elevated GLUT1 expression increased glucose metabolism and glycolysis, ROS production and expression of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-1β. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Here, we found that MSU and m-CPPD crystals triggered plasma membrane localisation of GLUT1, which drove glucose uptake, NLRP3 activation and IL-1β production. Furthermore, we observed in gouty patients that GLUT1 was more frequently expressed at the surface of neutrophils isolated from flaring joint than neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood of the same patient. These results added crystal-induced IL-1β production to the list of inflammatory conditions regulated by GLUT1-induced glucose uptake in macrophages, such as cancer, infection, autoimmune disease, diabetes and obesity. <ref type="bibr">14 24 28 35 39 40</ref> Interestingly GLUT1 also governed postprandial glucose uptake by peritoneal macrophages, leading to IL-1β production and, subsequently, insulin secretion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> This might explain why gout flare frequently occurred after a feast. MSU and m-CPPD crystals enhanced both GLUT1 mRNA expression and GLUT1 plasma membrane localisation by unknown mechanisms. GLUT1 activity is regulated by its membrane localisation and activation, kinetic of its internalisation, endosomal sorting and recycling back to the cell membrane, which depends on retromer cargo complex. <ref type="bibr">41 42</ref> Cancer cells favour aerobic glycolysis by promoting GLUT1 plasma membrane localisation through the PI3K/Akt/mTORC pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> Akt activation promotes cell surface membrane recycling of GLUT1 and reduces its internalisation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Inversely, Akt inhibition by phosphatase TENsin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) prevented GLUT1 plasma membrane localisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> Whether MSU and m-CPPD crystals regulated GLUT1 membrane expression through the Akt pathway needs to be studied. Alternatively, MSU and m-CPPD crystals might induce GLUT1 membrane localisation through thioredoxin-interacting protein, which facilitated GLUT1 endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits, modulated PTEN activity and was involved in crystal-induced inflammation. <ref type="bibr">31 48</ref> Lastly, crystal-induced glucose uptake might be due to an increase in GLUT1 transport activity. Indeed, the drastic decrease of cytosolic ATP observed after MSU and m-CPPD crystal stimulation might stimulate GLUT1 transport activity, as previously reported. <ref type="bibr">49 50</ref> Although SLC2A6 (GLUT6) gene expression in THP-1 cells was highly enhanced by either MSU or m-CPPD crystal stimulation, its exact role in crystal-induced inflammation and glucose uptake is currently unknown. Recent data suggested that GLUT6 was involved in neither glucose uptake nor glycolysis nor OXPHOS. <ref type="bibr">25 51 52</ref> GLUT6-deficient mice had normal glucose metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> and GLUT6-deficient BMDMs had similar ECAR and OCR than wild-type cells. <ref type="bibr">25 52</ref> Moreover, expression of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1β and TNF-α was unchanged in the absence of GLUT6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> Further studies are needed to understand how GLUT6 participates to crystal-induced inflammation.</p><p>How MSU and m-CPPD crystals induced GLUT1 membrane localisation constituted the main limitation of our study. Although we did not identify the exact mechanisms involved in crystal effects, our results suggested that MSU and m-CPPD crystals increased, in THP-1 and mouse BMDM cells, GLUT1 gene expression, GLUT1 protein production and membrane location and GLUT1 activity. Whether crystals induced IL-1β production by primary human monocytes does also depend on glucose uptake need specific studies. Similarly, we did not assess in this study how hyperglycaemic modulated crystalinduced inflammation in vivo. We planned to address this question in type 2 and type 1 diabetes using Ob/Ob mice and streptozotocin mouse models, respectively. Interestingly, recent report supported our findings by showing that patients treated with metformin had less gout flare. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Finally, metabolic reprogramming during gout flare needed also to be confirmed in patients by doing metabolomics analysis in neutrophils isolated from inflamed joint.</p><p>Overall, metabolic changes characterised by GLUT1mediated glucose uptake and increase in glycolysis governed MSU and m-CPPD crystal-activated IL-1β production. These findings open new therapeutic paths to modulate crystalrelated inflammation.</p></div>
