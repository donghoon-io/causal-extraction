<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Most angiosperms bear hermaphroditic flowers, but a few species have evolved outcrossing strategies, such as dioecy, the presence of separate male and female individuals. We previously investigated the mechanisms underlying dioecy in diploid persimmon (D. lotus) and found that male flowers are specified by repression of the autosomal gene MeGI by its paralog, the Y-encoded pseudo-gene OGI. This mechanism is thought to be lineage-specific, but its evolutionary path remains unknown. Here, we developed a full draft of the diploid persimmon genome (D. lotus), which revealed a lineage-specific whole-genome duplication event and provided information on the architecture of the Y chromosome. We also identified three paralogs, MeGI, OGI and newly identified Sister of MeGI (SiMeGI). Evolutionary analysis suggested that MeGI underwent adaptive evolution after the whole-genome duplication event. Transformation of tobacco plants with MeGI and SiMeGI revealed that MeGI specifically acquired a new function as a repressor of male organ development, while SiMeGI presumably maintained the original function. Later, a segmental duplication event spawned MeGI's regulator OGI on the Y-chromosome, completing the path leading to dioecy, and probably initiating the formation of the Y-chromosome. These findings exemplify how duplication events can provide flexible genetic material available to help respond to varying environments and provide interesting parallels for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transition into dieocy in plants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Most species of flowering plants are hermaphrodite, but a small proportion have genetically determined separate sexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The rarity of dioecy contrasts with its broad distribution across the flowering plant phylogenetic tree, suggesting multiple independent transitions into dioecy. Our study aimed to understand the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying such changes. Advances in genomic analyses have allowed studies of plant sex chromosomes in a few dioecious plant species including papaya and Silene <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and a few genetic sex determining genes have recently been identified, including in the persimmon, kiwifruit, and asparagus <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Consistent with theoretical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, the results indicate that at least one gain-offunction mutation occurred in the evolution of dioecy, creating a dominant gynoecium or androecium suppressor. Data from these species is also consistent with gene duplication events as the first event leading to these gain-of-function mutations, because the redundancy provided by the presence of duplicate copies allows one copy to be neofunctionalized without loss of the original function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Unlike many animal taxa, flowering plants have experienced numerous whole-genome duplication events (WGD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which are thought to have provided opportunities for the appearance of new traits specific to each plant species. For example, functional differentiation between paralogs, which had been derived from whole-genome duplication (WGD), resulted in the establishment of ripening characteristics in tomato fruits <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and potentially enabled the adaptation to life underwater in seagrass (Zostera marina) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Within the large order Ericales, a heterogametic male (XY) sex determination system has evolved independently in at least two genera, Diospyros and Actinidia <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Diospyros had evolved a Y-encoded pseudogene called OGI, that produces small-RNA, which in turn repress the autosomal feminization gene, MeGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. MeGI belongs to the HD-Zip1 gene family conserved across angiosperms, but the specific function of MeGI to act for repression of male function, or feminization, has not been observed in MeGI orthologs from other plants so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Indeed, although Actinidia and Diospyros are phylogenetically close to each other, the Y-encoded sex determination system in Actinidia does not involve the MeGI ortholog or another member of the HD-Zip1 family <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The existence of MeGI, OGI, and a third paralog called Sister-of-MeGI (SiMeGI), which was newly identified in this study, provide the opportunity to investigate both the scale and context of the duplication events that triggered the appearance of a lineage-specific sex determination system in this species. To address this question, we sequenced the genome of Caucasian diploid persimmon, focusing on the lineage-specific duplication events. Evolutionary analyses on the duplicated pairs found a limited numbers of the genes which were potentially neofunctionalized via adaptive evolution after the duplication. Our results provide a potential path from the duplicated paralogs of a HD-Zip1 to dioecy, and shed light on how lineage-specific duplication events contribute to the evolution of a new sex determination system in a plant species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Draft genome sequencing of Diospyros</head><p>Initially, we assembled a draft genome from ca 65X PacBio long read coverage of the expected haploid genome size (907Mb from flow cytometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, 877.7Mb from kmer analysis) using Falcon (S1 Fig, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref> Table ). This resulted in 3,073 primary contigs totaling 746.1Mb, which covers ca 85% of the genome, and 5,901 "secondary" contigs, which are putative allelic contigs to the primary contigs. Next, we built three genetic maps, created from two segregating F1 populations (N = 314 and 119, see Materials and Methods and S2 Table ). These maps were created from a total of 5,959 markers derived from GBS/ddRAD sequencing and allowed for the anchoring of the ca 61.8% scaffolds into <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>  To start characterizing this newly assembled genome, we documented sequence variation between female and male individuals of D. lotus and content and type of repeat sequences of the draft sequence compared to other sequences eudicots (Fig 1B <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref>, S3 and S4 Tables). Mapping of transcriptome data to this draft genome resulted in 40,532 predicted gene locations <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1D,</ref><ref type="bibr">S1 Dataset)</ref>. These numbers are similar to results from other asterid plant species, such as tomato (N = 34,879) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or kiwifruit (N = 39,040) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (S2 and S3 Figs). Of these primary genes, we selected 12,058 which were determined to be either unique or low copy number within the genome (see Materials and Methods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of a whole-genome duplication event specific to the Diospyros genus</head><p>To investigate gene duplication patterns, we analyzed the distribution of silent divergence rate (dS) between homologous gene pairs. We compared the distribution of silent divergence rate of homologous gene pairs within the persimmon genome, with those within the kiwifruit (Actinidia), tomato (Solanum) and grape (Vitis) genomes. A subset of persimmon genes formed a clear peak of silent divergence rate (Fig 2A, dS = ca 0.5-0.9, mode dS = 0.69), suggesting that a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event, named Dd-α, occurred in this clade. Next, we performed a genome-wide synteny analysis, based on the location of the gene pairs with dS values ranging from 0.5 and 0.9, using SynMap in CoGe <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>   <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>). Two other events, Ad-α and Ad-β, have been inferred by a similar analysis in the Actinidia genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (S6 Fig) but are not detectable in the Diospyros genome. Thus, Actinidia and Diospyros differ by at least three lineage-specific ancestral WGD events. These occurred at a time similar to previously reported whole-genome duplication events in the asterids <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, as well as across the angiosperms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, concentrated around the K-Pg (Cretaceous-Paleogen) boundary (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Only a few gene, including MeGI, exhibit signs of positive selection but divergent expression patterns are common following the WGD event</head><p>To explore the evolutionary significance of lineage-specific duplications, and particularly of the Dd-α WGD event, dN/dS values between the duplicated gene pairs putatively derived from the Dd-α WGD events (N = 2,619) were calculated. The dN/dS values averaged over the coding regions indicated that most of the duplicates experienced either purifying or neutral selection (dN/dS � 1.0, Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>). In contrast, site-and evolutionary branch-specific tests for positive selection (dN/dS &gt;&gt; 1.0), using PAML, suggested that at least 9 genes experienced strong positive selection (posterior probability &gt; 0.99 in Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis) following the Dd-α WGD event (Fig 3B <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>). Importantly, MeGI and its paralog, named Sister of MeGI (SiMeGI), were one of these 9 gene pairs. Consistently, MeGI and SiMeGI were included in the same gene family after OrthoMCL analysis. They are located on Chr 13 (Dlo_pri0799F.1) and Chr 4 (Dlo_pri0025F.1), respectively, and these regions showed syntenic collinearity around these genes based on sequence similarity (Fig 3D <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">-3F</ref>, S7 Fig). Syntenic blocks derived from gene order (with genes with dS values between 0.5 and 0.9) were observed with SynMap in CoGe as well <ref type="bibr">(Fig 3E)</ref>. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that they were derived  ). b, model for the detection of the genes that underwent significant site-branch specific positive selection (posterior probability &gt; 0.99 in Bayes Empirical Bayes method) after Dd-α, using Actinidia, Solanum, and Vitis as outgroups. c, Functional annotation of the 9 genes that underwent significant site-branch specific positive selection after Dd-α.

The MeGI-SiMeGI syntenic region is indicated by a red circle, a more detailed figure is available in from the Dd-α WGD event, although we cannot exclude the possibility that they were generated from a simple segmental duplication concurrent with the Dd-α.</p><p>In contrast to very small number of genes exhibiting positive selection, a larger proportion of the gene pairs derived from the Dd-α WGD events exhibited significant differences in expression patterns. We described expression patterns in male and female buds/flowers using transcriptome data from 8 time points throughout the annual cycle (see Materials and Methods for details). Our results suggest that 45.5% of the gene pairs (597/1,311 pairs) showed significant differentiation (Pearson product-moment correlation test r 2 &lt; 0.3, S2 Dataset). To investigate differences in expression pattern between male and female flowers throughout development, we conducted 2x2 Fisher's exact test on the Dd-α-derived gene pairs (see Materials and Methods) and identified 36 and 65 gene pairs (of 1,311 pairs) exhibiting significant differentiation (p &lt; 0.01) in expression patterns between male and female flowers at developing and maturing stages, respectively (Fig 3G <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3H</ref>, S3 Dataset). These might have potentially contributed to the establishment of Diospyros-specific sex determining mechanisms. Such frequent variation in expression patterns is consistent with previous results in soybean <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and could have originated from rapid evolution in cis-motifs after WGD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adaptive evolution of MeGI to act specifically for repression of androecium development</head><p>Genome-wide survey of the HD-Zip1 family, to which MeGI belongs, found <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref>  On the other hand, MeGI experienced strong purifying selection overall (average dN/dS = 0.095) since the establishment of the Ebenaceae (Euclea and Diospyros) (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4B</ref>). Furthermore, the regions that experienced positive selection early are currently under stronger purifying selection in MeGI than in SiMeGI (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4E</ref>). This is also consistent with the idea that MeGI first underwent neofunctionalization following the whole-genome duplication event, and that these changes were later fixed by positive selection. On the other hand, stronger purifying selection in MeGI than in SiMeGI could reflect lesser functional importance of SiMeGI (or possibly that it is degenerating since the whole-genome duplication occurred). Alternatively, it could reflect the need to conserve high sequence homology between OGI and MeGI in order to maintain the regulatory role of OGI via smRNA targeting MeGI.</p><p>Consistent with the evolutionary analysis presented above, ectopic expression of  ), consistent with previous results using the same construct in A. thaliana <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. On the other hand, Supplementary S7 Fig. f, Microsynteny analysis of the genomic fragments including SiMeGI and MeGI, using promer in MUMmer. g-h, Comparison of the expression patterns of paralog pairs derived from the Dd-α event, focusing on the sex differentiation stages. The ratio of expression levels in male versus female developing flowers (g) and mature flowers (h) were compared in the paralogs putatively derived from the Dd-α WGD event. The ratios were expressed in log 10 scale. Approximately 10% of the gene pairs exhibited a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01, 2x2 Fisher's exact test, orange circles) expression bias between the two paralogs (S3 Dataset), and 18.5% of the gene pairs (N = 242) showed &gt;5-fold differences between the two paralogs.  ). The function of MeGI as repressor of androecium in persimmon is due to the ability to regulate PISTILLATA (PI) in young developing androecium <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The expression level of PI in N. tabacum was significantly down-regulated in the transgenic lines with MeGI, while the lines transformed with SiMeGI showed no changes in PI expression (Fig 5I <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5J</ref>). In Arabidopsis, which is a very far lineage from Diospyros, high expression of SiMeGI Taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a role in androecium development is specific to MeGI. This is further supported by the fact that mutants of the MeGI/SiMeGI orthologs which are normally expressed in flower primordia in other angiosperm species, do not affect androecia development <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Our evolutionary analyses revealed that the positive selection that affected MeGI specifically did not occur on the region binding to the target cis-motifs, called homeobox-domain (HB) (Fig 4D <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4E</ref>), but rather on the 5' undefined region and on the leucine zipper region putatively forming heterodimers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. This was supported by the results of DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> using MeGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> or SiMeGI fused to a Halo-tag. This allowed us to identify which genes and/or motifs is preferentially targeted by each of these transcription factors. The DAP-Seq reads were mapped to the D. lotus genome to characterize the accumulated recognition motifs (see Materials and Methods). We identified the motifs using the top 1,000 high-confidence peaks, and determined that the AATWATT sequence was enriched when using MeGI <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and SiMeGI as the probes (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5K</ref>). This motif is commonly recognized by the Arabidopsis HD-ZIP1 genes as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Thus, it is possible that the feminization role of MeGI could have resulted from either increased efficiency or novel affinity to interact with other factors. Finally, the native expression patterns of MeGI and SiMeGI in persimmon are also slightly different in developing buds and flower primordia (Fig 5L <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">-5N</ref>, S11 and S12 Figs). Specifically, MeGI exhibits higher expression than SiMeGI during the flower maturing stages (Fig 5L <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">-5N</ref>). This expression differentiation might also contribute to MeGI-specific feminizing function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formation of a lineage-specific, and slowly evolving Y-chromosome in Diospyros</head><p>To investigate the sequence and structure of the sex chromosomes, we undertook the following steps. First, we anchored some pseudo-autosomal scaffolds to chromosome 15, using sexlinked SNPs markers, previously derived from the F1 population described above (S9 Table ). On the other hand, the male-specific region of the Y-chromosome, including OGI, could not be anchored using SNPs, presumably due to large structural variation between the X and Y chromosome at these locations. Therefore, we anchored 7 Y-chromosomal scaffolds surrounding OGI using the end-sequences of BAC clones selected for sequencing based on successive walking starting from OGI itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We then assessed their genomic context by mapping short sequencing reads from male and female individuals of the KK population (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5A</ref>) to these scaffolds. The regions flanking OGI were male-specific or hyper-repetitive, often including palindrome-like structures (S13 Fig), that are consistent with the sequence context of sex chromosomes in animal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Putative pseudo-autosomal region (PAR)-like sequences, which include both X-and Y-allelic genes, were observed only 200-300 kb from OGI (Fig 6A ). Such a short Y-specific region is consistent with our previous results <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The silent divergence rate (dS) between the X and Y alleles of the genes located within the PAR-like sequences decreased with increasing distance from OGI, but was always higher than the interspecific dS rate between D. lotus and other Diospyros species (Fig 6B ), suggesting that recombination was suppressed in the regions flanking OGI before the divergence of some Diospyros species. Large structural variation specific to male (or large male-specific region) were frequently observed within the PAR-like sequences (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6A</ref>). Contrary to the observation of synteny around MeGI and SiMeGI, sequence similarity between the regions surrounding OGI (Chr. 15) and MeGI (Chr. 13), was only observed in the transcriptional regions of MeGI and OGI (S14 Fig) . No significant gene order synteny was observed using SynMap (CoGe). Finally, the phylogenetic relationship between SiMeGI, MeGI, and the inverted and forward repeats of OGI (S15 Fig) <ref type="figure">suggested</ref> that the inverted structure of OGI was derived from local inversion after segmental duplication of MeGI and (proto)OGI. Altogether, these results suggest that OGI was not derived from a wholegenome duplication event but from a local segmental duplication event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transitions towards dioecy are associated with duplication events</head><p>Our results suggest the following working hypothesis for the evolutionary path into dioecy in Diospyros. The Diospyros-specific WGD event, Dd-α resulted in the appearance of MeGI and promoted the neofunctionalization of this gene into a dominant suppressor of androecium, as a feminization factor. This was followed by a second, segmental duplication of MeGI to derive a Y-encoded OGI, which is a dominant repressor of MeGI (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref>). Interestingly, the information available so far from other dioecious species hints at the possibility that this type of pattern may have played a role in the evolution of dioecy in other species. For example, in the establishment of dioecy in garden asparagus, the Y-encoded putative sex determinant, SOFF, is thought to have originated from an Asparagus-specific gene duplication event, which was followed by the acquisition of its function as a dominant suppressor of feminization (SuF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Furthermore, the Y-encoded putative sex determinant in kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.), Shy Girl, which acts as a dominant suppressor of feminization, also arose via an Actinidia-specific duplication event <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, probably one of the Actinidia-specific WGD events, Ad-α <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. These parallel paths towards the independent evolution of all three of these sex determinants is probably not Genomic context of the Y-chromosomal region surrounding OGI. a, Read coverage from male (blue) and female (pink) samples and male/female coverage ratio across the scaffolds covering the male-specific region of the Y-chromosome. For both the male and female reads, expected coverage a single-copy sites is approximately 20 (grey lines across). This male-specific region was assembled via anchoring of the scaffolds with BAC sequences. Approximately 1.3Mb region was covered by Y-allelic scaffolds. More than 400kb of long repetitive sequences (dotted lines), flank OGI. Outer regions of these hyper repetitive sequences contain malespecific sequences (blue bands in M/F rate) and pseudo autosomal region (PAR)-like sequences (orange lines), where M/F rate was less than 70%, and the percentage of repetitive sequences was much lower. b, The silent divergence rate (dS) between X and Y alleles of the genes located in the PAR-like sequences (orange circles) decreases with distance to OGI. Stil, for most of these genes, the dS value between the X and Y alleles was larger than the average interspecific dS between the X alleles of D. lotus and D. mespiliformis (green square and dotted line), D. lotus and D. virginiana (blue square and dotted line), and D. lotus and D. kaki (red square dotted line). These results suggest that, in these PAR-like sequences, recombination between the X and Y alleles was suppressed before the divergence of Diospyros species, or at least predates the divergence between D. lotus and D. kaki. dS values for genes located in the regions closest to OGI are comparable to dS values between OGI and MeGI (gray circle, dS = 0.205), which suggest that little or no recombination occurred between these sequences after the establishment of OGI. In comparison, dS values between the X and Y alleles of genes located in the recombining region of chromosomes 15 are much lower (while circles on the right).</p><p><ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008566.g006">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008566.g006</ref> </p><p>coincidental, but consistent with the theoretical framework described above. In flowering plants, transition into separated sexuality requires the appearance and selection of a gain-offunction event in order to acquire a dominant suppressor(s), such as MeGI. Whole-genome duplication events provide good opportunities for such a scenario. The concentration of independent paleoplodization events in the K-Pg boundary is consistent with the adaptive evolution of plants against the substantial environmental changes, including mass extinction of their pollinators that took place at the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. A selfing habit engendered by polyploidy would be advantageous, but protracted evolutionary success would be favored by an eventual return to outcrossing. The neofunctionalization of MeGI resulting in the acquisition of a lineage-specific new sexual system could be one of these adaptive strategies. This hypothesis is also consistent with the observed wide diversity of sex determination system within plants.</p></div>

Kunsenshi-male were burst in the dark for 2-weeks to harvest chlorophyll-starved young leaves (S10 Table ). High molecular weight DNA were extracted The Dd-α event triggered positive selection on the 5-end and bZIP motifs, resulting in the acquisition of a new role for MeGI as repressor of male organs. This was potentially associated with the first switch in sexual system, from hermaprhodistism to monoeocy. The following duplication event, a segmental event, resulted in formation of OGI, containing an inverted repeat, which acquired the function of repression of MeGI expression via small-RNA production.

Approximately 1.5 μg of genomic DNA was used for the construction of Illumina genomic libraries; the DNA was fragmented using NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase (New England BioLabs; NEB) for 40-60 min at 37˚C and cleaned using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Tokyo, Japan) for size selection. To select fragments ranging between 300 and 600 bp, 27 μl of AMPure was added to the 63 μl reaction. After a brief incubation at RT, 90 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 20 μl water and 30 μl AMPure were added. After a second brief incubation at RT, the supernatant was discarded and the DNA was eluted from the beads in 20 μl of water, as recommended. Next, DNA fragments were subjected to end repair using NEB's End Repair Module Enzyme Mix, and A-base overhangs were added with Klenow (NEB), as recommended by the manufacturer.

Briefly, bud samples were fixed in FAA (1.8% formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid, 50% ethanol), dehydrated using an ethanol: t-butanol series, and then embedded in paraffin. The embedded tissues were sliced into ca 10-μm sections, and the sections were mounted on FRONTIER coated glass slide (Matsunami Glass Ind., Japan). Paraffin was removed with xylene, and the tissue sections were rehydrated in an ethanol series. The tissue sections were then incubated in a Proteinase K solution (700U/mL Proteinase K, 50mM EDTA, 0.1M Tris-HCl pH 7.5) for 30 min at 37˚C, followed by acetylation with acetic anhydride (0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine solution) for 10 min. Full length MeGI and SiMeGI cDNA sequences were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, WI, USA) to synthesize the DIG-labelled probes, respectively. Antisense RNA probes were synthesized using the DIGlabeling RNA synthesis kit (Roche, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The probe solution including RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) was applied to the slides and covered with parafilm. Hybridization was performed at 48˚C for &gt;16 h. For detection, 0.1% Anti-Digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was used as the secondary antibody to stain with NBT/BCIP solutions.  <ref type="figure">-c</ref>).

Further details about these SNPs and Indels are available from the Persimmon Genome Database (<ref type="url" target="http://persimmon.kazusa.or.jp">http://persimmon.kazusa.or.jp</ref>) (PDF)    Validation: Takashi Akagi.</p></div>
