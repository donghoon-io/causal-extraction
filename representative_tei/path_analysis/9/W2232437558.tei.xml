<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether the relationships between contextual factors and basic psychological needs were related to antisocial and prosocial behaviors in sport. A two-study project employing Bayesian path analysis was conducted with competitive athletes ( <ref type="table">Study 1,</ref><ref type="table">n = 291;</ref><ref type="table">Study 2,</ref><ref type="table">n = 272</ref>). Coach and teammate autonomy-supportive climates had meaningful direct relations with need satisfaction and prosocial behaviors. Coach and teammate controlling climates had meaningful direct relations with antisocial behaviors. Need satisfaction was both directly and indirectly related with both prosocial and antisocial behaviors; while moral disengagement was directly and indirectly related with antisocial behaviors. Overall, these findings reflected substantial evidence from the SDT literature that autonomy-supportive motivational climates are important environmental influences for need satisfaction; and are important correlates of prosocial behavior in sport. Whereas, controlling coach and teammate climates, along with moral disengagement, were important correlates of antisocial behavior in sport.</p></div>

Sport has a meaningful role to play, as an important socialization agency, with respect to anti/prosocial behavior. The terms antisocial and prosocial behavior have been used to refer to the inhibitive and proactive aspects of morality <ref type="bibr">(Kavussanu &amp; Boardley, 2009)</ref>. Antisocial behaviors are acts intended to harm or disadvantage another individual <ref type="bibr">(Kavussanu &amp; Boardley 2009)</ref>, whereas prosocial behaviors have been defined as acts intended to help or benefit another person <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Eisenberg &amp; Fabes, 1998)</ref>. For example, physically intimidating an opponent and verbally encouraging a teammate are antisocial and prosocial behaviors in sport, respectively.</p><p>In recent years researchers have examined self-determination theory (SDT; <ref type="bibr">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002)</ref> as a motivational framework to explain the psychological underpinnings of antisocial and prosocial variables in sport (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hodge &amp; Lonsdale, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ntoumanis &amp; Standage, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref> proposed that motivation can be characterized as existing along a continuum representing two broad types of motivation: autonomous motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation and self-determined forms of extrinsic motivation), and controlled motivation (i.e., non-self-determined or controlled extrinsic motivation).</p><p>Autonomous motivation is dominant when the three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are satisfied in a particular environment/context; in contrast, controlled motivation is dominant when these basic needs are not satisfied or thwarted <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref>. These three psychological needs are regarded as basic or fundamental to optimal functioning and well-being <ref type="bibr">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Feelings of autonomy indicate a perception of choice and an authentic sense of self-direction and volition; competence refers to a feeling that one has the ability and the opportunity to be effective in one's sport, and opportunities to express one's capacities; and relatedness is defined as a sense of mutual caring and connectedness with others (e.g., teammates and coaches). Controlled motivation has been shown to be positively linked to antisocial behaviors/attitudes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ntoumanis &amp; Standage, 2009)</ref>, whereas autonomous motivation has been shown to be positively associated with prosocial behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gagné, 2003)</ref>. However, despite the relevance of autonomous and controlled motivation, the specific role of the three basic psychological needs has not been examined to date with respect to antisocial and prosocial behavior. There is growing evidence in the sport domain (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adie, Duda, &amp; Ntoumanis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balaguer, González, Fabra, Castillo, Mercé, &amp; Duda, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Felton &amp; Jowett, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McDavid, Cox. &amp; McDonough, 2014</ref>) that basic need satisfaction directly influences affect, cognition, and behavior (i.e., not mediated by motivation); consequently, studies investigating this hypothesis with respect to antisocial and prosocial behavior appear warranted.</p><p>In this two-study research project we examined direct effects between contextual factors (i.e., coach and teammate autonomy-supportive vs. controlling climates) and basic psychological needs outlined in self-determination theory (SDT; <ref type="bibr">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref> with antisocial and prosocial behaviors in sport. We also investigated moral disengagement as a potential mediator of the relationship between basic psychological needs and antisocial behavior (Study 2). Recent research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hodge and Lonsdale (2011)</ref> investigated moral disengagement as a potential mediator of the relationship between controlled/autonomous motivation and antisocial behavior; thus, we extended their research by examining the relations with basic psychological needs. Moral disengagement is the selective use of psychosocial manoeuvres that allow an individual to transgress moral standards without experiencing negative affect (e.g., guilt, shame), thereby decreasing constraint on future antisocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 2006)</ref>. The concept of moral disengagement has recently been examined with respect to antisocial and prosocial behaviors in sport (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boardley &amp; Kavussanu, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Boardley, Grix &amp; Dewar, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Corrion, Long, Smith, &amp; d'Arripe-Longueville, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Psychological Needs and Anti/Prosocial Behavior</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Deci (2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Weinstein &amp; Ryan, 2010)</ref>, the extent to which the three basic needs are satisfied will influence the degree to which an individual engages in positive behaviors (e.g., prosocial behavior), whereas the extent to which these needs are frustrated (or thwarted) will influence the degree to which an individual engages in negative behaviors (e.g., antisocial behavior). Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT) is a sub-theory within SDT <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, 2002)</ref>, one of the most commonly used models of motivation, optimal growth and psychological well-being employed in psychology. Considerable research has demonstrated that satisfaction of these three basic needs predicts autonomous motivation <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002)</ref>, well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Molix &amp; Nichols, 2013)</ref>, and other positive outcomes in various life domains such as work, health <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baard, Deci, &amp; Ryan, 2004)</ref>, and exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gunnell, Crocker, Wilson, Mack, &amp; Zumbo, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref> have argued that humans are naturally inclined to be prosocial animals, given proper nurturing (e.g., an autonomy-supportive environment). When one lacks this nurturing, one is likely to substitute it by pursuing goals (e.g., gain ego enhancement, fame, and extrinsic rewards) that do not promote prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gagné, 2003)</ref>. In the few SDT-based studies that have examined moral functioning in sport, it has been shown that autonomously motivated athletes were more likely to report prosocial behaviors/attitudes <ref type="bibr">(Hodge &amp; Lonsdale, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ntoumanis &amp; Standage, 2009)</ref>, and avoidance of antisocial behaviors such as using performance-enhancing drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barkoukis, Lazuras, Tsorbatzoudis &amp; Rodafinos, 2011)</ref>; whereas controlled motivation was associated with antisocial behaviors/attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hodge, Hargreaves, Gerrard, &amp; Lonsdale, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ntoumanis &amp; Standage, 2009)</ref>. Although the role of autonomous versus controlled motivation has been examined</p><p>with respect to prosocial/antisocial behavior in sport, the role of basic psychological needs has not been examined relative to these moral variables. Given the importance of basic psychological need satisfaction with respect to autonomous/controlled motivation <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref>, the influence of autonomous/controlled motivation on prosocial/antisocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Weinstein &amp; Ryan, 2010)</ref>, and the empirical evidence that basic needs explain variance in sport-related variables beyond autonomous/controlled motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Felton &amp; Jowett, 2013)</ref>, the direct relations between basic needs and prosocial/antisocial behavior in sport appear to warrant investigation.</p><p>There is substantial evidence regarding the role of need satisfaction in sport, with studies indicating that autonomy, competence, and relatedness scores predict levels of autonomous motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Ntoumanis &amp; Standage, 2009)</ref>, sport continuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gucciardi &amp; Jackson, 2015)</ref>, well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Felton &amp; Jowett, 2013)</ref>, subjective vitality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balaguer et al., 2012)</ref>, athlete burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Li, Wang, Pyun, &amp; Kee, 2013)</ref>, mental toughness <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mahoney, Gucciardi, Ntoumanis, &amp; Mallett, 2014)</ref>, and performance in sport <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sheldon, Zhaoyang, &amp; Williams, 2013)</ref>. Given the theoretical and empirical links amongst need satisfaction, positive consequences (e.g., well-being), and negative consequences (e.g., burnout) in sport, it was expected that the satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness needs would predict positive relations with prosocial behavior, and negative relations with antisocial behavior in sport.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contextual Determinants of Anti/Prosocial Behavior in Sport</head><p>Research employing an SDT perspective has demonstrated the importance of considering contextual (autonomy-supportive and controlling motivational climates) as well as person (basic needs; autonomous and controlled motivation) variables with respect to antisocial and prosocial variables in sport (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hodge et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ntoumanis &amp; Standage, 2009)</ref>. From a BPNT standpoint, the influence of autonomy-supportive versus controlling motivational climates is viewed as a fundamental environmental influence for the satisfaction of the three basic needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moreau, &amp; Mageau, 2012)</ref>. Motivational climate refers to the goals and behaviors emphasized, and the values that are salient, in the social environment created by significant others (e.g., coaches, teammates, peers <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baard, et al., 2004)</ref>. A number of authors have contended that the coach is one of the most influential individuals in the athlete's sport experience and the contextual environment the coach creates amongst his/her team/training squad (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gagné, Ryan, &amp; Bargmann, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rutten, Schuengel, Dirks, Stams, Biesta, &amp; Hoeksma, 2011)</ref>. Teammates and training partners can also influence the creation of an autonomy-supportive versus a controlling climate through means similar to those of the coach <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hodge et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kipp &amp; Weiss, 2013)</ref>. Consequently, it is important to identify the relevance of teammate-driven as well as coach-driven climates with respect to need satisfaction (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jõesaar, Hein &amp; Hagger, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moreau &amp; Mageau, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ntoumanis, Taylor, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In a controlling environment, coaches and teammates may behave in a coercive, pressuring, and authoritarian way, and employ strategies such as manipulation, obedience, guilt induction, controlling competence feedback, and conditional regard to impose a specific and preconceived way of thinking and behaving upon their athletes/teammates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bartholomew et al., 2010)</ref>. In contrast, in an autonomy-supportive environment athletes are provided with choice and a rationale for tasks, their feelings are acknowledged, opportunities to show 6 initiative and independent work are provided, athletes are given non-controlling competence feedback, and overt control is avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gagné et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kipp &amp; Weiss, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Control, whether by external forces or by oneself, entails regulatory processes that are more rigid, involve greater pressure, tension and a more negative emotional tone, and result in less integrated motivation <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002)</ref> as well as potential antisocial behavior. On the other hand, researchers have argued that autonomous motivation is a central determinant of prosocial behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gagné, 2003)</ref> -the assumption in the present research was that motivation for prosocial behavior would be enriched by autonomy-supportive climates and dampened by controlling climates, because these factors affect the satisfaction of basic psychological needs. Thus, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gagné (2003)</ref> asserted, autonomy-support should orient people toward paying more attention to others, and therefore more likely to engage in prosocial behavior and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rutten et al., 2011)</ref>. In contrast, controlling climates should orient people toward paying less attention to others, and therefore more likely to engage in antisocial behavior and less likely to engage in prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hodge et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Contextual variables and the social environment also play an important role in determining moral thought and action <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandura, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Long, Pantaléon, Bruant, &amp; d'Arripe-Longueville, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ntoumanis et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rutten et al., 2011)</ref>. Athletes who perceive controlling climates may morally disengage by displacing responsibility for their actions on their coach/teammates (e.g., it's not my fault), by blaming the people they harm in response to provocation (e.g., he/she deserved it), or by justifying antisocial behaviors as a legitimate means to a desired end emphasized by the coach and teammates (e.g., to help my team win). Moral disengagement, therefore, may mediate the relations between controlling climates, basic need satisfaction, and antisocial behaviors.</p><p>Moral Disengagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandura (2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bandura ( , 2006) )</ref> suggested that in the development of moral agency, individuals engage in a self-regulatory process in which they adopt standards of right and wrong that serve as guides for their conduct. Individuals monitor their conduct and the conditions under which it occurs, judge it in relation to their moral standards and perceived circumstances, and regulate their actions by the consequences they apply to themselves. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bandura (2006)</ref>, transgressive conduct is regulated by two major sources of sanctions, social sanctions and internalized self-sanctions, that operate anticipatorily. With social sanctions, individuals refrain from transgressing because they fear that such conduct will bring them social censure.</p><p>Whereas with internalized self-sanctions, individuals behave prosocially because it produces self-satisfaction and self-respect and they refrain from antisocial behavior because such actions would provoke self-censure and self-reproof <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Known collectively as the 'mechanisms of moral disengagement', <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandura (2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bandura ( , 2006) )</ref> argued that the use of eight psychological manoeuvres allows individuals to transgress moral standards without experiencing negative affect (e.g., self-censure, guilt), thereby decreasing constraint on future negative behavior. The eight mechanisms of moral disengagement are: moral justification, euphemistic labeling, advantageous comparison, displacement of responsibility, dehumanization, attribution of blame, distortion of consequences, and diffusion of responsibility. These eight mechanisms are explained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandura (2002)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Boardley and Kavussanu (2011)</ref> have offered sport examples for each mechanism. Moral disengagement has been associated with antisocial behaviors in sport (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Boardley et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Corrion et al, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hodge et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stanger, Kavussanu, Boardley, &amp; Ring, 2013)</ref>, and inversely linked to prosocial behavior in team sports <ref type="bibr">(Boardley &amp; Kavussanu, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose and Hypotheses</head><p>The purpose of this two-study research project was to examine both direct and indirect (mediator) relations amongst contextual factors (i.e., autonomy-supportive vs.</p><p>controlling climates), basic psychological needs, moral disengagement, and antisocial and prosocial behaviors in sport. In these studies we extended previous SDT research on antisocial and prosocial behavior in sport by (i) integrating basic psychological needs variables with prosocial behaviors (Study 1), (ii) integrating basic psychological needs variables with both prosocial and antisocial behaviors, and with moral disengagement (Study 2), (iii) assessing controlling as well as autonomy-supportive climates (Study 2), and (iv) assessing teammate as well as coach autonomy-supportive and controlling climates (Study 2).</p><p>Study 1. We hypothesized that an autonomy-supportive coach climate would have a positive direct effect with prosocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents, and that those effects would be mediated by basic psychological need satisfaction. We tested the following specific hypotheses in Study 1 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>H1a: autonomy support from the coach will have a positive direct effect with need satisfaction.</p><p>H1b: autonomy support from the coach will have a positive direct effect with prosocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents.</p><p>H1c: need satisfaction will have a positive direct effect with prosocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents.</p><p>H1d: the direct effect from autonomy support from the coach to prosocial behaviors will be mediated by need satisfaction.</p><p>Study 2. We extended upon Study 1 to include antisocial behaviors, and we examined moral disengagement as a potential mediator variable. Previous research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hodge and Lonsdale (2011)</ref> had investigated the role of moral disengagement with autonomous/controlled motivation, but not with basic needs. In addition, we extended our contextual environment focus to include controlling as well as autonomy-supportive climates, and in doing so we also assessed teammate as well as coach climates. As with Study 1, we hypothesized that an autonomy-supportive climate (coach and teammate) would have a positive direct effect with prosocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents, and those effects would be mediated by need satisfaction. We also hypothesized that controlling climates (coach and teammate) would have a positive direct effect with antisocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents, and those effects would be mediated by need satisfaction and moral disengagement. We tested the following specific hypotheses in Study 2 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>H2a: autonomy support (from coach and teammates) will have a positive direct effect with need satisfaction.</p><p>H2b: autonomy support (from coach and teammates) will have a positive direct effect with prosocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents.</p><p>H2c: need satisfaction will have a positive direct effect with prosocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents.</p><p>H2d: the direct effect from autonomy support (from coach and teammates) to prosocial behaviors would be mediated by need satisfaction.</p><p>H2e: controlling climates (from coach and teammates) will have an inverse direct effect with need satisfaction.</p><p>H2f: controlling climates (from coach and teammates) will have a positive direct effect with antisocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents.</p><p>H2g: need satisfaction will have an inverse direct effect with antisocial behaviors toward both teammates and opponents.</p><p>H2h: the direct effects between controlling climates (from coach and teammates) and antisocial behaviors will be mediated by need satisfaction.</p><p>H2i: the direct effects between controlling climates (from coach and teammates) and antisocial behaviors will be mediated by moral disengagement. and national senior representatives (n = 18).

This questionnaire assessed athletes' perceptions of autonomy-supportive behaviors exhibited by the coach in their major sport.</p><p>We adapted 14 items from the Health Care Climate Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Williams, Cox, Kouides, &amp; Deci, 1999)</ref> to assess autonomy-supportive coaching style (e.g., "I feel that my coach cares about me as a person").

Autonomy consisted of three interrelated subscales, namely, internal locus of causality (IPLOC; 3 items), perceived choice (4 items), and volition (3 items).

In contrast, theoretical expectations informed our priors regarding the direct effects between need satisfaction and prosocial behavior owing to the limited prior knowledge on these effects. Specifically, informative priors were modeled such that need satisfaction were expected to evidence a positive relation with prosocial behavior (μ = .40; σ 2 = .04). Noninformative priors were employed for residual variances and covariances among exogenous and endogenous variables. We employed a convergence criterion of .01 (van de <ref type="bibr">Schoot et al., 2015)</ref> and a minimum of 30,000 iterations each for two independent chains of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to generate the posterior distribution based on the parameter specifications and observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Muthén &amp; Asparouhov, 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this two-study project was to examine relationships amongst contextual factors, basic psychological needs, and moral disengagement with antisocial and prosocial behaviors in sport. We investigated both the direct and indirect (mediator) effects of psychological need satisfaction on antisocial and prosocial behaviors. We also examined moral disengagement as a potential mediator of the direct effects between the motivational climate and antisocial behaviors. In general, our BPNT and SDT hypotheses were supported.</p><p>These athletes reported high scores on their perceptions of coach autonomy-support (both studies) and teammate autonomy-support (Study 2), basic need satisfaction (both studies), and prosocial behavior towards both teammates and opponents (although opponents scores were moderate-high in both studies). These high scores were consistent with recent research in sport (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Adie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gunnell et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kavussanu &amp; Boardley, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kipp &amp; Weiss, 2013)</ref>. Study 2 revealed overall low scores on perceived coach and teammate controlling climates, moral disengagement, and antisocial behavior; which was also consistent with recent research in sport (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartholomew et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">Bartholomew et al., , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Boardley &amp; Kavussanu, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kavussanu &amp; Boardley, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stanger et al., 2013)</ref>. These SDT findings were positive given the evidence supporting adaptive psychological outcomes (e.g., subjective well-being, enjoyment, work/life satisfaction, less stress) stemming from autonomy-supportive climates and basic need satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Moreau &amp; Mageau, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Levels of moral disengagement and antisocial behavior towards both teammates and opponents were low (Study 2), which was heartening given the negative outcomes (e.g., aggressive behavior, cheating, doping) associated with these personal characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Boardley &amp; Kavussanu, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Corrion et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contextual Climates and Psychological Needs</head><p>Our results indicated that perceived autonomy-supportive climates from both coaches (Studies 1 and 2) and teammates (Study 2) had a direct positive relation with all three basic needs. These findings supported hypotheses H1a and H2a. On the other hand, perceived controlling climates (coach and teammates) were not of a magnitude that was important (negatively) for the prediction of basic need satisfaction in Study 2; this finding refuted hypothesis H2e. In general, these findings reflected substantial evidence from the BPNT and SDT literatures (across multiple life domains) that autonomy-supportive versus controlling motivational climates are critical environmental influences for the satisfaction of the three basic needs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gagné, et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moreau, &amp; Mageau, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, our results also supported the importance of 'peer' (i.e., teammates, friends, coworkers) autonomy-supportive climates in addition to coach climates with respect to need satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jõesaar et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Moreau &amp; Mageau, 2012)</ref>. Autonomy-supportive climates have been shown to predict need satisfaction in sport (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balaguer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, Ryan, Bosch, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2011)</ref>, with autonomysupportive coaches more likely to consider the athlete's perspective, offer a rationale for coaching decisions, and promote choice and decision-making for their athletes. It is assumed in BPNT that such interpersonal behaviors will lead to greater need satisfaction --our results supported this assumption, but also highlighted the importance of autonomy-supportive teammate climates with respect to need satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contextual Climates and Anti/Prosocial Behavior</head><p>As hypothesized perceived autonomy-supportive climates showed a direct positive relation with prosocial behavior toward teammates in both studies (H1b; H2b); Study 2 results indicated that both coach and teammate autonomy-supportive climates predicted prosocial behavior towards both teammates and opponents. These direct effects were partially mediated by need satisfaction (H1d; H2d), but only with respect to prosocial behavior towards teammates (both studies), and two of the basic needs (i.e., relatedness, competence).</p><p>The latter finding indicated a differential relationship between autonomy-supportive climates, basic needs, and teammate versus opponent-focused prosocial behaviors. Perhaps the athletes in our two studies were more inclined to act in a prosocial manner towards people with whom they had a personal relationship (i.e., teammates) as opposed to those with whom they had an impersonal relationship (i.e., opponents). Nevertheless, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hodge and Lonsdale (2011)</ref> the items used to measure prosocial and antisocial behaviors toward teammates and opponents may have influenced these results. Prosocial and antisocial opponent behaviors, as measured by the PABSS, were both verbal and physical, whereas teammate behaviors were only verbal. Consequently, it was not possible to determine if motivational climates were differentially predictive of behaviors toward teammates versus opponents, or the type of behavior assessed (i.e., verbal vs. physical).</p><p>Our Study 2 findings indicated that the perception of controlling climates from teammates, but not coaches, had a direct positive relation with self-reported antisocial behavior towards both teammates and opponents (H2f). Controlling climates reflect influences based upon coercive demands and reward contingencies (i.e., external regulation), and/or an athlete's sense of guilt or obligation (i.e., introjected regulation). Such pressures force athletes into engaging in requested behaviors (e.g., antisocial behaviors) that are carried out, but likely do not reflect personal endorsement on the athlete's behalf <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bartholomew et al., 2010)</ref>. The relationships between controlling climates and antisocial behaviors were mediated by need satisfaction (hypothesis H2h), which was consistent with the BPNT and SDT literatures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Felton &amp; Jowett, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gagné, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ntoumanis &amp; Standage, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Study 2 also revealed a mediating effect for relatedness and prosocial behavior towards opponents (for both coach and teammate climates). Given that the basic need for relatedness has previously been regarded as less important than the other needs <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref>, our finding that relatedness was an important mediator in the relationship between motivational climate and prosocial behavior was notable. Indeed, this finding supported recent research indicating that relatedness predicts prosocial behavior (i.e., volunteering and charitable donations; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pavey, Greitemeyer, &amp; Sparks, 2011)</ref>, and that sport is a context in which relatedness emerges as a significant predictor of well-being over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gunnell et al., 2013)</ref>. Since relatedness focuses on caring about others (and being cared for oneself), this basic need should logically have a strong relationship with prosocial behaviors which are characterized by an altruistic concern for the welfare of others. Consequently future research should investigate not whether relatedness is important in sport, but under what circumstances it is important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Needs and Prosocial Behavior</head><p>Results from both studies indicated that basic need satisfaction had a direct positive relationship with self-reported prosocial behavior (towards teammates only), but only two of the basic needs (i.e., relatedness, competence) were found to be of a magnitude that is important. Alongside these direct relations, the basic needs of relatedness and competence partially mediated the relationship between autonomy support and prosocial behavior towards teammates (Study 1). Similar findings were found in Study 2, with the basic needs of relatedness and competence partially mediating the relationship between autonomy support and prosocial behavior towards teammates (but not opponents). These findings provided partial support for hypotheses H1c and H2c. As mentioned earlier, Study 2 also revealed a positive relationship between the basic need for relatedness and prosocial behavior towards opponents. This relationship appeared to reflect the 'other-focus' aspect of the basic need for relatedness (i.e., caring for others and being cared for, by others; <ref type="bibr">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, these results were consistent with the BPNT and SDT literatures with respect to need satisfaction and positive psychological outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gagné et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kipp &amp; Weiss, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McDavid et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Molix &amp; Nichols, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pavey et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the absence of significant effects with the basic need for autonomy was unexpectedgiven the volitional, self-regulatory nature of moral agency and prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 2006)</ref> we expected need satisfaction for autonomy to have an important direct effect with prosocial behavior. On the other hand, there is some recent evidence for a lesser role for autonomy in some circumstances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pavey et al., 2011)</ref>; moreover, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adie et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavior</head><p>The perception of controlling coach and teammate climates predicted higher levels of moral disengagement, whereas moral disengagement and controlling teammates influenced higher levels of antisocial behavior towards opponents and teammates (Study 2). In contrast, perceived coach autonomy support predicted lower levels of antisocial behavior toward one's teammates. These findings supported previous research in both sport and non-sport environments that has demonstrated the important influence that contextual variables have on moral thought and action <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandura, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Long et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ntoumanis et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rutten et al., 2011)</ref>.

On the other hand, controlling climates should orient people toward paying less attention to others, and therefore more likely to engage in antisocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hodge et al., 2013)</ref> and less likely to engage in prosocial behavior.</p><p>Basic need satisfaction had an inverse direct relationship with antisocial behavior towards opponents, but not teammates (Study 2), providing partial support for hypothesis H2g. These findings were consistent with the BPNT and SDT literatures with respect to inverse relations between need satisfaction and negative psychological outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balaguer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Li et al., 2013)</ref>. Nevertheless, inverse relations between high levels of need satisfaction and antisocial behavior do not address potential positive relations between antisocial behavior and low levels of need satisfaction or with need thwarting. Indeed, low levels of need satisfaction do not necessarily equate to need thwarting. Psychological need thwarting is conceptualized as the perception that need satisfaction is being actively obstructed, impeded, blocked or frustrated in a specific context <ref type="bibr">(Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, Ryan, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2011)</ref>. Need thwarting has been associated with negative and maladaptive outcomes in sport (e.g., negative affect, depression, disordered eating, burnout; <ref type="bibr">Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, Ryan, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, Ryan, Bosch, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gunnell et al., 2013)</ref> and it would seem logical to hypothesize that need thwarting would have a positive relationship with antisocial behavior in sport. Unfortunately we did not measure need thwarting in either of our studies; future research should assess these variables in relation to both antisocial and prosocial behavior.</p><p>Study 2 findings also indicated that perceived controlling coaches and teammates predicted higher levels of moral disengagement, whereas moral disengagement and controlling teammates led to higher levels of antisocial behaviour towards opponents and teammates (supporting H2f and H2i). In Study 2 moral disengagement, coach and teammate climates, and need satisfaction explained an important amount of variance in antisocial behavior towards one's teammates (42%) and opponents (48%). These findings provided partial support for hypotheses H2f, H2g and H2h. Moreover, moral disengagement partially mediated the relation between both controlling coach and teammate climates and antisocial behavior towards both teammates and opponents (study 2; supporting hypothesis H2i). These moral disengagement findings reflected evidence from a number of studies that have substantiated the relation between moral disengagement and antisocial behaviors in sport <ref type="bibr">(Boardley &amp; Kavussanu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Boardley et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Corrion et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kavussanu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stanger et al., 2013)</ref>. Athletes who perceive their coach and/or teammates as being high on controlling behaviors may have higher levels of moral disengagement because they will have increased exposure to coaching/teammate behaviors that promote compliance with authority (e.g., coercion, obedience, conditional regard), rather than an internalization and subsequent self-regulation of moral values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandura (2002)</ref> refers to such a process as 'gradualistic moral disengagement' which results in a decrease in self-regulation of moral action (cf. autonomy) and a potential increase in antisocial behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths, Limitations and Future Research</head><p>We extended previous SDT research on antisocial and prosocial behavior in sport by (i) integrating basic psychological needs variables with prosocial and antisocial behaviors, (ii) integrating basic needs and moral disengagement, (iii) assessing controlling as well as autonomy-supportive climates, and (iv) assessing teammate as well as coach autonomysupportive and controlling climates. Analytically, we demonstrated the usefulness of Bayesian estimation for the integration of prior knowledge with new data. Nevertheless, like all research these studies were not without limitations. First, we relied on self-report, crosssectional data; consequently no causal relationships can be inferred from these findings.</p><p>Second, both samples were from a young adult population, which limits the generalizability to other age groups. Third, some athletes were surveyed in their immediate off-season and they had to recall experiences from the previous season for their sport.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balaguer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, Ryan, Bosch, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gunnell et al., 2013)</ref>, and a sport-specific need thwarting questionnaire has been developed <ref type="bibr">(Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, Ryan, &amp; Thøgersen-Ntoumani, 2011)</ref>.

Alongside these direct effects, two indirect pathways were found to be of a magnitude that is important with Bayesian estimation. Perceived autonomy support influenced prosocial behavior towards teammates via satisfaction of relatedness (unstandardized estimate = .06, 95% CI [.03, .09]) and competence needs (unstandardized estimate = .03, 95% CI</p>[.01, 06]</p>). These Bayesian indirect effects were corroborated with MLR estimation both in terms of magnitude and direction, as well as their statistical relevance (i.e., confidence intervals did not encompass zero). 36), provincial senior representatives (n = 38) and national senior representatives (n = 14). Ethical approval was received from the first author's university ethics committee and informed consent partners. Participants responded to the following stem: "This questionnaire contains items that are related to your experience with your teammates/training partners. Teams (training squads) have different interaction styles, and we would like to know more about how you have felt about your encounters with your teammates/training partners."</p>Controlling coach/teammate climate. We used the Coach Controlling Behaviors Scale (CCBS;</p><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartholomew et al., 2010)</ref> </p>to assess the controlling dimension of coaching style/climate. The CCBS is a 15-item questionnaire, answers are given on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree). There are four subscales of controlling interpersonal styles that have been identified; controlling use of rewards (e.g. "My coach only rewards/praises me to make me train harder"; 4 items), negative conditional regard (e.g. "My</p></note></figure>

Notwithstanding these limitations, our findings provide important insights into the moral and motivational underpinnings of antisocial and prosocial behaviors in sport. Future research should (i) employ longitudinal designs, (ii) assess direct behavioral observations of antisocial and prosocial behaviors, and (iii) experimentally examine the efficacy of interventions designed to increase autonomy-supportive motivational climates and basic need satisfaction (i.e., which, in turn, should decrease moral disengagement and antisocial behavior, and increase prosocial behavior). Finally, future research should also examine the issue of need thwarting instead of only measuring levels of need satisfaction. Recently, a number of authors have examined need thwarting in sport (e.g.,</figDesc><table /></figure>
