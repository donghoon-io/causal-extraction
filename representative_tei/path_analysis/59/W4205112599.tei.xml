<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Research suggests a link between acquired head injury and signs of conduct disorder, with a majority of findings based on retrospective reports and comparison samples. The relationship between head injuries and conduct problems and how they may influence one another during development is currently unclear. This study aimed to investigate direct and indirect associations between head injury and conduct problems through to early adolescence.</p><p>Methods: Data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study was used to investigate the relationship between conduct problems as assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and parent reported head injury over time, at ages 9 months, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 years, using a cross-lagged path analysis. This is data from 18,552 children, participating in a UK cohort study that is representative of the UK population. We included 7,041 (3,308 male) children, who had full information about head injuries and conduct problems at age 14.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>We found a mutual association between childhood head injuries and conduct problems but with distinct timings: Head injury between 5-7 years predicted greater chance of conduct problems at age 11 and 14 years, while greater conduct problems at 5 years predicted a significantly greater chance of a head injury at age 7-11 years.</p><p>Conclusions: These findings have important implications for the timing of preventive and ameliorative interventions. Prior to school entry, interventions aiming to reduce conduct problems would appear most effective at reducing likelihood of head injuries in future years. However, equivalent interventions targeting head injuries would be better timed either as children are entering formal primary education, or soon after they have entered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Conduct problems encompass aggressive, destructive and deceptive behaviour, such as violating rules or social norms or breaking the law. If these problems are an ongoing pattern, conduct disorder can be diagnosed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Conduct disorder is associated with risk taking behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , probably due to impaired fear conditioning, hyporeactivity to incentives and impairments of the paralimbic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</p><p>While research has shown that losing one's temper and displays of mild aggression are common amongst healthy children <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , aggressive behaviour that overcomes expected age-related and social norms in childhood has a high degree of persistency 6,7 . This is often followed by clinically significant problems arising in adolescence and adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref> , such as greater delinquency, violence, poor mental and physical health, and economic problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">11</ref> . Potential causes of conduct problems in young people are diverse and include social, familial and neurodevelopmental risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">11</ref> . One of these risk factors is head injury.</p><p>Head injury is the main cause of death and disability for children and adolescents in the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">12</ref> . Up to 1.4 million individuals attend hospital for a head injury in England and Wales each year, and around 33% to 50% of those are children and adolescents younger than 15 years old <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">12</ref> . Although head injuries and TBIs are not clearly distinct, partially because most individuals with a head injury will not receive a brain scan, a difference between mild head injuries and TBIs can be made based on clinical criteria. The national institute for health and care excellence (NICE) define head injuries as any trauma to the head excluding superficial facial injuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">12</ref> , while it defines TBIs as head injuries resulting in structural damage and/or new onset or worsening disruption of brain function such as amnesia or aphasia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">12</ref> . Some studies have found a relationship between head injuries and aggressive or delinquent behaviour. For instance, some clinical studies have shown increased aggressive behaviour following TBIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref> , and TBIs have been shown to be more common in offenders than in non-offenders <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref> . Two longitudinal studies showed that head injuries in adolescence predicted more interpersonal violence in early adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">21</ref> , and violent behaviour one year later <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">22</ref> . However, pre-existing conduct problems also have also been shown to be exacerbated by TBIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref> and it is therefore important to take into account pre-injury levels of aggressive behaviour when assessing the effects of TBIs or head injuries more generally.</p><p>Only 10.9% of TBIs that are reported to an emergency department are moderate or severe <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30</ref> .</p><p>Mild head injuries without severe consequences (e.g. bumping one's head without losing consciousness) are common in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">31</ref> , and their often persistent and progressive long-term consequences are less well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">32</ref> . It is therefore largely unclear how head injuries and conduct problems may be related across development. Furthermore, the direction of the association between head injury and conduct problems is currently unclear, i.e. does a head injury lead to more conduct problems or do conduct problems increase the likelihood of head injuries? This is particularly true for children. Reflecting on the source of the current uncertainty in the literature, there are a number of methodological limitations including: a) frequent use of small and niche populations (clinical samples, moderate -severe TBI, criminal offending populations), which limits generalisability; b) reliance on retrospective, self-report data, which limits reliability and validity; and c) a use of cross-sectional designs, which do not allow a developmental interpretation of the relationship between head injuries and conduct problems.</p><p>Therefore, the current study uses a nationally representative UK cohort that were surveyed six times from age 9 months to 14 years between 2000-2015 to investigate the relationship between head injury and conduct problems in children over time. To account for other well-established risk factors for conduct problems, such as male gender and low family income <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">33</ref> , these were included as covariates in this study. Based on previous research we hypothesised that conduct problems and incidence of head injury exacerbate each other over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study uses Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref> , which follows the development of 19,517 children born between 2000-2002 in the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">39</ref> . Families were initially recruited via random sampling using all listed parents on the UK Child Benefit registers. The study is disproportionally stratified to allow areas of minority (e.g. ethnic minorities and disadvantaged areas) to be sufficiently signified, resulting in a nationally representative cohort. The MCS includes weight variables to allow for accurate representation of all population groups. Interviews with parents took place when the children's age was 9 months (T1), 3 (T2), 5 (T3), 7 (T4), 11 (T5), and 14 years (T6). Parents gave written informed consent. This secondary data analysis was approved by the University of Southampton Ethics Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Only first-born children were included in this study, to minimise family related extraneous variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">41</ref> . After matching data across all time points for first-borns (T1-6), the dataset included n = 18,552 participants. In addition, children were excluded if they had a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or any indicators of epilepsy (e.g. seizures, Febrile fits and Fainting due to seizures) at any MCS data sweep, due to the increased risk of head injury associated with both diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">43</ref> . N = 497 had an ADHD diagnosis, n = 887 had an epilepsy diagnosis, n = 45 had both, overall excluded n = 1339. There are different possibilities to handle missing date. For our analyses, only participants with no missing data for the outcome variables at the latest data sweep of the MCS (T6) were included <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">44</ref> , resulting in n = 7041 (n = 3308 male) participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">45</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Conduct Problems. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[48]</ref> has 25 items with a three-point rating scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true, 3 = certainly true), and five subscales: hyperactivity / inattention, emotional difficulties, conduct problems, peer problems and the prosocial behaviour subscale, with good overall psychometric properties and good performance as screening instruments for a number of psychiatric diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">50</ref> . SDQ parent-rated data was collected from T2 (age 3). This study used the conduct problems subscale (5 items), with questions regarding aggressive behaviour, e.g. 'often fights with other children or bullies them'. A higher score indicates a higher level of conduct problems (possible range: 0-10).</p><p>Head injury. At each data sweep parents reported if their child had experienced any accidents or injuries since the last data sweep. If yes, the frequency of accidents/ injuries was recorded and several injuries could be further defined: 'Thinking about the most severe (or only) accident or injury, what sort of accident or injury was it?' The responses were then coded into categories by interviewers (For the full list of injury categories see supplement 1). For the current study, a binary measure of Head Injury was constructed:</p><p>1. Bang to the head (coded 1) encompassing those coded with a 'loss of consciousness/knocked out', or 'injury to the head without being knocked out', 2) No head injury (coded 0) including no injuries and every injury other than head injury.</p><p>Covariates. Income and gender have been found to be associated with problematic behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">33</ref> . Cohort member's gender (n = 3308 male [47%]) and OECD equivalized household income (mean = 315, SD = 205, n = 6968) from T1 were therefore included in the path analysis.</p><p>Males were coded 1, females 2. Data analysis. Weights were used. Mplus 7.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">51</ref> was used to run a cross-lagged path analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) to test reciprocal influences on head injury and conduct problems, with weighted least square means to account for missing data. Path analysis involves estimating direct, indirect, and total effects (which is the sum of the direct effect plus all indirect effects). The indirect effects can also be summed to produce a total indirect effect. For a classic primer on direct, indirect, and total effects see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">52</ref> . These effects are estimated as matter of course within the Mplus software.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref> .</p></div>

The cross-lagged path analysis of head injury and conduct problems for UK children aged Considering direct effects linking variables at time T to time T+1: conduct problems at each time point significantly predicted conduct problems at the following time point as did head injury. For direct and indirect effects linking variables at time T to variables at time points later than T+1: head injury at age 7 had a significant direct effect on conduct problems at age 11 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and an indirect effect on conduct problems at age 14 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Conduct problems at age 3 had a significant indirect effect on head injury at age 11 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) but there were no significant direct effects of conduct problems on head injury (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</p></div>

Surprisingly, females showed greater average parent-reported conduct problems at age 14 than males.</p><p>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to characterise the relationship between conduct problems and head injuries between age 9 months to 14 years in a sample of children representative of the general population in the UK. The results show three ways in which head injuries and conduct problems are associated across development. Most importantly though, head injuries at most ages did not lead to a direct increase in conduct problems or vice versa. Only head injury between 5-7 years was a significant risk factor for conduct problems (at age 11 and 14). Further, only greater conduct problems between 1-3 years was a risk factor for head injury (at age 11).</p><p>Setting these results in context, previous studies in community samples have found increased problematic behaviour in adolescents following or associated with a head injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">54</ref>  Severity of head injury (e.g. loss of consciousness, amnesia) may play a role with regard to conduct problems but results have been mixed. A small study found that children with mild TBIs did not differ from children with orthopaedic injuries and both were significantly less aggressive than children with severe TBIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">55</ref> , while other studies found that TBIs of all severity were associated with more conduct problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">56</ref> . Catroppa and colleagues (2008) showed that injury severity significantly predicted postinjury behavioural problems in 2-6 year olds, however, behaviour pre-injury was the strongest predictor and should be controlled for <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">57</ref> . While only a minority of head injuries in this study resulted in loss of consciousness, injuries were significant enough that most children were taken to hospital.</p><p>The data are representative of the UK population and therefore provide a clearer picture of the relationship between head injury and conduct problems, without focusing on severe cases. The findings are important because head injuries are common but are mild in the majority of cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">31</ref> . It would be interesting to explore the difference between head injuries with and without a loss of consciousness. However, the number of children with a severe head injury was too small for a complex model, particularly at T1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>).</p><p>The exact relationship between age at injury and conduct problems has also remained unclear, with some contradictory findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">59</ref> . A twin study showed that head injuries early in childhood were associated with a delayed decline in impulsivity and greater increase in reactive aggressiveness by adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">60</ref> . However, head injury was assessed retrospectively. Our results indicate that age at injury plays a role. While head injuries do not lead to higher levels of conduct problems at most ages, it appears that they can, if occurring between age 5-7. Our results also showed that there was an indirect effect of conduct problems at age 3 on likelihood of head injury at age 11. This is roughly in line with a previous study showing that aggressive behaviour predicts rate of any accidental injuries in 5-10 year olds <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">61</ref> . Previous cross-sectional studies regarding the link between head injury and aggressive behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[64]</ref> were unable to determine whether head injury leads to aggression, or if aggression leads to head injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">65</ref> . Our results suggest that both can be the case.</p><p>The results have important implications for the timing of preventive and ameliorative interventions. Interventions aiming to reduce conduct problems might be most effectively tailored to children before they enter school, to reduce likelihood of subsequent head injury. Interventions targeting the prevention of head injury in order to reduce subsequent conduct problems might be most effective when children enter formal primary education, or in the early period of primary education.</p><p>The education system could facilitate interventions in early primary school. For instance, accident prevention, particularly in boys, might be an effective strategy to reduce head injuries. It would be useful to identify where most head injuries occur (school or home setting, sports, etc.). Interventions identifying and treating conduct problems prior to school entry may be more difficult and involve parent training or screening by the GP. Existing parent trainings for conduct problems in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">66</ref> should include head injury prevention aspects.</p><p>Conduct problems decreased from age 3 over time. Furthermore, conduct problems significantly predicted conduct problems at each following time point. This finding is in line with previous research, showing that physical aggression tends to decrease in early childhood in the majority of children <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">68</ref> and that children typically follow stable trajectories <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">69</ref> ; for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">70</ref> .</p><p>Interestingly, females had greater average parent-reported conduct problems at age 14 than boys (while controlling for income). Previous research in the MCS dataset has pointed to a group of children who have a school-onset trajectory of conduct problems and this was more common in girls than in boys <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">71</ref> . Moreover, while physical aggression is more common in boys, other symptoms of conduct problems, such as lying and cheating, can be more prevalent in girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">72</ref> . Future research should address the question which factors change girls' conduct problem trajectories during adolescence.</p><p>In line with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">73</ref> , our results also revealed that those who have experienced one head injury, are likely to experience another. Several risk factors may play a role in repeated head injuries. Some people may be more prone to having accidents than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">74</ref> . Particularly head injuries are often followed by a range of, sometimes subtle, physical, cognitive, and affective changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">75</ref> . As our data were based on general population interviews rather than clinical data, parental factors, such as a higher likelihood to seek medical treatment by some parents, cannot explain this stable effect.</p><p>Another risk factor for head injury is physical abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">77</ref> , which is also a risk factor for conduct problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">78</ref> . If head injuries and conduct problems are not directly associated at most ages, previous findings of associations between the two variables may be better explained by other common variables that influence both head injury and conduct problems, such as environmental factors. We did not determine specific risk factors for conduct problems and head injury other than gender and income <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">79</ref> . Future studies could include further risk factors for conduct problems, such as other types of adverse life events, in order to further dissociate specific impact of brain injury from environmental factors.</p><p>Males were more likely than females to experience a head injury after the age of 9 months. This is in line with previous research, showing that being male and having a lower SES increases the risk for experiencing a head injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30</ref> . Our data confirms that these factors also increase the risk of displaying conduct problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">33</ref> though income only played a minor role in the risk for head injury.</p><p>Future studies should investigate risk factors for repeated head injuries and their interactions in more detail.</p><p>Strengths of this study are the large number of children, its longitudinal nature and its naturalistic setting, i.e. all head injuries (with and without loss of consciousness) were compared to a control group of all others (without injury and all injuries other than head injury). We can therefore draw conclusions based on the general population, not on a clinical sample. Furthermore, head injuries and conduct problems were assessed at each time point and should not be as biased by memory as other retrospective data. Limitations include that head injuries were broadly defined, only first-borns were included, and that we were unable to differentiate between severe and less severe head injuries.</p><p>Moreover, we used a fairly simple model, only controlling for the main risk factors for conduct problems and head injuries, i.e. gender and family income. Future studies should take into account further risk factors.</p></div>
