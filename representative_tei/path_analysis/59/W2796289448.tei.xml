<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective: Higher body-mass index (BMI) and lower birth weight (BW) are associated with elevated risk of diabetes in adulthood, but the extent to which they compose two distinct pathways is unclear.</p><p>Methods: We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a cohort of adolescents (1994-1995) followed for 14 years over four waves into adulthood (n = 13,413).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>T he prevalence of diabetes is *9.4% in the United States 1 and 8.5% worldwide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Obesity during childhood or adulthood is associated with greater risk of diabetes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and prenatal development has emerged as an important contributor to diabetes susceptibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> These mechanisms support the conceptualization of type 2 diabetes as a heterogeneous condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> that emerges through multiple pathways.</p><p>Elucidation of pathways leading from prenatal development to diabetes is critical for informing diabetes prevention strategies. Low birth weight-an indicator of fetal growth restriction that is often followed by compensatory growth in infancy-consistently predicts higher diabetes risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Obesity prevention is a cornerstone of diabetes prevention, yet overall low birth weight is associated with lower overweight risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Importantly, experimental research suggests that fetal growth restriction may increase vulnerability to diabetes through insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, even in the absence of obesity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Macrosomia-an indicator of developmental overnutritionis associated with higher body-mass index (BMI) later in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and, in some studies, higher diabetes risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Therefore, diabetes may develop through obesity-dependent and obesity-independent mechanisms, but these pathways have not been well studied.</p><p>The transition from adolescence to adulthood may be a particularly sensitive period during which trajectories of BMI gain differentiate individuals who do or do not develop diabetes. These pathways may further vary by sex due to behavioral, psychosocial, or biological differences. The objective of this study was to characterize sex-specific pathways between birth weight and diabetes in adulthood that occur through BMI-dependent and BMI-independent pathways from adolescence to adulthood in a nationally representative, contemporary US cohort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p>We examined data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a cohort of over 20,000 adolescents followed for over 14 years into adulthood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Initially a school-based study, the core sample represents all adolescents attending US public, private, and parochial schools, grades 7-12, in the 1994-1995 school year, with oversampled groups (e.g., non-Hispanic black adolescents with a college-educated parent). The Wave I in-home participant and parental interview was conducted in the 1994-1995 academic year (11-21 years of age; N = 20,745). Wave II included all eligible adolescents who would have been in school in 1995-1996 (excluding those who graduated in 1995) (N = 14,738). All located Wave I respondents were eligible for Waves III (2001-2002; N = 15,197) and IV (2008-2009; N = 15,701). All waves included an in-home interview and biospecimens were collected in Wave IV.</p><p>Among participants in the probability sample (n = 18,923), we included 17,288 non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic participants (n = 1635 other race/ ethnicities excluded). Inclusion of Asian or other race led to difficulties with model convergence, likely due to the small number and heterogeneity of participants in these categories. Of these, we excluded 3866 with fewer than 2 nonpregnant BMI measurements (n = 980 with 0 BMI measures, 2886 with 1 BMI measure). As a result of our age-specific cohort design, we further excluded participants who were 11 years of age at Wave I (n = 9). Information about multiple births or gestational age at birth of the participant was not available. The remaining 13,413 participants composed the analytic sample for this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Variables</head><p>Birth weight (exposure) was reported by the participant's parent in pounds and ounces during the in-home Wave I interview; parent-reported birth weight is valid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> We con-verted birth weight to kilograms then, to characterize diabetes risk across the full birth weight spectrum, and examined continuous birth weight (kg) in primary analysis. We categorized birth weight as low (&lt;2500 g), normal, and high (&gt;4000 g) for descriptive analysis. Gestational age at birth was not recorded, precluding the distinction of fetal growth restriction from premature birth.</p><p>Diabetes or prediabetes (pre/diabetes; outcome). Diabetes was defined as HbA1c ‡6.5%, self-reported physician diagnosis, or report of diabetes medication. Prediabetes was defined as HbA1C of 5.7%-6.4% or fasting glucose of 100-125 mg/dL. HbA1c was collected at Wave IV from standardized whole blood spot assays 14 collected from finger pricks, which exhibit similar precision and reliability as venipuncture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> While the prevalence of diabetes in this young adult study population indicates substantial public health burden (6%), we combined prediabetes and diabetes (pre/diabetes), comparing with no diabetes, to achieve stable estimates in our path analysis. In general, the percentage of diabetes (vs. prediabetes) was similar across birth weight groups (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub .com/chi); in one exception, among those with pre/diabetes, a greater percentage of participants had diabetes among low birth weight females (38%) compared with normal and high birth weight females (&amp;30%). Because we were unable to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, we examined prediabetes (vs. no diabetes), a precursor to type 2 diabetes, in a sensitivity analysis. BMI (mediator) was calculated from height and weight measured at Waves II, III, and IV using standardized protocols. BMI trajectory analysis analyzed BMI (kg/m 2 ), rather than BMI z-scores, as recommended for analysis spanning the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Control variables. Race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic) was classified based on adolescent self-report or, if missing, parental report at Wave I. Sex was self-reported at each wave. Age was calculated from self-reported date of birth and interview date at each wave. Socioeconomic status (SES) in adolescence was indicated by highest parental education (&lt;high school graduate, high school graduate, some college, college graduate) and household income, both reported by the parent at Wave I; SES at Waves III and IV was indicated by the participant's education and household income. Participant smoking status (current smoker or not) was self-reported at each wave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>We conducted data management and descriptive analyses using Stata 13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and latent growth curve (LGC) analyses in Mplus 7.2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Mplus accounts for missing data within the analytic sample of 13,413 participants using full information maximum likelihood estimation. Sample weights provided by Add Health helped to account for nonparticipation in Wave II, III, or IV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> All analyses adjusted for complex survey design (e.g., clustering) using the Stata survey function or the complex analysis command in Mplus. We stratified by sex due to prior research suggesting sex differences in the relationship between birth weight and BMI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Latent growth curve analyses. We estimated the effects of birth weight (as a proxy for prenatal development) on BMI at baseline (Wave II, the first wave with objectively measured height and weight) and over time (Waves III and IV) and pre/diabetes (Wave IV) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Trajectory analysis offered the advantages of examining BMI from adolescence to adulthood, addressing within-person correlation of BMI across time points, and maintaining temporal sequencing of birth weight, BMI, and diabetes.</p><p>An accelerated cohort design was used to examine BMI trajectory with increasing age, rather than across study wave. Because adolescence is a critical period of BMI change, trajectories from baselines of early versus late adolescence observed in Wave I can mask age-related differences. Participants were 12-19 years of age at Wave I, providing eight age cohorts (12-year-old cohort, 13-year-old cohort, etc.). The 11-year-old cohort was small (n = 9) and therefore excluded. Each participant had at most three data points of 20; to accommodate the large degree of planned missingness, we set the acceptable minimum covariance coverage to zero.</p><p>The robust maximum likelihood estimator addressed the skewed distribution of BMI in LGC models. Model comparisons were made using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); we were unable to calculate standard SEM fit statistics (e.g., Comparative Fit Index) because numerical integration was required to fit our models.</p><p>BMI trajectories were defined by their average intercept (i, baseline, age 13) and slope (s, change from 13 to 31 years of age). We estimated linear trajectories because a maximum of three BMI time points were available for each participant; while pediatric growth is curvilinear, BMI in-creases approximately linearly throughout the ages under study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> For each sex, we built three adjusted LGC models, each controlling for time invariant and time-varying control variables (full model with covariates shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Analogous crude associations are reported in Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref>. Model 1 examined the overall association between birth weight and pre/diabetes. Model 2 examined the association between birth weight and BMI trajectory. Linear, quadratic, and cubic birth weight terms were tested; linear and quadratic terms were retained in association with BMI intercept and BMI slope on the basis of statistical significance (Wald p &lt; 0.05) of the quadratic term and change in BIC (&gt;10) in models with versus without the quadratic term. Model 3 combined Models 1 and 2, estimating the full pathway from birth weight to BMI trajectory to pre/diabetes (BMI-dependent) and the BMIindependent pathway from birth weight to pre/diabetes.</p><p>We did not conduct formal mediation analysis, which would quantify the extent to which inclusion of the BMIdependent pathway attenuates the birth weight-diabetes association. Based on prior evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and known biological mechanisms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> we expected BMI adjustment to yield stronger rather than weaker associations, suggesting substantive importance of the BMI-independent pathway. Therefore, our goal was to characterize two pathways leading from birth weight to diabetes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Study participants were racially and ethnically diverse and, on average, 15 years of age at Wave I and 29 years at Wave IV (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Girls and boys lived in households with similar income and parental education level in adolescence. In adulthood, women gained more education, but had lower incomes than men. Girls and boys were born with similar birth weights (3.3 and 3.4 kg in girls and boys, respectively) and experienced similar gains in BMI across Waves II-IV. In adulthood, pre/diabetes prevalence was higher in men (25.3%) versus women (19.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall and BMI-Independent Pathways from Birth Weight to Pre/Diabetes</head><p>Overall associations between heavier weight at birth and pre/diabetes were negative, but not statistically significant in women and men (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Model 1); these overall associations represent combined BMI-dependent andindependent pathways. In women, higher birth weight was significantly and more strongly associated with lower odds of pre/diabetes in the full model [odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): Model 3, 0.79 (0.68, 0.92); Model 1, 0.88 (0.76, 1.03); exponentiated coefficients from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c]</ref>, which adjusted for BMI trajectory, thus representing the birth weight-pre/diabetes association that occurs through pathways other than BMI. In men, birth weight was not associated with pre/diabetes regardless of adjustment for BMI trajectory (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Models 1 and 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BMI-Dependent Pathway from Birth Weight to Pre/Diabetes</head><p>We identified pathways from greater birth weight to higher BMI trajectory, which in turn predicted a greater probability of pre/diabetes in adulthood (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). In this study, we describe estimates from the full model (Model 3); associations between birth weight and BMI trajectory were similar in models without pathways to pre/ diabetes (Model 2). To aid in interpretation, associations are graphically displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In girls, greater birth weight was associated with higher BMI in early adolescence (BMI intercept); this association was nonlinear, such that it was observed in birth weights of 3.0 kg and greater, and was more pronounced in the upper range of birth weights (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Girls born with higher birth weights gained BMI marginally faster from adolescence to adulthood (BMI slope; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). In turn, both BMI in early adolescence and BMI gain were associated with higher odds of pre/diabetes [OR (95% CI): 1.1 (1.06, 1.12) for each 1-unit difference in BMI intercept, 1.1 (1.07, 1.16) for each 1-unit increase in BMI per year; exponentiated coefficients from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 3].</p><p>In boys, associations were similar, but attenuated relative to girls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). In one exception, faster BMI gain from adolescence to adulthood was associated with 34% greater odds of adulthood pre/diabetes [OR (95% CI): 1.34 (1.2, 1.5) for 1-unit increase in BMI per year].</p><p>In the analysis examining prediabetes (vs. no diabetes) as an alternative outcome, model results were similar (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>), suggesting that our findings were not attributable to type 1, as opposed to type 2, diabetes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we characterized two pathways from birth weight to diabetes in adulthood in a contemporary US   cohort. One pathway occurred from higher birth weight to elevated BMI and subsequent pre/diabetes. A second pathway stemmed from lower birth weight, independent of BMI throughout adolescence and adulthood. Our trajectory analysis further suggests that pathways through BMI may occur over specific time periods in the life course, such as rapid BMI gain from adolescence to adulthood in boys and girls, and before adolescence in girls. These findings have implications for the type and timing of diabetes prevention strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Association between Birth Weight and Pre/Diabetes in Adulthood</head><p>Our findings about the overall association between birth weight and pre/diabetes in adulthood corroborate a substantial body of research. In women, we found odds ratios of 0.79 and 0.88 of pre/diabetes for a 1-kg increment in birth weight; while these associations were not statistically significant, the direction and magnitude of association are virtually identical to a pooled odds ratio of 0.80 in a metaanalysis of 31 studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Our analysis differed from most prior studies on birth weight and diabetes in two key ways. First, we found that birth weight was unrelated to pre/diabetes in men. In a handful of prior studies that tested for effect modification by sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> or examined study populations restricted to men or women, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> evidence of sex differences in the association between birth weight and diabetes was mixed. Sex differences could reflect numerous biological, developmental, or behavioral processes discussed in a later section. Second, our outcome included both prediabetes and diabetes ascertained at 25-32 years of age, capturing future cases that may emerge in subsequent decades of life. However, our combined outcome also includes prediabetes that does not progress to diabetes, potentially resulting in misclassification bias; the extent to which prenatal development impacts resilience to progression from prediabetes to diabetes is an important area of future study.</p><p>BMI-Independent and BMI-Dependent Pathways from Birth Weight to Diabetes BMI-independent pathway. In girls, the BMI-independent association was similar, but slightly stronger than the overall association (OR = 0.79 vs. 0.88 for a 1-kg greater birth weight), consistent with Whincup et al.'s meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and recent studies that compare associations with and without adjustment for BMI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> These findings suggest that in girls, lower birth weight is associated with pre/ diabetes in adulthood largely through BMI-independent pathways. However, this BMI-independent association was not observed in boys.</p><p>BMI-independent pathways from lower birth weight to diabetes likely reflect well-described characteristics of individuals who experienced intrauterine growth restriction. These characteristics include low pancreatic beta cell mass (lower capacity for insulin secretion), low muscle mass (lower capacity to metabolize glucose), insulin resistance, and inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Pathways stemming from these prenatally induced characteristics may underlie the diabetes phenotype that occurs in the absence of obesity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Moreover, the BMI-independent pathway may be heterogeneous, involving multiple prenatally induced pathways that can be studied in populations with repeated measurements of body composition and requisite biomarkers.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Adjusted for race/ethnicity, parental education, and parental income at Wave I and time-varying smoking, participant income, and participant education.</p><p>Explanations for the observed sex differences in the BMI-independent pathway are unknown, but may include sex differences in developmental programming effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> or velocity of diabetes progression. In addition, BMI can mask differences in body composition or fat distribution that are important for diabetes risk, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and these differences may be more pronounced in boys as they grow into adults. Further investigation of physiologic or behavioral differences that may explain sex-specific pathways from early life to diabetes in adulthood is needed. BMI-dependent pathway. A second pathway, more pronounced in girls, led from higher birth weight to higher BMI from adolescence to adulthood and later increased the likelihood of pre/diabetes. This pathway is consistent with a vast literature on the association between higher birth weight and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and the role of obesity in the pathogenesis of diabetes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Prior studies seeking to understand the role of BMI in the association between birth weight and diabetes typically compared associations before and after adjusting for BMI in adulthood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> In one exception, Eriksson et al. examined associations along the pathway from birth weight to BMI to diabetes, focusing on childhood growth before 11 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Our findings are consistent with Eriksson et al.'s study, contributing complimentary evidence with regard to growth through adolescence to adulthood. Our path analysis approach enabled characterization of not only the BMIindependent pathway but also the pathway that occurs through BMI over a critical life stage transition period. Our approach also helps to prevent collider-stratification bias resulting from BMI adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> by modeling the two pathways separately and adjusting for confounding in the mediator-outcome association (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Strengths</head><p>Our study findings should be interpreted with regard to several limitations. We used birth weight as an indicator of prenatal development, but future research should examine size for gestational age and specific prenatal exposures (e.g., maternal obesity or nutrition). Similarly, BMI can mask interindividual differences in adiposity, including differences resulting from early life development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> We were unable to ascertain when BMI differences at our study baseline (adolescence) emerged, or examine sensitive developmental periods earlier in childhood; in particular, birth weight correlates with development in infancy, which is independently associated with later BMI. We lacked data on age at pubertal onset, which impacts the BMI trajectory during the age range under study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Our trajectory analysis examined the critical life stage transition from adolescence to adulthood, yet did not test associations of BMI at specific adult time points with diabetes. We also lacked information on pre/diabetes before Wave IV, such that our dependent variable reflected prevalent pre/diabetes at 25-32 years of age; however, diabetes in adolescence is rare. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> Furthermore, the analysis did not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes; type 1 diabetes accounts for only 5% of total diabetes cases in the United States, 34 but this proportion is higher in younger populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> However, findings were similar in sensitivity analyses that examined prediabetes, a precursor to type 2 diabetes, suggesting that this limitation minimally influenced our results. Finally, although we adjusted for several important covariates, residual confounding may be present.</p><p>Balancing these limitations, our study leveraged valuable information spanning from birth to objectively measured height and weight throughout adolescence and adulthood and biomarker assessment of diabetic status in adulthood. Furthermore, the large, representative study population provided findings that are generalizable to a national population and supported sex-specific path analysis to understand complex pathways from prenatal to adult health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Health Implications</head><p>Our findings suggest that diabetes prevention strategies may require elements that address pathways induced not only by obesity but also by adverse prenatal development. That is, ongoing efforts to reduce excess weight gain throughout childhood and adulthood are critical, but may be insufficient for preventing diabetes in subgroups with lower birth weight. Notably, low birth weight remains prevalent even in the context of Western obesogenic environments, corresponding to other risk factors such as maternal tobacco exposure and psychosocial stress, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and maternal obesityinduced placental insufficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Diabetes prevention in children with adverse prenatal development may include therapeutics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> physical activity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> or healthy diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> that overcomes physiologic abnormalities stemming from adverse prenatal development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> Mitigation of adverse prenatal development requires a deeper understanding of pathways leading to diabetes in children and how these pathways vary by sex.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
