<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a critical inflammatory mediator persistently induced during endotoxemia, contributing to tubular damage and kidney failure. The intracellular process responsible for persistent induction of LCN2 by bacterial endotoxin Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is not well understood. Using primary kidney fibroblasts, we observed that LPS-induced LCN2 expression requires a coupled circuit involving an early transient phase of AP-1 path and a late persistent phase of C/EBPd path, both of which are dependent upon the interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1). Using immunoprecipitation analysis we observed transient binding of AP-1 to the promoters of both TNFa and C/ ebpd. On the other hand, we only observed persistent binding of C/EBPd to its own promoter but not on TNFa. Blockage of new protein synthesis using cyclohexamide significantly reduced the expression of C/EBPd as well as LCN2. By chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we demonstrated that LPS recruited C/EBPd to the Lcn2 promoter in WT, but not IRAK-1 deficient fibroblasts. A differential equation-based computational model captured the dynamic circuit leading to the persistent induction of LCN2. In vivo, we observed elevated levels of LCN2 in kidneys harvested from LPS-injected WT mice as compared to IRAK-1 deficient mice. Taken together, this study has identified an integrated intracellular network involved in the persistent induction of LCN2 by LPS.</p></div>

Elevated level of LCN2 in kidney is a well-recognized marker for both chronic kidney diseases, reflecting the extent of kidney damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. LCN2 is not only a marker, but also a key contributor of kidney disease, as reflected by the alleviation of chronic kidney damage in mice with Lcn2 gene deletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide-LPS) is a potent inducer of LCN2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Elevated levels of endotoxin are seen in both acute and chronic conditions. Acute endotoxemia leads to septic shock and multi-organ damages including acute kidney failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In contrast, chronic endotoxemia associated with obesity, aging, and other adverse health conditions can lead to persistent inflammatory complications and chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. LCN2 levels persist during both acute and chronic phases of kidney damage, and may serve as a key propagating factor for chronic kidney disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the persistent expression of LCN2 is not well understood.</p><p>Studies using other inflammatory stimulants such as IL-17 and IL-1b indicate that the induction of LCN2 requires multiple transcription factors including AP-1 and C/EBPd <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. AP-1 activation by LPS is transient and responsible for the transient induction of pro-inflammatory mediators <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. On a separate report, C/EBPd was implicated in propagating the persistent activation of TLR4 pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Based on these observations, we examined the molecular circuit underlying the persistent induction of LCN2 by LPS in kidney fibroblasts. We identified that IRAK-1, a key TLR4 intracellular signaling component, is involved in coordinating both the transient activation of AP-1, as well as the persistent activation of C/EBPd, which are collectively responsible for the sustained expression of LCN2. We further performed a differential equation-based computational modeling, which complemented our experimental data and revealed a dynamic intracellular signaling circuit responsible for the persistent induction of LCN2 by LPS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kidney Fibroblast cultures</head><p>Both WT and IRAK-1 2/2 C57/BL/6 mice were housed and bred in the Derring Hall Animal Facility in compliance with approved Animal Care and Use Committee protocols at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Murine kidney fibroblasts were isolated as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Fibroblast cells were grown in 50:50 DMEM/F12 #10-092-CV (Mediatech TM , Inc., VA) supplemented with 10% FBS #SH30071.03 (Hyclone TM ) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin at 37uC with 5% CO 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)</head><p>Total RNAs were harvested from murine kidney fibroblasts treated with or without LPS using TrizolH Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNAs were generated using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied BioSystems TM , Foster, CA). Real-time PCR analyses were performed using the iQ SybrH Green Supermix (BioRad TM Laboratories, Hercules, CA) on an IQ5 thermocycler (BioRad). The relative levels of transcripts were calculated using the DDCt method using GAPDH as the internal control. The relative levels of mRNA from the untreated samples were adjusted to 1 and served as the basal control value. The following primers were used perform qRT-PCR: mouse LCN2 forward: 59-TTT CAC CCG CTT TGC CAA GT-39, reverse: 59-GTC TCT GCG CAT CCC AGT CA-39; mouse C/ebpd forward: 59-ACT TCA GCG CCT ACA TTG ACT CCA-39, reverse: 59-TGT TGA AGA GGT CGG CGA AGA GTT-39; mouse GAPDH forward: 59-AAC TTT GGC ATT GTG GAA GGG CTC-39, reverse: 59-GGA AGA GTG GGA GTT GCT GTT GA-39; mouse TNFa forward: 59-AGC CGA TGG GTT GTA CCT TGT CTA-39, reverse: 59-TGA GAT AGC AAA TCG GCT GAC GGT-39; mouse Il-6 forward: 59-ATC CAG TTG CCT TCT TGG GAC TGA-39, reverse: 59-TAA GCC TCC GAC TTG TGA AGT GGT-39; mouse SOCS1 forward: 59-AGT CGC CAA CGG AAC TGC TTC TT-39, reverse: 59-ACG TAG TGC TCC AGC AGC TCG AAA-39; and mouse ATF3 forward: 59-TCA AGG AAG AGC TGA GAT TCG CCA-39, reverse: 59-GTT TCG ACA CTT GGC AGC AGC AAT-39.</p></div>

Samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4uC. The supernatants were saved as the cytoplasmic extract and the pelleted nuclei were re-suspend and lysed in a high salt buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 30 minutes. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 RPM for 20 minutes at 4uC and supernatant kept as the nuclear extract. Protein samples were analyzed by Western Blot as described before. Images were quantified with Fujifilm Multi Gauge software normalized against b actin, GAPDH, or Lamin B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays</head><p>Protein and chromatin from treated cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde solution in complete media for 15 minutes with gentle rocking every 3 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and treated with a glycine solution for 5 minutes to stop the cross-linking reaction. The cells were then lysed in an ice cold buffer containing SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail. The samples were then subject to sonication in an ice water bath to shear the chromatin for 6 minutes (30 seconds on and 30 seconds off). The sheared chromatin was processed using Chip-IT Express Kit #53008 from Active Motif TM . The immuneprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR using primer pairs that span the promoter regions of either Lcn2, C/ebpd, and Tnfa. The primer sequences are as follows: mouse pLcn2 forward: 59-TGA CCC ACA AGC AGT GCC CTG T-39, reverse: 59-ACT TGG CAA GAT TTC TGT CCC-39; mouse pC/ebpd forward: 59-ACA AAC AGG AAG GAG GGA AG-39, reverse: 59-TCC AAG TTG GGC TGT CA-39; and mouse pTnfa forward: 59-AGG AGA TTC CTT GAT GCC TGG GT-39, reverse: 59-TTT CTG TTC TCC CTC CTG GCT AGT-39. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LPS induces persistent expression of LCN2 in kidney fibroblasts in an IRAK-1 dependent fashion</head><p>We first compared the expression profiles of selected inflammatory genes in fibroblasts stimulated with LPS. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, the induction of Tnfa message by LPS was transient, peaked at the 2 hour time point post challenge, and returned to basal values at the 16 hour time point. In contrast, the expression of Lcn2 mRNA persisted throughout the course of LPS treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Because IRAK-1 is one of the key downstream components of TLR4 pathway, we evaluated whether IRAK-1 is involved in both the transient induction of Tnfa and persistent induction of Lcn2 message. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and 1B, the inductions of both Tnfa and Lcn2 were significantly reduced in IRAK-1 deficient kidney fibroblasts. We also confirmed the induction of LCN2 protein in wild type (WT) cells by LPS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LPS induces transient activation of AP-1 and persistent induction of C/EBPd in kidney fibroblasts</head><p>To determine the potential mechanism for the persistent induction of LCN2 in kidney fibroblasts by LPS, we examined the activation status of relevant transcription factors including NFkB, AP-1 and C/EBPd. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>, LPS treatment caused no apparent decrease in the levels of Ikba in WT fibroblasts, indicating a lack of robust NFkB activation by LPS in kidney fibroblasts. Further supporting this claim, we observed that the residue nuclear p65/RelA remained constant following LPS treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). In contrast, we observed a rapid yet transient induction of AP-1/c-Jun. Nuclear levels of AP-1/c-Jun was induced by LPS, reached its peak level by 60 to 120 minutes, and decreased at 240 minutes after LPS challenge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). C/ EBPd, on the other hand, was elevated after 24 hr of LPS treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>). Given the fact that Western blot may not give rise to quantitative result, we performed RT-PCR analysis of C/ebpd expression induced by LPS. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>, LPS significantly induced the expression of C/ebpd, and such induction is dependent on IRAK-1.</p><p>Based on above observation and previous studies, we propose that a coupled step-wise process may lead to the persistent activation and induction of C/EBPd. LPS may first induce an initial C/EPBd expression primarily through a transient activation of AP-1 and residue NFkB in the nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Subsequently, newly synthesized C/EBPd can auto-induce its own expression and contribute to a steady induction of C/EBPd <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and its downstream target gene LCN2. To test this hypothesis, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to determine the recruitment of c-Jun and C/EBPd to the promoter of C/ebpd. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, LPS transiently increased the recruitment of c-Jun to the promoter of C/ebpd (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) and Tnfa (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), peaking at 4 hr for C/ebpd and 1 hr for Tnfa promoter, and dropping off at the 8 hr time point. In contrast, increased recruitment of C/EBPd at the 8 hr time point was evident on the promoter of C/ebpd, but not Tnfa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Both De novo synthesis and subsequent activation of C/ EBPd is required for the expression of LCN2</head><p>To further confirm that de novo synthesis of C/EBPd is involved in LPS-induced LCN2 expression, we applied cycloheximide (CHX), a known protein synthesis inhibitor, to the culture medium. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, CHX significantly reduced LPS-mediated induction of Lcn2 message, suggesting that new protein synthesis is required for the induction of LCN2 gene expression. In contrast, CHX has no inhibitory effect on LPSmediated expression of C/ebpd message (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). This is in agreement with a previous finding that the expression of C/EBPd and its subsequent transcriptional activation are two separate events controlled by two distinct upstream processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. To further confirm the role of C/EBPd in LPS induced expression of Lcn2, we examined the recruitment of C/EBPd to the promoter of Lcn2 following LPS challenge. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>, LPS dramatically prolonged the elevated recruitment of C/EBPd to the Lcn2 promoter in WT cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The lack of inducible negative regulators contributes to prolonged expression of LCN2 in kidney fibroblasts upon LPS stimulation</head><p>Through the classical NFkB pathway, LPS is known to induce negative regulators that subsequently turn off the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Among the negative regulators, SOCS1 suppresses the upstream LPS signaling pathway by inhibiting IRAK-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. On the other hand, ATF3 is shown to compete and suppress the activity of C/EBPd <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Given the fact that we did not observe noticeable activation of the NFkB pathway, we hypothesize that LPS may not be able to induce related negative regulators in kidney fibroblasts. Indeed, we demonstrated that LPS failed to induce the expression of Socs 1 and Atf 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). As a consequence, we observed that there was no apparent degradation of IRAK-1 protein in kidney fibroblasts following a 4 hr LPS treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). Taken together, our data indicate that LPS treatment in kidney fibroblasts failed to induce negative regulators that modulate the persistent activation of C/EBPd, leading to a sustained induction of its downstream gene Lcn2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vivo induction of LCN2 expression in an IRAK-1 dependent fashion</head><p>To test the in vivo relevance of our finding, we examined the expression of LCN2 in kidney tissues from WT and IRAK-1 deficient mice following LPS challenge. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, LPS injection induced significant induction of Lcn2 messages as well as LCN2 proteins in kidney tissues harvested from LPS-injected WT mice. In contrast, the levels of Lcn2 messages were significantly lower in kidneys harvested from IRAK-1 deficient mice injected with LPS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational analyses of the molecular circuit responsible for the persistent induction of LCN2 in kidney fibroblasts</head><p>We further fit our experimental data into a differential equation based computation model (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). This model takes into consideration of the positive feedback loop involving C/EBPd that helps to maintain a sustained expression of LCN2.</p><p>This model is based on a coarse-grained TLR4-signaling network that highlights the core pathways controlling the induction of LCN2. As is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7A</ref>, this signaling circuit is composed of both an early-phase module with transient response and a late-phase module with persistent response. Each module can be viewed as an information processor that receives inputs from upstream signals, and generate outputs that regulate downstream response. The two modules are connected. The transcription of C/EBPd is dependent on AP-1/c-Jun, and serves as the core of the late-phase module. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> lists the equations in the computational model. Each ODE describes the change of a molecular species in the relative level as a function of time. Parameters such as mRNA degradation rates are estimated based on our data or from existing literatures. Other parameters such as activating threshold k and relative weights K are estimated using genetic algorithm of least square regression (MATLABH 2009b, the MathWorks, Natick, MI). All parameters are listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>As is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7B</ref>, our computational model based on the proposed signaling circuitry fits well with the experimental data. The model reveals that the essential requirement of the biphasic dynamics of C/EBPd and LCN2 is the proper timing of the two consecutive modules. The immediate yet transient induction in c-Jun explains the first pulse in C/EBPd, when the early-phase module dominates the dynamics of the system. As soon as c-Jun decays, the late-phase module relays the signal and an auto-regulation of C/EBPd gives rise to the persistent induction of both C/EBPd and LCN2. IKKe plays an important role in ensuring the correct timing of the second module. Experimentally, it was shown that IKKe activates the activity of C/EBPd, therefore the auto-regulation of C/EBPd is IKKe-dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, our computational simulation based on the intracellular signaling circuitry identified in this report fitted well with the experimental data, capturing the dynamic intracellular circuits that give rise to transient induction of TNFa and persistent induction of LCN2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this report, we have identified that LPS can induce a persistent expression of LCN2 in kidney fibroblasts. The intracellular signaling circuit responsible for the persistent induction of LCN2 involves dynamic interaction among AP-1 and C/EBPd. An early phase of a transient AP-1 activation helps to usher in a late phase of C/EBPd activation. IRAK-1 is responsible for the propagation of both phases necessary for the persistent induction of LCN2.</p><p>Our study shed light on the dynamic and functional circuitry within cells when challenged with bacterial endotoxin. Although empirical knowledge reckons that integrated intracellular circuits instead of linear cascades are more capable of interpreting and responding properly to environmental cues including LPS, almost all existing studies have adopted conventional approaches in defining the signaling cascades downstream of LPS and TLR4 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. To this regard, a large number of signaling molecules and pathways have been discovered that can be activated by LPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, how these signals are properly integrated and give rise to distinct cellular responses is not clear. This work builds upon conventional information uncovered in the area of LPS signaling within host cells, and reveals an integrated circuit that couples a transient activation of AP-1 with a sustained activation of C/EBPd.</p><p>Our effort is made possible by the integrated approach combining experimental tests and computational analyses. Taken into consideration of the experimental data, we have employed a differential equation-based approach to analyze time-dependent activation of AP-1 and C/EBPd, as well as expression of Tnfa and Lcn2. As a consequence, genes primarily under the control of AP-1 such as Tnfa experience a transient pattern of expression. The expression of C/ebpd, on the other hand, is initially activated by AP-1, and subsequently sustained by its own auto-activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Due to the transient nature of AP-1 activation, we observed a transient dip in the expression of C/ebpd (around the 4 hr time point). Subsequent self-activation of C/EBPd then sustains the continued expression of C/ebpd and its downstream gene Lcn2. A detailed computational analysis can be seen in the supplementary material.</p><p>It is likely that there will be significant perturbations as well as additional connections surrounding this circuit in different cell types. Consequently, this may allow distinct outcomes in different cell types in response to bacterial endotoxin. For example, the expression of C/EBPd in macrophages induced by LPS eventually subsides, due to a novel negative feedback initiated by ATF3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In contrast, we observed that LPS failed to induce Atf3 in kidney fibroblasts, which may explain the sustained expression and activation of C/EBPd. This may due to the fact that fibroblasts are less sensitive to the LPS challenge as compared to macrophages. Indeed, our recent study indicates that a much lower LPS dose (,50 pg/ml) induces a persistent activation of C/EBPd in macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, similar to the effect seen in this study using fibroblasts with a high dose LPS. Further supporting this claim, we observed that IRAK-1 is relatively stable in kidney fibroblasts treated with 100 ng/ml LPS. In contrast, it was observed that 100 ng/ml LPS causes IRAK-1 degradation in macrophages, which can dampen the signals leading to C/EBPd activation, leading to LPS tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Further studies employing systems biology approach are clearly warranted to clarify the differential sensing mechanisms of LPS signal strength in different cell types. On a separate note, the integrated systems approach will likely explain the complex phenotypes such as LPS priming and tolerance exhibited in cells treated with either a low or a high dose LPS.</p><p>Our findings bear significant clinical implication during the pathogenesis of chronic and persistent inflammatory diseases. Local tissues and fibroblasts encountering bacterial endotoxin may  exhibit persistent activation of the C/EBPd circuit without a dampening mechanism. As a consequence, inflammatory mediators such as LCN2 may accumulate and lead to chronic tissue damages including kidney failure. Strategies targeting at this functional circuit may hold promise in designing therapeutic strategies to combat chronic inflammatory diseases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
