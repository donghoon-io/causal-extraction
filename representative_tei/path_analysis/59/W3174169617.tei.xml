<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this study, along with organizational culture, organizational dissent which becomes more important in terms of national and international literature in recent years is discussed. This study aims to answer the question of how organizational dissent perception is shaped within the context of organizational culture. In this study, in which quantitative research methods were used, a questionnaire was applied to 211 white-collar private sector employees working in companies in the organized industrial zone in Duzce, Turkey. In the SPSS program, correlation analysis was carried out and the data were subjected to multiple regression in the AMOS program by path analysis. As a result of the path analysis, it was determined that the clan culture, which is one of the sub-dimensions of organizational culture, has a negative effect on the questioning and latent dissent from the sub-dimensions of the organizational dissent. While the culture of adhocracy has a positive effect on the constructive articulated dissent, the hierarchy culture has a negative effect on the constructive articulated dissent and positive effect on latent dissent. These results are expected to demonstrate the importance of organizational dissent in organizational culture for employees and businesses and contribute to the development of the literature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Today, many organizations try to make their employees happy and create a culture in this direction in order not to have difficulty in keeping up with the rapid changes in their environment and to gain an advantage against their competitors. For this, organizations need employees who do not hesitate to share information, who are sensitive to changes in their surroundings, and who can advocate the ideas that their teammates believe without hesitation <ref type="bibr">(Dimitris &amp; Vakola, 2007:17)</ref>. Employees' ability to express their opinions and participate in management improves their sense of belonging to the company and causes the acceptance of the company <ref type="bibr">(Şen &amp; Bolat, 2014:153)</ref>. Accordingly, it can be expected that each individual will express their dissent behavior differently. The reason for this is the way of individual raising based on cultural symbols and the individual behaviors that emerge accordingly. However, employees' expressing their opinions depend on their perception that there is a problem in the organization and this problem is worth mentioning <ref type="bibr">(Grahan, 1986:2)</ref>.</p><p>In organizations, the dissent behavior of employees and managerial attitudes and approaches as a product of culture should be handled together. In modern management approaches, managers tend to leave open doors to their employees in the organization so that they can express their wishes and desires. Despite this tendency, employees may be reluctant to convey situations that do not satisfy themselves in order not to disturb the harmony within the organization and not to be negatively affected by other employees, even though they may feel uneasy about an unfair situation encountered in the organization <ref type="bibr">(Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999:77)</ref>.</p><p>If the dissent behavior is defined as the dissonance between the expectations and the organizational facts that arise as a result of the demands and requests of the individuals, the conflict process of the organizational facts and expectations constitutes the core principles of the dissent in the organization as a result of the unwillingness of the employees to accept certain things in the organization. In organizations, dissent is a personal action in which employees assess their character and their social and organizational posture at work. If the dissent is seen as a personal act, it will be meaningful to expect that employees with different personality traits will change their behavior according to the way they express the dissent <ref type="bibr">(Kassing &amp; McDowell, 2008:36)</ref>. From this point of view that is the baseline of the study, it can be said that disharmony between an individual's personality and the characteristic of the organization, reveals dissent behavior.</p><p>From the administrative point of view, the explanation of the organizational dissent in the context of organizational culture, which expresses different thoughts, contradictory opinions, opposite ideas about organizational methods and the general policies of the organization, and the emergence of new perspectives in the organization constitutes the main research subject of this study.</p><p>Adokrasi kültürü ise, yapıcı açık muhalefet üzerinde olumlu bir etkiye sahipken, hiyerarşi kültürü, gizli muhalefet üzerinde olumlu, yapıcı açık muhalefet üzerinde olumsuz bir etkiye sahiptir. Bu sonuçların, örgüt kültüründe örgütsel muhalefet davranışının çalışanlar ve işletmeler için önemini göstermesi ve literatürün gelişimine katkıda bulunması beklenmektedir.</p><p>Anahtar Kelimeler: Örgüt Kültürü, Örgütsel Muhalefet, Beyaz Yakalılar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Framework</head><p>Although the concept of dissent is essentially perceived as a concept specific to political science, it has become important for many disciplines, especially management science. When it is examined in terms of management science, the concept of dissent is defined as the situation of disagreement between members of the organization and its superiors <ref type="bibr">(Kassing, 1997:313)</ref>. This divergence does not only occur between the superiors of the subordinates but also sometimes among subordinates. However, organizational dissent is mostly based on the ability to express thoughts freely as a result of the perception of an incident, situation, or practice in the workplace by employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sadykova &amp; Tutar, 2014)</ref>. The dissent is not only a difference of opinion, but it is also a kind of communication model that creates a loop between administrative thoughts and employee frustration and discontent <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burns &amp; Wagner, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Dissent behaviors are explained with four behaviors as articulated dissent, latent dissent, displaced dissent, and whistleblowing <ref type="bibr">(Kassing, 1997:315)</ref>. Expressing as the direct conveyance of employees to the managers who have a voice and influence in the organization when an event or situation occurs that may create dissent in the organization refers articulated dissent <ref type="bibr">(Kassing, 1998: 199)</ref> and these behaviors against the problem are conveyed directly and clearly to the top manager, the officials of the institution and supervision mechanisms through vertical communication channels <ref type="bibr">(Kassing 1997:316)</ref>. When employees demonstrate dissent behavior, they must have a guarantee regarding perceive positive feedback from superiors. Occasionally, members of the organization express their dissenting opinions to other members of the organization rather than share them with the managers and it is called latent dissent. The most important difference from the articulated dissent is that the dissent behavior is displayed to other members of the organization that do not have a direct relationship with the process of issues <ref type="bibr">(Kassing, 1997:317)</ref>. The most important reason that pushes the members to express their opinions in this way is the lack of superiors to whom they will express the problem or event. In other words, the existence of a body that restricts the dissenting views of the members and has an enthusiasm at the point of expressing a dissent opinion is effective in the emergence of latent dissent behavior <ref type="bibr">(Kassing &amp; Armstrong, 2002:44-45)</ref>. Another remarkable issue among the possible causes of dissent behavior is displacing that members of the organization recognize and accept a problem, but are concerned about being at the forefront of voicing this problem <ref type="bibr">(Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999:78)</ref>. The main difference from the latent dissent is that the organization's member cannot express his opposing views not only to his manager but also to his colleagues. Opposing views and thoughts are expressed to those who are not in the organization <ref type="bibr">(Kassing &amp; Avtgis, 1999:82)</ref>. Sometimes, members of the organization that have previously been or continue to be active in an organization may transmit illegal and unethical activities in the organization to their superiors or non-organizational institutions as whistleblowers <ref type="bibr">(Miceli &amp; Near, 1984:689)</ref>. If the member of the organization carries the hope that the problems in the organization can be solved and trusts his senior managers, members can turn towards this behavior. Because the employees of the organization want to work in an environment where they can easily express their ideas and thoughts and offer solutions to the problems that arise and by feeling safe <ref type="bibr">(Şahin &amp; Yürür, 2020:29)</ref>. If the manager gives confidence to the person who conveys the information concerning no judging about an event or situation that goes wrong and if the member believes in his sincerity and determination in this regard, these facts become premises in the emergence of behavior for the person who will disclose the information <ref type="bibr">(Aktan, 2015:33)</ref>.</p><p>When dissent behavior is considered as a process, strategic behavioral choice variables that affect dissent behavior are individual, relational, and organizational factors <ref type="bibr">(Kassing, 1997:318)</ref>. The dissent behavior emerges as an individual when the member begins to isolate itself from the organization and starts to move away. The personality traits of people are different from each other and these differences affect the boundaries of the dissent as well as distinguishing them from each other. On the other side, communication is the main factor that determines, directs, and concludes internal relations in an organization and it plays an active role in the emergence, regulation, and finalization of relationships. Members should determine the audience or groups to whom the opinion will be shared before revealing the dissent behavior. In an organization, when the individual exhibits dissent behavior, it should be considered what this behavior will cost. It refers to a culture that shapes the individual within the organization. Employees feel more comfortable in an organization where there is freedom of expression and do not have difficulty in expressing their opposing views by communicating directly with managers <ref type="bibr">(Kassing, 2000:392)</ref>.</p><p>The main starting point of the studies on organizational culture is to identify the cultural elements that dominate the organization and to discuss the relations between these elements. Different characteristics in different organizations are expressed through organizational culture approaches <ref type="bibr">(Doğan, 2007:123)</ref>. This study is based on the competing values framework. The reason, why the competing values framework is used in this study, is that competing values framework reveals the relationship between organizational culture and organizational activity that enables the organization to achieve its goals without applying pressure to its members <ref type="bibr">(Hooijberg &amp; Petrock, 1993:32)</ref>. In this study, the competing values framework is taken as a basis to better understand the current status of cultures in organizations and to determine which culture type is more effective and which culture type is less effective.</p><p>There are 4 basic dimensions that constitute the measurement tool in the definition of organizational culture types: These dimensions are clan culture, adhocracy culture, hierarchy culture, and market culture. Clan culture is the culture in which human relations are kept superior, members can share opinions sincerely and a wide range of family cultures are dominated <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 1999:37)</ref>. The purpose of the calling clan culture as a family culture is the high level of organizational commitment in it, the concepts such as unity and solidarity, teamwork, and team spirit come to the fore. In clan culture, a manager or leader is like the team's mentor. Members of the organization provide the authority unofficially. As a result of the participation and agreement of the decisions, an organic structure in which the organization manager and leader make the dynamics of the organization more difficult and the members of the organization have a voice dominates the clan culture <ref type="bibr">(Erdem et al., 2010:79)</ref>.</p><p>Adhocracy is a developmental organizational culture based on risk-taking, innovation, and change <ref type="bibr">(Quinn &amp; Spreitzer, 1991:119)</ref>. With its external and dynamic structure, it refers to the organizational culture in entrepreneurial, flexible, innovative, and creative fields. The most important point in this culture is that the growth paths of the organization are supported by entrepreneurial activities along with flexibility and tolerance. The adhocracy culture aims to achieve adaptation, flexibility, and entrepreneurial activities, especially in environments where uncertainty prevails <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 2006:43)</ref>. Adhocracy does not have a centralized authority in the organization as the members of the organization adapt themselves rapidly to the newly formed environment. The use of power and authority varies from individual to individual. In the culture of adhocracy, which provides an environment where there is no hierarchical structure, individuals can freely make discoveries and take responsibility for themselves, members of the organization feel happy, more satisfied and more faithful that they can achieve something. <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 1999:38)</ref>. For this reason, it is the most innovation-oriented culture that strives to promote adaptability, flexibility, and creativity to face uncertainty and information load <ref type="bibr">(Deshpandé et al., 1993:26)</ref>.</p><p>In the dimension of hierarchy culture, which is mainly focused on internal control and efficiency, members of the organization are directed from top to bottom based on the rules in a highly bureaucratic environment. Thanks to the order and control mechanisms within the hierarchy culture dimension, members of the organization can eliminate many of the difficulties and threats they face from inside or outside. The hierarchy by clearly defining roles in the organization, especially when group members are linked to each other and the organization, can improve group performance by creating a breakthrough model that will facilitate the integration of information and coordination that reduce intra-group conflict. But a strict understanding of the hierarchy that exists in the organization in another way may limit the members of the organization to express their concerns about a problem that arises in the organization <ref type="bibr">(Cameron-Quinn, 1999:28)</ref>.</p><p>In the market culture, the main goal of the organization is to gain competitive advantage and reach the goal by turning to the external environment. Customers, suppliers, competitors, regulators are important in line with the competition in the external environment rather than addressing internal protection and internal concerns <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 2006:39)</ref>. Organizational goals are not at the forefront due to personal interests among the members of the organization. Individuals try to pursue their interests and increase the factors such as increasing performance and effectiveness and planning in the external environment. It consists of leaders, ambitious manufacturers, managers, and competitors. In this culture, leaders are very aggressive and demanding. It is the emphasis on winning, which keeps the organization together. In the long term, the goal is competitive activities and achieving these goals and objectives. The concept of success is reshaped in terms of market share and penetration. Overcoming competition, increasing shares in the market, and market leadership dominates the success criteria of culture <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 2006:40)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Theoretical Background</head><p>In this study, the relationship between organizational culture and organizational dissent is explained based on the Person-Environment Fit Theory. The theory is defined as the harmony, conformity, or consistency that arises between the individuals and their environments such as work, organization, group, or profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Pervin, 1968)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kristof (1996)</ref>, harmony takes place mostly between the individual and the (environment) organization in which the individual is located, and Kristof calls this harmony "Person-Environment Fit". If the individual becomes integrated with the organization, the commitment to the organization will increase and the organization and the individual will begin to act in line with the common goal. If the individual establishes a strong link between his personality traits and organizational structure, he will take a more constructive, managerial attitude in dealing with other members of the organization, without much effort to adapt to the norms of the organization. Individuals need to find suitable members for their personalities within the organization. The effectiveness of the organization will increase if relations with these individuals occur within the framework of certain patterns. The main reason for the dissenting behaviors that result in the organization and the result of leaving the job is the incompatibility between the person's expectations from the organization and the functioning of the organization. Besides, if the personality traits of the individual do not comply with the organization, the information or message to be conveyed may not healthily reach the necessary places or may be misinterpreted. This may lead to conflicts in the organization and decrease the efficiency of the organization <ref type="bibr">(Erdoğan, 1994:266-267)</ref>. As a result of the interaction of organizational and individual values, this study examines the effect of organizational culture on dissent behaviors, based on the Person-Organization Fit Theory, which argues that the organization can also shape the attitudes and behaviors of the individual.</p><p>In the literature, studies investigating the relationship between culture dimensions in the competing values framework and organizational dissent have been limited. Studies including <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cameron &amp; Quinn (1999)</ref>'s Competing Values Framework and the relationship between different types of organizational culture and concepts that may contain dissent behaviors in their content such as organizational silence and organizational voices have taken more place in the literature <ref type="bibr">(Yaman &amp; Ruçlar, 2014:36-50;</ref><ref type="bibr">Acaray et al., 2015:472-482;</ref><ref type="bibr">Çavuşoğlu &amp; Köse, 2016:115-146)</ref>. For this reason, the relationship between organizational culture and organizational dissent was investigated based on the research results that deal with organizational silence, organizational voices that may be associated with organizational dissent.</p><p>When empirical studies related to the effect of clan culture on organizational dissent are examined, <ref type="bibr">Acaray et al. (2015:472-482)</ref> support the mentor manager-employee relationship; He stated that the employees in the clan culture will express their views openly against the negativities in the working environment. This sense of togetherness makes employees think that the negativities that may occur in the organization may arise from them, and this idea is an internal motivation tool for employees. <ref type="bibr">Kowtha &amp; Landau (2001:1-34</ref>) stated that clan culture is characterized by a charismatic authority stemming from the knowledge and mastery of the manager, based on the knowledge and organizational culture model of <ref type="bibr">Boisot &amp; Child (1988:507-527)</ref>. Those who work in clan culture do not reveal their opposing thoughts about the organization or its administrators much because of their sense of belonging to the organization. Freedom of expression of ideas and thoughts that reflect the essence of clan culture may differ from country to country. In the organizational sense, all processes and approaches can change according to cultures <ref type="bibr">(Stephens &amp; Greer, 1995:108)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Croucher et al. (2014:298-313</ref>) examined the relationship between organizational dissent and freedom of expression in the workplace in their intercultural studies. As a result of their studies investigating the relationship between organizational dissent and freedom of expression in the workplace, individuals in five European countries, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, have demonstrated that freedom of expression in the workplace is positively associated with dissent behavior. The open and democratic communication system makes its employees more responsible not to feel foreign in their organizations and creates a sense of belonging <ref type="bibr">(Parcham &amp; Ghasemizad, 2016:25-30)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ataç &amp; Köse (2017:117)</ref> found that increasing democratization in organizations will increase organizational dissent. As in this study, the authors reached the three-dimensional organizational dissent scale together with the latent dissent by separating the articulated dissent into constructive articulated dissent and questioning articulated dissent. As the result obtained from the findings increases in democratization and freedom of expression in organizations, constructive articulated dissent increases, and questioning articulated dissent decreases. The more constructive way of dissent is due to the sense of belonging and integrity provided by the clan culture. Employees consider the benefits of the organization rather than their interests in this culture <ref type="bibr">(Ataç &amp; Köse, 2017:117)</ref>.</p><p>Based on all these results, the hypotheses about how and to what extent the clan culture affects the organizational dissent behavior of employees is as follows: Empirical studies about the effect of adhocracy culture on organizational dissent focus on creativity, entrepreneurship, flexibility, and adaptation that represent adhocracy. The most important point in adapting to the environments where uncertainty prevails is to be innovative in this culture <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 2006:43)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ötken &amp; Cenkci (2013:41-51)</ref> examined the relationship between personality factors such as responsibility and assertiveness, extroversion, openness to a new experience which are the necessities of adhocracy culture, and organizational dissent. In this study, where the articulated dissent was examined in two sub-dimensions as constructive and questioning, it was found that there was a positive and significant relationship between constructive articulated dissent variable and extroversion, responsibility, and openness to a new experience.</p><p>The behaviors brought by the responsibility emerge as the voice of the employee in the culture of adhocracy, which promotes flexibility and entrepreneurship. <ref type="bibr">Aktaş &amp; Şimşek (2014:24-52</ref>) found a significant negative relationship between employees with adhocracy culture and organizational silence in their studies in three hospitals operating in Istanbul. Employees in such organizations, where more flexibility and entrepreneurship are encouraged, can express their reactions to problems more clearly. The flexible structure of the adhocracy culture and the encouragement of entrepreneurship cause the conflicts to decrease in the organization as it forces the employees to produce extroverted. Because in the culture of adhocracy, managers are seen as visionary, reliable, creative, and risk-oriented. Payne (2014:236) found that trust in superiors in an innovative organization increases employees' articulated dissent behavior, but in the opposite case, members of organizations that do not trust their superiors show more latent and displaced dissent behavior.</p><p>In this respect, the hypotheses about how and to what extent the adhocracy dimension affects the organizational dissent behavior of the employees are as follows: It is aimed at the hierarchy culture, which is guided by official rules, procedures, and policies <ref type="bibr">(Weber, 1947:330)</ref>, to minimize uncertainty, intensive security, precision, foresight, stability, formal organization, and standardization because of its unique features. The behavioral output of the hierarchy culture, which is dominant in the organization, may differ. Firstly, although the superiors do not consider the participation of subordinates to the common decisions and policies of the organization, they do not consider it appropriate to speak openly to the superiors about this issue. The second case is closely related to the degree of adaptability of the individual's organization. Because the individual is afraid to express ideas clearly in the organization with the effect of "Somehow, I cannot get any results" <ref type="bibr">(Marrison &amp; Milleken, 2004:34)</ref>. The biggest reasons for the employees to remain silent in the businesses and avoid telling their real ideas are divided into four categories. These are the concerns of different return when employees make voices, the loss of value and reputation that may arise in the eyes of the manager or superior, the idea that voicing their ideas won't work, the desire not to be the person who causes problems and causes separation in the organization <ref type="bibr">(Gleespen, 1993:417)</ref>.</p><p>In a study that <ref type="bibr">Çavuşoğlu &amp; Köse (2016:117)</ref> applied to university staff, in the dominant hierarchical culture the staff preferred to remain silent against their superiors within the organization, and as a reason, the employees who have confidence problems in the organization share their ideas and a problem with people who are trustable and only have similar personality traits within the organization. It can be said that the hierarchy culture prevents the dissent of the employees in a way due to its unique structure and concrete examples obtained from the research findings. <ref type="bibr">Pearlin (1962:320)</ref>, in his study with hospital employees, identified the most important obstacles to exposing the opinions and ideas of employees in organizations as increasing centralization in decision-making processes, not allowing employees to participate in decisions and implementing a strict hierarchy.</p><p>Within the scope of the research, the hypotheses about how and to what extent hierarchy culture affects organizational dissent behavior are as follows: The market culture, whose main goal is to achieve a competitive advantage and reach the goal <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 2006:39</ref>) by focusing on the external environment, is focused on the external environment and internal issues are secondary in the market culture. To realize their personal interests in the market culture, individuals try to increase factors such as increasing performance, efficiency, and planning in the external environment. In the market culture, the voice of the employee can be expected to be strong and brutal for these reasons. Since the attitude of the manager is more focused on the external environment in the market culture, low power differences are observed and more consensus is tried to be solved in the solution of the problems that may arise in the organization. Although there is a consensus in the market culture because the information is clear, the voice of the employees directly in the organization is strong, but the sound is more individual rather than based on team and friendship, as in clan culture. In organizations with a market culture where formal procedures are not dominant, dissenting views will take place through both formal and informal channels. <ref type="bibr">(Kowtha &amp; Landau, 2001:36)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Irani &amp; Sharp (1997:199-223)</ref> argued that the adoption of innovation, which is another indicator of the existence of market culture, as a culture in the organization may trigger dissent behaviors. Project teams or owners who realize innovation projects may encounter resistance in the organization. As a result of resistance, dissent behavior will be exposed and with these behaviors, the organization can face. <ref type="bibr">Üçok (2016:67)</ref> obtained more different findings in his study. The author found that the silence behavior will be more in the organizations where competition is in the foreground. As a result of the competition, it was stated in the study that with the rewarding system based on superior effort, the relations of the employees in the organizations will be based on individual interests and employees will be reluctant to share their ideas freely.</p><p>Accordingly, the hypotheses about how and to what extent the market culture affects organizational dissent behavior are as follows: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Sample</head><p>The research universe consists of white-collar employees employed in the textile, automotive, and machinery sectors in organized industrial zones I. and II. in Duzce, Turkey. The total number of white-collar employed in organized industrial zones is 407 people. Within the scope of the research, a sample of 211 people was reached from the sectors in the region. The results of the research to be made with a sample selected from these three sectors will be generalizable for more than half of the workforce. Because the purpose of the sample is to provide the researcher with the necessary information to make generalizations about the population without having to reach the entire population <ref type="bibr">(Neuman, 2006:31)</ref>. The quality of the concepts investigated was decisive in the inclusion of only white-collar employees in the research. A white-collar employee is a group of employees who work with more mental strength rather than their physical strength, or in other words, are active in administrative and research and development, and are in a wide range from civil servant to executive positions. In a sample where blue-collar is chosen according to white-collar, where behavioral relationships are more intense, employees participate reluctantly in academic studies, fill the questionnaires in their studies unconsciously, and in a way that does not reflect the truth. It was observed that they took a negative attitude with the thought that it would serve their interests, but fear that it would cause harm rather than benefit them <ref type="bibr">(Yücesan, 2001:340)</ref>.</p><p>In the sample selection phase of the research, convenience and snowball sampling techniques were used together. The convenience sampling technique is a technique in which the participants voluntarily participate in the research, which provides researchers an advantage both in terms of reaching the participants and in terms of time and cost. The Snowball sampling technique is a technique that starts depending on several events or subjects and enables the researcher to connect with potential new participants with the help of the subjects <ref type="bibr">(Punch, 1998:67)</ref>. In the organized industrial zones firstly, a survey was conducted with volunteer participants, and then, with the help of volunteer participants, new participants were reached and the number of samples was increased in this way.</p><p>When demographic features of the sample evaluated as sectorial, approximately 46% of the sample consists of the machinery sector, 31% of the automotive sector, and 15% of the textile sector. These three sectors are the sectors with the highest number of white-collar participants in the selected population. When evaluated in terms of the positions of whitecollar in three companies operating in three different sectors, there is a sublevel manager with a maximum of 41% and a senior manager with a minimum of 5%. While the number of mid-level managers constitutes approximately 31% of the sample, approximately 23% of the white-collar employees who are employed are non-executive white-collar personnel. When evaluated in terms of the experiences of white-collar companies in the enterprises, close percentages stand out. The range of years in which the experience is seen proportionally about 28% is between 0-2 years. The range of 2-4 years, with little experience, is proportionally 26%. While the rate of white-collar employees working for 8 years or more in businesses is 19%, approximately 20% of this experienced white collar group consists of senior managers. Due to the machinery and automotive sectors, approximately 75% of the white-collar employees are 73% male and 27% female. The age range of the employees, on the other hand, is similar to the rates in which the density is mostly seen in the positions of chief-officer, sublevel, and mid-level managers. The age range was mostly collected in the 25-34 age group with a rate of 53%, and this represents more than half of the sample. Again, the age range of 35-44 has approximately 30% and the lowest rate consists of 1% with 55 years and above the white-collar. When the educational status of the white-collar people participating in the study is examined, it is understood that the density is seen in graduates of college and bachelor's degrees and constitutes 80% of the sample (college 35.5%, bachelor's degree 44.5%). The proportion of primary and high school graduates is about 13%. When the white-collar people are evaluated within the framework of marital status, it is understood that the sample consists of approximately 64% of the married workers, and single workers are represented by 36%.</p></div>

The scale has two subdimensions: articulated and latent dissent. The scale which we used has been revised according to the "Organizational Dissent Scale" was developed by <ref type="bibr">Kassing (1998:183-229)</ref>. This scale which consists of three dimensions are articulated dissent, latent dissent and displaced dissent, is the first scale study of organizational dissent. In the new scale, the number of questions was reduced to 18, and the displaced dissent dimension was removed from the scale. The reason for this situation is the hypotheses that cannot be established in relationally with displaced dissent <ref type="bibr">(Kassing, 2000:394)</ref>.

In this regard, it is seen that the validity of the structure and scope has been tested many times. In this study, to test the reliability of the scale, reliability analyzes of four sub-dimensions determined by factor analysis were performed. It is seen that the lower limit of Cronbach's Alpha coefficient accepted for social sciences is .70 <ref type="bibr">(Altunışık et al., 2007:132)</ref>. It is seen that the four sub-dimensions of the organizational culture scale used in the thesis study are above the .70 limit. In this case, it was concluded that the dimensions obtained were safe for research. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the Cronbach's Alpha values for these dimensions. With the data obtained from the 211 questionnaire forms collected, exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the scale of organizational dissent. The KMO value was found to be 0.794 and the result of the Bartlett test was significant (Sig = 0.000). In the first analysis, a 5-factor structure that explains 61.847% of the total variance was obtained. Six items <ref type="bibr">(1, 2, 3, 6, 13, and 16</ref>) with cross-factor loading were removed from the scale and factor analysis was done again. In the exploratory factor analysis conducted with the remaining 12 items, a three-factor structure emerged, and the KMO value of 0.768 was significant as a result of the Bartlett test (Sig. = 0.000).

The "Organizational Dissent Scale" of <ref type="bibr">Kassing (2000:387-396</ref>) consists of 2 sub-dimensions, namely articulated dissent and latent dissent. However, the exploratory factor analysis in this study revealed two different factors within the articles related to the articulated dissent dimension. In the literature, it has been observed previously in articulated dissent divided as two-factor of size in a study conducted in Turkey related to organizational dissent. <ref type="bibr">Ötken &amp; Cenkçi (2013:46)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ataç &amp; Köse (2017:117)</ref> have divided the articulated dissent dimension of the organizational dissent into two factors as "constructive articulated dissent " and "questioning articulated dissent " and brought a new perspective to the organizational dissent literature. In these studies, there was a divergence in the articulated dissent dimension, which was similar to these studies. Two different sizes of new behavior in these results demonstrated that the dissent has strengthened the possibility that Turkey might be addressed. In this study, two new dimensions of articulated dissent behavior were used with their names in the literature. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>In this part of the research, correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> shows the means of sub-dimensions of the variables, their standard deviations and the correlation between the variables. When the mean and standard deviations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> are examined, it is understood that the highest score among the mean of the dimensions of the organizational culture belongs to the market culture (x̄ = 3.760). Market culture is followed by clan culture (x̄ = 3.430), adhocracy culture (x̄ = 3.394) and hierarchy culture (x̄ = 3.345). When the mean of all dimensions are evaluated, it is seen that they have high means. It is possible to talk about the existence of culture with these high scores in the organizations where the participants are included. The fact that the dimensions of the organizational culture scores above the mean makes the research subject more interesting. When the dimensions of the organizational dissent are examined, it is seen that the latent dissent has the lowest mean (x̄ = 3.105) and the highest mean belongs to the constructive articulated dissent (x̄ = 3.655).</p><p>When the correlations between the dimensions of two different variables are examined, it is found that there is a positive and positive relationship between the clan culture and the constructive articulated dissent (r (211) = -.313, p &lt;.001).

On the other hand, there is a positive relationship (r (211) =.311, p &lt;.001) between adhocracy culture and constructive articulated dissent and no significant relationship between questioning articulated and latent dissent. While there is no significant relationship between hierarchy culture and constructive articulated dissent, there is a positive relationship between hierarchy culture and questioning articulated dissent, between hierarchy culture and latent dissent (r (211) =.148, p &lt;.001; r (211) =.133, p 005). A positive correlation is found between market culture and constructive articulated dissent (r (211) =.189, p &lt;.001). No significant correlation is found between the market culture dimension and the other sub-dimensions of the organizational dissent.</p><p>As a result of the structural model with path analysis performed to test the hypotheses of the research, due to the normal distribution of data collected from 211 participants in the 5-point Likert scale, a covariance matrix is created using the Maximum Likelihood calculation method.

When the model is evaluated according to X 2 and degree of freedom rate (X 2 / sd = 1.959). The model's RMSEA value is first found to be 0.112 and is not at the desired level. By correcting this value, the analysis is repeated and improvement was achieved by correlating the error coefficients of some variables (e1-e2; e22-e23; e26-e27) in the model. The last RMSEA value has decreased to 0.068 and has reached a sufficient level for the model's fit. Other goodness of fit indices also support the acceptability <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wang &amp;Wang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Waltz et.al, 2010)</ref>    When evaluated in terms of regression weights, coefficients having values less than 0.10, means the effect is small; It is medium to be around 0.30; 0.50 and above means that it is at a high level. Based on these coefficient values, clan culture has a moderate and negative effect on the questioning articulated dissent <ref type="bibr">(-0.19; p &lt;0.05)</ref>. This means that a one point increase in clan culture in organizations will result in a 0.19 point decrease in questioning articulated dissent behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>When the relationship between the two variables and their sub-dimensions is analyzed, it is seen that the clan culture mostly has a negative relationship with the organizational dissent. The organizational dissent probably falls and the opposing views that will arise due to this situation will be more constructive in the favor of the organization and the individual since the people working in the clan culture feel like they are in a family environment and can share their personal or internal problems or suggestions freely with their superiors. In the results of the analysis, it is determined that the clan culture is the highest related dimension among the organizational dissent dimensions and the constructive articulated dissent. When examined causally, the basis of this high relationship is the communication dimension with the superiors and subordinates. <ref type="bibr">Kassing (2000:390)</ref> found that the quality of the relationship of the subordinates with their superiors and the concept of articulated dissent are positively related. When the superiors provide their subordinates with a freer environment, the latent dissent behavior in the organization will naturally decrease. However, the fact that the superiors do not leave the door open to their subordinates will cause some rumors to emerge and increase communication in the horizontal direction <ref type="bibr">(Yılmaz, 2009:259)</ref>.</p><p>Increasing communication and friendly relations in the horizontal direction may decrease latent dissent behavior. Also, it is expected that the clan culture will be negatively related to the questioning articulated dissent behavior in parallel with the relation of constructive articulated dissent and latent dissent. However, such a finding is not found in the analysis results. The clan culture increases the constructive articulated dissent while decreasing the latent dissent, but it is not related to the questioning articulated dissent behavior. This situation is thought to be due to the overlapping of the fair and free structure of the clan culture with the personality traits of individuals. However, this situation can be associated with the concept of justice within the organization. Fairness of the results or awards encountered may shape the direction of dissent behavior. When employees perceive outputs of decisions and their attainments are fair, their dissent appearance to their co-workers' increases, which might imply that in a fair environment, employees feel self-assured and don't hesitate to dissent <ref type="bibr">(Özsahin &amp; Yürür, 2019:4)</ref>.</p><p>If the person-environment fit theory referred to in this study is to be taken, the values of the individual must coincide with the attitudes and goals of the organization <ref type="bibr">(Kristof et al., 2005:290)</ref>. For this reason, in clan-type organizations, individuals refrain from carrying out behaviors that would disrupt the harmony within the organization and have a serious commitment to their organizations.</p><p>It is seen that clan culture negatively affects questioning articulated dissent behavior. However, there are some differences when looking at bilateral correlations. While there is a significant relationship between clan culture and both constructive and latent dissent behavior, there are differences in terms of the effect of clan culture on the dimensions of organizational dissent. These differences show that other organizational factors that may affect dissent behavior may be caused. Providing freedom of clan culture in Turkey affects the commitment of employees to their organizations. Apart from this, although the clan culture that requires responsibility dominates the organization, the continuity of old and corrupt traditions in the working environment and the experiences gained from these traditions in the past can shape the dissent behavior direction of the employees in organizations. In Turkey, many studies about the cultural structure of the organization, with a high power distance in organizations, mostly with low assertiveness abilities of employees, the expectation of the employee's related flexible work conditions, the employees 'widespread fear of criticisms, and employees' hesitant about taking responsibility are stated <ref type="bibr">(Akın, 2010:834)</ref>.</p><p>The culture of adhocracy is also in a positive and significant relationship with the constructive articulated dissent. Adhocracy culture is a type of culture that requires being more extroverted and more sociable. Accordingly, it will not be wrong to compare the culture of adhocracy to market culture more. The flexibility and tolerance that is dominant in this culture offer employees a freer environment as in the clan culture. The most important difference from the market culture is not to stand out in the direction of organizational interests and to take responsibility for bringing innovations for the organization. In this direction, it is possible to express the opposing views in such organizations in the interests of the organizations or in other words, they are more constructive, and similar findings were found in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ötken &amp; Cenkci (2013)</ref> similarly found that there is a positive and meaningful relationship between constructive articulated dissent and extroversion, responsibility, and openness to a new experience. As the level of responsibility of the individual increases, it will adopt the interests of the organization more and solutions will be more constructive in this direction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liu &amp; Cho (2011)</ref> found that the increase in the culture of adhocracy, which supports freedom in hospitals, will encourage employees to express themselves more clearly in the organization. Employees who can take responsibility where the control mechanism is flexible and can freely develop new ideas in the culture of adhocracy feel happy and believing that they can achieve something <ref type="bibr">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 1999:38)</ref>. When the belief that the employee can accomplish something by taking responsibility in the organization disappears, employees will feel that he/ she has experienced a decrease in personal success. With this feeling, the employee will feel insufficient for the organization, lose motivation, and feel that the efforts they spend cannot make a difference in the organization. <ref type="bibr">(Leiter &amp; Maslach, 1988:297-298)</ref>. The results reached by <ref type="bibr">Avtgis et al. (2007:100-101)</ref> indicate that employees who experience burnout with the loss of belief that they think fails in the organization will prefer to remain silent in the organization and reduce their articulated or latent dissent behavior.</p><p>When the findings regarding the relationship between the hierarchy culture and the dimensions of the organizational dissent are evaluated, findings different from the clan and adhocracy dimensions were found. According to these findings, as the hierarchy culture increases, the size of the dissent becomes more questioning and the latent dissent behavior also increases. However, no negative relationship is found with questioning articulated dissent behavior. If this finding is evaluated, the dissent behavior is mostly disliked in the organizations, and in the hierarchical organizations, the dissent is almost completely silenced. In such an organizational structure, individuals are not expected to turn towards a more questioning articulated dissent. <ref type="bibr">Kassing (1997:344)</ref>, who reached partially similar findings, found that workers in hierarchical structures silenced by the dissent show silent behavior other than unethical matters, but only in latent dissent behavior when an unethical situation exists. In the analysis in this study, no relation between hierarchy culture and questioning articulated dissent behavior is found, and the relationship between hierarchical structure and latent dissent behavior partially overlaps with Kassing's work. The people working at the lowest level in the organization mostly show latent dissent behavior in the hierarchy culture. <ref type="bibr">Kassing &amp; Armstrong (2001)</ref> found similar that workers mostly show articulated dissent behavior in the management position in the organization; and in lower positions prefer the latent dissent. Considering that the lower-level employees, who constitute the majority in the hierarchy culture, display the latent dissent behavior, it is an expected result that the opposing views within the organization are not expressively constructed. Again, considering the latent dissent behavior, even if it is questioning in the hierarchy culture, it is very difficult to express ideas and opinions and the results will not be welcomed by the managers, and it takes the employees away from articulated dissent behavior. In Turkey, expressing thoughts of employees to superiors or expressing thoughts of the child to grants is limited. Turkey is more important in the authorities and chairs; hierarchical respect, strict and authoritarian management styles are dominant. <ref type="bibr">Özdevecioğlu &amp; Akin (2013:128)</ref>, both in the public and private sectors in the study has found that the dominant culture of the hierarchy in Turkey. <ref type="bibr">Berberoğlu's (1989:95-99)</ref> findings gained from the research is to examine the organizational structure in the business press in Turkey are the qualities that Turkey still describes the common culture of the hierarchical structure of the organizational culture. In the findings, it was found that the hierarchical structure that continued from the employer or its representatives observed in the organizations in the past years to the lower steps continues. However, it has been found that the relations in the organizations are shaped according to the personality of the managers, the knowledge and experience of the employees and that the employees display behaviors in this direction and freedoms are disciplined. It has been found that employees are not included in the policies of the organizations and that subordinates do not have the right to speak together with strict authority practices.</p><p>No effect of market culture was observed on dimensions of the organizational dissent. Examining the structure of the market culture in organizations in Turkey, it is seen that the top executives adopt a mixed organizational culture of perceptive. If other dimensions of organizational culture in similar situations thought to be concerned say that having a single culture in the organization structure of the business culture in Turkey will be difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cameron &amp; Quinn (2006)</ref> stated that four different types of organizations can exist in one organization at the same time. It can also be a dominant culture or culture that can be equally across departments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cameron &amp; Quinn, 2006)</ref>. Especially considering the Turkish society that tends to avoid uncertainty, as well as the impact of market culture in organizations, it will be in the interest of the enterprises to adopt mixed culture types regarding the reactions of the employees. This research is important in that it provides preliminary findings that reveal the impact of organizational culture on organizational dissent. Organizational culture is not the only phenomenon that will affect dissent behavior in organizations and direct them. Studies in which many cases that may exist in the organization are included in the relationship between organizational culture and organizational dissent will contribute greatly to the literature. Considering firms in future studies, it is likely that a need will emerge in the literature on the extent to which different cultures of different countries affect organizational dissent in the working environment.</p></div>
