<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In 2022, the number of poor people in Java is ranked first in Indonesia, as many as 4. 181. 290 inhabitants (semester one) and 4. 236. 510 inhabitants (second semester). Factors are the cause of population growth and unemployment rates. This research aims to measure and determine the effect of population growth on poverty through the unemployment rate as a mediating variable. This research uses quantitative methods. Data collection techniques were obtained from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) of East Java Province in the form of time series data from 201 to 2021. Data analysis techniques include classical assumption tests, path analysis tests and Sobel tests through IBM SPSS Statistics 25 software and online statistics calculators. The results of this research show that population growth has a positive and insignificant effect on poverty. The result of the regression coefficient is a positive direction of 0.324 with a significance value of 0.091 &gt; 0.05. In addition, people without progress in other developmental factors will not increase income. Population growth has a positive and significant effect on the unemployment rate. The resulting regression coefficient is a positive direction of 0.225 with a significance value of 0.004 &lt; 0.05. The increase in population cannot be fully absorbed by the company. The unemployment rate has a negative and significant effect on poverty. Theregression coefficient is a negative direction of -0.948 with a significance value of 0.000 &lt; 0.05. Unemployment is not necessarily low or underprivileged. Because they are from families with sufficient income. Population growth on poverty mediated by the unemployment rate is a negative effect and there is no mediated effect. The result of the sobel test obtained an Unstandardized Coefficients B value of -0.213 and an Unstandardized Coefficients Std value. Error of 0.085 &gt; 0.05.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Poverty is a condition that is often associated with an inability on the economic side in order to meet the needs of daily life <ref type="bibr">(Utami &amp;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Masjkuri, 2018)</ref>. Absolute poverty is measured based on the inability to meet minimum basic needs such as food, clothing, health, housing and education needed to live and work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agustini &amp;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kurniasih, 2017)</ref>. Minimum basic needs are defined as financial measures in the form of money and the minimum needs of basic needs are called the poverty line <ref type="bibr">(Agustina et al., 2018)</ref>. People whose income is below the poverty line are classified as poor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Primandari, 2018)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr">RI, 2022 (data processed)</ref> In table 1 it can be seen that the number of poor people in East Java in 20 22 is in the first place in Indonesia, with the number of poor people in the first semester as many as 4. 181. 290 people and second semester as many as 4. 236. 510 inhabitants in 2022. Although the number of poor people in Java tends to fluctuate from 20 to 20 to 21. This can be seen in tabel 2 as follows:  <ref type="bibr">RI, 2022 (data processed)</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that the number of poor people in East Java in 2017 was 4,617.01 0 people, in 2018 it decreased to 4,332,590 people and in 2019 it again decreased to 4,112,250 people. However, in 2020 it increased to 4,419.10 0 people and in 2021 it increased again to 4,572.730 people. Java Timur Province consists of 29 regencies and 9 cities. The number of poor people in K ota tends to be lower than the number of poor people in Kabupaten.</p><p>Based on data from the Indonesian Statistics Center (BPS RI) in 2022, it has shown that the poverty rate in East Java province is very high with the first place in Indonesia <ref type="bibr">(BPS RI, 2022)</ref>. So that this must be addressed with government policy strategies that lead to the achievement of a just and prosperous society <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wirawan &amp;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Arka, 2015)</ref>. Because the main indicator of success in the economic development of a region is reducing the poverty rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Nabawi, 2020)</ref>. The goal of economic development is strongly emphasized by the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Mr. Ir. H. Joko Widodo through Presidential Instruction No. 4 of 2022 concerning the Acceleration of the Elimination of Extreme Poverty throughout Indonesia by 2024. With the integration and synergy of programs and cooperation between ministries/agencies and provincial/district/city local governments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Iqbal, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Some of the factors that cause the increase in poverty are population growth factors. This is in accordance with research conducted by previous researchers which showed that population growth has a positive and significant effect on poverty levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Sari, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hilmi et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ritonga &amp; Wulantika, 2020)</ref>. Population growth has an influence on the poverty rate, because rapid population growth is the cause of high poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Putra et al., 2021)</ref>. Then the unemployment rate factor is also the cause of the increase in poverty. This is in accordance with research conducted by previous researchers which showed that the unemployment rate has a positive and significant effect on the poverty rate <ref type="bibr">(Lismana &amp; Sumarsono, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fadlillah et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ningrum, 2017)</ref>. A high unemployment rate can reduce the wages of people with low incomes so that income inequality or poverty is higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hindun et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, the population growth factor is also the cause of high unemployment. This is in accordance with research conducted by previous researchers which showed that population growth has a positive and significant effect on the unemployment rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Taime &amp; Djaelani, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sisnita &amp; Prawoto, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Albarqi, 2016)</ref>. The higher the population growth, the more unemployed the population will be. This proves that large population growth will cause unemployment <ref type="bibr">(Ayuningtyas,</ref><ref type="bibr">201: 8)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the explanation that has been described and the existence of several research gaps from relevant previous studies, this study aims tomeasure andknow the effect of population growth on poverty through unemployment rate as a mediating variable. The similarity of this research with previous research lies in the type of data used, namely time series data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) of the Republic of Indonesia. The difference between this study and previous research lies in the collection of data used, namely the data is determined based on a period of five years so that the novelty of the data is the most recentand clarity in the discussion will be more specific or detailed. Data analysis techniques in this study are classical assumption tests, path analysis tests and sobel tests as the methods used in this study. So that the results of this research are expected to be a benchmark for the government in determining effective policy strategies in reducing poverty in East Java province and relevant for scientific development and further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD Types of Research</head><p>In this research,applying quantitative research methods in associative form using one independent variable yes it is population growth, one dependent variable yes it is poverty and one mediating variable yes it is unemployment rate. Quantitative methods use research data in the form of numbers and statistical analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Sugiyono, 2016)</ref>. The data usedis time series data from 201 to 2021 obtained from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) of East Java Province. The secondary data is processed using the Path Analysis method which is an extension of regression analysis to determine the direct and indirect influence between the independent variable on the dependent variable through mediation variables. Data collection techniques using documentation and processing methods as well as quantitative data analysis include classical assumption tests, path analysis tests and sobel tests which all use the help of IBM SPSS Statistics 25 software and online statistics calculators through website <ref type="url" target="https://danielsoper.com/">https://danielsoper.com/</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Research Framework</head><p>The conceptual framework model in Path Analysis is as follows:</p><p>Figure    Based on table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the value of Asymp. Sig. (2-tailed) of 0.200 more than the value of Standart Sig. 0.05 or (0.200 &gt; 0.05). So this shows that the variable data of population growth on poverty through the unemployment rate is normally distributed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Population Growth (X) and Poverty (Y)</head><p>Based on the linear regression equation above, the result of the linear regression coefficient of population growth is a positive direction of 0.324 with a significance value of 0.091 which is more than the significance level of 0.05 or 5% as the probability standard used. So it tells that population growth has a positive and insignificant effect on poverty in 201 7-20 21in East Java Province. The results of this study show that in the long run population growth has a positive effect on poverty. There are several things that make population growth an obstacle to development and have a positive effect on poverty. An increase in population growth without being accompanied by advances in other developmental factors will not increaseincome and demand. Thus, rising population growth will actually lower wage levels and also lower production costs.</p><p>According to Malthus (in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Conway, 2015)</ref> the continuous increase in population growth is a necessary element to support additional demand, but on the other hand a high increase in population growth is feared to have an adverse effect on economic growth which impacts the prospects for poverty reduction and further development efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Conway, 2015)</ref> . According to the World Bank (2016), most of Indonesia's population lives around the poverty line. With the increase in population, it also results in an increasing burden that must be borne by the head of the family in meeting his needs. Because of this increased burden, it is possible for a family that previously lived above the poverty line, to be included in the poor category, because the ability to meet their needs (income) is fixed, but the number of needs increases <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2016)</ref>. The results of this study are in accordance with previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Trisnu &amp; Sudiana (2019)</ref> which showed that population growth had a positive and insignificant effect on poverty in Regencies / Municipalities in Bali Province <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Trisnu &amp; Sudiana, 2019)</ref>. However, the results of this study are also different from the previous one conducted by <ref type="bibr">Suhandi et al. (2015)</ref> which states that population growth has a negative and significant effect on poverty in Palembang City <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Suhandi et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Population Growth (X) to Unemployment Rate (Z)</head><p>Based on the linear regression equation above, the result of the linear regression coefficient of population growth is a positive direction of 0.225 with a significance value of 0.004 which is less than the significance level of 0.05 or 5% as the probability standard used. So it tells that population growth has a positive and significant effect on the unemployment rate in 201 7-20 21in East Java Province. The results of this study show that when there is an increase in population growth by 1%, it will increase the unemployment rate by 0.948%. The significance of population growth in influencing the unemployment rate in East Java Province is due to high population growth every year. Population growth has a positive and significant effect on East Java Province because of the high population growth caused by migration to the East Java region so that the increase in population cannot be fully absorbed by companies that provide jobs so that population growth will also increase the unemployment rate. East Java Province is also a trade and service area that should be able to absorb a lot of labor. However, due to very rapid technological advances, human power has slowly been replaced by machine power or sophisticated and modern technology in production activities.</p><p>According to Malthus (in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Skousen, 2005)</ref> the higher the population growth, the more unemployed people will be. More clearly, the faster the population will produce more and more workers, but this is not balanced with existing job opportunities. From that small number of opportunities, humans compete with each other in obtaining jobs and those who are left out in the competition become the unemployed. Therefore, efforts are needed to control population growth because someday natural resources will run out <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Skousen, 2005)</ref>. The results of this study are in accordance with previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Syam &amp; Wahab (201: 5)</ref> which showed that population growth had a positive and significant effect on the unemployment rate in Makassar City <ref type="bibr">(Syam &amp;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wahab, 2015)</ref>. However, the results of this study are also different from previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Zulfa (201: 6)</ref>, which stated that population growth had a negative and insignificant effect on the unemployment rate in Lhokseumawe City <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zulfa, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Unemployment Rate (Z) and Poverty (Y)</head><p>Based on the linear regression equation above, the result of the linear regression coefficient of the unemployment rate is a negative direction of -0.948 with a significance value of 0.000 which is less than the significance level of 0.05 or 5% as the probability standard used. So it tells that the unemployment rate has a negative and significant effect on poverty in East Java Province in 2017-20 21. The results of this study show that when there is an increase in the unemployment rate by 1% which should increase poverty but actually reduce poverty by 0.948%. It can also be said that the results of this study are inversely proportional between independent variables and dependen variables. So it can be interpreted that not all unemployment is poor because unemployment itself has several definitions. For example, there are individuals who are looking for work, individuals who are preparing for an organization but not looking for a job because they feel they cannot find a new job path and individuals who are looking for work but have not yet found a job opportunity.</p><p>Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (MENDIKBUDRISTEK), Nadiem Anwar Makarim stated that in 2020 East Java province ranked first with the most university graduates in Indonesia, which was 227,694 thousand people. Yang means that people in East Java are still able to finance the education of their family members up to the university level. So it can be said that the social welfare of the population in East Java can still be said to be very high <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(KEMENDIKBUD RI, 2021)</ref>. This indicates that those who are unemployed may not necessarily also have low per capita income. In addition, this is also supported by indications that not all those who are unemployed are categorized as underprivileged or poor. Because those who are unemployed certainly still have the potential to be supported by people who have enough per capita income to support their family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Zuhdiyaty &amp;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kaluge, 2018)</ref>. The results of this study are in accordance with previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Padli (2021)</ref>, which showed that the unemployment rate had a negative and significant effect on poverty in Districts/Municipalities in West Nusa Tenggara Province in 2009-2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Padli, 2021)</ref>. However, the results of this study are also different from previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Putra &amp; Arka (2018)</ref>, which stated that the unemployment rate had a positive and insignificant effect on poverty in districts / cities in Bali Province <ref type="bibr">(Putra &amp;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Arka,</ref><ref type="bibr">201: 8)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Population Growth (X) to Poverty (Y) through Unemployment Rate (Z)</head><p>Based on the results of data analysis of the effect of population growth on poverty through the level of unemployment shows that population growth does not have a significant effect on the unemployment rate and the level of unemployment does no Significant effect on poverty. So it can be concluded that the study of population growth variables on poverty through unemployment rate as a mediating variable based on the indirect influence relationship of the sobel test results is a negative effect with an Unstandardized Coefficients B value of -0.213 and does not significantly or does not mediate the effect of population growth on poverty with an Unstandardized Coefficients S value Td. Error of 0.085 which is more than the significance level of 0.05 or 5% as the probability standard used. From the calculation results using the sobel test formula, it shows that thitung &lt; ttable, which is with a value of -2.506 &lt; 1.96. In addition, from the results of online sobel tests using statistical calculators, a thitung value of -2.549 was obtained, it can be concluded that the indirect relationship between the influence of population growth on poverty through the increase in unemployment as an intervening variable there is no mediating influence.</p><p>The results of this study are in accordance with previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Murtala (20,</ref><ref type="bibr">17)</ref> which showed that population growth had no influenceon poverty in Aceh Province. This means that it gives an indication that if the condition of human resources is getting better, every time there is an increase in population growth, the tendency to reduce the poverty rate is greater or it can be said that there is a non-directional relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Murtala, 2017)</ref>. Then the results of this study are also in accordance with previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Prasetya &amp; Sumanto (2022)</ref>, which stated that the unemployment rate did not have a significant effect on poverty in East Java Province in 2011-2020. This means that the community's ability to meettheir needs and high graduation rates can indicate the ability to prosper their families even though they are not yet working or unemployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Prasetya &amp; Sumanto, 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, related to the absence of a mediating effect of the unemployment rate as an intervening variable between the influence of population growth on poverty has also been in accordance with the results of research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alwi et al (2021)</ref>, which shows that there is no mediating effect by the unemployment rate as an intervening variable between economicgrowth and education level on poverty in Jambi Province 2004-2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alwi et al., 2021)</ref>. Similarly, in accordance with the results of research conducted by Putri &amp;; Yuliana (2023), which shows that there is no mediating effect by the unemployment rate as an intervening variable between economicgrowth and poverty rates in Probolinggo <ref type="bibr">(Putri &amp;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yuliana, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on the resultsof research and the discussion above, it can be concluded that population growth affects poverty in 201, 7-2021 in East Java Province. This shows that population growth without being accompanied by advances in other developmental factors will not increaseincome and demand. Population growth affects the unemployment rate in 201 7-20 21in East Java Province. This shows that the increasing population cannot be fully absorbed by companies that provide jobs. The unemployment rate has no effect on poverty in 201 7-20 21in East Java Province. This shows that those who are unemployed do not necessarily have low per capita income and are categorized as underprivileged or poor. Because branda is still potenti supported by family members who have sufficient per capita income. Populationgrowth in poverty mediated by the unemployment rate is not indirectly related or there is no mediating effect.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .Figure 3 .</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
