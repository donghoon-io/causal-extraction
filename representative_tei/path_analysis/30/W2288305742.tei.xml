			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Healthcare practitioners' fitness to practise has often been linked to their personal and demographic characteristics. It is possible that situational factors, such as the work environment and physical or psychological well-being, also have an influence on an individual's fitness to practise. However, it is unclear how these factors might be linked to behaviours that risk compromising fitness to practise.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the association between job characteristics, well-being and behaviour reflecting risky practice amongst a sample of registered pharmacists in a region of the United Kingdom. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional self-report survey of 517 pharmacists. These data were subjected to principal component analysis and path analysis, with job characteristics (demand, autonomy and feedback) and well-being (distress and perceived competence) as the predictors and behaviour as the outcome variable. Two aspects of behaviour were found: overloading (taking on more work than one can comfortably manage) and risk taking (working at or beyond boundaries of safe practice). Separate path models including either job characteristics or well-being as independent variables provided a good fit to the dataset. Of the job characteristics, demand had the strongest association with behaviour, while the association between well-being and risky behaviour differed according to the aspect of behaviour being assessed. The findings suggest that, in general terms, situational factors should be considered alongside personal factors when assessing, judging or remediating fitness to practise. They also suggest the presence of different facets to the relationship between job characteristics, well-being and risky behaviour amongst pharmacists.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>One challenge for care quality and safety is ensuring that healthcare professionals remain fit to practise <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wachter, 2012)</ref>. While this can be achieved in part by detecting and remediating performance problems as they emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Weenink, Westert, Schoonhoven, Wollersheim, &amp; Kool, 2014)</ref>, another aspect is the control of factors that could compromise fitness to practise in the first place <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harrison, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jacobs, Hassell, Seston, Potter, &amp; Schafheutle, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>A number of studies have explored risk factors for fitness to practise by identifying the characteristics of healthcare professionals who have been referred either to a fitness to practise hearing or to an assessment and rehabilitation service; such referrals typically happen because of suspected professional misconduct (e.g. dishonesty) or health impairment (e.g. addiction) <ref type="bibr">(Phipps, Noyce, Walshe, Parker, &amp; Ashcroft, 2011a)</ref>. The characteristics typically highlighted by these studies include clinical specialty or sector, age, amount of experience, working without other healthcare professionals, gender, ethnicity, whether or not the practitioner was trained overseas, socio-economic class, and whether or not the practitioner has previously been disciplined (e.g. National Patient Safety <ref type="bibr">Agency, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chamberlain, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bismark, Spittal, Gurrin, Ward, &amp; Studdert, 2013)</ref>. The relationship between some of these characteristics and practitioner risk differs between studies, while other characteristics have a more consistent patternmost notably, male, ethnic minority and overseas-trained practitioners being at higher risk (as noted by <ref type="bibr">Phipps et al. (2011a,b)</ref> amongst others, however, such findings may reflect process variables such as working relationships rather than an inherent feature of particular demographic groups). Other studies have suggested a role for individual differences such as personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Firth-Cozens, Cording, &amp; Ginsburg, 2003)</ref> and cognitive ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Perry &amp; Crean, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Korinek, Thompson, McRae, &amp; Korinek, 2009)</ref> in practitioner risk; for example, doctors referred to a performance assessment service were found to have impaired intellectual and neuropsychological performance.</p><p>While these studies have focused on the role of enduring personal characteristics, it is likely that situational factors are also associated with practitioner risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nahrgang, Morgeson &amp; Hofmann, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Panagopoulou, Montgomery, &amp; Tsiga, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Firth-Cozens (2006)</ref> proposed a system model that places doctors' performance in the context of organisational stressors and individuals' psychological and physical well-being; these are proposed to affect patient care, both in their own right and in combination with personal characteristics. This view is supported by data from British doctors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Firth-Cozens &amp; Greenhalgh, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cohen, Rhydderch, Marfell, &amp; Cooper, 2009)</ref> and examination of malpractice cases amongst doctors in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stripe et al., 2006)</ref> and the Netherlands (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Goor et al, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>As in other health professions there is evidence to suggest that in general terms, demographic factors, individual differences, personal well-being and the work environment can affect both the performance of pharmacists and their likelihood of engaging in specific behaviours that compromise their fitness to practice <ref type="bibr">(Johnson, O'Connor, Jacobs, Hassell, &amp; Ashcroft, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Phipps, Noyce, Walshe, Parker, &amp; Ashcroft, 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Willis, Elvey, &amp; Hassell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schafheutle, Seston, &amp; Hassell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Merlo, Cummings, &amp; Cottler, 2003)</ref>. Other studies have explored the nature of the stressors that affect pharmacists' well-being; these commonly include excessive work demand, poor work-life balance, and lack of reward or recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lea, Corlett, &amp; Rodgers, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobs, Hassell, Ashcroft, Johnson, &amp; O'Connor, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">McCann, Adair, &amp; Hughes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">McCann, Hughes, Adair, &amp; Cardwell, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gaither, Kahaleh, Doucette, Mott, Pederson, &amp; Schommer, 2008)</ref>. While it is apparent from these studies that personal and situational factors could affect pharmacists' well-being and performance, there remain questions regarding how these factors relate to each other and to the behaviours that could compromise fitness to practise (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schafheutle et al., 2011)</ref>. The current study aims to address this question by examining the association between psychosocial factors (job characteristics and wellbeing) and engagement in risky behaviour (that is, behaviour that could lead to the emergence of a fitness to practise concern) amongst pharmacists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>The study used a cross-sectional survey design. The sampling frame consisted of all pharmacists registered to practise in Northern Ireland as of December 2010 <ref type="bibr">(N = 1978)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study measures</head><p>The following measures were used as part of the survey instrument:</p><p> Perceived work characteristics in health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Haynes, Wall, Bolden, Stride &amp; Rick, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The six-item measure of perceived work demand and the six-item measure of perceived autonomy (control) over one's work.</p><p> Work Design Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2006)</ref>. The three-item measure of task-related feedback available from other members of staff.</p><p> General Health Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Goldberg &amp; Williams, 1988)</ref>. The 12-item version of this questionnaire, with Likert scoring, in order to measure distress;  Well-being at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Warr, 1990)</ref>. The six-item measure of perceived work competence.</p><p> Measure of pharmacist risk behaviours. A 15-item measure, based on interview data from a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Phipps, Noyce, Walshe, Parker, &amp; Ashcroft, 2010)</ref>. This asks respondents to rate the frequency with which they engage in a set of risk-increasing or risk-reducing behaviours (see Appendix A for details).</p><p>The measures were selected by the authors on the basis of their content validity with respect to job characteristics and well-being. In order to establish their face validity, a convenience sample of ten pharmacists working at the authors' institution and ten pharmacists who were part of the study's sampling frame reviewed the measures' content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Every participant within the sampling frame was mailed a paper copy of the instrument, and invited to complete it anonymously and return it directly to the lead author using a reply-paid envelope.</p><p>Completed questionnaires were received from 543 respondents. Respondents who reported that they were not working at the time of completing the survey were removed from the sample. Demographic details of the final sample (N = 517, equating to a response rate of 26%) are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A comparison with demographic data for the entire sampling frame around the time of data collection (see <ref type="bibr">McCann, Hughes, et al., 2009)</ref> suggests that the distributions of employment sector and year of registration were broadly consistent with that of the study population, although there was some overrepresentation of hospital pharmacists (23.6% versus 13.5%) compared to community pharmacists (63.2% versus 74.2%) and underrepresentation of longer qualified pharmacists (5.1% qualified 1979 or earlier, versus 14.1%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>The distribution of responses and pattern of missing responses were initially examined using version 22 of SPSS. Because all measures were administered within a single instrument, the Lavaan package in version 3.1.2 of R <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> was then used to screen for common method variance (CMV) between the measures, following the procedure described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003)</ref>. This identified thirteen items in the risky behaviour measure, three of the items in the demand measure, and one of the items in the autonomy measure, as being contaminated by CMV.</p><p>As the effect of CMV appears to be confined mainly to two measures (risky behaviour and demand), all items were retained for the purposes of the analysis.</p><p>In order to determine whether the risky behaviour items form a unidimensional or a multidimensional measure, a principal component analysis was carried out using the Psych package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Revelle, 2015)</ref>. Components were extracted from the correlation matrix, and rotated using the promax procedure. The number of components to extract was decided on by examining the scree plot and the eigenvalue and squared multiple correlation of each component. During successive runs of the analysis any items that had a loading of more than .32 on more than one component, or that had no loading of at least .32 on any component, were removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In order to identify the effect of the independent variables (job characteristics and well-being) on the dependent variable (risky behaviour), three path models were specified. In Model A, job characteristics were proposed to have a direct association with risky behaviour. In Model B, wellbeing was proposed to have a direct association with risky behaviour. Model C combines Models A and B, with the additional proposal that well-being has an indirect effect on risky behaviour, mediated by well-being. During the analysis, each model was fit to covariance matrices and the maximum likelihood procedure was used to estimate model parameters. Each of the job characteristics and wellbeing measures was centred around its sample mean score prior to analysis, and cases with missing data were removed using listwise deletion. Model fit was assessed using the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The path analyses were conducted in R using Lavaan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data screening</head><p>Of the data points in the dataset, 0.5% were missing. Little's test indicated that these values were missing completely at random [χ 2 (1126) = 1174.07, p = 0.16], although year of registration and patient-facing versus non patient-facing were more affected than other variables (5.2% missing from each). There were 21 multivariate outliers on the study measures. Analysis of variance identified cases with missing data as reporting more years of experience and higher ratings for competence.</p><p>Outlier cases reported having high work demand with respect to the level of autonomy and feedback available to them, and a high frequency of risky behaviour, but a low level of distress. For each analysis the outlier cases were retained, and missing data deleted on a listwise basis, but the findings of these analyses were cross-checked with those obtained from two alternative datasets: one with outliers removed; the other with missing data substituted using the expectation maximization method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principal component analysis of risk behaviour items</head><p>The scree plot and eigenvalues suggested that three components could be extracted, and the squared multiple correlation of each component was higher than 0.9. However this solution was not adopted because only two items, with a correlation of 0.3 between them, loaded on the third component.</p><p>Instead, a solution consisting of two components was adopted. The components accounted for 46% of the variance in the item responses. Bartlett's test of sphericity and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy were within acceptable limits for the analysis [Bartlett χ 2 (66) = 1473.37, p &lt; 0.001; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin = 0.82]. The components are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 2 HERE</head><p>From the items loading on each component, the components were identified as follows: component 1 reflects overloading (that is, taking on a high volume of work relative to that which the respondent can deal with); and component 2 reflects risk-taking (working at or beyond the limits of safe practice).</p><p>Therefore, the single measure of risky behaviour was replaced with two measures, each representing one of these components. The descriptive statistics for the job characteristics, well-being and risky behaviour measures are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and their distributions in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test of modified path diagram</head><p>As a result of the principal component analysis, the path model was revised to that shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>Here, job characteristics and well-being are directly related to the two sets of risky behaviours (Models A and B respectively), and well-being accounts for the association between job characteristics and the risky behaviours (Model C). In order to construct Model C, paths for the job characteristics were added to Model B; these were added in an iterative manner, with paths added one-by-one until the best fitting version of Model C had been constructed. In all three models, covariance paths between items on the risky behaviour questionnaire were added as suggested by the modification indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE</head><p>The path weights for each model are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. In interpreting each path weight, he critical p value for statistical significance was assumed to be 0.05 divided by the number of parameters in the When these analyses were repeated with the outliers removed, the same associations were observed, except for the path between feedback and distress becoming non-significant. However, when missing data were substituted rather than listwise deleted, competence no longer had a significant association with either behaviour measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The findings indicate a general association between job characteristics, well-being and risky behaviour amongst pharmacists. Specifically, there appear to be at least two aspects to pharmacists' risky behaviour, each of which is predicted by particular elements of job characteristics and wellbeing. Work demand is the job characteristic that is most consistently related with behaviour, in combination with either competence or distress according to the aspect of behaviour being assessed.</p><p>In addition, each aspect of well-being is itself related to particular job characteristics. However, while job characteristics and well-being have associations with risky behaviour in their own right, and job characteristics have an association with well-being, there is only modest support for a model in which well-being mediates the association between job characteristics and well-being.</p><p>The findings highlight the potential role of situational factors in accounting for healthcare practitioners' performance or conduct. As such, they are consistent with those studies that have suggested a link between organisational stressors, individual well-being, and performance problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cohen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Montgomery, Todorova, Baban, &amp; Panagopoulou, 2013)</ref>. They are also broadly consistent with the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Firth-Cozens (2006)</ref>. With regard to the latter, though, the findings suggest that simply casting well-being as a mediator between the work environment and performance may not be the best way to account for the associations between these variables. Firth-Cozens' model proposes that individual differences such as personality and coping style also act as mediators, and so also need to be included in a mediation analysis.</p><p>The formation of different components from the risky behaviour items indicates that risky behaviourat least, in the context of pharmacy practiceis best understood as comprising different categories, closely related but differentially affected by psychosocial factors. For example, overworking could be conceived of as a product of perceived distress, risk taking a product of perceived competence, and both a product of perceived work demand. That the association between competence and risky behaviour was absent when the most experienced and competent respondents were retained in the sample suggests this association is confined to the relatively less confident respondents. Interestingly, those respondents who had a low level of distress despite experiencing heavy work demand and frequently engaging in risk behaviour appeared to introduce a link between feedback and distress. Why this might be is a matter for conjecture; one suggestion is that feedback about job performance helps respondents to manage any negative feelings associated with their work.</p><p>In methodological terms, the current study examines variation in risk factors across a population of healthcare professionals. Also, the outcome is defined in terms of behaviour that may lead to performance or conduct problems, rather than whether or not such problems have actually been identified. Therefore, the study complements previous studies that have concentrated on a subset of the population that has been identified to have performance or conduct problems. There are, though, some limitations with the methodology used here. Because the measure of risky behaviour is bespoke, neither it nor the components that were derived from it in the current study have been validated outside of this study sample. Furthermore, while the findings are consistent with previous studies, the extent to which they generalise to other locations or professional groups is not clear; more so given the relatively low response rate from this sampling frame. Finally, the study relies on crosssectional self-reported data. As described in the method section, any contamination of the findings due to common method variance is limited; nevertheless a cause-and-effect relationship between the study variables can only be inferred on the basis of these findings. It is quite possible that bidirectional or reciprocal relationships exist between the variables over time; for example, distress both influencing and being influenced by engagement in risk-taking behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ford et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The findings support the argument that fitness-to-practise risk is not a matter only of personal or employment characteristics, but also of a given practitioners' work setting and personal well-being <ref type="bibr">(Cox, King, Hutchison, &amp; McAvoy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jacobs, Hassell, Seston, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">van den Goor et al., 2015)</ref>. These factors should be taken into account when screening members of a professional group for risk, and also when deciding how to remediate any problems that do arise. A remedial or preventative intervention should consider ways of improving the overall fit between the practitioner and his or her work environment (for example by changing one or the other, or both) as opposed to focusing only on the practitioner <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harrison, 2008)</ref>. In order to aid decision-making about the most suitable sanction, both personal and situational factors should be incorporated into the classification or formulation of a disciplinary case <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Elkin, Spittal, Elkin, &amp; Studdert, 2012)</ref>. A more general point to be drawn from the findings is the multifaceted nature of the link between psychosocial factors and behaviour; for one thing, positive and negative aspects of well-being could be differentially affected by job characteristics, or have differential effects on behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Warr, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Further studies should be carried out to establish whether the findings can be generalised to other healthcare professions or locations (for example, primary care medicine: <ref type="bibr">Calnan, Wainright, Forsythe, Wall, &amp; Almond, 2001)</ref>. Such studies should, where possible, also assess the role of individual differences and attitudinal factors that could affect risky behaviour (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Phipps, Beatty, &amp; Parker, 2015)</ref> and lifestyle factors that could affect well-being. They should also use a longitudinal design in order to further explore the cause-and-effect relationships suggested here.   </p></div>

When the job characteristics measures are used as independent variables (Model A), only demand has a significant association with either behavioural measure. The fit indices for this model indicate a statistically significant chi-square test [χ 2 (78) = 174.97, p &lt; 0.01], but the other fit indices were within acceptable limits [CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.05]. When the well-being measures are used as independent variables (Model B), distress has a significant association with overloading only, while competence has a significant association with risk taking only. Again, this model has a statistically significant chi-square test [χ 2 (68) = 157.78, p &lt; 0.01], but the other fit indices were within acceptable limits [CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.05]. When both sets of measures are used together (Model C), demand has a direct association with overloading and risk taking, and with distress and competence. In addition to this, competence has a direct association with risk taking, while distress has a direct association with overloading. Autonomy has a direct association with competence only, and feedback has a direct association with distress only. Model C fits the data less well [χ 2 (102) = 271.69, p &lt; 0.01; CFI = 0.92; TLI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.06]. A comparison of the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) values reported in Table 4 indicates that the difference in fit between Model C and each of the other models is statistically significant [for Model A, χ 2 (8) = 3546.02; p &lt; 0.001; for Model B, χ 2 (13) = 3108.51; p &lt; 0.001]. In addition, Model A has a significantly better fit than Model B [χ 2 (5) = 437.51; p &lt; 0.001]. Therefore, Models A and B are preferable to Model C, with Model A being the best fitting model of the three.</figDesc></figure>
