<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 is an era that demands rapid change. This era is marked by the existence of cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) which are all related to artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence) and big data. In this era, the industrial world demands the availability of human resources (HR) who can adapt to the changes and challenges that exist. This is certainly a big challenge, especially for the world of education in preparing quality human resources. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 has two sides: convenience and challenges. The same sides also take place in the field of education. The educational field plays an important role in preparing a generation who is ready to compete and answer the challenges of the times <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Retnaningsih, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sardiman (2011)</ref> explained that teacher is one of the main components in the teaching and learning process. They play a role in efforts to form potential human resources in the field of development in study. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sutrisno (2016)</ref>, basically the common goal to be realized by the organization is to seek profit. Therefore, employees who have high work performance are needed. Teacher job performance is closely related to what teachers do in the classroom and how it affects student learning activities. Based on this view, what is meant by job performance is behavior related to teaching activities carried out by a teacher in the classroom.</p><p>There are several factors that determine the quality of work performance of State Elementary School teachers in North Banjarmasin District such as work performance and emotional intelligence. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Irfan (2014)</ref>, work discipline can affect the quality of work performance. Efforts to improve teacher performance can also be done by applying the existing work discipline in the organization. Teacher work performance can also be improved through the teacher's emotional intelligence <ref type="bibr">(Susiani, 2019)</ref>. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize our own feelings and the feelings of others, the ability to motivate ourselves and the ability to manage emotions well in ourselves and in relationships with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goleman, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In an effort to make the working conditions of teachers can be realized as expected, it takes a principal who has a vision for the future and is able to identify environmental changes and is able to transform these changes into the organization; pioneering change and providing motivation and inspiration to individual employees to be creative and innovative, as well as building a solid team work, bringing renewal, being brave and responsible for leading and controlling the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Usman, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Another crucial factor in influencing teacher performance is the transformational leadership of the principal. Transformational leaders inspire employees to go beyond their own self-interest for the benefit of the organization. Transformational leaders can have a tremendous influence on their followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Robbins, 2019)</ref>. This research study is conducted with the intention of establishing the effect of the principal's transformational leadership, work discipline, and emotional intelligence on the work performance of elementary school teachers in North Banjarmasin District. This study is in line with several previous studies which showed that there was an effect of principal transformational leadership on teacher work performance. The results of the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wibowo (2021)</ref> concluded that there was an influence of the principal's transformational leadership on work discipline. Rahmawati, Ahmad, and Suriansyah (2019) in their research concluded that emotional intelligence has an influence on teacher performance. Research by Hitu, Kusumaningtyas, and Ardiana (2022) concluded that emotional intelligence has a significant influence on teacher work discipline. Saputri, Qomariyah, and Herlambang (2020) in their research conclude that there is an influence of teacher work discipline on teacher work performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>Work performance is the level of success achieved by a person to determine the extent to which a person achieves the measured and assessed achievements. According to Dessler in Uno and Lamatenggo (2016), achievement is a result achieved by a person after he has carried out an activity. In the world of work, work performance is referred to as work performance. According to Uno &amp; Lamatenggo (2016), teacher work performance is a result achieved by teachers in carrying out their professional duties efficiently and effectively which includes: a) Quality of work; b) speed; c) accuracy; d) initiative; e) ability; and f) building communication related to: 1) mastery of the ins and outs of the field of work and other fields related to learning tasks; 2) mastery of excellent skills in carrying out tasks; 3) mastery of extensive experience in the field of tasks and other related fields; 4) serious and not knowing the time in carrying out the task; 5) have good physical and spiritual fitness; 6) email by carrying out tasks efficiently and effectively; 7) provide work results that exceed those required by the organization, company, unit, or institution where he works; 8) effective in carrying out the task; and 9) efficient in carrying out tasks.</p><p>Work performance can be improved through several factors including the transformational leadership of the principal, the discipline of the teacher, and the emotional intelligence of the teacher. Principal transformational leadership is the leadership process of a principal who has a far-sighted vision. Transformational leaders have the ability to bring about enormous changes to their followers and organizational development. A transformational leader understands the importance of preparing the next generation that is tough, strong and ready to face the various challenges that exist so that they can achieve the desired goals.</p><p>According to Bass and Avolio in Rahmi (2014) there are four dimensions in the level of transformational leadership known as the 4I concept. The 4I concept consists of idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation and individual consideration. Uno and Lamatenggo (2016), teacher work discipline is behavioral control that is adjusted to the norms, compliance, obedience, willingness, responsibility, and awareness of teachers in working based on regulations and policies that have been established by educational organizations/ institutions/ agencies. This relates to the professional duties of teachers in managing administration, as well as planning, implementing and evaluating learning in schools.</p><p>Uno and Lamatenggo (2016) revealed seven dimensions of teacher work discipline, namely: controlling behavior, following norms, obeying rules, obeying regulations, willingness to do work, responsibility for carrying out tasks, and awareness of tasks. The seven dimensions are related to indicators of managing administration, making lesson plans, implementing learning, and evaluating learning. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goleman (2016)</ref> emotional Intelligence is an emotional skill which includes the ability to control oneself and have endurance when facing obstacles, being able to control impulses and not feeling satisfied quickly, being able to regulate moods and being able to manage anxiety so as not to interfere with thinking skills, being able to empathize and hope. Goleman (2016) reveals five dimensions of emotional intelligence, namely: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>This study objective are to describe and analyze direct and indirect relationships between variables: transformational leadership of school principals on work performance; the principal's transformational leadership towards work discipline; emotional intelligence on teacher work performance; emotional intelligence on work discipline; work discipline on work performance; transformational leadership of school principals through work discipline on work performance; and emotional intelligence through work discipline on teacher performance.</p><p>The population of this study were all teachers with a total of 281 teachers. The research sample was 165 teachers who were selected by proportionate random sampling. Data was collected using a questionnaire consisting of work performance (quality of work, speed, accuracy, initiative, ability, and building communication), transformational leadership of the principal ( idealized The Influence of Principal Transformational Leadership, Work Discipline, and Emotional Intelligence on Teacher Work Performance at State Elementary Schools, North Banjarmasin District influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration ), work discipline ( behavioral control, following norms, obeying rules, complying with regulations, willingness to do work, responsibility for carrying out tasks, and awareness of tasks), and emotional intelligence (self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, and social skills). The instrument was analyzed and tested for validity and reliability. The research data were analyzed using path analysis to see the direct and indirect relationships between variables by first conducting the analysis requirements test, namely normality test, linearity test, multicollinearity test, and heteroscedasticity test.</p></div>
