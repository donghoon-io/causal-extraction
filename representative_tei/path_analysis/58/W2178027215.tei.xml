<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Physician e-mail communication, with patients and other providers, is one of the cornerstones of effective care coordination, but varies significantly across physicians. A physician's external environment may contribute to such variations by enabling or constraining a physician's ability to adopt innovations, such as health information technology (HIT) that can be used to support e-mail communication.</p><p>Purpose: To examine whether the relationship external environment and physician' e-mail communication with patients and other providers is mediated by practice's health information technology (HIT) availability.</p></div>

Cross-sectional multivariable subgroup path analysis was used to investigate the mediating role of HIT availability across 2,850 U.S. physicians.</p><p>Findings: Solo physicians' perceptions about malpractice were associated with 0.97 lower odds (p&lt;0.05) of e-mail communication with patients and other providers, as compared to group and hospital practices, even when mediated by HIT availability. Subgroup analyses indicated that different types of practices are responsive to different dimensions of the external environment. Specifically, solo practitioners were more responsive to the availability of resources in their environment, with per capita income associated with lower likelihood of physician e-mail communication (OR=0.99, p&lt;0.01). In contrast, physicians working in the group practices were more responsive to the complexity of their environment, with a physician's perception of practicing in environments with higher malpractice risks associated with greater IT availability, which in turn was associated with a greater likelihood of communicating via e-mail with patients (OR; 1.02, p&lt;0.05) and other physicians (OR; 1.03, p&lt; 0.001).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Physician e-mail communication, with patients and other providers, is an important component of effective care coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mettner, 2009)</ref> as it is shown to improve patient and physician outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Forrest et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schoen et al. 2006)</ref>. Approximately 20% of physicians use e-mail to communicate with patients and about 65% with their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Menachemi, Prickett, &amp; Brooks, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Houston, Sands, Nash, &amp; Ford, 2003)</ref>, but this practice varies greatly throughout the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(O'Malley &amp; Reschovsky, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pham, O'Malley, Bach, Saiontz-Martinez, &amp; Schrag, 2009)</ref>. According to resource-dependency theory, which highlights the importance of availability of external resources, this variation may be partially attributed to characteristics of a physician practices' external environment, such as practice location <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gupta, O'Connor, &amp; Quezada-Gomez, 2004)</ref> or socio-demographic characteristics of the surrounding community <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rodriguez, von Glahn, Rogers, &amp; Safran, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Policy makers have increasingly promoted the use of health information technology (HIT; e.g., the passage of Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)), in part to improve physician e-mail communication with patients and other clinicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blumenthal, 2010)</ref>. This interest has resulted in an unprecedented number of financial resources being devoted to development of HIT availability in physician practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blumenthal, 2009)</ref>. Importantly, however, these resources are not evenly distributed across markets (Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rao et al. 2011)</ref>, which may influence practice's HIT availability and in turn, the amount of e-mail communication engaged in by these practices.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the role of HIT availability as a potential mediator of the relationship between the external environment and e-mail communication, operationalized as the amount of time allocated on e-mail communication with other providers and patients. Because different types of practices may have variable levels of interest and ability to respond to changes in the external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdolrasulnia et al., 2008)</ref>, the study will also examine whether the mediational role of HIT availability between the external environment and communication varies as a function of practice type (e.g., solo practitioners vs. group practice).</p><p>The findings of the study may help policy makers and sponsors of HITs focus their efforts to promote HITs in certain markets known to have low levels of HIT availability, which in turn may support e-mail communication between patients and clinicians. Similarly, a better understanding of whether HIT availability mediates the relationship between the external environment and e-mail communication for different types of practices is important for identifying opportunities and barriers to foster better communication in these settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resource Dependence Theory</head><p>It is our contention that physician practices adopt changes in their organizational structure (i.e., HIT capabilities) in response to constraints and opportunities available in their external resource environment, and that these changes have consequences for organizational processes <ref type="bibr">(i.e., e-mail communication)</ref>. Given the assumption of rational decision-making on the part of physician practices and the influence of the practice's technical environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Meyer &amp; Scott, 1983)</ref>, resource dependence theory provides an appropriate theoretical lens for considering this relationship.</p><p>Resource dependence theory (RDT) is an open system theory that stipulates that an organization's external environment provides resources needed to successfully engage in key strategic and operational activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dess &amp; Beard, 1984)</ref>. However, because organizations operate in different environments, they often adopt different structures and strategies to align themselves with their external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Thompson, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Venkatraman &amp; Camillus, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Previous research has identified three primary dimensions of the external environment: complexity, munificence, and dynamism <ref type="bibr">(Dess &amp; Beard,1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zinn, Proenca, &amp; Rosko, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Environmental complexity reflects the number of different actors/elements that need to be taken into consideration when making strategic decisions. Environmental munificence reflects the abundance of resources in the environment. Environmental dynamism reflects the rate of change and thus uncertainty in the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>External Environment and Communication: The Mediating Role of HIT Availability</head><p>One means by which the external environment may influence physician e-mail communication is by promoting or hindering HIT availability. Research suggests that more complex and dynamic environments are associated with EMR adoption due to the uncertainty that these environments can create for organizations (e.g., unclear return on investment; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kazley &amp; Ozcan, 2007)</ref>. In contrast, more munificent environments help reduce a practice's dependence on other entities for resources (e.g., financial, technical, information) and can be used to facilitate electronic health record (EHR) adoption.</p><p>Other research has found that HIT availability is associated with improved communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Milne et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shachak, &amp; Reis, 2009)</ref>. For example, HIT availability is associated with enhanced information exchange about active medications among providers and facilitated discussion about pharmacy procedures between providers and the patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arar, Wen, McGrath, Steinbach &amp; Pugh, 2005)</ref>. Together, this research suggests that the relationship between the external environment and communication may be mediated by HIT availability.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Physician practices in more munificent environments will be associated with greater HIT availability, which in turn will be associated with more time allocated to e-mail communication.</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Physician practices in more dynamic environments will be associated with lower HIT availability, which in turn will be associated with less time allocated to e-mail communication Hypothesis 3: Physician practices in more complex environments will be associated with lower HIT availability, which in turn will be associated with less time allocated to e-mail communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderating Influence of Practice Type</head><p>In this study, we also consider the moderating role of practice type (solo practitioners, group practices, or hospital-based physicians). Different types of organizations often have variable access to internal (e.g. managerial expertise and staff) and external (e.g., affiliation with hospital) resources needed to manage the adoption process of new innovations such as HIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Castle 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zinn, Proenca, &amp; Rosko, 1998)</ref>. We expect these differences to moderate the influence of the external environment on HIT availability, and in turn, the amount of e-mail communication engaged in by a physician practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>The study uses a cross-sectional design to analyze the mediating role of HIT availability in the relationship between the external environment and physician e-mail communication. The data were obtained from the Health Tracking Physician Survey (HTPS) (2008) conducted by the Center for Studying Health System Change and the Area Resource File (2008) <ref type="bibr">(Health Tracking Physician Survey Methodology Report, 2008)</ref>. The HTPS consisted of nationally representative sample of U.S. physicians. The response rate of among eligible participants was 61.9 %.</p><p>Observations with item specific missing values were discarded from the sample (N=1,870), leaving a final analytic sample of 2,850 physicians. We compared individual level characteristics (specialty, years in practice, gender) of those included in the analysis with those excluded using chi-square and one-way analysis of variance tests and did not detect any statistically significant differences between the groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Variable</head><p>Amount of e-mail communication with patients and other providers. E-mail communication with patients and other providers was measured with 2 items that were modeled individually in the analysis. The items were: 1) Amount of time allocated for e-mail communications with patients and their families; 2) Amount of time allocated for e-mail communication with physicians and other clinicians. The responses were provided on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (more than 2 hours) plus the "not ascertained" category. "Not ascertained" responses were coded as missing and excluded from final analysis. Our initial attempts to model time allocated to email communication as an ordinal variable were unsuccessful, however, with the Score test indicating that the variable did not meet the proportional odds assumption. Therefore, the response categories were recoded into binary variables, with none and less than a half hour categories coded as "0" and the remaining categories coded as "1".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explanatory Variables</head><p>Environmental munificence was represented by community income level and reimbursement. Community income level was operationalized as the average per capita income, measured in $1,000 units (income divided by population, multiplied by $1,000). Reimbursement was based on the physician's response to the following question: "Is your practice reimbursed by any health insurance plans for these activities: 1. Email communications with family; 2.</p><p>Telephone communications with family; 3. Email communications with physicians and other clinicians; and 4. Telephone communications with physicians and other clinicians."". The response categories were: "Reimbursed", "Not Reimbursed", and"Unsure if reimbursed".</p><p>"Reimbursed" responses were coded as 1, "Not reimbursed" responses were coded as 0, and "Unsure if reimbursed" responses were coded as missing and removed from further analysis. A single reimbursement variable was then created by summing across the responses related to these four activities (range 0 to 4). Environmental dynamism was measured as the change in the unemployment and poverty rates from 2002 to 2007 (the five-year period preceding our study data. Environmental complexity was measured as the degree of competition and the level of malpractice concern perceived by physicians. Previous research indicates that medical practices located in more complex environments, characterized by the presence of a malpractice crisis in the state where the medical practice is located, were less likely to pursue a strategic initiative, such as adoption of an electronic medical record (EMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Menachemi, Shin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Menachemi, Mazurenko et al. 2012</ref>). The degree of competition was assessed with a single question that asked respondents "Thinking about your practice specifically, how would you describe the competitive situation your practice faces?" Responses options were "Not at all competitive", "Somewhat competitive", and "Very competitive", which were subsequently coded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively with higher values indicate perceptions of a more competitive environment. Finally, the level of malpractice concern was constructed as the average across four items that asked physicians to what degree they agreed with the following statements: 1. Will be involved in a malpractice case sometime in the next 10 years; 2. Pressured in my day-to-day practice by the threat of malpractice litigation; 3. Order tests or consultations simply to avoid the appearance of malpractice; and 4. Ask for consultant opinions primarily to reduce my risk of being sued. Responses to all four items were recorded on five point scales ranging from "Strongly Disagree" (1) to "Not Sure" (3) to "Agree Strongly (5); thus, higher scores indicated greater concerns about malpractice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating Variable</head><p>HIT availability. The HTPS included seventeen questions about the availability of electronic health records (EHR) and various HIT applications, such as ordering laboratory tests, exchanging clinical data with other physicians, hospitals or laboratories, and electronically transmitting prescriptions to pharmacies (See Appendix 1 for the list of HIT applications). The response categories were: "yes, application is available", or "no, application is not available". A summated scale was developed from these 17 questions to obtain a single variable (range 0 to 17) reflecting the health information technology (HIT) availability in a physician's practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderating Variable</head><p>Practice type. Practice type was included as a moderating variable and was measured through a series of dummy variables: solo/2physicians ; group with 3 physicians or more; and hospital-based practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Variables</head><p>We also included the following control variables: physician demographic characteristics (gender, race), professional characteristics (specialty, years in practice) and practice characteristics (practice type). Gender was operationalized as a binary variable, where male was coded as one and female coded as zero. Race was specified as a binary variable representing non-Hispanic white coded as one and others coded as zero. Specialty was coded as a binary variable, where primary care provider (PCP) is coded as one and the rest are coded as zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic Strategy</head><p>The unit of analysis was the physician practice. This was driven by the fact that HTPS survey asks respondents both physician level (e.g. specialty, years in practice) and practice level attributes (e.g. HIT availability) and the primary items of interest for this paper were practice level attributes. A multivariable subgroup path analysis was used to analyze the mediating role of HIT availability in the relationship between the external environment and amount of e-mail communication. A multivariable path analysis is an extension of multiple regression that enables researchers to test a theory of causal ordering among a set of variables (e.g., X causes Y and Y causes Z) by treating these relationships as a system of regression models whose parameters and standard errors are estimated simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(MacKinnon, 2008)</ref>. A multivariable path analysis has several advantages over the causal steps approach (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>. First, simulation studies have shown that the causal steps approach has low power relative to other methods for testing indirect effects <ref type="bibr">(Fritz &amp; MacKinnon, 2008)</ref>. Second, studies have shown that it is possible to detect significant indirect effects in the absence of direct effects between the constituent paths, a precondition in the causal steps approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hayes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhao, Lynch, &amp; Chen, 2010)</ref>. Finally, the causal steps approach typically entails using the Sobel test to make inferences about the statistical significance of indirect effects, which requires an assumption that the sampling distribution of the indirect effect is normal but is often not the case <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bollen &amp; Stine, 1992)</ref>. Newer methods such as bootstrapping provide tests that do not require such assumptions. Thus, multivariable path analysis provides a more parsimonious yet comprehensive approach to analyzing both direct and indirect effects of exogenous variables. Results are presented as standardized regression coefficients and odds ratios to facilitate comparisons across variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>Physician, practice and environmental characteristics are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Respondents were predominately male (71.9%), White (74.7%), and board certified in their practice specialty (91%). More than half of the responding physicians were working in a practice with more than three physicians (55.8%) and nearly half (47.3%) were primary care physicians (PCPs). The mean community income across markets was $41,129.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE</head><p>Less than 5% of physician respondents reported spending more than 30 minutes emailing patients. In comparison, 21.2% of all physician respondents reported spending more than 30 minutes e-mailing other providers. Solo/2-person practices were more likely to report no email communication with patients (79.1%) compared to group practices (73.6%) and hospitalbased practices (71.2%; χ 2 =23.5, p&lt;0.01; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Similarly, solo/2-person practices were more likely to report no e-mail communication with other providers (67.8%) compared to group practices (39.6%) and hospital-based physicians (21.0%; χ 2 =381.5, p&lt;0.001). On average, physician practices reported 7.1 HIT capabilities available (SD=4.0, range=0-14). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that solo/2-person practices had significantly fewer IT capabilities available (M=5.8, SD=4.0) compared to group (M=7.71, SD=3.9) and hospital-based (M=7.9, SD=3.7) practices (F=77.6, p&lt;0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE</head><p>Overall, the analysis suggests that environmental characteristics are indirectly associated with e-mail communication via HIT availability, although the indirect relationships are more pronounced for certain environmental dimensions and practice types. Detailed results for each dimension and practice type are presented below.</p><p>Munificence. Hypothesis 1 was not supported by our analysis. Higher levels of community income were negatively associated email communication with patients (OR= 0.99, p&lt;0.001) and providers (OR= 0.99, p&lt;0.001) when mediated by HIT availability of the practice. This was because higher levels of community income were associated with lower HIT availability (OR=0.95, p&lt;0.001). Similarly, solo physicians practicing in more munificent environments, when measured as receiving financial incentives for engaging in communication activities, were more likely to report e-mail with other physicians (OR= 1.14, p&lt;0.005), but the indirect relationships between reimbursement and e-mail communication were not statistically significant.</p><p>Dynamism. Hypothesis 2 was partially supported by our analysis. Specifically, an increase in the unemployment rates decreased e-mail communication with patients (OR=0.98, p&lt;0.5) and other providers (OR=0.99, p&lt;0.5), when mediated by HIT availability, but only for group practice physicians. Contrary to our prediction, an increase in the poverty rates increased e-mail communication with patients (OR=1.20, p&lt;0.05) and other providers (OR=1.01, p&lt;0.05), when mediated by HIT availability, but again only for group practice physicians.</p><p>Complexity. Our analysis found the strongest support for Hypothesis 3. Solo and hospitalbased physicians who expressed greater concerns about the malpractice environment reported lower HIT availability, which in turn, was associated with lower likelihood of e-mail communication with patients (solo: OR=0.97, p&lt;0.05) and other providers (solo: OR=0.97, p&lt;0.05; hospital-based: OR=0.75, p&lt;0.001). Contrary to our predictions, group-based physicians who expressed greater concerns about the malpractice environment reported more robust HIT availability, which was associated with a greater likelihood of e-mail communication with patients (OR=1.03, p&lt;0.05) and other providers (OR=1.02, p&lt;0.01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>One important finding of our study was that measures of environmental complexity were most consistently associated with physician e-mail communication, even when mediated by HIT availability. We found that solo and hospital-based physicians who expressed greater concerns about the malpractice environment reported lower HIT availability, which in turn, was associated with lower likelihood of e-mail communication with patients and other providers. This finding is congruent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bertram, Hershey, Opila, &amp; Quirin, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Menachemi et al., 2012)</ref> that suggests more complex environments can create "distractions", such as fear of potential lawsuits, and adversely impact decision-making processes and daily activities.</p><p>Although HIT, and electronic health records (EHR) in particular, can facilitate legal and regulatory compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agrawal, 2002)</ref> by confidentially storing patient records, our results indicate that solo and hospital-based physicians practicing in more complex markets either are not be aware of these benefits or have yet to take advantage of them.</p><p>Our findings with respect to other environmental dimensions were more mixed. Specifically, measures of environmental munificence exhibited significant indirect relationships with e-mail communication, but in the opposite direction of what was predicted. One potential explanation for this finding is that physicians who are located in higher income communities may care for healthier patients with lower demands to for engaging in extensive communication and care coordination. Consequently, these practices may invest fewer resources into building robust HIT systems used for e-mail communication with patients and other providers.</p><p>Finally, our findings suggest that certain practice types are more sensitive to their external environment than others. Specifically, solo practices appeared to be the most responsive to changes in their environment in ways that affected their e-mail communication with patients and other providers, even when mediated by HIT availability. This could be due to fewer resources available to this practice type. Although the HITECH Act is intended to address certain financial barriers to HIT adoption, the impact of this legislation may be attenuated because of certain market factors that play a particularly important role for practices with fewer resources.</p><p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, although resource-dependency theory is widely used in the strategic management literature, it may not be exhaustive in capturing a physician practice's environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Yeager et al., 2014)</ref>. Second, the data presented are cross-sectional, thus we are not able to comment on the causality of the relationships. Third, our study used "self-reported" measures of communication, which have notable limitations such as desirability bias. Future studies should consider using more objective measures of communication. Likewise, our measure of HIT availability was based on a sum of dichotomous items indicating the presence or absence of HIT capabilities and does not reflect the level of use or how long these capabilities have been used by a practice. Finally, we were not able to control for the patient population served by a given physician practice (e.g. demographic characteristics).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS</head><p>Our study revealed generally low levels of e-mail communication among physicians, with both patients and other physicians. Although more recent research is needed to assess whether this is still the case, it seems plausible that circumstances have not changed so dramatically that electronic communication is commonly occurring among physicians. Such low levels suggest that, despite developments in HIT and increased policy attention toward promoting the use of HIT, more efforts, including non-technological ones, may be needed to promote e-mail communication by physicians. For example, renewed interest in new models of care such as the PCMH that emphasize care coordination and shared decision making with patients may remedy this problem. Likewise, reimbursement models that compensate physicians for e-mail consultations may also encourage greater use of electronic communication.</p><p>Regardless of the specific effort, our findings also indicate that "one size fits all" approaches to foster communication may not be as effective as desired. More specifically, our findings indicate that the mediational role of HIT availability varies by environmental dimension, with physicians who practice in more complex environments associated with less robust HIT availability, which, in turn, was associated with lower likelihood of e-mail communication. Such findings suggest that resource availability may not be the sole or even primary driver of HIT adoption and use and subsequent use of this technology to engage in electronic communication. Thus, policy makers and other sponsors and advocates of HIT may want to consider how the allocation of existing resources may influence decisions regarding HIT adoption and use. In particular, our analysis suggests that the malpractice environment may play a significant role in such decisions. Similarly, we found that solo practitioners' e-mail communication patterns are most responsive to their external environment, even after the mediational role of HIT availability is taken into consideration. Thus, despite the efforts of the HITECH Act, payers and policy makers may want to reconsider how resources are allocated to this group of practitioners.
