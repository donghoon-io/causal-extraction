<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Brucella melitensis is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes brucellosis, a disease that affects sheep, cattle and occasionally humans. B. melitensis strain M5-90, a live attenuated vaccine cultured from B. melitensis strain M28, has been used as an effective tool in the control of brucellosis in goats and sheep in China. However, the molecular changes leading to attenuated virulence and pathogenicity in B. melitensis remain poorly understood. In this study we employed the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform to perform genome-wide digital gene expression (DGE) analysis of mouse peritoneal macrophage responses to B. melitensis infection. Many parallel changes in gene expression profiles were observed in M28and M5-90-infected macrophages, suggesting that they employ similar survival strategies, notably the induction of antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic factors. Moreover, 1019 differentially expressed macrophage transcripts were identified 4 h after infection with the different B. melitensis strains, and these differential transcripts notably identified genes involved in the lysosome and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Further analysis employed gene ontology (GO) analysis: high-enrichment GOs identified endocytosis, inflammatory, apoptosis, and transport pathways. Path-Net and Signal-Net analysis highlighted the MAPK pathway as the key regulatory pathway. Moreover, the key differentially expressed genes of the significant pathways were apoptosis-related. These findings demonstrate previously unrecognized changes in gene transcription that are associated with B. melitensis infection of macrophages, and the central signaling pathways identified here merit further investigation. Our data provide new insights into the molecular attenuation mechanism of strain M5-90 and will facilitate the generation of new attenuated vaccine strains with enhanced efficacy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Brucella spp are facultative intracellular, Gram-negative coccobacilli belonging to the alpha subclass of Proteobacteria. They reside in professional and non-professional phagocytes, and macrophages in particular are a major target in infected mammals. In contrast to other pathogenic bacteria, Brucella spp appear to lack classical virulence factors such as exotoxins, capsules, fimbriae, invasive proteases, virulence plasmids and lysogenic phages, and their virulence is instead associated with their capacity to invade and propagate within host cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Intracellular survival and multiplication of Brucella is thought to depend crucially on avoidance of fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Brucella melitensis, the first species described in the genus Brucella, causes abortions in goats and sheep and Malta fever in human. In humans, B. melitensis is highly pathogenic, making it one of the most serious zoonoses in the world. To date, several strategies have been employed to develop vaccines against brucellosis, but no satisfactory vaccine has been discovered to combat the disease in humans, and animal vaccines are pathogenic to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Because of its epidemic potential, the effectiveness of aerosol infection, the absence of a human vaccine, and the drawbacks of current vaccine strains in terms of safety, this agent has been classified as a biosafety level 3 pathogen and is considered to be a potential bioterrorism agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The attenuated B. melitensis vaccine smooth strain M5-90 was derived from the virulent smooth B. melitensis M28 ovine isolate by serial passage in chicken, acriflavine treatment, and further passage for 90 generations in chicken embryo fibroblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. This attenuated live vaccine is considered to be one of the key factors that caused a rapid decline in the incidence of brucellosis in animals and humans in China. The reduced virulence of the vaccine appears to be stable and the vaccine strain maintains its original biochemical and immunological characteristics. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular or physiological changes underlying loss of virulence are not understood.</p><p>Next-generation high-throughput deep-sequencing technology, such as digital gene expression tag profiling (DGE), has recently been adapted for transcriptome analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. This direct sequencing methodology allows for the identification of millions of short RNAs in a sample, and of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), without the need for prior annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Sequencing-based methods generate absolute gene expression measurements and avoid many of the inherent limitations of earlier microarray-based assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p><p>In many tissues macrophages constitute the first line of defense of the innate immune response against invading microorganisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. One study provided evidence that virulent Brucella abortus strain 2308 survives at significantly higher levels in normal mouse peritoneal macrophages and in macrophages treated with gamma interferon than does the attenuated strain 19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Although the transcriptional profiles of Brucella-infected mouse macrophages have been studied previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, no studies have compared host responses between infections with a virulent B. melitensis strain and its attenuated vaccine strain. In the present study we employed the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform to perform DGE analysis of changes in the peritoneal macrophage transcriptome in response to B. melitensis infection. Macrophage gene expression profiles after B. melitensis infection were systematically analyzed, and both common and strain-specific transcriptional responses to B. melitensis infection were evaluated. The findings reported here cast new light both on the molecular interactions between Brucella and its host and on the changes that underpin the attenuation of strain M5-90. These data provide a firm foundation for further work aimed at reducing the residual virulence of the vaccine strain and thereby enhancing vaccine efficacy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics statement and animal experimentation</head><p>Care of laboratory animals and animal experimentation were preformed in accordance with the Beijing Administration Guidelines for the Use of Laboratory Animals. All animal studies were approved by the Review Board of Harbin Veterinary Research Institute and by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Heilongjiang Province (SYXK(H)2006-032). Animal studies with Brucella infected macrophages were conducted in a biosecurity level 3+ laboratory approved by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culture of bacterial strains and mouse peritoneal macrophages</head><p>B. melitensis strain M28 and the attenuated strain M5-90 (laboratory stock) were grown on Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) plates containing 1% agar under biosecurity level 3+ conditions. After 2 days at 37uC, cells were collected by scraping and were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). Colony forming units (CFUs) were determined by plating on agar and incubating for 3 days at 37uC under 5% CO 2 .</p><p>BALB/c female mice aged 6-8 weeks were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (VRL, Beijing, China). Peritoneal macrophages were recovered by peritoneal lavage with 5 ml of cold RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and isolated by centrifugation according to the method described by Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> with some modifications. For adherent cells, cells (2610 6 ) were plated on six-well tissue culture plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2 mM L-glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic (100 U/ml penicillin G; 100 mg/ml streptomycin) for 2 h in a humidified incubator at 37uC under 5% CO 2 . Non-adherent cells were removed by washing once with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, and then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Adherent cells were cultured in RPMI</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Macrophage infection and RNA isolation</head><p>Peritoneal macrophages from 10 mice were pooled and plated at 2610 6 cells/well in six-well tissue-culture plates in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium without antibiotics. After 12-24 h, macrophages were infected with 1 ml of stationary phase Brucella spp culture [multiplicity of infection (MOI) 200:1]. Control macrophages and infected macrophages (M28 or M5-90) were incubated for a further 4 h at 37uC under 5% CO 2 , washed once with PBS, and then lysed for RNA purification (RNeasy, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). All samples were quantified and examined for protein and reagent contamination by a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. RNA samples for analysis were selected based on a 28S/18S rRNA band intensity of 2:1, a spectroscopic A260/A280 nm ratio of 1.8-2.0, and an A260/ A230 nm ratio greater than 1.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digital gene expression tag profiling (DGE)</head><p>Reagents for DGE analysis were primarily from the Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) Gene Expression Sample Preparation Kit and the Illumina Sequencing Chip (Flowcell); instrumentation was based on the Illumina Cluster Station and the Illumina HiSeq TM 2000 System. Sequence tag preparation was performed using the Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was purified and subjected to Illumina sequencing. Image analysis, base calling and quality calibration were performed using the Solexa Automated Pipeline, after which the raw data (tag sequences and counts) were deposited in the GEO (<ref type="url" target="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ref>) database under submission number GSE26337. Raw sequence reads were filtered by the Illumina pipeline. For analysis, adaptor tags, low-quality tags and tags with a copy number of one were excluded, and the clean tags generated were mapped to the reference sequences in the mouse genome (mm9 version from UCSC site) and the mouse transcriptome (all Refseq, mRNA and ESTs found in the GenBank database) with the criterion that only a single mismatch with the reference sequence was permitted. Tags that mapped to reference sequences of more than one transcript were excluded from analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)</head><p>To compare DEGs across samples (M28/Mc, M5-90/Mc, and M5-90/M28), the number of raw clean tags in each library was normalized to the number of tags per million (TPM) to obtain normalized gene expression levels. The detection of DEGs or tags across samples was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was set below 0.01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. FDR #0.001 and an absolute value of log2Ratio $1 was set as the threshold for significant gene expression differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cluster analysis of the DEG profiles</head><p>Genes with similar expression patterns often subserve overlapping functions. Accordingly, we performed cluster analysis of gene expression patterns using Cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Java Treeview <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis for DEGs</head><p>In gene expression profiling analysis, GO enrichment analysis of functional significance applies two-sided Fisher's exact test and x 2 testing to map all DEGs to terms in the GO database, searching for significantly enriched GO terms in DEGs compared to the genomic background. The FDR was calculated to correct the P value. We chose only GOs with a P value of ,0.001 and a FDR of ,0.05. Within the significant category, the enrichment factor Re was given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Re~n f n Nf N</formula><p>where nf is the number of DEGs within the particular category, n is the total number of genes within the same category, Nf is the number of DEGs in the gene reference database list, and N is the total number of genes in the gene reference database list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pathway enrichment analysis for DEGs</head><p>Genes involved in different steps of a common pathway tend to overlap in their expression profiles, and pathway-based analysis can therefore cast light on biological function. Accordingly, further analysis consulted the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the major public pathway-related database. Pathway enrichment analysis identifies significantly enriched metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in DEGs versus the genomic background according to the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P~1{ X m{1 i~0 M i N{M n{i N n</formula><p>where N is the number of genes with KEGG annotation, n is the number of DEGs in N, M is the number of genes annotated to specific pathways, and m is the number of DEGs in M. Enrichment analysis of DEG pathway significance highlights the most meaningful pathways. Path-Net was the interaction net of the significant pathways of the DEGs (P,0.05), and was built according to the interactions among pathways of the KEGG database to reveal potential interactions between significant pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Pathways that were statistically significant, but which markedly increased pathway bifurcation, thereby proving uninformative at the network level, were excluded from further analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein-protein interaction network analysis</head><p>Direct binding between different proteins can also reveal shared functionality. Protein-protein interaction network analysis integrates several important interaction network databases, including BIND(<ref type="url" target="http://www.isc.org/software/bind">http://www.isc.org/software/bind</ref>), BioGrid(<ref type="url" target="http://thebiogrid">http://thebiogrid</ref>. org/) and HPRD(<ref type="url" target="http://www.hprd.org/">http://www.hprd.org/</ref>), and constructs interaction networks for protein-coding DEGs. Signal-net, a network map of differentially expressed proteins, was constructed using the KEGG interaction database. In Signal-net each cycle represents a gene. As an example, if there is evidence that two proteins interact with each other, an interaction edge is assigned between the two proteins where arrows or smooth edges indicate activation or inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>Quantitative PCR analysis cDNA was synthesized using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, USA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was then performed using the same RNA samples employed for DGE experiments on a Lightcycler480 (Roche), with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Each cDNA was analyzed in triplicate, after which the average threshold cycle (Ct) was calculated per sample. The relative expression levels were calculated with the 2 2DDCt method; the average Ct value for all genes was used to correct for differences in cDNA input (D Ct is the difference in Ct between the control Fnip1 products and the target gene products).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Macrophage proteomic analysis</head><p>Protein samples were prepared from the cells in the same way as for the DGE experiments. After 4 h of incubation, infected macrophages were washed (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0) and lysed in cold 0.2% v/v Triton X-100. Large cellular debris and contaminating bacteria were removed by low speed centrifugation (60 g, 5 min, 4uC). Supernatants were then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 h; pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% w/v CHAPS) containing a protease inhibitor mix (GE Healthcare) and sonicated for 10 min on ice using a Sonifier 750 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT, USA) with the following parameters: 2 s of sonication with a 6 s interval, and a 35% duty cycle. After the addition of nuclear mix (GE Healthcare), cell lysates was incubated for 1 h at 15uC to solubilize proteins. After centrifugation to remove insoluble material the supernatants were collected; protein concentrations were measured using the 2D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare) and 100 mg protein aliquots were stored at 274uC.</p><p>Sample labeling and 2D gel electrophoresis were performed according to previously published methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (24 cm, pH range 4-7) (GE Healthcare) were used for isoelectric focusing (IEF). Vertical slab SDS-PAGE (12.5%) was run at 15 W/gel in a Ettan DAL twelve large vertical system (GE Healthcare). Gels were scanned using the Typhoon 9400 gel imager (GE Healthcare). Gel image analysis was performed using the DeCyder software suite (GE Healthcare) for image overlay and image analysis to identify alterations in protein spot intensities. Differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of DGE libraries</head><p>We investigated molecular changes taking place in mouse peritoneal macrophages following infection with virulent and vaccine strains of Brucella. Global gene expression profiles were analyzed using the Solexa/Illumina DGE system, a tag-based transcriptome sequencing method. cDNA libraries from uninfected macrophages (Mc) and from macrophages infected with strains M28 or M5-90 were sequenced using massively parallel sequencing on the Illumina platform. The major characteristics of these three libraries are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We obtained approximately 3.7 million total sequence tags per library, and 184,420 distinct tag sequences. We filtered out adaptor tags, low-quality tags and tags with a copy number of one, generating ,3.7 million clean sequence tags per library and 176,348 distinct clean tag sequences. Saturation analysis of the libraries revealed that the number of detected genes reduced progressively as the total number of sequence tags analyzed was increased, and the number of genes detected plateaued in each case when the number of sequence tags reached ,2 million (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>). Heterogeneity and redundancy are two significant characteristics of mRNA expression. To analyze the depth of the distribution of the ratio of distinct tag copy numbers between the two libraries, we determined that the number of distinct tags within five was approximately 99.05% of the total distinct tags (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of tag mapping</head><p>For tag mapping we preprocessed one reference tag database that included 33,642 sequences from the Mus musculus RefSeq database. To obtain the reference tags we used NlaIII to digest the samples; all CATG+17 tags in each gene were employed as reference tags for that gene. This generated a total of 303,456 reference tag sequences comprising 268,495 unambiguous tag sequences. In view of potential polymorphisms across samples, clean tags that mapped to reference sequences from multiple genes were filtered and tolerances were set to allow for a maximum of one mismatch. Using these criteria, 56.48-58.76% of the distinct clean tags mapped to the RefSeq virtual tag database, 46.75-48.85% of the distinct clean tags mapped unambiguously to the RefSeq virtual tag database, whereas 18.71-20.73% of the distinct clean tags did not map to this database (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>To determine the gene expression profiles we first mapped the unique tags from each library to the existing gene sequences. Analysis of the three libraries revealed 11,776, 11102 and 11241 tag-mapped sense transcripts for the Mc, M28 (virulent) and M5-90 (attenuated) libraries, respectively (Supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). To quantify the overlap in the response to infection a Venn diagram was created; 10,171 transcripts were present both libraries whereas 392 and 516 were present only in M28 or M5-90 macrophageinfected cells, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). Antisense genes can play an important role in gene expression; approximately 13.49, 13.48 and 12.72% of the transcripts identified for Mc, M28 and M5-90, respectively, were perfect matches for the antisense strand of known genes (Supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of DEGs</head><p>To gain insight into the global transcriptional changes taking place in Brucella-infected macrophages we applied a previously described method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref>). Common changes in DEGs were observed between M28 and M5-90-infected macrophages, suggesting that similar gene expression changes take place in response to infection with virulent and vaccine strains of Brucella. Overlapping DEGs between the M28 and M5-90 libraries are likely to provide an insight into the molecular events related to different virulent Brucella infections.</p><p>Similar expression patterns can be indicative of overlapping biological function. We therefore performed cluster analysis of gene expression patterns using Cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Java Treeview <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>   <ref type="table">S4</ref>, the majority of the DEGs at the intersections between the two libraries identified genes, such as Acp5, LIPA and Atp6v0d2, that are implicated in lysosomal pathways. Some immune-related proteins (e.g. Cxcr4 and Ap2a2) involved in endocytosis were also detected. In addition, the analysis identified amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism proteins (e.g. Cmas, Gfpt1 and Gnpda1), receptors related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions (Ccl9, Cxcr4, Vegfa and Il10ra), and other proteins, as detailed in Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>.  Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for DEGs (M28 versus M5-90 libraries)</p><p>To characterize the functional consequences of gene expression changes associated with infection with different virulent Brucella strains we performed GO enrichment analysis of DEGs based on the GO database; statistical significance was evaluated by twosided Fisher's exact test and x 2 testing. We focused on GOs with a P value of ,0.001 and a FDR of ,0.05. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, high-enrichment GOs included the inflammatory response, lipid metabolism, endocytosis, the innate immune response, apoptosis, mRNA processing, transport, and cell adhesion. Of these, the maximum-enriched GO targeted by overexpressed DEGs was the inflammatory response. Among these inflammatory responserelated genes, Ly96, Tlr1, Tlr7, and Tollip belong to Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. By contrast, the maximum-enriched GO for underexpressed DEGs was endocytosis (Ankfy1, Ap1s1, Ap3b1,Nostrin, and Usp33). Of these high-enrichment GOs, the transport GO (including proton, ion, mRNA, protein, and vesiclemediated transport) contained the most DEGs identified from the M28 versus M5-90 library comparison. Among these transportrelated genes, Abca2, Ap1s1, Ap3b1, Ap4s1, Atp6ap1, Mcoln1, Atp6v0b, and Atp6v0d2 belong to the lysosomal pathway; Stx3, Stx6,Vti1b, and Bet1l, belong to SNARE interactions in vesicular transport pathway.</p></div>

Significant pathway interactions in Path-Net were identified between the energy metabolism network (centered on the TCA cycle) and the cell apoptosis signal transduction network (centered on the MAPK signaling pathway).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Macrophage proteomics analysis</head><p>We used the 2D difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) method to compare total protein extracts from uninfected macrophages and cells infected with M28 or M5-90 respectively. Biological Variation Analysis (BVA) provides the average ratios between three samples with a threshold of 1.3 and a t test confidence level of P,0.05, generating a list of spots of interest. All selected spots were picked, digested and identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF. Using BVA software, 17 spots were found to be significantly differentially expressed, and 14 were identified as unique proteins. Of the 14 unique proteins, Actb, Ctsb, Ctsd, Ctss, Apoe, Fabp5, Krt1, and Hnrnpf were all upregulated in M28infected macrophages compared to macrophages infected with the attenuated M5-90 strain. Of the 11 proteins detected by DGE analysis, eight showed similar expression changes in both DGE and 2D-DIGE analysis (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>). Four of these were related to lysosome metabolism and all were downregulated in infected macrophages compared to controls, but with lower expression levels in macrophages infected with the M28 virulent strain. Of these proteins, cathepsins (Ctsb, Ctss and Ctsd) participate in both caspase-dependent and -independent programmed cell death induced by a variety of stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Glutathione peroxidase (Gpx1) and capping protein muscle Z-line alpha 2 (Capza2) were upregulated in infected macrophages, and with higher expression levels in macrophages infected with the attenuated strain M5-90 than in M28-infected macrophages. Gpx1 functions in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide and is one of the most important antioxidant enzymes. It has been reported that Gpx1 protects against CD95induced apoptosis in cultured breast cancer cells and inhibits 5lipoxygenase in blood cells; overexpression delays endothelial cell growth and increases resistance to toxic challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Fatty acid binding protein (Fabp5) was downregulated in infected macro- phages. FabPs play roles in fatty acid uptake, transport and metabolism; FabPs expressed by adipocytes and macrophages (FabP4 and FabP5, respectively) play key roles in regulating systemic metabolism and are important mediators of metabolic syndromes in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. FabPs are also involved in inflammation. LPS-stimulated cytokine and chemokine secretion, as well as Nos2 and Cox2 production, were inhibited in FabP4-deficient macrophages, and this could reflect reduced responsiveness of the IKK-NFkB pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validation of DGE data by qPCR</head><p>The Mus musculus folliculin interacting protein 1 (Fnip1) RT-PCR product was used as an internal control; expression levels of this gene were unchanged in all samples examined by DGE analysis. To validate the DEGs identified by Solexa sequencing we selected 14 genes for qPCR confirmation. These included nine identified by 2D-DIGE (Hnrnpf, Ctsd, Actb, Capza2, Eef1d, Apoe, Ctsb, Ctss and Fabp5), and five detected by DGE analysis but not by 2D-DIGE. Only Eef1d was discordant between DGE and qPCR analysis. The expression of six genes (slco4a1, B3gnt7, Inhba, Ctss, Ctsd and Capza2) by qPCR fitted the pattern of Tagseq analysis well (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>). Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) showed that the DGE and qPCR data were highly correlated; genes modulated by Brucella infection showed high consistency with r values of $0.78 between the two methods. qPCR analysis confirmed the direction of changes detected by DGE analysis, supporting the reliability of the DGE results (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The M28 virulent strain of B. melitensis produces chronic infection whereas the attenuated vaccine strain M5-90 is cleared relatively rapidly from goat, cattle and BALB/c mouse tissues (unpublished data). Mouse macrophages are commonly used in studies of Brucella infection. Comparison of responses of BALB/c mouse peritoneal macrophages to infection with strains M5-90 and M28 is likely to cast light not only on common responses to infection but also on differential gene expression in response to infections with Brucella strains that differ in virulence. It has was reported earlier that the most significant changes in macrophage gene expression take place early following infection, and global gene expression profiles return to normal between 24 and 48 h post-infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Indeed, most active brucellacidal activity is thought to occur within 4 h after infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Accordingly, we used a number of techniques to analyse systematically gene expression changes taking place in mouse macrophages 4 h after infection with two Brucella strains of differing virulence.</p><p>Here we report the first genome-wide host transcriptional study into different virulent B. melitensis infections using the Solexa/ Illumina DGE system, a tag-based novel high-throughput transcriptome deep-sequencing method. Previous studies have been limited to commercially available microarrays; the DGE analysis reported here provides a more sensitive and comprehensive unbiased coverage of the entire transcriptome. Because of the nature the DGE methodology we pooled peritoneal macrophages from 10 BALB/c mice to produce macrophage infection samples for deep-sequencing analysis. We achieved a sequencing depth of approximately 3.7 million tags per library (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and identified over 4000 genes that were differentially expressed following B.  Huntington's disease YES 0 7 7</p><p>Arginine and proline metabolism YES melitensis infection (Supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref>). By mapping our DGE tag data onto transcript databases and genomic sequences we were able to show that many alternative and novel transcripts are specifically disease-regulated, information that could not have been obtained by microarray analysis.   In and out (Indegree and Outdegree) represent the gene regulation numbers upstream and downstream. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0028485.t003</p><p>Our results confirm previous reports regarding cytokine and chemokine expression during B. melitensis infection in mouse macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> where similar upregulated inflammationassociated genes were observed during Brucella infection. For example, the genes encoding nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), interleukin 12a (Il12a), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (Cxcl2), coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptor (F2r) and prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), were significantly upregulated by a factor of $eight at 4 h post-infection. Other upregulated genes directly or indirectly related to inflammatory responses included Ccl (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 22), Ccr7, Cxcl (1,3) interleukins (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TLR2. The upregulated genes also included Cxcl2 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein 2-a; MIP2-a), a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family, growth-regulated protein beta (Gro-b), and Gro oncogene-2 (Gro-2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In macrophages, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; Nos2) production has been proposed as a host antimicrobial effector system, displaying activity against fungi, bacteria and parasites <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize Brucella spp and bacterial components and initiate mononuclear phagocyte responses that influence both innate and adaptive immunity. Recent studies have revealed the intracellular signaling cascades involved in the TLR-initiated immune response to Brucella infection. TLR2 and TLR4 have been implicated in host interactions with Brucella <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The cell membrane receptor TLR2 recognizes many bacterial, fungal, and viral molecules in addition to particular endogenous substances. In general, this results in the uptake of bound molecules by endosomes/phagosomes and cellular activation. Cytokines participating in this process include TNF-a and diverse interleukins (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Anti-inflammatory cytokines include interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor b (TGFb1) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1rn); these cytokines control the damaging effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lead to a dynamic balance between these opposing functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. In this study both TGFb1 and IL-1rn transcripts were upregulated during Brucella infection.</p><p>Elimination of infected cells via apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a fundamental role in the defense of multicellular organisms against bacteria, viruses and parasites <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Previous studies indicated that smooth Brucella spp inhibit apoptosis in macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Our data show that apoptosisrelated host genes are similarly up-or downregulated at an early stage of infection in the two infection libraries (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>). Some proapoptotic molecules, including cyc1 (cyto c), caspase-2 (Casp2), Txnip and Casp7, Cebpb, Eaf2, were significantly down-/upregulated after infection with Brucella, and this could result in apoptosis of infected cells. Previous work indicated that smooth virulent Brucella app downregulates Casp2 transcriptional levels at an early stage of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> and inhibition of Casp2 activity also increased the number of rough Brucella abortus surviving inside macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. We have also observed down-/upregulation of the expression of antiapoptotic genes including Aif1, Mkl1, Naip1, Naip6, Birc5, Cited2 and Adam17, Cflar, Pim2, Vegfa. Proapoptotic and antiapoptotic effects taking place concurrently following Brucella infection may reflect a balance between apoptotic and antiapoptotic mechanisms; this could represent a sophisticated strategy evolved by Brucella to modulate the host cell-death program to promote their own survival.</p><p>DEG analysis of the macrophage transcriptional response 4 h after infection with B. melitensis strains M28 or M5-90 revealed many macrophage genes whose expression levels changed significantly versus uninfected macrophages. Comparison of the two infection libraries revealed 1019 DEGs whose expression changed in parallel in response to infection; these provide insights into the macrophage antimicrobial defense mechanisms operating in response B. melitensis infection (Supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref>).</p><p>Phagocytic cells are known to initiate several different antimicrobial defense mechanisms in response to bacterial infection; these include the generation of oxygen radicals, the extreme acidification of pathogen-containing phagosomes, and fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes, thereby promoting pathogen killing by defensins or degradation by lysosomal enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. One study indicated that Brucella enters host cells and translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a replicative niche, within a few hours after infection, although the majority of bacteria are thought to be killed by phagosome-lysosome fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Enrichment analysis of the DEG pathways revealed the lysosome pathway as the most significant. Most lysosome pathway proteins were downregulated in both infection libraries. Of the downregulated lysosome pathway proteins, lysosomal proteases Ctss and Ctsd were also identified by 2D-DIGE and with comparable changes in expression levels. This indicates that lysosome digestive activity is downregulated following infection with Brucella. Comparison of the two infection libraries revealed 25 of the 138 genes with lysosome pathway annotations showed increased or decreased expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>). The vacuolar-type proton ATPases (Atp6ap1, Atp6v0b and Atp6v0d2), some lysosomal acid hydrolases (glycosidase Neu1 and lipase Lipa), other lysosomal enzymes and activators Cln1 (Ppt1, 2), and lysosome membrane proteins (Endolyn and Cln5), were upregulated. In the lysosomal pathway the V-ATPases, which were altered in expression level, are located in late endosomes and lysosomes and are essential for the acidification of intracellular organelles by coupling ATP hydrolysis to transmembrane proton transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. In mouse macrophages, vacuoles containing live Brucella suis are rapidly acidified to a pH of ,4.0-4.5 at 1 h after infection, and are maintained at this level for at least 5 h; early acidification was found to be essential for the replication of bacteria within macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Compared to uninfected macrophages, the overwhelming majority of DEGs annotated in the lysosome pathway were downregulated. However, downregulation of V-ATPases, some lysosomal acid hydrolases and lysosome membrane proteins was significantly greater in M28-infected cells than in M5-90-infected cells. This indicates that both strains M28 and M5-90 inhibit bacterial killing by host lysosomes, but virulent strain M28 does so more efficiently, in accordance with a previous report that vacuoles containing Brucella strain M28 can avoid phagosome-lysosome fusion, thereby promoting access to the replicative niche in the ER <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Interaction analysis (Path-Net) of the significant pathways in M28 versus M5-90 (P,0.05), comparisons revealed interactions between the significant pathways (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Path-Net identified the energy metabolism network (centered on the TCA cycle) and the cell apoptosis signal transduction network (centered on the MAPK signaling pathway). A further small net included three pathways related to glycan metabolism. Smooth Brucella inhibited host cell apoptosis by the action of O-linked polysaccharides through a TNF-a independent mechanism that is absent from rough Brucella <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The O-linked chains can mask other surface antigens such as outer membrane proteins (OMPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and are necessary for the full virulence of smooth strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. In recent work the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells was shown to be induced by Brucella lipoproteins rather than lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>. One study indicated that genes involved in lipid metabolism that were either up-or downregulated 4 h postinfection, and this could reflect macrophage responses to bacterial lipid components <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In the energy metabolism localized network, fatty acid metabolism and fatty acid elongation in mitochondria were both significant pathways in M28 versus M5-90. The glycan metabolism-associated significant pathways were glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis and other glycan degradation pathways. In our previous 2D-DIGE study, analysis of attenuated strain M5-90 cultured on TSB plates showed downregulated expression of OMPs Omp25 and Omp31 (unpublished data). The Brucella spp Omp25/Omp31 family comprises seven homologous OMPs, with Omp25 and Omp31 being the major OMPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Regarding virulence, mutant B. melitensis, Brucella abortus and Brucella ovis strains harboring an inactivated omp25 gene were found to be attenuated in mice, goats (B. melitensis) and cattle (B. abortus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. Members of the Omp25/Omp31 family of surface proteins were previously shown to participate in the virulence of some Brucella species, and the different distribution of the seven proteins of this family among species could be related to differences in pathogenicity and host preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>In mammals, three major MAPK pathways have been identified: MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. MAPK pathways constitute a large kinase network that regulate a variety of physiological processes including cell growth, proliferation, and survival/apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. It is notable that ERK pathway activity is suppressed by JNK/p38 kinases during the induction of apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. A previous study demonstrated that infection with virulent smooth Brucella inhibits the activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways, thus preventing the synthesis of immune mediators that regulate host defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, 4 h following infection with either virulent B. melitensis M28 or the attenuated strain M5-90, most MAPK signaling pathway genes displayed similar changes in expression. With the exception of ERK (Mapk3), MSK1/2 (Rps6ka4) and TAO1/2 (Taok3), most such genes showed reduced expression in M28-infected cells versus M5-90-infected cells. To identify potential key control genes, proteins of the MAPK (ERK, JNK and p38), Jak-STAT and TLR signaling pathways, in addition to the renal cell carcinoma and related pathways, were built into the protein-protein interaction networks (Signal-Net). Apoptosisrelated genes Mapk3, PTPN6, Kras, TRAF6, IKBKE, Chuk, and RelB, were identified as the key genes in Signal-Net (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Of these key genes, proapoptotic genes in were upregulated more greatly in macrophages infected by strain M5-90 than by M28, whereas expression of the antiapoptotic genes was reduced following M5-90 infection versus M28 infection.</p><p>PTPN6 (SHP-1) is an important protein of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway and is located upstream of the MAPK signaling pathway. Extensive studies on PTPN6 revealed that the expression of PTPN6 was diminished or abolished in most cancer cell lines and tissues examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Dysfunction in PTPN6 regulation can cause abnormal cell proliferation and induce different kinds of cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. These data suggest that PTPN6 protein plays a switching role in signal transduction pathway regulation; this is supported by the suggestion that SHP-1 can function as a tumor suppressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. In the Signal-net center, ERK1/2 (Mapk3) was inhibited by many upregulated proteins. Msk-1 (Rps6ka4) is an important ERK-activated mediator of mitogen-induced c-fos activation, and c-fos is a cellular proto-oncogene belonging to the immediate early gene family of transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. The renal cell carcinoma pathway protein Kras is a GTPase and an early player in many signal transduction pathways. In colorectal cancer (CRC), increased Kras 4B expression is accompanied by increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis and activation of MAPK pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies reported that Chuk (IKK-a) is a multifunctional protein which plays a crucial role in the suppression of skin cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>. Chuk indirectly modulates the transcription factor RelB. One study demonstrated that RelB protein contributes to the quality of cell signaling in thymocytes by providing antiapoptotic signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. A recent study revealed that RelB plays an important role in prostate cancer growth in vivo, suggesting that the NF-kB alternative pathway contributes to the progression of prostate cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Another study indicated that NF-kB pathway activation is crucial for macrophage cell death induced by rough Brucella infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which mediates activation of downstream signaling via NF-kB transcription factors and MAPK cascade-activated AP-1 transcription factors, binds to the type I TGF-b receptor and, upon TGF-b stimulation, causes activation of TGF-b-associated kinase 1 (TAK1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. Activated TAK1 in turn activates MKK3/6, which activates the p38pathway, leading to apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. TRAF6 of the p38 pathway mediates activation of the Toll-like pathway through interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). The Toll-like pathway protein IKBKE (IKKe), which is reportedly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumors, similarly suppresses IKKe expression in breast cancer cell lines that harbor IKKe amplifications, inducing cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has evaluated the macrophage transcriptome during infection with B. melitensis strains M28 and M5-90. By employing a deep-sequencing approach for DEG analysis many more DEGs were detected than using traditional methods, providing new insights into genes involved in hostpathogen interactions. Common changes in gene expression were observed among M28 and M5-90-infected macrophages, suggest-ing that similar strategies are employed for their survival via the induction of anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic responses. Numerous genes were found to be differentially expressed between macrophages infected with the virulent and attenuated B. melitensis strains, in particular genes participating in the lysosomal and MAPK pathways. High-enrichment GOs included endocytosis, inflammatory, apoptosis, and transport. Path-Net and Signal-Net analysis identified the MAPK pathway as the key regulatory pathway, and the key DEGs of the significant pathways were apoptosis-related genes. These findings indicate that the attenuated strain M5-90 has a reduced ability to avoid phagosomelysosome fusion and activate MAPK pathways, reflecting the differing intracellular survival abilities of the two strains. Future studies will aid our understanding of the Brucella attenuation mechanism by evaluating altered expression of host genes after genetically modified virulent Brucella spp infection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>to identify DEGs from the normalized DGE data by pairwise comparisons between samples (Mc versus M28, Mc versus M5-90, M28 versus M5-90).

Of the 2105 DGEs exhibiting the parallel changes in both comparisons, the expression levels of 1676 were increased whereas 429 were downregulated. The majority of these overlapping response genes had inflammatory-or apoptosisrelated functions, suggesting that macrophages respond similarly to infection with B. melitensis strains M28 and M5-90.</figDesc></figure>
