<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: A vicious cycle exists between dental anxiety, oral health behaviors and oral health status.</p><p>Based on previous research, psychological factors of the Health Belief Model (HBM) are associated with oral health behaviors and oral health, and are likely involved in this cycle. However, little is known about the relationship between HBM factors and dental anxiety of adolescents. The purpose of this crosssectional study was to investigate the relationship between health belief factors, oral health and dental anxiety based on the constructs of the HBM.</p><p>Methods: 1207 Grade 2 students from 12 secondary schools in Hong Kong were randomly selected and measured for the decayed, missing and lled permanent teeth (DMFT) index. Data for oral health behaviors, HBM constructs and dental anxiety were collected using questionnaires. The hierarchical entry of explanatory variables into logistic regression models estimating prevalence odds ratios (POR) were analyzed and 95% con dence intervals (95% CI) for DMFT and dental anxiety were generated. Path analysis was used to evaluate the appropriateness of the HBM as predictors for oral health behaviors, DMFT and dental anxiety.</p><p>Results: Based on the full model analysis, individuals with higher perceived susceptibility of oral diseases (POR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.14-1.56) or girls or whose mother received higher education level were likelier to have a DMFT≥1, while those with higher perceived severity (POR: 1.31, 95%CI: 1.09-1.57), ossing weekly, DMFT≥1 or higher general anxiety level statistically increases the possibility of dental anxiety. The results from path analysis indicated that stronger perceived susceptibility, greater severity of oral diseases, less performing of oral health behaviors and a higher score of DMFT were directly related to increased dental anxiety level. Other HBM variables, such as perceived susceptibility, self-e cacy beliefs, cues to action and perceived barriers, might in uence dental anxiety through oral health behaviors and caries status.</p><p>Conclusions: Clarifying the propositional structures of the HBM can help the future design of cognitivebehavioral therapy in reducing dental anxiety and preventing dental caries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>A vicious cycle of dental anxiety, oral health behavior and oral health status has been hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Multifaceted socio-economical and psychosocial aspects are involved in the onset of dental anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A 3-year cohort study demonstrated the crucial role of Decayed Missing Filled Teeth (DMFT) scores in the development of dental anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Psychological factors such as personality traits or attachment patterns are also important in the development and persistence of dental anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Children with low psychological functioning tend to have higher levels of dental anxiety and increased social problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, self-rated oral health status can trigger dental anxiety which is mediated by certain cognitive vulnerabilities, such as threat or disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Signs of depression and anxiety in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, as well as higher psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, are highly correlated to dental anxiety.</p><p>Dental anxiety among youth is a common problem in dental practice. The prevalence of dental anxiety among adolescents ranges from 9.4% to 19% <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. Adolescence is a transitional phase from childhood to adulthood, with biological and psychological developmental changes occurring, such as socialnetworking <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In a retrospective study, 22% of respondents reported that their dental anxiety emerged in adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In establishing their health-related behavior and attitudes, dental avoidance in adolescents has the potential to in uence their oral health in the short-term and long-term <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a theory which posits that one engages in particular health behaviors based on his belief towards susceptibility to illness and severity, and the perception that there are more bene ts over barriers to taking action against illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Previous research has found that the HBM can predict tooth brushing, ossing and dental visit behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. In addition, studies have demonstrated that stronger self-e cacy beliefs and greater perceived severity of oral diseases were related to increased tooth brushing frequency, which in turn was associated with better oral health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The HBM has also been applied in mental health and anxiety relief contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Nevertheless, we are unaware of studies investigating the importance of HBM variables in oral health and dental anxiety contexts.</p><p>The objectives of the study were (a) to identify psychological factors contributing to oral health and dental anxiety based on the HBM and (b) to explore the direct and indirect associations of the HBM factors on oral health and dental anxiety via oral health behaviors among Hong Kong adolescents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst study employing a theoretical model to explore HBM constructs involved in dental anxiety via oral health behaviors and oral health status. A well-known conceptual model of in uences on health-related behaviors has been described by Janz and Becker et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Based on the previous model, we hypothesized that oral health beliefs (as conceptualized by HBM) involving higher susceptibility, greater severity, more barriers, fewer perceived bene ts and weaker self-e cacy, would be associated with increased dental anxiety scores directly or indirectly through oral health behaviors and oral health status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Sampling</head><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (HKU/HA HKW IRB) (IRB HKU: UW18-029). We hypothesized the prevalence of dental anxiety in the adolescent population as 19.5% based on previous studies <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. The percentage frequency of the estimated dental anxiety was set at 19.5% with con dence limits of ± 2.5% and a signi cant level set at 5%. The sample size was calculated for 965 subjects. Accounting for an 85% response rate, 1136 subjects were required for recruitment. A list of government-funded secondary schools was retrieved from the o cial website of the Education Bureau, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (<ref type="url" target="http://www.edb.gov.hk">http://www.edb.gov.hk</ref>). All secondary schools were coded respectively in the list of their district area (there were four districts of the Hong Kong SAR, i.e. New Territories West, New Territories East, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island). Three schools were randomly selected from each of the four districts using the bowl method, given that there were approximately 100 Grade 2 students in each secondary school. The inclusion criterion included every Grade 2 student from the 12 invited schools.</p><p>Students with severe systemic diseases, physical, or psychological disabilities were excluded. All eligible adolescents in the participating schools were approached. Written informed consents from parents were obtained prior to their child's participation. The data were collected through self-reported questionnaires and clinical oral examinations from September 2018 to November 2018.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The questionnaire was lled by participants under the supervision of the teacher-in-charge in order to prevent student interaction and maintain data integrity. Age and the gender of participants were requested. The following oral health-related behaviors were measured: frequency of tooth brushing (1.</p><p>Less than twice a day; 2. Twice or more a day), ossing frequency (1. Never or less than once a week; 2. Once or more a week), sugar consumption (1. Several times a week or daily; 2. Rare) and dental visits (1. No regular dental visit; 2. Have an annual dental visit). Each bene cial behavior scored 1 while discouraged behavior scored 0. The oral health behavior (OHB) score was calculated by summing up the scores of the four bene cial behaviors (ranged from 0-4), with a higher score indicating a higher level of oral health behavior.</p><p>The constructs of the HBM were measured using the OHBQAHBM, which consists of 35 items related to 6 interrelated components of the HBM; Perceived Susceptibility (2 items), Perceived Bene ts (7 items), Perceived Barriers (6 items), Cues to Action (3 items), Perceived Severity (7 items) and Self-e cacy (10 items) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Each item was scored on a scale from 1-5 points and the average score for each subscale was calculated thereby representing the individual's belief towards that speci c component. For each subscale, a higher average score indicates a stronger feeling towards its corresponding component.</p><p>Dental anxiety was assessed using the Modi ed Child Dental Anxiety Scale consisting of 8 questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Responses were scored from 1-5 points, giving a total score of 8-40. A higher score indicates a higher dental anxiety level. A score under 20 indicates no dental anxiety while a score equaling 20 or higher is indicative of dental anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. General anxiety levels were measured using the Chinese version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A 7-item self-rating questionnaire, each item is scored 0-4 points, giving a total range from 0 to 28. A higher score indicates a higher general anxiety level.</p><p>Two trained and calibrated dentists conducted dental examinations in schools using dental mirrors with added lights and Community Periodontal Index probes. Dental caries diagnosis was determined according to the criteria of WHO <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. DMFT (number of decayed, missing, and lled teeth due to caries) score was calculated. To avoid measurement bias, the clinical examinations were performed unannounced in advance. 10% of children from each school were randomly selected and re-examined on the same day. Acceptable intra-and inter-examiner reliability was achieved (kappa = 0.90-0.94).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The percentage of missing values of the questionnaire was 0.3-7.0%. For eligible participants, an MCAR (missing completely at random) analysis in SPSS was undertaken to test whether data were missing at random. The p-value for the MCAR analysis were all &gt; 0.05, signifying that our data were missing completely at random. The expectation maximization algorithm was used to replace the missing values with predicted values.</p><p>Correlation tests con rmed weak associations among the HBM factors, oral health and dental anxiety (Spearman's Rho correlation range 0.1-0.4). Variables were not excluded due to collinearity. Using bivariate analyses, prevalence, corresponding con dence intervals, and p-values were generated using the 'cross-tabulations' approach in SPSS. Blocks of explanatory variables were entered into a binary logistic regression model using a hierarchical methodology, as predicated by our conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The dependent variable of these models were DMFT ≥ 1 or DMFT = 0 and the existence of dental anxiety.</p><p>The HBM construct factors were entered into Model 1, with the main effects presented as prevalence odds ratio and 95% con dence interval (95% CI). The modifying factors were entered into Model 2 and oral health behaviors entered into Model 3. For DMFT, the full model (Model 4) comprised all factors. For dental anxiety, DMFT was entered into Model 4 and general anxiety entered into Model 5. The full model (Model 6) for dental anxiety comprised all factors. It is important to note that the full model was built based on a priori selection of covariates according to the conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) as opposed to covariate selection based upon bivariate statistics. The degree of attenuation was calculated by the 1-[ln (adjusted OR)/ln (unadjusted OR)] formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. A normality distribution test for general anxiety score, DMFT and HBM variables was used. Since the data were not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the median between groups with dental with and without anxiety. The chosen level of signi cance was p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed). The above mentioned statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 25.0.</p><p>To explore the relationship between HBM variables, general anxiety, OHB and DMFT, a path analysis was performed using AMOS 22.0. In this model, oral hygiene beliefs were posited to be related to dental anxiety both directly and indirectly through oral health behaviors and oral health status. If the p-value of the chi-square statistics (χ 2 ) exceeded 0.05, the hypothesized path analysis was retained. The model t was evaluated using multiple t indices, such as the comparative t index (CFI), goodness-of-t index (GFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR). Cut-offs to consider the model a good t to the data were CFI &gt; 0.90, TLI &gt; 0.90, RMSEA &lt; 0.06 and SRMR&lt; 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Characteristics</head><p>Of the 1207 eligible participants, 1159 participated in clinical examinations and returned questionnaires (response rate = 96%). The mean age of the participants was 14.32 ± 0.68 and the proportion of girls were 46.6%. The prevalence of dental anxiety among Hong Kong adolescents was 40.5%. Nearly half of adolescents (45.0%) had a DMFT ≥ 1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). 67.9% adolescents brushed their teeth at least twice a day, but only 20.3% ossed weekly. Most adolescents (81.7%) consumed sugar every week and less than a quarter (23.3%) had annual dental visitation plans. A high proportion of adolescents with DMFT ≥ 1 were girls with highly educated parents who had stronger perceived susceptibility of oral diseases and more perceived barriers towards performing OHB (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Dental anxiety among participants was associated with being a girl, lower ossing rates, higher sugar consumption rates, DMFT ≥ 1, stronger perceived susceptibility, stronger perceived severity, lower self-e cacy and higher general anxiety levels (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). For an unadjusted model of HBM variables, every increase of one unit in perceived susceptibility resulted in 1.44 times the odds for DMFT ≥ 1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 1). The addition of modifying factors to HBM variables attenuated the effect of perceived susceptibility on DMFT by 16% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 2), while the addition of oral health behavior variables to HBM variables attenuated the odds by 10% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 3). A strong perceived susceptibility persisted as a risk indicator for DMFT ≥ 1 in the nal model, which included all covariates. In the full model, the odds of perceived susceptibility was attenuated by 22% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 4). In addition, girls and low education level of mothers were also signi cantly associated with DMFT ≥ 1 in the full model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 4). In the unadjusted model, the increase in perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers and decrease in self-e cacy signi cantly resulted in a higher chance of dental anxiety (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Model 1). In the full model, only perceived severity remained signi cantly associated with dental anxiety. The odds of perceived severity and dental anxiety was 1.31, which was attenuated by 14% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Model 6). The addition of modifying factors increased the effect of perceived severity by 4%, while general anxiety attenuated it by 19% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Model 2&amp;5). In addition, ossing behavior, DMFT and general anxiety were also associated with dental anxiety in the full model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Model 6). After deleting several insigni cant paths, the nal model is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and as shown, the model was well tted (TLI = 0.99; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.01; SRMR = 0.01; χ2 = 13.60; df = 11; p = 0.26).</p><p>Regarding the direct effect, a signi cant path was noted from general anxiety to dental anxiety (β = 0.44, p&lt;0.01). Consistent with this hypothesis, higher perceived susceptibility (β = 0.56, p = 0.03) and greater perceived severity (β = 0.72, p&lt;0.01) were associated with greater dental anxiety. Signi cant direct paths were also found to OHB from perceived susceptibility (β = -0.07, p&lt;0.05), self-e cacy (β = 0.20, p&lt;0.01), perceived barriers (β = -0.25, p&lt;0.01) and cues to action (β = 0.08, p = 0.02). Regarding the direct effects of OHB and DMFT on dental anxiety, both were signi cant (β = -0.74, p&lt;0.01; β = 0.28, p = 0.02).</p><p>For indirect effects exerted through OHB and DMFT, perceived susceptibility, self-e cacy beliefs, cues to action and perceived barriers were equal to 0.05 (SE = 0.03, p = 0.03), -0.16 (SE = 0.05, p&lt;0.01), -0.06 (SE = 0.03, p&lt;0.01) and 0.19 (SE = 0.07, p&lt;0.01). The majority of standard errors of the unstandardized parameter estimates were small, indicating that values of the model parameters were estimated accurately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study suggests that HBM factors are risk indicators for caries and dental anxiety among Hong Kong adolescents. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and behavior covariates, the association of perceived susceptibility with DMFT score and perceived severity in relation to dental anxiety was maintained.</p><p>We believe that this is the rst study to examine the complex predictors regarding oral health and dental anxiety after accounting for the impact of HBM variables in a path analysis model of data. Our ndings indicate that oral health beliefs (including HBM constructs) are associated with dental anxiety directly or indirectly via OHB and oral health.</p><p>In recent decades, pressure has been placed on therapeutics to reduce patients' anxiety in the long term without pharmacological use <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>. Psychological treatments have displayed better improvement in dental anxiety prevention in the long term compared to the use of pharmaceuticals <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. In our study, we identi ed the role of HBM psychological constructs on the severity of dental anxiety. Threat-related perceptions based on past experiences may bring negative expectations of dental treatment and trigger dental phobia <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. From the perspective of the HBM, threat perceptions are based on two beliefs: perceived susceptibility and perceived severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Perceived susceptibility refers to the chance of obtaining a disease or a painful state; perceived severity refers to one's belief towards the effect and psychological harm the disease could create <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. In previous research on preoperative anxiety, perceived severity was a risk factor for increased anxiety levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. In this study, perceived severity and perceived susceptibility were positively correlated with dental anxiety directly.</p><p>Other variables from the HBM are able to predict dental anxiety via the oral health behavior path. The HBM theory also proposes that if an individual has su cient self-e cacy, perceived bene ts over barriers, and cues to action, he is more likely to perform a behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Dental anxiety is a risk factor for caries in younger children <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> and individuals with poorer oral health practices are correlated with higher dental anxiety levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. Our study results were consistent with previous studies and the HBM variables indicate that they are related to dental anxiety via OHB and caries status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>One of the major limitations of our study is the cross-sectional study design of the work. Given the nature of the design, a causal relationship between psychological factors and dental anxiety cannot be determined. Thus, future work is necessary to test this relationship using a longitudinal study design. Another limitation of our study is the use of self-reported measures. It is possible that response bias may limit the effects of our results. The third limitation of our ndings is that it may not be generalizable to older adolescents as differences in psychological and physical status exist between early adolescents and late adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Regardless, the importance of the HBM in oral health and disease should be investigated further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The present study suggests directions and further steps to be taken to reduce dental anxiety and improve oral health status in adolescents. The need for cognitive-behavioral interventions is further evidenced by the fact that 2/3 of adolescents brushed their teeth as recommended (at least twice a day) but only 20.0% of adolescents ossed weekly. Most adolescents had a high frequency of sugar intakes and did not have plans for annual dental visitation. Moreover, our study found a relatively high prevalence of dental anxiety (40.5%) and DMFT ≥ 1 (45.0%). A high prevalence of dental anxiety has been shown to result in increased dental avoidance and poorer oral health outcomes.
