<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Affective dysregulation is present in those with subsyndromal symptoms of hypomania and mania and prospectively predicts the development of bipolar spectrum disorders. A crucial, understudied area related to the experience and regulation of emotion in this population is emotional awareness -emotional clarity (Clarity) and attention to emotion (Attention). We examined whether scores on the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS) were associated with deficits in emotional awareness and whether these deficits were associated with heightened intensity and instability of negative (NA) and positive affect (PA). Young adults (n=233), oversampled for high HPS scores completed selfreports and 14 days of experience sampling assessing high and low arousal NA and PA. HPS scores were associated with low Clarity and unassociated with Attention. High HPS scores were associated with greater high and low arousal NA intensity and instability only for those at low and mean levels of Attention. In contrast, there was a significant indirect association between HPS scores and intensity of high and low arousal NA and PA, as well as instability of high arousal NA, through low Clarity. Results highlighted that individual differences exist in the extent to which facets of emotional awareness differentially link scores on the HPS to emotional outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Bipolar spectrum psychopathology refers to a range of trait-like and episodic disruptions in the experience of emotion, cognition, and behavior that encompasses both clinical and subclinical manifestations of mania and hypomania <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kwapil et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sperry and Kwapil, 2017)</ref>. Assessment of this wider phenotype is important for understanding heterogeneity in symptom presentation, impairment across varying levels of symptoms, and for prospectively identifying those who may be at greater risk for the development of bipolar disorders. The Hypomanic Personality Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Eckblad &amp; Chapman, 1986</ref>) is a self-report questionnaire developed to provide dimensional ratings of bipolar spectrum psychopathology with up to 77% of high scorers (&gt;1.5 SD) reporting a lifetime history of a hypomanic episode <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Eckblad &amp; Chapman, 1986)</ref>. Higher scores on the HPS are associated with subclinical and clinical symptoms of mania/hypomania in daily life (e.g., inflated self-esteem, energetic-enthusiasm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kwapil et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sperry and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kwapil, 2017, Walsh et al., 2012)</ref> and prospectively predict the development of new cases of bipolar disorders both three and ten years later <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kwapil et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Walsh et al., 2015)</ref>. A growing body of work highlights that scores on the HPS, even in non-clinical samples, are also associated with greater affective instability and heightened mean levels of negative and positive affect in daily life <ref type="bibr">(Sperry and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kwapil, 2019, Sperry and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kwapil, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sperry, Walsh, &amp; Kwapil, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Emotion dysregulation is a core feature of bipolar spectrum psychopathology with greater affective instability associated with worse outcomes (e.g., greater severity of episodes, increased number of hospitalizations, co-occurring substance use; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angst et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Henry et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Henry et al., , 2008;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Prisciandaro et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition, greater instability of mood in a non-clinical sample oversampled for high HPS scores predicted the development of new onset bipolar spectrum disorders over a three-year follow-up period <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sperry, Walsh, &amp; Kwapil, 2020)</ref>. Thus, a greater understanding of the experience and regulation of emotion in those displaying various levels of bipolar spectrum psychopathology is warranted and may help identify targets for preventative interventions for those at risk for the development of bipolar spectrum disorders or therapeutic interventions for those who have already developed the disorder.</p><p>Trait emotional awareness, one's cognitions about their emotions and their ability to identify and label emotions <ref type="bibr">(Boden &amp; Thompson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gohm &amp; Clore, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Thompson et al., 2009)</ref>, is an important aspect of the experience and regulation of emotion that has not yet been studied in the context of bipolar spectrum psychopathology. The Affect-as-Information hypothesis posits that people's judgements and understanding of their emotions influences their experience of emotion, decision-making, and the value they place on their affective response <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gohm &amp; Clore, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983)</ref>. Accordingly, individuals who do not value, attend to, or understand their emotions may not benefit from the information that affect can provide. In terms of trait emotional awareness, people vary in their emotional clarity (Clarity), the extent to which they understand, perceive, and describe their emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gohm &amp; Clore, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Thompson et al., 2009)</ref>, and attention to emotion (Attention), the extent to which they attend to, monitor, and value their emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gohm &amp; Clore, 2000)</ref>. Clarity and Attention are distinct, modestly correlated phenomenon (see <ref type="bibr">Boden &amp; Thompson, 2017</ref> for meta-analysis) and have been widely studied in the context of psychopathology and emotion dysregulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vine &amp; Aldao, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Emotional Clarity</head><p>Both theoretical and empirical work suggests that low levels of Clarity may result in disruptions in the experience of emotion. Specifically, low Clarity has been linked to greater momentary affect intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boden et al., 2013)</ref> and instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Thompson et al., 2009)</ref>. Successful identification and labeling of affective responses should enable an individual to better understand and manage their emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barrett et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kashdan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lieberman, Inagaki, Tabibnia, &amp; Crockett, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vine &amp; Aldao, 2014)</ref>. As such, those characterized by low Clarity require the use of more cognitive resources to understand their current affective state and as a result have less successful emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellis &amp; Ashbrook, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gohm &amp; Clore, 2000)</ref>. Specifically, when an individual lacks Clarity, they may be more likely to engage in avoidant coping skills which in turn is associated with greater intensity of negative affect (NA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Neumann et al., 2017)</ref>. Likewise, <ref type="bibr">Thompson and colleagues (2009)</ref> suggest that low Clarity is associated with greater variability of affect which may inhibit adaptive antecedent-focused emotion regulation.</p><p>Low Clarity has also been widely linked to various forms of psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Vine &amp; Aldao, 2014)</ref> and affective disorders including depressive episodes and diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ehring et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Loas et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Thompson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Thompson et al., 2015)</ref> and bipolar I disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Van Rheenen et al., 2015)</ref>. Although no studies to our knowledge have examined the association of Clarity and broader bipolar spectrum phenotypes (e.g., using HPS scores), there has been work linking disruptions in Clarity to disruptions in aspects of the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) (e.g., dysregulated reward sensitivity and goal pursuit), which are known to underlie bipolar spectrum disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Edge et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Johnson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Johnson et al., 2000)</ref>. For example, adolescents with BAS risk for bipolar disorders were characterized by low Clarity and increased depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Stange et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Merchán-Clavellino et al. (2019)</ref> examined the links between BAS, Clarity, and PA and found that Clarity mediated the association of sensitivity to reward and PA. Thus, we hypothesized that bipolar spectrum psychopathology, as indexed by higher scores on the HPS, would be associated with low levels of Clarity (H1) and that there may be a significant indirect relationship between HPS scores and affect intensity and instability through low levels of Clarity (H2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Attention to Emotion</head><p>Theoretical work attempting to elucidate the links between Attention and the experience of emotion suggest that their links may depend on the levels of Attention one experiences. The Affectas-Information hypothesis suggests that the association between affect and judgment should be stronger for those with greater Attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983</ref>) such that individuals low in Attention may not value their affective response and are less likely to learn from it <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gohm &amp; Clore, 2002)</ref>. This could potentially indicate that low levels of Attention would be associated with greater affective instability. Furthermore, the hedonic contingency hypothesis posits that individuals' level of Attention may influence their motivation to remain in the same mood state <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wegener &amp; Petty, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wegener et al., 1995)</ref>. Specifically, they report that the more one attends to PA, the more likely they are to ignore mood-incongruent cognitive messaging in an effort to sustain high levels of PA. Theoretically, this model suggests individuals with high Attention may display less affective instability given that they are more likely to remain in the same mood state. Interestingly, at the momentary level, higher Attention has been linked with greater NA concurrently leading initial thoughts that high Attention may be associated with poor emotion regulation; however, higher Attention prospectively predicted greater decreases in NA at future assessment points <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Thompson et al., 2011)</ref>. These results highlight the possibility that those high in Attention may more successfully down-regulate emotion over time and that the function of Attention at trait vs. state levels and across different timescales may be varied.</p><p>Some studies find positive associations between Attention with psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Salovey et al 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huang et al., 2013)</ref>, some find negative associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Salovey et al., 1995)</ref>, and some find no associations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Salovey et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boden and Thompson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Van Rheenen et al., 2015)</ref>. We hypothesized that bipolar spectrum psychopathology, as measured by the HPS, would be associated with high levels of Attention (H3). Specifically, we hypothesized that HPS scores would be associated with higher Attention as patients with bipolar disorder have an attentional bias towards both negative and positive stimuli independent of mood-episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alloy et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">García-Blanco et al., 2014)</ref>. Given that prior work suggests distinctions between high vs. low levels of attention with the experience of emotion, we hypothesized that levels Attention may moderate the association between HPS scores and greater affect intensity and instability (H4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Goals &amp; hypotheses</head><p>It is clear that trait emotional awareness plays an important role in psychopathology, and further, that trait emotional awareness influences the experience of emotion. Specifically, trait emotional awareness has been linked to both trait and state affect intensity and instability. Despite this, theoretical models of emotion dysregulation across the bipolar spectrum have failed to consider the role of trait emotional awareness in affective dysregulation. Thus, the overall goal of this study was to examine the role that trait emotional awareness plays in the association between bipolar spectrum psychopathology, as measured by the HPS, and affective intensity and instability. Importantly, we employed novel methods (experience sampling methodology; ESM) and statistical methods (time-series analysis) to assess affect intensity and instability in daily life.</p><p>We had several a priori hypotheses that were pre-registered at Open Science Framework (osf.io/xjnfd). In our initial pre-registration, we hypothesized that higher HPS scores would be associated with low Clarity and high Attention and that Attention and Clarity would moderate the association of HPS scores with affect intensity and instability1. Between pre-registration and the completion of this project, an updated review of both theoretical and empirical literature led us to revise our hypotheses. Specifically, we hypothesized that Attention and Clarity would have differential relationships with the path between HPS scores and affect intensity and instability. Based on work of Merchán-Clavellino et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>), we hypothesized that high HPS scores may be associated with heightened affect intensity and instability through low Clarity whereas this relationship would depend on different levels of Attention. As such, we ran a series of exploratory path models that tested the direct pathways between HPS scores with Clarity (H1: pre-registered) and Attention (H3: pre-registered), whether Attention moderated the path between HPS scores and affective intensity and instability (H4: pre-registered), and whether there was a significant indirect pathway between HPS scores, Clarity, and affective intensity and instability (H2: exploratory). Given that <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gohm and Clore (2000)</ref> originally proposed the idea that valence denotes value and arousal denotes importance, we tested each hypothesis in both high and low arousal NA and PA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Open science statement</head><p>Following open science guidelines, we have made the data and analysis scripts associated with this report publicly available on Open Science Framework (<ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/xjnfd">https://osf.io/xjnfd</ref>). All hypotheses are identified as either pre-registered a priori or exploratory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Participants</head><p>This study was part of a larger study <ref type="bibr">(Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2020</ref>) that examined daily life expression of emotion dynamics in bipolar spectrum psychopathology. A total of 352 young-adults from a large Midwestern university participated. Usable data was available for 233 participants (MAGE = 18.8, SDAGE = 1.0, self-identified as 71% female, 29% male, 52% White, 22% Asian, 13% Black/African American, 11% Multiracial, 1% American Indian, 1% Native Hawaiian). Note that this sample size was determined a priori using Monte Carlo Simulations based on preliminary data and was sufficient to detect small direct effects between level 1 and 2 variables with 80% power <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heck &amp; Thomas, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2020)</ref>. Detailed information regarding those dropped from analyses are presented in supplemental materials. Note that participants were recruited through two methods. First, undergraduates taking psychology courses could enroll into the study for course credit. Second, participants who scored 1.5 SD's above the mean on the HPS administered during departmental pre-screening were invited to participate. This recruitment method ensured adequate inclusion of participants experiencing high levels of bipolar spectrum psychopathology. Note that college students provide an appropriate sample for studying trait emotional awareness in bipolar spectrum psychopathology as they are at the age that bipolar disorders often first are experienced and the HPS effectively identifies young adults with bipolar symptoms and risk for bipolar disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Walsh et al., 2015)</ref>. Participants who completed at least 70% of the ESM questionnaires were entered into a drawing for a $100 gift card. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and all participants provided informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Procedures</head><p>Participants came to the lab for a one-hour session during which they completed self-report questionnaires and were instructed on ESM procedures. Participants completed a practice ESM survey (not included in analyses) using either the ESM Smartphone application Metricwire or Expimetrics. Participants were randomly prompted eight times per day between the hours of 10am and 10pm within stratified 90-minute intervals for 14 days. They had 10 minutes to complete questionnaires once they received notification that a questionnaire was available. The questionnaire took approximately two minutes to complete. In order to enhance participant compliance and motivation to complete ESM questionnaires and to troubleshoot problems, they were required to return to the lab for two follow-up sessions, once during the first 7 days and once during the second 7 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Materials</head><p>Participants completed self-report measures of risk for bipolar spectrum psychopathology, Clarity, Attention, infrequent responding, and demographics, as well as several other self-report measures not included in the present study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Hypomanic Personality Scale</head><p>The HPS is a well-validated measure that assesses bipolar spectrum psychopathology and risk for the development of bipolar spectrum disorders. High scorers on the HPS are at greater risk for the development of bipolar spectrum disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kwapil et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Walsh et al., 2015)</ref> and are significantly more likely to have subsyndromal symptoms of mania and hypomania. Several longitudinal studies have found that 33% -78% of high scorers on the HPS have had a hypomanic episode <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Eckblad &amp; Chapman, 1986)</ref> and that high scorers are more likely to develop a bipolar spectrum disorder at both three <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Walsh et al., 2015)</ref> and ten-year reassessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kwapil et al., 2000)</ref>. The HPS includes 48 true-false items, has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Eckblad &amp; Chapman, 1986)</ref>. The HPS was intermixed with a 13-item infrequency scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chapman &amp; Chapman, 1983)</ref> designed to identify invalid responders. Participants who endorsed more than two items were excluded from analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Clarity and Attention</head><p>Clarity and Attention were measured using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Salovey et al., 1995)</ref>. Participants reported responses on a Likert scale ranging from "1: Strongly disagree" to "5: Strongly agree." The Clarity subscale contains 11 items (e.g., "I am rarely confused about how I feel") and the Attention subscale includes 13 items (e.g., "I don't usually care much about what I'm feeling" [reverse-scored], "I pay a lot of attention to how I feel"). In three samples, the coefficient alpha internal consistency reliability ranged from .82 to .87 for the Attention subscale, and .85 to .87 for the Clarity subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Thompson et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">NA and PA Intensity and Instability</head><p>Affect items were drawn from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988)</ref> and the affective circumplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Russell, 1980)</ref>. Specifically, we assessed high arousal NA with the following affect items: "angry", "nervous", "irritable", "afraid"; low arousal NA: "sad", "bored", "sluggish"; high arousal PA: "enthusiastic", "determined", "proud", "excited"; low arousal PA: "content", "calm." Participants were asked to respond to the item "Right now, I feel [affect]" using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1: not at all to 7: very much. High and low arousal NA intensity represented the average of the NA indices and high and low arousal PA intensity represented the average of the PA indices over the 14-day protocol (this resulted in four intensity values per participant). Means and within and between person reliability, calculated using McDonald's omega (ω; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zinbarg et al., 2005)</ref> are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Next, we calculated the Mean Square of Successive Differences (MSSD) for each participant. Following, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jahng, Wood, &amp; Trull (2008)</ref>, we adjusted successive differences for unequally spaced time (see Formula 1). Lambda was chosen to account for serial effects and make successive differences as constant as possible. Finally, we took the square root of MSSD values (RMSSD) to account for non-normality. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistical analyses</head><p>We conducted path analyses in R version 4.0.2 using lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>show the path models we tested. For each model, we used the HPS score as the exogenous variable with the emotional outcome (intensity or instability) as an endogenous variable. Paths were also specified from the HPS to Clarity and Attention and from Clarity and Attention to the emotional outcome. Following the hypothesized model, we specified that Attention would moderate the link between the HPS and emotional outcome. We also estimated the indirect path from the HPS to the emotional outcome through Clarity. Standard errors were calculated based on 1000 bootstrapped samples. Finally, models were estimated using full information maximum likelihood (FIML). We evaluated model fit using CFI, RMSEA, and SRMR based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref> criteria.</p><p>We computed simple slopes analyses to decompose significant interactions by examining whether the slope between HPS scores and affect intensity or instability were significant at low (-1 SD), mean (0), or high (+1 SD) levels of Attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Participants completed an average of 63% (n=35) usable ESM protocols during the first week and 61% (n = 34) during the second week. Total number of completed ESM questionnaires was not significantly associated with HPS scores (r = .04, p =.60), Clarity (r = -.03, p = .65), or Attention (r = -.02, p = .71). Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations for all variables are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Twenty-six percent (n = 60) of participants had scores in the upper quartile on the HPS (27 to 48). Based on prior research, it is expected that concurrently, 15% of the sample (n = 35) would meet criteria for a DSM bipolar spectrum disorder and 20% likely have a lifetime history of a hypomanic episode. Additionally, we would expect that prospectively over three years, approximately 58% of those scoring in the upper quartile at baseline would meet criteria for a diagnosable bipolar spectrum disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Walsh et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, oversampling procedures were viewed as successful and the current sample is enriched with those who likely have or will develop a bipolar spectrum disorder. Across zero-order correlations and all path models, higher HPS scores were associated with lower Clarity, providing support for hypothesis 1. However, HPS scores were not significantly associated with Attention (i.e., hypothesis 3 was not supported).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Intensity Models</head><p>All four models predicting high and low arousal NA and PA intensity had good fit (CFI = .95 -.96, RMSEA = .05, SRMR = .03). As predicted (H2), we found that the indirect path (labeled d*b in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) was significant in predicting high and low arousal NA intensity (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Furthermore, the indirect path through Clarity also predicted high and low arousal PA intensity (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref> ; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Also, as predicted (H4), we found that the HPS*Attention interaction significantly predicted high arousal NA intensity (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) at low levels of Attention, t(229) = 4.05, p &lt; .001, and at mean Attention, t(229) = 2.76, p = .006, but not high levels, t(229) = -.04, p = .97. We also found that HPS scores were associated with greater low arousal NA at low levels of Attention, t(229) = 2.29, p = .02, but not mean, t(229) = .85, p = .40, or high Attention, t(229) = -.95, p = .34.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Clarity and Attention showed differential mechanistic relationships with risk for bipolar spectrum psychopathology, as measured by the HPS, and affect intensity and instability. HPS scores predicted greater high and low arousal NA only when participants had low or mean trait levels of Attention. A similar pattern emerged for instability -HPS scores predicted greater high and low arousal NA only when participants had low or mean trait levels of attention, consistent with the Affect-as-Information hypothesis. Attention did not seem to be related to PA in daily life. In contrast, the association between HPS scores and intensity of both high and low arousal NA and PA was partially accounted for by their indirect relationship with low levels of Clarity. More specificity was seen in terms of instability -HPS scores were associated with low Clarity which in turn was associated with higher instability of high arousal NA. Based on these results we highlight three major implications and areas of future study: (1) assessing trait emotional awareness in those at risk for bipolar spectrum psychopathology is important, (2) facets of emotional awareness are differentially associated with affect intensity and instability in daily life, and (3) targeting emotional awareness in psychosocial interventions may improve affective dysregulation in those with subsyndromal symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Clarity</head><p>We extended <ref type="bibr">Van Rheenen et al.'s (2015)</ref> study in bipolar I disorder to find that high HPS scores were associated with low trait Clarity. This suggests that low trait Clarity may be present across a wide spectrum of bipolar psychopathology and in those at risk for the development of bipolar spectrum disorders. Furthermore, trait Clarity was negatively associated with high and low arousal NA and positively associated with high and low arousal PA suggesting that on average, individuals low in trait Clarity may fail to downregulate emotions and experience higher intensity of NA and lower intensity of PA. This is consistent with findings that suggest that identifying one's emotions functions to regulate their intensity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Torre &amp; Lieberman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lieberman et al, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, it could be that higher affect intensity could lead to less Clarity. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arndt et al. (2018)</ref> found that indirect (reaction time) measures of Clarity in daily life were associated with intensity in an inverted U pattern (i.e., both linearly and quadratically) whereby intense affect was needed for someone to be clear about their emotions, and, higher intensity of affect was associated with greater confusion about one's emotion. Although we measured Clarity at the trait not state level, the alternate model we tested in which intensity predicted Clarity had poorer model fit. As such, the relationship between Clarity and affect intensity may depend differentially on state vs. trait Clarity, particularly in those at risk for the development of bipolar spectrum disorders. One potential factor influencing differences between state and trait Clarity is one's confidence in their emotion ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arndt et al., 2018)</ref>. Interestingly, a core feature of bipolar spectrum psychopathology is increased confidence with HPS scores positively associated with self-reported confidence in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kwapil et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sperry &amp; Kwapil, 2017)</ref>. Individuals may endorse high trait Clarity during periods of grandiosity but have less accuracy in labeling their emotions. This will be an important future direction of this work in expanding it to both clinical populations and measuring emotional awareness at both trait and state levels.     Our finding that the indirect path between HPS scores and instability of high arousal NA is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boden et al. (2013)</ref>) findings regarding variability of NA and PA -Clarity was associated with variability of NA but not PA. Yet, in the present study, this was only true in high arousal not low arousal NA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Muhtadie and Johnson (2015)</ref> found that participants with bipolar disorder showed greater patterns of cardiovascular threat reactivity during a cognitive task. Our high arousal NA measure included subjective feelings of fear and anxiety -core components of threat sensitivity. This may suggest that higher scores on the HPS may be particularly associated with low clarity of threat-related negative emotions which in turn leads to difficulty regulating the intensity of these category of emotions. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Storbeck and Clore (2008)</ref> posit that high vs. low arousal emotions provide information about the importance of one's situation. Thus, individuals scoring high on the HPS may be having difficulty integrating the importance of their high arousal NA into the current context and thus may not engage in emotion regulation strategies appropriately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Attention</head><p>Contrary to expectations, but consistent with <ref type="bibr">Van Rheenan et al. (2015)</ref>, HPS scores were unassociated with levels of Attention at both the zero-order level and in the path analysis. This suggests that in general, individuals with varying levels of risk for bipolar spectrum psychopathology do not show trait-level alterations in the ability to monitor, value, and maximize their experience of emotion. However, we found that under specific conditions (low, mean Attention), HPS scores were associated with NA intensity. These findings are consistent with the Affect-as-Information <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gohm &amp; Clore, 2002)</ref> and hedonic contingency hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Wegener et al., 1995)</ref> that suggest that low levels of attention may impair emotion regulation leading to greater affect intensity and higher instability of affect. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thompson et al. (2011)</ref> found that concurrently, higher Attention was associated with greater intensity of NA and PA, but that attention predicted reductions in NA in next moment. Taken together with our results, this may suggest that higher Attention is associated with greater intensity of emotion in the moment (perhaps because intensity of emotion is signaling to the person that there is something important and valuable that they need to attend to), but that this enables the individual to successfully regulate the intensity of their emotions over time. This would explain why <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thompson et al. (2011)</ref> found prospective decrease in NA and why at trait levels, those who do not attend to their emotion (and have risk for psychopathology) have more affective dysregulation over time. Perhaps individuals with high scores on the HPS and low trait Attention fail to monitor and attend to changes in the intensity of their emotions, subsequently failing to engage antecedent-focused emotion regulation strategies and learn from their environment. Never-the-less, rather than being proximal to various forms of psychopathology, Attention seems to be a more distal factor influencing the experience of emotion in the moment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implications</head><p>Taken together, these results clearly implicate a relationship between HPS scores, Clarity and Attention, and affective dysregulation. As such, it is essential that in those identified as at risk for the development of bipolar spectrum disorders (e.g., high scorers on the HPS, high BAS participants, first-degree relative with bipolar disorder), trait emotional awareness is assessed. Given that affective instability and dysregulation is a risk factor for the development of bipolar spectrum disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sperry et al., 2020)</ref>, it could be especially important to engage at risk individuals in emotional awareness training aimed at decreasing affect intensity and instability. Preliminary trials have shown that dialectical behavior therapy, which directly addresses Clarity and Attention, may be helpful in reducing emotion dysregulation in those with bipolar disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eisner et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldstein et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldstein et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Van Dijk et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, individuals identified as high risk based on psychometric risk assessments may benefit from early intervention to a) monitor and attend to feelings in reaction to an external or internal stimulus, and b) accurately make attributions about the source and type of emotions they feel could potentially decrease affect intensity and instability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>This study was not without limitations. First, although affect intensity and instability were modeled longitudinally over 14 days, the HPS, Clarity, and Attention were modeled cross-sectionally. Thus, path models should not be interpreted causally as they do not temporal dependency. However, it is worth noting that in reversing the models, theorized models had better fit suggesting some support for directionality. Future studies could more concretely speak to causality and directionally should variables be temporally ordered, or, experimentally manipulated. Second, Attention, as measured by the TMMS, appeared largely unrelated to PA outcomes. This was somewhat surprising given that <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thompson et al. (2011)</ref> found that Attention was associated with momentary intensity of PA. Future work is warranted to disentangle whether Attention is unrelated to PA, or, the measure itself does not adequately tap attention to PA. Lastly, it is unclear whether these findings generalize to patients with clinically diagnosed bipolar spectrum disorders. The present study examined a non-clinical sample oversampled for high scores on the HPS. However, in previous studies, high HPS scorers had a high likelihood of having experienced a hypomanic episode, may already have diagnosable bipolar disorders, and are more likely to go on to develop a bipolar spectrum disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kwapil et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Walsh et al., 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, assessing affective instability in a population that is potentially naïve to medication side effects is a benefit, as first-line treatments such as Lithium are known to reduce affective instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hollander et al., 2005)</ref>. However, the present study did not include a diagnostic interview that assessed diagnostic or medication status, so this information is unknown. Future studies should examine the extent to which state levels of Clarity and Attention are different than trait levels across various mood presentations and account for medication usage. For example, findings regarding the link between Attention and affect intensity and instability may look different in an individual who is actively hypomanic or manic and on or off mood stabilizers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
