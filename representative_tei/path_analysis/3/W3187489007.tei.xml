<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The decomposition of the total effect of a treatment X on an outcome variable Y into direct and indirect effects is a central topic in empirical research. In linear models, the relationship between total, direct and indirect effects is well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cochran 1938;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alwin and Hauser 1975</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baron and Kenny 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollen 1987</ref>) and a simple decomposition is available. Such a decomposition is based on the linearity of the marginal model for Y against X, where the coefficient of X is equal to the sum of the direct effect and the indirect effects. Outside the linear case, this simplicity is lost, as in the marginal model of Y against X only, either the effect of X on Y is a complex function of the original parameters or the error term does not possess nice properties, or both.</p><p>We here consider situations where the outcome Y is a binary random variable. Contributions have addressed the case of one continuous mediator, see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">MacKinnon et al. (2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Karlson, Holm, and Breen (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Breen, Karlson, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Holm (2013, 2018)</ref>. Recent results concern the exact parametric form of the marginal effect of X on Y on the log odds ratio scale when the mediator is also binary <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Stanghellini and Doretti 2019)</ref>. In this setting, when X is continuous the marginal model of Y against X is non-linear unless some conditional independence assumptions hold, and a rather complex formula links the marginal and conditional effect of X on Y. Similarly, for a discrete X the parameters of the conditional model combine in a non-linear fashion to form the marginal effect. For analogous results on the log relative risk scale see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lupparelli (2019)</ref>.</p><p>Starting from the results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Stanghellini and Doretti (2019)</ref>, we here elaborate a novel proposal for the direct and indirect effect definitions on the log odds scale for a treatment variable X either continuous or discrete. The postulated system can be represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), see <ref type="bibr">Lauritzen (1996, Ch. 2)</ref>, to which we refer for definitions; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Elwert (2013)</ref> for an account in the sociological context. Our proposal is based on zeroing the path-specific regression coefficients. Graphically, this corresponds to deleting one arrow in the associated DAG and thereby represents the analogue of the path analysis method.</p><p>We initially focus on a single mediator context and show that the marginal effect can be written as the sum of the indirect and direct effects plus a residual term that vanishes under some specific conditions. The proposed parametric relationship allows, for the specific setting under investigation, to solve the debate on which method should be used to disentangle the total effect, i.e., the product method or the difference method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Breen et al. 2018)</ref>. It also avoids fitting two nested models, thereby sidestepping the issue of unequal variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Winship and Mare 1983)</ref>. We then extend our derivations to the case of multiple binary mediators, also modeled as a recursive system of univariate logistic regressions. In this context, additional path-specific effects can be defined and different research questions addressed. Although the paper draws from the derivation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Stanghellini and Doretti (2019)</ref>, some novel results are also presented. With reference to a single mediator, a general formulation of functional form linking the log odds ratio of the mediator and of the outcome to the covariates is considered. This is then extended to the multiple mediator context, for which a strategy for deriving the direct and indirect effects when marginalizing over an intermediate or outer mediator is also illustrated.</p><p>Our approach is developed in a purely associational context that, in general, holds no interpretation for causal inference. However, if the recursive system of equation is structural <ref type="bibr">(Pearl 2009, Ch. 7)</ref> and no unmeasured confounders exist, the total effect and some of its components can be endowed with a causal interpretation. Notice that a decomposition of the total effect based on counterfactual entities has been given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pearl (2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pearl ( , 2012) )</ref> and extended to the odds ratio scale by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">VanderWeele and Vansteelandt (2010)</ref>. This parallelism is also addressed in this paper.</p><p>In Section 2, we offer the general theory for the case of a single mediator. A case study concerning a randomized encouragement experiment on cultural consumption performed in Florence (Italy) is also presented as a guiding example. Results of a simulation study investigating maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the effects and other related measures is also reported in Section 3, while the extension to the multiple mediator setting is contained in Section 4. In Section 5, we address other complex issues concerning path-specific effects, whereas links with counterfactual</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W X Y (a) W X Y (b) W X Y (c) W X Y (d)</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>: Data generating process when (a) no conditional independences hold, (b</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">) X ⊥ ⊥ Y | W, (c) W ⊥ ⊥ Y | X and (d) W ⊥ ⊥ X.</formula><p>definitions are explored in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7 we draw some conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Effect decomposition with a single mediator</head><p>We first focus on a very simple model for a binary outcome Y, a binary mediator W and a treatment X, that can be either discrete or continuous; see Fig 1(a) for the corresponding DAG. Our aim is to decompose the total effect of X on Y on the log odds scale. Our postulated models are a logistic regression for Y given X and W and for W given X, that is, log</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P(Y = 1 | X = x, W = w) P(Y = 0 | X = x, W = w) = β 0 + β x x + β w w + β xw xw (1)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">log P(W = 1 | X = x) P(W = 0 | X = x) = γ 0 + γ x x.</formula><p>(2)</p><p>Notice that we allow for the interaction between X and W in the outcome equation. In order to make the paper self-contained, the derivations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Stanghellini and Doretti (2019)</ref> to evaluate the total effect as a function of the parameters of models (1) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) are here reproduced, prior the introduction of its decomposition into direct, indirect and residual effects.</p><p>As a guiding example through this section, we consider an experiment aiming at identifying the best incentives to offer high school students in Florence to enhance cultural interest and increase art museum attendance. Three treatment levels are considered: a flyer given to the students with the main information about the Palazzo Vecchio museum constitutes the first level; a flyer and a presentation of the museum from an expert constitutes the second level; a flyer, the presentation and a reward in the form of extra-credit points for their final school grade constitutes the third level. All students receive a free entry ticket to Palazzo Vecchio. The aim of the experiment is not only to assess the total effect of the treatment (X) on students museum's attendance (Y), but also to understand to what extent this effect could be stimulated by student's visit to Palazzo Vecchio (W); see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lattarulo, Mariani, and Razzolini (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Forastiere et al.

From first principles of probabilities, it follows that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">log P(Y = 1 | X = x) P(Y = 0 | X = x) = -log P(W = w | Y = 1, X = x) P(W = w | Y = 0, X = x) + log P(Y = 1 | W = w, X = x) P(Y = 0 | W = w, X = x) .

We here offer an example for p = 1, with both additive and interaction effects up to the second order in both models for Y and W. After the marginalization over W, we obtain the marginal model for Y given X and C as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">log P(Y = 1 | X = x, C = c) P(Y = 0 | X = x, C = c) = β 0 + β x x + β c c + β xc xc -log RR W|Y,X=x,C=c<label>(9)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">RR W|Y,X=x,C=c = 1 + exp g 0 (x, c) 1 + exp g 1 (x, c) ,</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">g y (x, c) = y β w + β xw x + β cw c + log 1 + exp(β 0 + β x x + β c c + β xc xc) 1 + exp(β 0 + β x x + β c c + β w + β xw x + β xc xc + β cw c) + γ 0 + γ x x + γ c c + γ xc xc.</formula><p>(10) See Appendix A for a general formulation that includes more covariates and possibly nonlinear link functions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Y Y W = 0 C = 0 0 1 W = 0 C = 1 0 1 X 1 19 2 X 1 48 17 2 14 21 2 14 28 3 3 3 3 23 21 Y Y W = 1 C = 0 0 1 W = 1 C = 1 0 1 X 1 0 0 X 1 1 2 2 1 0 2 6 3 3 1 9 3 19 11</formula><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Contingency tables for (Y, X, W, C) for the cultural consumption experiment.</p><p>With reference to the cultural consumption data, 15 classes for a total of 294 students, all aged between 15 and 18, from three different schools, were randomly assigned at baseline (March/April 2014) to the three treatment levels (X). At the second occasion, after two months, researchers collected the entry tickets to record student visits (W). Finally, after six months they collected the concluding questionnaire with general information on visits to other museums (Y). A questionnaire with information on background characteristics of the students and their families was also administered. Among all the covariates, only one appears to be relevant in the model for the outcome, Ignoring for now the sampling errors, we see that the g y (x, c) function can be formed by plugging in (10) the ML estimates of the parameters. The function expresses the log odds ratio of W after conditioning on X, Y and the covariate C.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">that</formula><p>We now present a definition for the total, direct and indirect effects in the situation with no covariates. When covariates C are present, the parametric formula of TE(x) and its decomposition, for both continuous and discrete X, vary with the level of C. Notice that the direct and indirect effects so defined do not sum to the total effect, but a residual term remains. This term is zero only under some specific conditions, that we are going to discuss.</p><p>Total Effect Let TE(x) be the effect of X on Y, on the log odds scale, in the distribution of (Y | X) obtained after marginalization on W. For X continuous and differentiable, the total effect is defined as the derivative of (6) with respect to x.

This definition is aligned with the collapsibility of odds ratio, as explained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xie, Ma, and Geng (2008)</ref>, Corollary 3.

Provided that these two are positive, it is therefore meaningful to look at the ratio between the indirect effect and the total effect, as it gives an indication of the proportion of total effect due to the mediator W (i.e., the proportion mediated). When a residual effect is present, the ratio between the indirect and total effect can still provide information on the weight of the indirect effect on the total effect, though with a less clear interpretation (see Sections 2.1 and 2.</p></div>

Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">12</ref>) confirms the well-known fact that the marginal logistic model is non linear in x, also providing the explicit expression of it. Notice that, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Stanghellini and Doretti (2019)</ref>, all terms in curly bracket are bounded between 0 and 1, while ∆ w (x) is bounded between -1 and 1. Notice further that ∆ w (x) and ∆ y (x) share the same sign, and they are both zero whenever</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">W ⊥ ⊥ Y | X.</formula><p>Indirect Effect Following the definition, we evaluate the total effect assuming</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">β x = β xw = 0, that is IE(x) = TE(x) | β x =β xw =0 = γ x ∆ * w (x)<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">∆ * w (x) is ∆ w (x) evaluated at β x = β xw = 0.

Notice that the latter case coincides with the condition of collapsibility of odds ratio, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xie et al. (2008)</ref>, Corollary 3. Since all terms in curly brackets are bounded, expression (15) also highlights that the sign of the residual effect depends on the relative magnitude of the coefficients and is not linked to the logistic regression coefficients in a clear way. As a matter of fact, even if the direct and indirect effects share the same sign, the sign of the residual effect may be either positive or negative. Thus, as mentioned in Section 2, for a fixed level of x, the ratio between the indirect effect and the total effect may provide an indication of the relative strength of the indirect effect, though with a less clear interpretation.</p></div>

In a single mediator context, VanderWeele and Vansteelandt (2010) define the counterfactual notion of direct and indirect effects when the outcome is binary, thereby focusing on the log odds scale. Within a regression analysis context with a continuous mediator, the authors present an approximated parametric formulation of the effects that holds under the rare outcome assumption of Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Valeri and VanderWeele (2013)</ref> address the same problem when also the mediator is binary, again modeled under the rare outcome assumption. It is therefore worth to explore the links existing between the effects introduced here and these causal effects defined in a formal counterfactual framework. Since the latter are contrasts expressed, possibly after a logarithmic transformation, by a difference, this parallel holds for X binary. Notice that, differently from the above cited approaches, we here present a decomposition based on the exact formulation of the effects on the log odds scale.</p><p>Under the assumption that the recursive system of equation is structural in the sense of <ref type="bibr">Pearl (2009, Ch. 7)</ref>, one can give the total effect and some of its components a causal interpretation. To say that the recursive system of equations is structural implies that the DAG is a causal graph that satisfies a set of axioms, namely composition, effectiveness and reversibility, see also <ref type="bibr">Steen and Vansteelandt (2018)</ref>.</p><p>With a single binary mediator, a parallelism between the structural definition of a DAG and the Sequential Ignorability Assumption of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto (2010)</ref> exists, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pearl (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shpitser and VanderWeele (2011)</ref>. Under the assumption of no unmeasured counfounder of the treatment-outcome relationship, possibly after conditioning on a set of pre-treatment covariates C, the total effect of X on Y here presented corresponds to the total causal effect as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">VanderWeele and Vansteelandt (2010)</ref>. Similarly, assuming that there are no unobserved confounders of the treatment-outcome relationship, possibly after conditioning on a set of pretreatment covariates C, and no unmeasured confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship, after conditioning on the treatment X and possibly some pre-treatment covariates C, the direct effect can be seen as the controlled direct effect (VanderWeele and Vansteelandt 2010) after an external intervention to fix W = 0 is performed (see Section 2.2 case ii)). Less obvious are the parallelisms in terms of natural effects of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">VanderWeele and Vansteelandt (2010)</ref>. It is possible to</p><p>show that the pure natural indirect effect can be seen as the total effect after assuming β x = β xw = 0 (i.e. the indirect effect; see Section 2.2 case i)) and that the pure natural direct effect corresponds to the total effect after assuming γ x = 0, i.e. X ⊥ ⊥ W (see Section 2.2 case iv)). More details are in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Doretti et al. (2021)</ref>.</p><p>When multiple causally ordered mediators are present, several possible effects are of interest, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daniel et al. (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Steen et al. (2017)</ref>. However, in this case the definition of natural direct and indirect effects is more cumbersome, and sometimes effects of interest are non-parametrically non identifiable, see e.g. the situation described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Avin, Shpitser, and Pearl (2005)</ref>. Again, if no unobserved confounders exist, some parallelisms continue to hold. As an instance, the direct effect can be seen as the controlled direct effect of X on Y after an external intervention to fix the mediator W 1 = W 2 = . . . = W k = 0 is performed, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">VanderWeele and Vansteelandt (2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our approach allows further to appreciate the total and controlled direct effect of X on Y also when some mediators are marginalized over, while others are kept in the system. We believe that this is an important research question in many applied studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>Logistic regression is by far the most used model for a binary response. Further than in a mediation context, the models here proposed may arise in longitudinal studies with a binary outcome measured at different occasions.</p><p>With reference to a single mediator, we have proposed a novel decomposition of the total effect into direct and indirect effects that is more appropriate for the nonlinear case and that, under certain conditions, reduces to the classical definition in the linear case. Additionally, this decomposition overcomes the issue of unequal variance when fitting two nested models. As illustrative example,</p><p>we have re-analyzed data based on an encouragement program to stimulate students' attitude to visit museums. We have shown how the decomposition of the total effect could avoid erroneous conclusions on the direct and indirect effects and provides additional information that cannot be found by just looking at the results of the separate regressions analysis. Although the total, direct and indirect effects are all positive, a substantial residual effect, possibly due to a large interaction coefficient, hinders the interpretation in terms of proportion mediated.</p><p>Additional important results concern the extension of the definitions to the multiple mediator context. Repeated use of the decomposition of the total effect allows to address complex issues like quantifying the total, direct and indirect effects when a subset of mediators are marginalized over. Links to the causal effects have also been established.</p><p>A Appendix: a general formulation </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Appendix: multiple mediators</head><p>We here generalize the previous derivations to a situation with multiple mediators. We denote with g (w &lt; j ) y (x, w &gt; j ) the function (30) evaluated after marginalizing over the W &lt; j mediators and considering (W j+1 , . . . , W k ) as covariates. The expression of g (w &lt; j ) y (x, w &gt; j ) can be derived recursively, after noting that g y (x, w &gt;1 ) is (30) after imposing W = W 1 and C = W &gt;1 .

Furthermore, if for the binary case the bias seems reasonable, it becomes consistent in the continuous case.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>n 250</cell><cell>500 1000 250</cell><cell>500 1000 250</cell><cell>500 1000</cell></row><row><cell>β x</cell><cell cols="2">true value method</cell><cell>average</cell><cell>variance</cell><cell>RMSE</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">IE/TE (X binary)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>0.4</cell><cell>0.716</cell><cell cols="4">KHB 0.732 0.683 0.669 0.144 0.033 0.014 0.379 0.184 0.129 RSD 0.757 0.732 0.724 0.064 0.024 0.011 0.256 0.154 0.107</cell></row><row><cell>0.9</cell><cell>0.532</cell><cell cols="4">KHB 0.475 0.468 0.462 0.020 0.008 0.004 0.153 0.111 0.092 RSD 0.544 0.539 0.535 0.020 0.009 0.004 0.141 0.094 0.064</cell></row><row><cell>1.8</cell><cell>0.364</cell><cell cols="4">KHB 0.301 0.300 0.297 0.004 0.002 0.001 0.092 0.079 0.074 RSD 0.367 0.367 0.364 0.007 0.003 0.002 0.082 0.058 0.040</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">AIPE/ATPE (X continuous)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>0.4</cell><cell>0.590</cell><cell cols="4">KHB 0.531 0.521 0.513 0.028 0.013 0.006 0.178 0.133 0.108 RSD 0.561 0.589 0.580 0.010 0.004 0.002 0.103 0.064 0.042</cell></row><row><cell>0.9</cell><cell>0.437</cell><cell cols="4">KHB 0.316 0.317 0.310 0.008 0.004 0.002 0.149 0.135 0.134 RSD 0.411 0.458 0.440 0.002 0.002 0.001 0.055 0.046 0.026</cell></row><row><cell>1.8</cell><cell>0.351</cell><cell cols="4">KHB 0.180 0.178 0.180 0.002 0.001 0.001 0.178 0.177 0.173 RSD 0.328 0.343 0.352 0.001 0.001 0.000 0.042 0.026 0.017</cell></row></table></figure>

When all effects are positive, it is therefore meaningful to compute the proportion mediated as the ratio between the indirect and total effect; see Eq. ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Breen et al. (2013)</ref>. The authors present a method to sidestep the well-known issue of unequal variances, known as KHB method. They also propose to adapt it to the binary mediator case, by postulating a linear probability model for W.</p><p>We here postulate a logistic model for W and analyze, through simulations, the behaviour in finite samples of the KHB method and of the proposed method. For X binary, we compare the KHB method with the ratio between the estimates of the effects IE(x) and TE(x) in Section 2, obtained by plugging-in the ML estimates of the parameters in the corresponding expression. For X continuous, we notice that the KHB measure should be interpreted as the proportion mediated on the probability scale in the same fashion as discussed in Section 2.3. For this reason, we proceed as follows. Given a sample of n units, an estimate of the corresponding effect is formed by averaging across units the corresponding entities. As an instance, the estimated Average Total Probability A straightforward extension of the derivations presented in Section 1 leads to the following:</p><p>with log RR W|Y,X=x,C=c = log exp g 1 (x, c)</p><p>The total effect can be obtained from Equations ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>) -( <ref type="formula">30</ref>), after taking the derivative with respect to X (for X continuous) or taking difference among levels of X (for X discrete).</p><p>B Appendix: concordance between ∆ * w (x) and β w</p><p>To prove that ∆ * w (x) and β w are concordant, we first prove the concordance between ∆ y (x) and ∆ w (x).
