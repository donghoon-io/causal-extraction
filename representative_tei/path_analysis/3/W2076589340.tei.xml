<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -For team leaders or supervisors (functional coordinators, FCs) warehouses are one of the most difficult places to supervise and manage subordinate workers. FCs themselves can be supervised by their bosses in different ways, either semiautonomously or in a traditional authoritarian manner. However, different supervision environments for FCs may affect the performance of the warehouses they work in. This paper investigates the linkages between different supervision environments; FCs' trust in and satisfaction with their bosses, warehouse service quality and company growth.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach -Structural equation modelling (path analysis) is applied to a randomly-drawn data sample (n = 95) of dairy warehouses from the UK.</p><p>Findings -The results show that semi-autonomous supervision has a strong positive impact on FCs' trust and satisfaction and on warehouse service quality which positively affects company growth. In addition, FCs' trust and satisfaction are found to be important antecedents of warehouse service quality and they also directly enhance company growth. In contrast, traditional supervision does not build trust nor creates satisfaction and has a negative direct impact on warehouse service quality.</p><p>Practical limitations/implications -While conducted based on a small sample, the study examines important performance determinants and thus enhances the understanding of how to better manage warehouses in particular in a logistically challenging industry.</p><p>Originality/value -This study empirically analyses the linkages between supervision environments, warehouse service quality and company growth and thus contributes to determine a best-practice approach for modern warehouse management.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Supervision is management by overseeing the performance or operations of a person or group of people. Supervisors can choose between two opposing supervision approaches or styles: semi-autonomous and traditional authoritarian. The former emphasises the empowering of work teams. This supervision practice appreciates participation from team members and demonstrates recognition, respect, flexibility and workplace autonomy. The latter adopts command-and-control practices that reflect directive supervision behaviour (authoritarian management style). A main difference between these two approaches is the level of autonomy given to subordinates or supervisees <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Doughty, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have identified a significant connection between supervision style and performance. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ichniowski et al. (1996)</ref> estimated an increase of about 7% in production output when the production lines were run by autonomous supervision practices rather than in traditional practices and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pfeffer (1998)</ref> stated that a manufacturing firm reduced by 38% defect rates and increased its productivity by 20%.</p><p>However, despite the strong evidence documented in the literature about the associated benefits of employee empowerment and a supportive culture within organizations, only a small percentage of businesses have adopted a full system of employee autonomy, particularly in warehouses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellinger et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Leeuw and Berg, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Warehouses are dedicated spaces for storage and handling of materials. In supplydriven chains, warehouses hold stocks to feed internal departments such as manufacturing and production. In demand-driven chains, warehouses store goods to fulfil the needs of external customers <ref type="bibr">(Emmett, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In warehouses, functional coordinators play a vital role. Functional coordinators (FCs) are team leaders or supervisors who are responsible for a number of activities such as training and developing team members, clarifying goals, solving day-to-day problems and managing stakeholder relationships. Moreover, with the responsibility of coordinating their supply chain activities, these coordinators regularly communicate with upper management and external customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lado et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>Yet, while semi-autonomous practices in warehouses are increasingly adopted, little research attention has been given to empirically investigating their effectiveness, in particular in a logistically challenging industry such as perishable food distribution. In this industry, warehouse operations are characterised by high throughput rates (due to the limited shelf life of the handled products) and the controlled temperature environment adds additional operational constraints thus making it difficult to achieve good performance results.</p><p>This study therefore attempts to extend the existing literature and knowledge by collecting and analysing data from the UK food logistics industry. Based on a sample of dairy warehouses, which handle logistically demanding products such as fresh milk, yogurt, butter and cheese, the inter-relationships between different supervision environments, trust, satisfaction, warehouse service quality and company growth are analysed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Previous work and hypotheses</head><p>A semi-autonomous supervision style emphasises the empowerment of employees. It has been an important part of the creative manager's tool-kit during the last two decades. On the other hand, in traditional authoritarian supervision environments, job performance is closely associated with rates of pay and clearly separates the duties and rights of workers. In addition to this, in the traditional system, upper management retains the major decision-making power and conflicts are resolved through formal chains of command and grievance procedures. This system of supervision also ignores workforce empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Doughty, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In general, the work effectiveness of employees depends on the nature of supervision that ties workers and managers into a unified whole. To support this view, a study conducted in fourteen US firms clearly revealed a positive relationship between workers' decision-making participation and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hammer et al., 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Stewart and Him (1991)</ref> further believed that the ability to create, develop and maintain good working relationships is the key ingredient used by Chinese supervisors. In such type of supervision, FCs focus on gathering and transformation of information, teamwork and relationships management. They consider employees as a major source of their success and productivity. Therefore, supervision styles that emphasize the participation of all team members and treating employees fairly allow maximizing the morale and productivity of a workforce <ref type="bibr">(Bent et al., 1999)</ref>. Other studies further support this finding by indicating (i) a significant positive relationship between the supervision style and effects on the shop floor behaviour in multiple Dutch industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Leeuw and Berg, 2011)</ref>; (ii) a highly significant correlation between supervision style and warehouse performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellinger et al., 2003)</ref>; and (iii) management's trust in employees improving service quality and sales performance in a longitudinal study of 88 retail stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Salamon, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1a.</head><p>In UK dairy warehouses, as in other industries, employee work performance will be higher in semi-autonomous supervision environments than in traditional supervision ones Other research indicates that higher levels of trust in management are associated with semi-autonomous teams rather than traditionally designed groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cordery et al. (1991)</ref> showed that the attitude of employees at work is more favourable which leads towards higher financial performance and better service quality. However, it was also found that absenteeism and employee turnover rates were higher in autonomous groups than traditional groups although one reason for this might be that workers in the autonomous groups had to travel longer distances and to work more overtime. Within a participative supervision environment, trust can increase work effectiveness. <ref type="bibr">Bent et al. (1999)</ref> and DeConinck (2010) also argue that trust increases in a less regulated work environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1b.</head><p>In UK dairy warehouses, as in other industries, semi-autonomous supervision positively affects employees' trust in management while traditional supervision negatively affects it Empirical studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wall et al. (1986)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cordery et al. (1991)</ref> identified positive effects of semi-autonomous supervision environments on job satisfaction, which reflects the degree of employees' satisfaction with management behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cordery et al. (1991)</ref> claimed that higher levels of job satisfaction are correlated with the semi-autonomous management approach rather than the traditional authoritarian supervision style. An environment of praising employees for their good work, listening to their views, encouraging their participation in decision-making and applying flexible control contribute to their satisfaction and help them to feel valued <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wall et al.,1986)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1c.</head><p>In UK dairy warehouses, as in other industries, semi-autonomous supervision positively affects employees' satisfaction with management while traditional supervision negatively affects it A climate of trust can increase chances to acquire new skills and job enrichment (giving employees the opportunity to use a wide range of their abilities), and as a result, performance is improved. For example, the trust in participative management of General Motors has shown many positive effects such as good industrial relationships and low employee turnover. It is believed that General Motors has achieved relative success in Europe by implementing such practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ichniowski et al., 1996)</ref>. Besides this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Salamon (2008)</ref> produced empirical evidence that management trust in employees improves service quality and increases sales performance.</p><p>Hypothesis 2. In UK dairy warehouses, as in other industries, higher levels of trust will result in higher work performance</p><p>The positive effects of semi-autonomous supervision on service quality were shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chaston (1998)</ref>. His study suggested that management should not expect reducing employees' empowerment to have positive effects on overall service quality, sales and revenue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ellinger et al. (2005)</ref> also believed that the semi-autonomous supervision approach is positively associated with staff job satisfaction and the productivity of a company. Moreover, satisfied employees stay longer and continually find ways to add value. The outcome is a high-performing company in which people flourish and financial performance is sustained and increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chatteeuw et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Hypothesis 3. In UK dairy warehouses, as in other industries, higher levels of job satisfaction will result in higher work performance Service quality is a key aspect of financial performance and company growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lado et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Paulraj (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aramyan et al. (2007)</ref> suggested that delivery on time, order flexibility and a 100% fulfilling of orders are important ingredients for service quality and alternatively these factors contribute to financial results and growth.</p><p>Theoretical dimensions of these factors have been discussed in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Paulraj, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aramyan et al., 2007)</ref>. An empirical study of over 200 US manufacturing firms revealed a significant positive relationship between service quality and financial performance. Moreover, it has been suggested that service quality is an important factor to enhance competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lado et al. 2011)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sichtmann et al. (2011)</ref> found that service quality has positive and significant effects on company performance even though they were not particularly large in absolute terms.</p><p>Hypothesis 4. In UK dairy warehouses, as in other industries, service quality has a positive impact on company growth In summary, the conceptual model shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts the factors and their interrelationships which have been discussed above. Supervision type, FCs' trust and satisfaction are treated as exogenous (independent) yet interconnected variables.</p><p>Warehouse service quality and company growth are endogenous (dependent) variables.</p><p>In addition, warehouse service quality serves as a mediator variable, i.e., there are direct and indirect effects of the exogenous variables on company growth. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data collection and analysis method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sample procedure</head><p>Dairy wholesalers listed in the business database system KOMPASS were randomly selected. The sample consists of wholesale companies which are part of UK dairy supply chains (milk, butter, cheese and yogurt). The selection was based on the UK industrial classification. Available funds limited the sample size to 400 companies. In the cover letter, it was explained that the questionnaire should be filled in by managers that can be considered as functional coordinator or come close to this work profile.</p><p>From the questionnaires sent by ordinary mail, 113 questionnaires were returned after a follow-up reminder letter. Eighteen of these questionnaires were unusable because of incomplete responses or did not fulfil other quality criteria and were thus excluded from the study. This yielded a rate of usable responses of 24%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Questionnaire and measures</head><p>The questionnaire was based on the literature discussed. Five-point Likert scales (strongly disagree: 1 and strongly agree: 5) were used to allow respondents to express their degree of agreement or disagreement. The developed questionnaire was tested on five FCs from four different warehouses. Remaining clarity issues and other problems were identified and resolved. The respondents also mentioned that a questionnairebased survey was more convenient and time efficient than face-to-face interviews.</p><p>The constructs (variables) and measurement items used in this study are summarized in Appendix A. Each construct consists of three measures (statement items). The constructs of supervision environments, i.e., semi-autonomous supervision and traditional authoritarian supervision, were assessed employing scales originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Warr et al. (1979)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Campion et al. (1993)</ref>. The constructs measure who (immediate boss or FC) determine major work-related decisions and procedures. The construct trust measured the levels of trust which FCs have in their managers. The construct's individual items assessed the efficacy of management at work, the confidence of the FCs in being treated fairly and whether management fulfil their promises <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cook and Wall, 1980)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Warr et al. (1979)</ref>, FCs' satisfaction was measured based on how management deals with FCs, the quality of their working relationships with each other and an assessment of the quality of their immediate bosses.</p><p>By using measures (items) employed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Paulraj, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aramyan et al., 2007)</ref>, we measured performance using two constructs, warehouse service quality and company growth. Service quality was assessed using measures of delivery timing, order flexibility and rate of order fulfilment. The measures of company growth were indicators on profitability, sales and market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Paulraj, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aramyan et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In order to identify two supervision environment sub-groups of companies, the constructs semi-autonomous supervision and traditional supervision were used. Using a cut-off value of 3 to define group membership resulted in statistically acceptable subsample sizes of 62 companies characterised by rather using semi-autonomous supervision and 33 rather using a traditional authoritarian one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data analysis</head><p>The statistical analysis conducted on the collected data includes the computation of descriptive statistics, reliability and validity tests and of structural equation models (SEMs). Before statistically testing the hypothesized relationships among the constructs, it was necessary to check whether the used data meet certain quality criteria such as means/medians comparisons and skewness and kurtosis being close to the recommended values <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barbara, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>SEM is a tool to estimate simultaneously multiple relationships (controlled correlations) between the observed and hypothesised variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barbara, 2010)</ref>. First, we calculated descriptive statistics and reliability tests using SPSS (version 18). Second, we performed validity tests and SEM (i.e., testing hypotheses and the fit of the data to the conceptual model) employing AMOS (version 18). AMOS utilizes the variance-covariance matrix of the variables from the dataset for estimating path parameters. In general, maximum likelihood optimization and critical ratios are used to test the statistical significance of the estimated parameters. Values of the critical ratios greater than 1.96 indicate statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>In order to assess the goodness of fit of the estimated SEM models, we used the standard measures discussed in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbara, 2010)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the fit indices and lists their generally recommend cut-off values. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Biases, descriptive statistics, data reliability and validity</head><p>To assess non-response bias, a total of 25 non-respondents were selected randomly.</p><p>As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Churchill (1991)</ref>, data from this sample about general company characteristics (annual turnover and number of employees) was requested. The Mann-Whitney U-test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the respondent and non-respondent samples (p &lt; 0.05). The majority of respondents did not complete their questionnaires because of their busy schedule or company policies. 1 In addition to this, no statistically significant difference was detected between early or late respondents.</p><p>Statistical tests showed that the obtained data met the distributional assumptions and also supported the reliability and validity criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barbara, 2010)</ref>. Moreover, Cronbach α values are listed in Appendix B. All α values are larger than the recommended value of 0.7 (the values lie between 0.86 and 0.96) and thus confirm the reliability of the measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kline, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The measurement models were also tested for validity. These models were estimated without putting addition constraints or modification indices. This process examined the relationships between the items and the underlying constructs. As shown in Appendix B, all factor loadings are higher than 0.50, ranging from 0.69 to 0.97. The loadings are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the values of construct reliability and average variance extracted are more than satisfactory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kline, 2005)</ref>. Finally, we assessed whether common method bias, i.e. significant measurement error due to multiple-item questions, limited the validity of our results. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref>, the 'single-common-method-factor approach' was used to test whether the obtained SEM results would significantly change when adding an unmeasured latent methods factor to the estimated models. This was not the case. Moreover, Harman's single factor test was applied where a common method latent variable was constructed based on all directly measured items used in this study. The estimated factor model was not significant thus indicating that shared variance resulting from a common measurement approach is non-existent or small at worst. However, there was a multicollinearity issue among the items used for warehouse service quality and company growth. In other words, inter-correlations among the items of theses constructs (i.e., Ser1, Ser2 and Ser3, and Gro1, Gro2 and Gro3, respectively, see Appendix B) were high. Therefore, we used 'parcelling' to overcome the multicollinearity problem and to reduce the number of indicators to achieve the main purpose of this study (i.e., investigating the structural relationships between the constructs under investigation rather than the relationships between the measurement items). Parcelling refers to the process of summing or averaging item scores of two or more items <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bandalos and Finney, 2001)</ref>. Researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Marsh et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bandalos and Finney, 2001)</ref> showed that the results obtained from parcels rather than the original items are more likely to provide a proper solution. They suggested that parcelling is particularly suitable when the research focus is on the structural part of a model.</p><p>A final data issue was that while the constructs traditional supervision and semiautonomous supervision were supposed to measure the same phenomenon but 'the other way round', we found that in fact both latent variables are only moderately related to each other. While the correlation coefficient is as expected negative and statistically highly significant its absolute size of -0.44 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) is not very large. This suggests that respondents did not give fully consistent answers with regard to the supervision environments in which they work. As the factor loadings in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> show, the semi-autonomous supervision constructs seem to be slightly more statistically reliable than the traditional supervision one and for this reason preference was given to it in the subsequent SEM analyses. *** statistically significant at p &lt; 0.01; + parameter fixed, i.e., no significant level available; n = 95 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Differences between the supervision environments</head><p>The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> show that in semi-autonomous supervision environments, warehouse service quality, company growth, FCs' satisfaction and trust are all significantly higher rated than in traditional authoritarian supervision environments. Hypothesis 1a states that in semi-autonomous supervision environments, employee trust in, and satisfaction with, management and employee work performance (here reflected in warehouse service quality and company growth) can be expected to be higher than in traditional supervision environments. Hence, this hypothesis is supported.</p><p>The results confirm that what could have been assumed from the literature is also valid for the UK dairy logistics industry and thus show that, generally speaking, companies which leave more autonomy (i.e., decision power) to their staff perform better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">SEM estimates</head><p>The results from the SEM estimations are provided in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> which depict the standardized path estimates and R² values for the dependent variables.</p><p>Starting with semi-autonomous supervision as an antecedent, one can see that this As to the model fit, all computed indices are better or equal the recommended values (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and thus indicate that the specified model represents in a more than satisfactory way the correlation structure contained in our sample data.</p><p>In the next step, the semi-autonomous supervision construct is swapped by the traditional supervision one (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Given that both constructs are supposed to Hypotheses 2 and 3 state that higher levels of trust and satisfaction respectively will result in higher work performance (i.e., service quality). The SEM estimates show that this is the case in both models and the effects are even stronger in the second model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Hence, both hypotheses are confirmed by the above results.</p><p>Finally, hypothesis 4 asserts that warehouse service quality has a positive impact on company growth. This hypothesis is also positively confirmed by the highly significant, positive and large path coefficients obtained in both SEMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and managerial implications</head><p>This study investigated the impact of alternative supervision environments on FCs' trust and satisfaction, warehouse service quality and company growth.</p><p>The obtained results are vital in the context of the changing environment of workplaces. Companies often emphasize semi-autonomous and team-based approaches, and these practices require certain behavioural characteristics such as trust and satisfaction of functional coordinators. Furthermore, such coordinators are often involved in inter-and extra-organizational (e.g., supply chain) coordination and therefore play a pivotal role within integrated and interdependent warehouses. The findings add to the existing body of literature by providing further empirical evidence for UK dairy warehouses thus confirming the results obtained in other studies which suggested that semi-autonomous supervision creates satisfaction, builds trust of functional coordinators and helps them feel valued <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wall et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cordery et al., 1991)</ref>. In other words, companies which allow their staff to contribute to internal decision-making show better performance outcomes. Hence, it is shown that a "soft" (i.e., semi-autonomously) management approach also works in a "hard" (i.e., fastmoving and temperature-controlled) logistics environment such as UK dairy warehouses.</p><p>The practical management implications arising from this study are twofold. First, participatory management approaches seem to be the future in a world which becomes ever more technology and knowledge intensive. While warehouse operations, in particular in the food industries, are supposed to be a low-skill work activity, there can be no doubt that technological progress will also arrive there and that, as a consequence, skill requirements will become more demanding. With work complexity increasing, decentralised decision-making will become more important and hence semi-autonomous supervision approaches will be expected as the standard. Consequently, future logistics management training and retraining programmes predominantly should be teaching trust and satisfaction-based management concepts. Second, regarding best-practice lessons, our empirical findings suggest that the rather intangible concept of warehouse service quality is not only an end in itself but that it is an effective means for achieving tangible company results. Trust and satisfaction therefore work simultaneously in several different ways and that is a message that managers should take on board.</p><p>Future academic research may investigate in more depth the links between the supervision types and individual logistics operations or activities such as picking, replenishing, packing and receiving goods. For some of these activities, trust and satisfaction-based management concepts may be more important than for others.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
