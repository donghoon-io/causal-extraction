<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Poor quality primary health care is a major issue in China, particularly in blindness prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field.</p><p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the general public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people's intention to use these devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care-related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model's path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed.</p><p>Results: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit. Intention to use (R 2 =0.515) is significantly affected by subjective norms (beta=.408; P&lt;.001), perceived usefulness (beta=.336; P=.03), and resistance bias (beta=-.237; P=.02). Subjective norms and perceived behavior control had an indirect impact on intention to use through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Eye health consciousness had an indirect positive effect on intention to use through perceived usefulness. Trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=-.095; P=.049) on the effect path of perceived usefulness to intention to use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The item, construct, and model indicators indicate reliable interpretation power and help explain the levels of public acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices in China. The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>As part of the fourth industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved massive progress and explosive growth. It is actively applied in health care to perform a wide range of functions such as patient administration and monitoring, clinical decision support, risk prediction, medical error reduction, health care intervention, and productivity improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref>. These potential benefits could contribute greatly to primary care services in China, where the health system is facing great challenges owing to an aging population and an increase in chronic noncommunicable diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. This challenge is especially crucial for eye health management in China, where rates of blindness and vision impairment are the highest in the world and age-related eye diseases such as cataracts, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and juvenile myopia are increasingly common <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Most of these diseases cannot be diagnosed in primary care institutions, so patients seek direct care from ophthalmologists in tertiary hospitals without a referral. Data from 1 survey in Shanghai showed that on average there are only 0.09 ophthalmologists and 0.1 primary eye care (PEC) providers for every 10,000 people <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Of the available ophthalmologists and PEC providers, 82.9% majored in public health, nursing, or internal medicine and have not had specialist ophthalmic training. The situation is even worse in areas of western China, such as Tibet and Inner Mongolia, where the high prevalence of blindness and poor vision has become a serious public health issue. It is vital to establish and maintain an appropriate, effective eye care program in these areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have demonstrated that the performance of image-based AI devices can reach or even surpass that of experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. The number of effective programs and policies to prevent blindness in China has increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, and a number of ophthalmic AI devices are available in clinical scenarios, such as EyeGrader (Center for Eye Research Australia, Melbourne, Australia) for the detection of DR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> and CC-Cruiser (Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China) for congenital cataracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. Stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers are trying to apply these devices in clinical settings such as health check centers, community health centers (CHCs), schools, optical stores, and grassroots hospitals in rural China <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>. As no prior studies have been conducted on the implementation of ophthalmic AI devices in the Chinese context, we have briefly described the results of our formative qualitative studies of 3 CHCs where an ophthalmic AI device was used (unpublished). During the implementation period from April 1 to December 31, 2018, the total number of people who signed the Service of Community Family Physician was 63,034. We found that the low number of patients who chose to receive AI screening (3067 out of 63,034) could reflect public unwillingness to use these devices, though AI screening was not systematically offered by physicians. In interviews with patients, we found that patients were unwilling to undergo this process unless it was provided free of charge, arranged by their work unit, or they could attend the screening in a group with other people. Above all, in recent years, AI health care researchers have focused on technical innovation and clinical results, without considering the human context or ethical challenges that are invariably involved in any complex health care system. Many real-world issues need to be assessed in the implementation phase, most notably the extent to which patients or the public accept AI and the challenges involved in protecting patient privacy and confidential medical information. Thus, understanding the factors that influence public acceptance of (or resistance to) AI devices in the Chinese social and cultural context will help government agencies and health care administrators to devise appropriate intervention strategies to minimize user resistance and its negative effects on health care policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective</head><p>The aims of this study were to develop and test a model investigating the factors that drive the public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in primary care institutions in China. In particular, we aimed to evaluate how subjective norms, resistance bias, and trust contribute to the relationships among these factors in the Chinese cultural context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background and Hypothesis Development</head><p>Many technology adoption models have been proposed to explain user adoption of new technology and to assess the factors that can affect user acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>; examples include the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>, Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19]</ref>, and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>. Many medical information researchers have modified and combined models or added new constructs to carry out studies in domains such as telemedicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>, clinical decision systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25]</ref>, electronic health care records <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>, mobile medical information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>, and personal digital assistants <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Studies of the acceptance of new health care technology have identified influential factors and reliable correlations between those factors and the acceptance or usage of new technology. However, very few studies have been carried out in relation to AI technology. As ophthalmic AI devices are an emerging technology, this study uses the following theories and constructs to evaluate these influential factors and facilitate the application of AI within primary health care institutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology Acceptance Model Theories</head><p>The TAM is the most widely applied model to describe consumer acceptability of information technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. The original model, developed by Fred D Davis in 1989 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>, revealed that perceived usefulness (PU; defined as the perception that using a system leads to enhanced job performance) and perceived ease of use (PEOU; defined as the perception that using a system will be free of effort) were 2 basic determinants of people's acceptance of new technology, which is now commonly evaluated by behavioral intention to use (IU; defined as an individual's motivation or willingness to exert effort to perform the target behavior) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16]</ref>. Then on, many researchers have added, modified, or deleted some variables to synthesize new models to fit their studies, such as TAM 2, TAM 3, and UTAUT. However, many researchers found that both PU and PEOU had a direct effect on IU without a mediation effect of attitude, and attitude was deleted in the following TAMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37]</ref>. In our study, although the purpose was to understand the Chinese public's acceptance of AI devices, as most regions do not have access to these devices, our final dependent variable was IU, rather than actual usage behavior as indicated in the TAMs.</p><p>IU is now commonly used to refer to acceptance and is considered to reliably predict actual use; it is sometimes the only measured outcome of interest in TAM-related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>. Studies have shown that PU and PEOU exert considerable positive influence on IU, and PEOU has an effect on PU <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16]</ref>. We thus proposed the following hypotheses:</p><p>• H1: Perceived usefulness positively affects the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices.</p><p>• H2a: Perceived ease of use positively affects the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>H2b: Perceived ease of use positively affects the public's perception of the usefulness of ophthalmic AI devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory of Planned Behavior</head><p>The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) states that an individual's behavioral intention (similar to IU in TAMs) is determined by attitude, perceived behavioral control (PBC; the extent to which people have control over engaging in the behavior) and subjective norms (SN; defined as perceptions of whether others think one should engage in a behavior) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>. TPB, a more comprehensive version of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>, allows us to examine the influence of personal determinants and social surroundings as well as nonvolitional determinants on IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>. As an extension of the TRA, TPB has been one of the most widely tested models of the factors influencing health-related behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>. SN has a direct effect on IU in the UTAUT and TPB models and an indirect impact on IU through PEOU in many integrated models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43]</ref>. PBC has a positive effect on IU in the TPB and UTAUT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44]</ref>. However, when combined with TAMs, PBC also has an indirect effect through PEOU <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>. Therefore, we proposed the following integrated hypotheses:</p><p>• H3a: Subjective norms positively affect the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices directly.</p><p>• H3b: Subjective norms positively affect the public's perception of the ease of use of ophthalmic AI devices.</p><p>• H4a: Perceived behavioral control positively affects the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices directly.</p><p>• H4b: Perceived behavioral control positively affects the public's perception of the ease of use of ophthalmic AI devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Belief Model and Eye Health Consciousness</head><p>The health belief model (HBM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref> was initially designed to "understand the widespread failure of people to accept preventives or screening tests for the early detection of asymptomatic disease" <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. In later studies, the HBM was used to predict more general health-related behaviors, to understand why individuals did or did not engage in these actions, and to explain and predict the acceptance of health and medical care recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49]</ref>. Health consciousness is defined as the "degree to which health concerns are integrated into a person's daily activities and health-conscious people are aware of and concerned about their wellness, resulting in a better motivation to improve or maintain their health" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>. Health beliefs and concerns have an indirect effect on behavioral intention to use health information technology via the remote mediation effect of perceived health threat (PHT) and PU <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. One study in China examined patients' acceptance of mobile phone health technology for chronic disease management and showed that PHT had a significant positive effect on PU together with a positive effect directly on IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>. In that study, PHT referred to patients' awareness and care of the health condition and its potential consequences. The items in their construct also covered a person's degree of consciousness, beliefs, and awareness of hypertension and health management and asked the participants if they were aware of or concerned about blood pressure and would make efforts to manage hypertension. Therefore, we modified these items to fit the eye care context and defined this construct as eye health consciousness (EHC). We thus proposed the following hypothesis:</p><p>• H5a: Eye health consciousness positively affects the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices directly.</p><p>• H5b: Eye health consciousness positively affects the public's perception of the usefulness of ophthalmic AI devices directly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dual Factor Theory and Status Quo Bias Theory</head><p>The above health behavior theories focus almost exclusively on users' positive (enabling) perceptions in relation to new technology usage and ignore negative (inhibiting) factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50]</ref>. However, in the Dual Factor Theory (DFT), potential users' information technology usage considerations are based on a simultaneous examination of both enabling and inhibiting factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>. Inhibitors discourage information systems (IS) usage when present but do not necessarily favor usage when absent. They are not quite the opposite of enablers but are qualitatively distinct constructs that are independent of but may coexist with enablers <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. Perceived risk (PR) refers to the combination of uncertainty and the seriousness of an outcome in relation to performance, safety, and psychological or social uncertainties, which have a negative influence on IU and are thus barriers to adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53]</ref>. Status Quo Bias (SQB) theory aims to explain people's preference for maintaining their current status or situation and provides a set of useful theoretical explanations for understanding the impact of incumbent system (IS) use as an inhibitor of new IS acceptance. For example, data on the selection of health plans by faculty members reveal that SQB is substantial in important real-world decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>, so several studies have modified their models by supplementing the negative (inhibiting) constructs of SQB theory with user resistance factors that are a type of inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55]</ref>. The 2 main inhibitors are regret avoidance (lessons from experiences that have taught individuals to avoid regrettable consequences) and inertia (an individual's attachment to his or her current situation even if there are better alternatives or incentives to change) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55]</ref>. Resistance to change (RTC) refers to people's attempts to maintain their previous behaviors or habits that are connected to their past experiences when facing change <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>. RTC has been confirmed as a major barrier for electronic health and mobile health adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>. We integrated these factors into 1 inhibitor, resistance bias (RB), defined as people's resistance to use a new technology owing to biases such as regret avoidance, inertia, and RTC. We thus proposed the following hypothesis: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trust as a Moderator in the Chinese Social Context</head><p>Trust is defined as the belief that someone or something is honest, reliable, good, and effective, or the desire to depend on someone or something for security <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. Various studies show that it has a direct or indirect mediation effect on user intention or adoption of new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>. With the increasing proliferation of AI applications in daily life, consideration of trust is essential because it is likely to be a critical factor in the acceptance of consumer products such as home automation, personal robots, and automotive automation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63]</ref>. Moreover, acceptance behaviors for technologies are controlled and moderated by cultural traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65]</ref>.</p><p>In China, patients' trust of physicians is lower than in Western countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref> and has become a serious social problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68]</ref>. Trust in applied AI is an evolving phenomenon, and cognitive compatibility, trialability, and usability are the main factors related to trust in a technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63]</ref>. The public's trust might play a more complicated role in relation to AI devices in China, affecting the factors that influence IU. In the field of health care research, no previous studies have tested trust of the public as a moderator between PU and IU in China. However, Cuadrado identified the moderating effects of trust, showing that trust levels strengthened the negative effect of prosocialness on selfish irrigation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref>. Although irrigation is unrelated to health or AI, it provides evidence and the possibility that trust might have a potential moderating effect in our context. Thus, we proposed a new hypothesis:</p><p>• H8: Trust of physicians moderates the effect of perceived usefulness on the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices.</p><p>Overall, this study proposes and evaluates 12 hypotheses with TAM and TPB as the underpinning theories (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). We added the constructs EHC, PR, and RB from HBM, DFT, and SQB, respectively, to fit our context as these constructs have been validated in the previous studies in China or other parts of Asia. Trust was also added as a moderator to reflect the significance of physician-patient relationships in the Chinese context. The selection of variables from relevant theories and the development of our model are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Sampling</head><p>Potential end users of ophthalmic AI devices in China were recruited if they (1) resided in China (including both urban and rural areas of different provinces and people in all age groups and career types); (2) could read and write in Chinese; (3) had a mobile phone or sufficient internet access; and (4) were not ophthalmic medical staff such as ophthalmologists or nurses.</p><p>On the basis of these criteria, we worked with a Web-based company to recruit participants. We calculated the required number of participants based on a sample size rule of thumb for structural equation modeling of 10 times the number of participants as items <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[70]</ref>. As our survey had 32 items, the required number of participants was more than 320. The company distributed the survey to 925 potential participants from January 20 to 24, 2019. The company used simple random sampling of people who were mobile phone users. Its sample database was our source for randomly sampling, which has more than 2.6 million members. Technicians sent selected participants a direct message over a popular messaging platform (WeChat) with the link to the invitation of our questionnaire during certain times on data collection days. Surveys could be completed by potential participants using WeChat. The survey company's website <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[71]</ref> showed the information about the sample source, which was verified and randomized with different job categories. Every day, more than one million people answered questionnaires on this survey platform.</p><p>The criteria for determining the completeness of a questionnaire included (1) each account responded only once; (2) the response time was longer than 300 seconds to exclude perfunctory respondents; (3) one identifying item randomly selected from an item bank, such as please select the right alphabetical sequence of the following letters: bcdefg, had to be answered correctly; and (4) anyone choosing ophthalmic medical staff in the final identification item was excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement</head><p>The 9 constructs in the hypothesis model were measured by 32 questionnaire items. Each item measured only 1 construct (variable or factor). All items were sourced from the relevant literature related to consumer technology acceptance research, with some changes to fit the ophthalmic AI context (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Items in English were translated into Chinese by 1 researcher and checked by 3 other researchers, and 1 researcher then back translated the items into English to check if the original meaning was retained. All researchers are bilingual fluent in English and Chinese. All items were measured on 7-point Likert scales ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16,</ref><ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Results</head><p>We distributed Web-based surveys to 925 potential participants, and 732 individuals participated in the survey (rate of participation, 79.1%, 732/925). Of these, 474 (rate of completion, 64.8%, 474/732) participants who completed the questionnaire and met the criteria were used for the SEM analysis. The participants' demographic characteristics are represented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Education on Intention to Use</head><p>The results of a single-factor analysis of variance showed that the main effect of education on IU was not significant (F 5,468 =0.316; P&gt;.05) and that each group of education had no significant difference in terms of IU, with means from 4.750 to 5.204, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. As predicted, the results of post hoc comparisons revealed that the effect of education on IU was not significant as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>Maximum likelihood estimation was used to test the factor loadings, measurement reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> presents a summary of the significance tests, item reliability, composite reliability (CR), and convergence validity. The standardized factor loadings of items are between 0.583 and 0.869, with good item reliability. The CR values of the 9 constructs range from 0.673 to 0.841, approaching or exceeding 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[75]</ref> All constructs have acceptable internal consistency. Most constructs have an average variance extracted (AVE) value higher than the threshold of 0.5, which confirms the constructs' convergent validity.  In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>, the square roots of the AVE values (the italic numbers on the diagonal) are higher than the numbers in the off-diagonal direction (correlations between a particular construct in the same column and other constructs in different rows) in the corresponding columns, indicating that the discriminant validity of all constructs meets the criteria of Fornell and Larcker <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76]</ref>.</p></div>

The model fit indicators shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> satisfy most of the criteria and the combination rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[77]</ref>, indicating that the hypothesized model has a good fit to the data.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> shows the graphic description, and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref> shows the numerical results of the path coefficients. IU is significantly affected by SN (beta=.408; P&lt;.001), PU (beta=.336; P=.03), and RB (beta=-.237; P=.02). PEOU (beta=.050; P=.59), EHC (beta=.077; P=.25), PBC (beta=-.066; P=.52) and PR (beta=-.133; P=.01) do not significantly affect IU. PEOU is significantly affected by PBC (beta=.506; P&lt;.001) and SN (beta=.354; P=.002). PU is significantly affected by EHC (beta=.159; P&lt;.001) and PEOU (beta=.279; P&lt;.001). R 2 was calculated to access the validity of the research model. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> show, 51.5% of IU can be explained by PU, SN, PEOU, RB, and PR constructs; 48.8% of PU can be explained by the EHC and PEOU constructs; and 39.6% of PEOU can be explained by the SN and PBC constructs.     e PEOU: perceived ease of use. f SN: subjective norms. g PR: perceived risks h RB: resistance bias.</p><p>i EHC: eye health consciousness. j PBC: perceived behavioral control.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principal Findings</head><p>This study investigated the relationships between factors that affect the adoption of ophthalmic AI devices for eye health management. The research model was developed using relevant theories of technology acceptance, including TAM, TPB, HBM, DFT, SQB, and Trust to fit AI applications in particular health care scenarios in China.</p><p>There are 4 principal findings: (1) SN plays a more important role than PU through both direct and indirect paths; (2) RB of new technology reduces public IU of ophthalmic AI, whereas PR does not have an effect on public IU; (3) EHC and PBC have an indirect positive effect on the IU of AI through the mediators PU and PEOU; and (4) trust moderates the effect of PU on IU. The results are discussed in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Norms Play a Much More Important Role in Artificial Intelligence Adoption Than Perceived Usefulness</head><p>As many studies have discussed, PU, PEOU, SN, and PBC significantly influence IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53]</ref>. However, the function of SN differs among cultures. Some studies have found no significant effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">78]</ref>, whereas others have reported the opposite result <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref>. In our study, SN was the most important predictor of IU, whose direct effect on IU was much stronger than that of PU. It also had a significant positive effect on PU through PEOU. These results indicate that, in China, when individuals encounter new technologies such as ophthalmic AI devices, public perceptions about usefulness, ease of use, and IU are likely to be influenced by their significant others (the items of the SN construct) such as close friends and relatives, colleagues and peers, and superiors or leaders in their work teams. This phenomenon could be linked to a crowd mentality (following the group's actions), collectivist culture (prioritizing a group over the individual), authoritarianism (follow the rule of team leaders), and Confucianism (conforming to prescribed relationship roles and avoiding transgression) in China.</p><p>Furthermore, an interesting finding was that PEOU did not have a significant direct effect on IU, so H2 was not supported. This finding means that the public's IU of ophthalmic AI was not influenced by perceptions of how easy these technologies would be to use. However, the average score of the construct PEOU was high, with a value of 5.739 out of 7. One possible explanation is that because ophthalmic AI devices are newly developed products, the public might perceive them as intelligent and believe that they should be convenient and easy to use. Although the direct effect of PEOU on IU was not significant, PEOU did have a strong effect on PU, confirming most TAM theories. Therefore, if someone whose opinion was important to participants suggested that they try the devices (SN), and the participants then realized the value or usefulness (PU) of the devices, participants' IU would be high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resistance Bias Reduces Public Intention to Use Ophthalmic Artificial Intelligence Whereas Perceived Risks Do Not Have an Effect on It</head><p>In most research on the Dual Factor Theory, PR negatively affected the public's IU. However, in our ophthalmic AI case, PR does not affect public's IU. This finding is in line with the Chinese context where people do not perceive risk of blindness as an acute threat and owing to the fact that the general population of China does not strongly prioritize privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[79]</ref>. The low mean score of the 6 items of the PR construct (3.802 out of 7) reflects the public's lack of awareness of health risks and protection of health information and privacy. These results were also confirmed by our qualitative study that people are accustomed to providing key personal information when registering on an app or receiving nuisance calls.</p><p>We also integrated a new construct, RB, and verified its reliability and validity in our model, improving our understanding of negative factors involved in health care technology acceptance. Our results confirmed the SQB theory. People might reject ophthalmic AI devices owing to unfamiliarity, regret avoidance, or past experiences with new technology products. This resistance reflects many people's natural preference to continue with traditional approaches to health management. This finding matches observations about Chinese patients' acceptance of mobile phone health technology and mobile health services for chronic disease management that these inhibitors had a negative effect on behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye Health Consciousness and Perceived Behavioral Control Have an Indirect Positive Effect Via the Mediators Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use</head><p>Previous studies of health behavior based on the theories of HBM have found that PHT (similar to EHC) has both direct and indirect effects on IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36]</ref>. In our study, EHC had a significant positive influence on PU and an indirect influence on IU via PU. However, EHC had no significant direct effect on IU, which contrasts with the findings of Dou about Chinese patients' acceptance of mobile phone health technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref> but is consistent with the work of Kim about consumers' health behavior IU of health information technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. Our findings could indicate that although people are conscious about their eye health and perceive health threats even without eye screening, they will assess the usefulness or function of new AI devices before switching from traditional face-to-face eye examination by ophthalmologists.</p><p>Many studies have found that perceived behavioral control has a significant direct and indirect influence on IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57]</ref>. We found that it had no significant impact on IU, consistent with the meta-analysis of factors influencing mobile health service adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>, but in contrast with research on health professionals' adoption of health clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref> and physicians' acceptance of electronic medical record exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>. Our findings could result from the different roles of general public and medical staff, as most health-related procedures in previous studies were conducted by medical staff, whose behavioral controllability of new developed devices was a more important concern during the manipulation process. However, we found that PBC had an indirect effect on IU through PEOU and PU. This indicates that unlike other health-related technologies studied, as emerging products, ophthalmic AI devices need to be convenient and useful to ensure the perception of behavioral controllability. The high average score of PBC items (5.005 out of 7) also shows that if the public perceived these devices as easy to use and useful, automanipulation of screening devices and self-management of eye screening could be achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderation Effect of Trust</head><p>Previous studies have treated trust as a variable that affects IU directly or indirectly <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52]</ref>. Few studies have discussed whether it could be a moderator. In China, in the context of unbalanced medical resource distribution and distrust between doctors and patients, this construct could play a more complicated role <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">80]</ref>. Our finding confirmed that this construct is a moderator, as trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=-.095; P=.049) on the path from PU to IU. The public's trust in the emerging technology and medical staff negatively moderated the influence of PU on IU. Participants with high trust in AI might have high expectations for AI in health care and thus might require greater PU before they would be willing to try the AI devices. Alternatively, participants with low trust in AI might have low expectations and require less PU before trying to use them. In light of the generally distrustful relationship between the public and medical staff in China, stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers should avoid making misleading or over-exaggerated claims in the promotion of AI health care products.</p><p>As the beta value was negative, the more the public trust AI devices, the lower the effect of PU on IU. In other words, if we improve people's beliefs and confidence about AI products, they will use these devices even if these devices are not as useful as they could be. In our study, the average score for the 3 trust items was 4.976 out of 7. Together with the low factor loading of PU on IU, in the Chinese context, the influence of PU was small. We interpreted this effect to be moderated by trust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison With Prior Work and Strengths of This Study</head><p>This study contributes to the AI health care literature in several ways: 1. This study was the first empirical study to examine the positive and negative factors that influence public acceptance of emerging AI devices in real clinical scenarios in China. As the model fit and R 2 values are high, our model can predict the Chinese public's IU of such AI devices. 2. We integrated 1 inhibitor of RB to modify the SQB theory to fit Chinese people's thinking style and language customs, and this showed both good convergence and discriminant validity. 3. We introduced trust as a moderator in the Chinese social context to reflect the health care context, and the results confirmed that trust had a moderation effect on the path from PU to IU. 4. SN has the greatest effect on the IU of AI devices. This finding differs from most studies of new health care technology acceptance and could reflect the culture, regulations, or rules in the Chinese social context. 5. PR does not significantly affect public's IU as participants were not aware of the protection of personal privacy and health information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Practice</head><p>Researchers are only just beginning to assess how we might improve medicine using neural networks, and we will not know how well AI can predict key outcomes in health care settings without "robust validation in prospective, real-world clinical environments, with rigorous statistical methodology and analysis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. As our data show, PU does not play as important a role as expected, and the following strategies could be a cost-effective way to improve public acceptance of AI devices and promote AI products in the era of narrow AI:</p><p>1. Enhance public trust in AI, avoiding misleading or exaggerated claims that might affect public perceptions of the function of AI in health care. 2. Expand the influence of SN through health communication campaigns in communities and workplaces, focusing on significant others in people's social circles such as superiors, public opinion leaders, and close friends. 3. Educate the public's knowledge and consciousness of the accuracy, effectiveness, safety, and privacy of AI devices and expedite legislation on AI to protect human rights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Our nationwide study included people of all ages, from students to elders, which indicated good external validity. It was more cost-effective to recruit participants nationally from the internet rather than by traditional means, and this method was more suitable in the AI context because it provided real-time reports and feedback for target users. However, as the sample was collected through mobile devices or websites, the proportion of participants aged above 50 years was relatively low. This age distribution could reflect the fact that older people are less likely to use mobile devices owing to poor vision or motor abilities or RTC <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>. If automated or self-management procedures with AI products require good mobile or digital skills, older people might not be appropriate target users. In future studies, we might introduce age as a moderator to evaluate its interference effect. When designing or promoting an AI device, we should consider its practical utility for older generations, as they are the main screening population in primary care projects. Moreover, medical staff such as hospital leaders, physicians, and nurses would be the main users of these devices, so their views on AI are very important. We will conduct further research on their intention to adopt and manipulate ophthalmic AI devices in real clinical scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Our study used the SEM method to explore the complex relationships between factors that influence public acceptance and IU of ophthalmic AI devices, as applied to real clinical scenarios in China. Positive factors such as SN played a more important and complex role than predicted, alongside people's EHC and PBC, whereas the inhibiting factor, RB, had a direct negative effect on adoption of AI devices. The new integrated inhibitor of RB fits Chinese people's thinking style and language customs and showed both good convergence and discriminant validity. PR does not significantly affect public's IU as they were not aware of the protection of personal privacy and health information. Furthermore, we found that trust had a moderation effect on the path from PU to IU. This integrated model, incorporating Chinese cultural and social contexts, demonstrated a good fit and explanatory power with high R 2 and could be used to explore other AI health care areas such as chronic disease screening and monitoring, especially for diabetes, hypertension, and cancer management.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•H6:</head><label></label><figDesc>Perceived risk negatively affects the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices.• H7: Resistance bias negatively affects the public's intention to use ophthalmic AI devices.</figDesc></figure>
