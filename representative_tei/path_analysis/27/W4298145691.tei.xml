Based on the results of the analysis in Tables <ref type="table">2</ref> and<ref type="table">3</ref>, this study found a correlation between variables which can be explained as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Effect of Professional Competence on Teacher Work Productivity</head><p>The direct effect of professional competence on the productivity of Elementary School or Sekolah Dasar Negeri (SDN) teachers in Lampihong is indicated by the Standardized Coefficients Beta value of 0.578 with a significance value of 0.000 &lt;0.05, so Ho is rejected. Thus, there is a direct effect of professional competence on the work productivity of SDN Teachers in Lampihong. Professional competency has a direct impact on the output of SDN Teachers in Lampihong. A teacher should be more productive and produce more, the greater their professional competency. The importance of instructors comprehending the content of instructional materials and their capacity to oversee the learning process is emphasized by their professional competence. The effectiveness of teaching will increase if instructors can develop these skills. Additionally, the instructor will get accustomed to taking complete responsibility for everything in order to always improve their instruction. Effective educators will take several steps to enhance their students' learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hajidah et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Professional educators should be highly productive and able to adapt to changes in their environment. When it comes to their duties as educators, teachers' productivity may be judged by the caliber of their work in the classroom, their involvement in volunteer work and research, and their attempts to develop their expertise and wisdom via education and training. A teacher should be more productive and produce more, the greater their professional competency.</p><p>The productivity of teachers can be increased by a variety of supportive variables. One factor that has a significant impact on efforts to raise productivity at work is the teachers' level of professionalism. As stated by <ref type="bibr">Susanto (2016:111)</ref>, one of the characteristics of a productive teacher can be seen from the technical ability and professional competence of the teacher. Through continuous competency improvement, it is expected that teacher work performance will improve. Teachers can work more efficiently and effectively so that it helps in producing a higher level of productivity than before. This is in line with research study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darsana et al., (2014)</ref> who stated that there is a positive and significant contribution between teacher competence and teacher work productivity with a contribution of 30.91% and an effective contribution of 13.032%. The results of this study are also relevant to research conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rayantini, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rudiansyah et al., 2022)</ref> stating that there is a significant and positive correlation between professional competence and teacher work productivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Effect of Communication on Teacher Work Productivity</head><p>The direct effect of communication on the work productivity of SDN teachers in Lampihong is shown by the Standardized Coefficients Beta value of 0.417 with a significance value of 0.000 &lt;0.05, then Ho2 is rejected. Thus, there is a direct effect of communication on the work productivity of elementary school teachers in Lampihong. Teacher communication is an indicator of teacher work productivity in an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hajidah et al., 2022)</ref>. Work productivity assessment is needed to find out how productive teachers can work together. This is in line with what was stated by Susanto (2016) that the form of teacher work productivity can be in the form of the best service that is seen through the teacher's communication. Teachers who have high communication are considered able to achieve the desired goals, so they are expected to be more productive and develop. In this case, good teacher communication is thought to have an effect on increasing teacher work productivity. The results of this study support previous research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hidayat &amp; Hasanah, 2016</ref>) that communication affects work productivity. Likewise (Pudjiastuti SMP &amp; Regency, 2016) which states that communication is related to teacher work productivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Effect of Discipline on Work Productivity</head><p>The direct effect of work discipline on the work productivity of SDN Teachers in Lampihong which is indicated by the Standardized Coefficients Beta value of 0.808 with a significance value of 0.000 &lt;0.05, then Ho3 is rejected. Therefore, there is a direct effect of work discipline on the work productivity of SDN Teachers in Lampihong. Discipline is the awareness and willingness of individuals to comply with all social rules and norms that are implemented in an institution or agency <ref type="bibr">(Hasibuan, 2019)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The Effect of Professional Competence on Discipline</head><p>The direct effect of professional competence on the work discipline of SDN Teachers in Lampihong which is shown by the Standardized Coefficients Beta value of 0.194 with a significance value of 0.000 &lt;0.05, then Ho4 is rejected. So, there is a direct effect of Professional Competence on the Work Discipline of SDN Teachers in Lampihong. Professional competence possessed by teachers is a combination of abilities, knowledge, skills, and attitudes that underlie the characteristics of teachers to perform in carrying out their duties or work in order to achieve the desired quality standards. These competencies are still in the form of abilities or potentials that are still in the teacher. The competencies possessed by the teacher are then realized in the form of performance actions. Teachers must be disciplined in realizing these performances, so that they are smooth and orderly in carrying out their duties so that educational goals can be achieved optimally. As stated by Suprihatiningrum (2016), professional teachers have effective discipline skills. The professional attitude of the teacher makes him accustomed to carrying out tasks with discipline. Therefore, the professional competence of teachers is thought to have an effect on changes in teacher behavior in carrying out their responsibilities in a disciplined manner.</p><p>In addition, indicators of professional competence such as time devoted to teacher professional activities also seem to refer to time management and teacher discipline in carrying out their professional responsibilities. Teachers who master professional competencies well certainly have a work discipline attitude that encourages the consistency of their competencies to continue to grow. Without discipline, a professional will have difficulty carrying out his duties with maximum results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Mardianti et al., 2020)</ref>. It can be said that if the professional competence of the teacher is good, then the work discipline of the teacher is also good. This is what makes researchers assume that professional competence has a direct one-way correlation to teacher work discipline.</p><p>The results of this study are also relevant to research conducted (Dewi &amp; Khotimah, 2020) stated that there is a positive and strong effect between professional competence on teacher work discipline. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The Effect of Communication on Discipline</head><p>The direct effect of communication on the work discipline of SDN Teachers in Lampihong is shown by the Standardized Coefficients Beta value of 0.628 with a significance value of 0.000 &lt;0.05, then Ho5 is rejected. Hence, there is a direct effect of communication on the work discipline of SDN teachers in Lampihong. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mangkunegara (2019)</ref> states that good discipline is formed from good communication from someone. Communication supports motivation by clarifying workers what needs to be done or how well they are doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atambo &amp; Momanyi, 2016)</ref>. When communication stops, company activities and individual activities will not be coordinated within an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Shonubi &amp; Akintaro, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, communication is very important for employees in the process of delivering information (messages &amp; ideas) from one party to another. Communication is the process of selecting and sending symbols in such a way as to help listeners generate responses from thoughts similar to those intended by the communicator. Research from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Suaip &amp; Astuti (2015)</ref> states that communication has a significant effect on employee work discipline. Dessy &amp; Wibawa (2015) also showed that communication simultaneously and partially affects employee discipline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. The Indirect Effect of Professional Competence on Work Productivity Through Work Discipline</head><p>The indirect effect of professional competence on work productivity through the work discipline of SDN Teachers in Lampihong refers to the Sobel calculation. It is known that the Sobel Test Statistic value has an indirect effect on the Professional Competence variable (X1) on Work Productivity (Y) through Work Discipline (Z). There are 2.707 elementary school teachers in Lampihong. The Sobel Test Statistic value is greater than t-table 1.960, then Ho6 is rejected. Therefore, the professional competence indirectly has a significant effect on the variable of work productivity through the work discipline of SDN Teachers in Lampihong.</p><p>Efforts to achieve high work productivity require mature professional skills and abilities to be able to produce quality output. This is certainly not easy, given the need for consistent teacher behavior to continuously improve their work. Therefore, it is necessary to have other factors that help so that the abilities possessed by teachers are not only limited to abilities. Good work discipline will have an impact on the work productivity of teachers in carrying out their duties so that it will lead to the results of their work. Susanto (2016) mentions that the factors that effect the level of teacher work productivity are the work ethic, namely a life attitude that is willing to work hard, enthusiastic and able to think ahead for the future, as well as develop a disciplined life attitude towards time and oneself, discipline towards their duties and responsibilities, and have the motivation and orientation to achieve a better future. Teachers need to develop work discipline so that their skills can still develop properly. Work discipline helps teachers focus on achieving the goals set. Through the development of work discipline by the principal to the teacher, it can contribute to improving the implementation of a more optimal education so that work productivity also increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Indirect Effect of Professional Competence on Work Productivity Through Work Discipline</head><p>The indirect effect of communication on work productivity through the work discipline of elementary school teachers in Lampihong. Referring to the Sobel calculation above, it is known that the Sobel Test Statistic value has an indirect effect on the communication variable (X2) on work productivity (Y) through work discipline (Z). There are 6.584 elementary school teachers in Lampihong. The Sobel Test Statistic value is greater than t-table 1.960, then Ho is rejected. Thus, the Communication variable (X2) indirectly has a significant effect on the Work Productivity variable (Y) through the Work Discipline variable (Z) for SDN Teachers in Lampihong.</p><p>Communication on work productivity through the work discipline of SDN Teachers in Lampihong fosters teachers to be able to work to make a positive contribution to work institutions, work only in accordance with the tasks given, try to make improvements to improve self-quality, and feel enough with what have been done in helping each other to complete the work can work productivity. Discipline is the awareness and willingness of individuals to comply with all social rules and norms that are implemented in an institution or agency (Hasibuan, 2019). Furthermore, Sulistiyani stated that work discipline can encourage one's work productivity because work discipline is an important suggestion to realize one's work productivity. Meanwhile Anoraga (2019) says that a person's work productivity can be carried out according to the goals of the institution. It requires perfect work discipline. Discipline must be enforced both against individuals and groups and to all employees who have been involved or become members of certain institutions or institutions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mangkunegara (2019)</ref> states that good discipline is formed from good communication from someone. Communication supports motivation by clarifying workers what needs to be done or how well they are doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atambo &amp; Momanyi, 2016)</ref>. When communication stops, company activities and individual activities will not be coordinated within an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Shonubi &amp; Akintaro, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, communication is very important for employees in the process of delivering information (messages &amp; ideas) from one party to another. Raymond (2010) states that communication is the process of selecting and sending symbols in such a way as to help listeners generate responses from thoughts similar to those intended by the communicator. Research study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Suaip &amp; Astuti (2015)</ref> showed that communication has a significant effect on employee work discipline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dessy &amp; Wibawa (2015)</ref> state that communication simultaneously and partially affects employee discipline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>There are direct and indirect influences between professional competence, communication, discipline and work productivity. Teachers should increase work productivity, especially on sub-variables.
