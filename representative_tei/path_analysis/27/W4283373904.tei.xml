<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Elementary school is one of the educational institutions and one of the driving forces behind national growth. Schools, like educational institutions, must define strategic goals that are part or substance of the national education goals. Educators, education personnel, infrastructure, school atmosphere, curriculum, and other resources are all part of the school's resources. Educational resources are crucial, but human resources (educators and education staff) are even more so, because instructors and school administration staff are the driving force behind the school system. According to Priansa (2014), education, especially in schools, is the main means in developing human resources and forming the character of a nation. Therefore, the dignity of a nation will be determined by the quality of education in that nation.</p><p>The development of the potential of students as mandated by law provides a perspective to the world of education about the importance of the educational process towards the formation of student achievement. This is to provide a definite guarantee of student achievement or student learning achievement. According to Arifin (2017), learning achievement has several functions namely: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> As an indicator of the quality and quantity of knowledge that has been mastered by students; (2) As a symbol of satisfying curiosity; (3) As information material in educational innovation. According to Shah (2011:145), the factors that influence student learning are divided into three types, namely: (1) internal factors, which include the physical and spiritual conditions of students; (2) external factors which are environmental conditions around students, namely social environmental factors and non-social environmental factors; (3) the learning approach factor which is a type of student learning effort which includes the strategies and methods used by students to carry out activities to study the subject matter. Especially in relation to the school's social environment, in schools there are principals and teachers who are known as holders of educational leadership, which are the most dominant components in improving school achievement and student learning achievement. In other words, the principal with his leadership function is responsible for the success of school achievement and student achievement. According to Misila (2013) and Pina, Cabral, &amp; Alves (2015), one of the tasks of instructional leadership is to take an active role in the instructional process, to guide teachers during their functioning in the teaching process, and to maintain the process to achieve better student achievement. Thus, in order to achieve increased school achievement and student learning achievement, of course, there will be a lot of dependence on the principal's instructional leadership.</p><p>In addition to learning leadership that affects student learning achievement is the work commitment of the teacher or it can also be called the teacher's teaching commitment. Work commitment is the perception of organizational members (individually and in groups) and those who are in constant contact with the organization about what is or is happening in the organization's internal environment on a regular basis, which affects organizational attitudes and behavior and the performance of organizational members who then find organizational performance. Firestone and Rossenblum, Werang &amp; Agung (2017) interpret teacher work commitment as a teacher's commitment to students, a teacher's commitment to the teaching profession and a teacher's commitment to the school where he teaches. Another factor that affects student achievement is teacher work discipline, because high work discipline affects the learning process which can ultimately improve student achievement. Adib and Santoso (2016) concluded that the purpose of each learning is learning achievement. Improved learning achievement can be improved with the discipline of the teacher's work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>This research study aims to describe the direct and indirect correlation between the variables. Direct correlation between instructional leadership and student learning achievement, instructional leadership and work commitment, instructional leadership and work discipline, teacher work commitment and student learning achievement, and teacher work discipline and student learning achievement, indirect correlation between instructional leadership and student achievement through work commitment, and the indirect correlation between instructional leadership and student achievement through work discipline.</p><p>The population of this study was 95 people with a sample of 77 people. Sampling using proportional random sampling. The number of samples was determined based on the Sloven formula. Data were collected through a questionnaire using a Likert scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree which had been tested for validity and reliability by choosing one of the five answers provided according to the actual situation. The answers are then analyzed through part analysis. The rejection and acceptance of the hypothesis were based on a significance level of 0.05. The media used to calculate the analysis was with the help of the SPSS 26 application. A total of four questionnaires were used in this study, namely the principal's instructional leadership questionnaire (school vision-mission, instructional programs, learning climate), work commitment (affective, sustainable and normative). , work discipline (official assignments, time, work atmosphere, community service, behavior) and student learning achievement (knowledge, attitudes and skills). This study uses quantitative research which is intended to determine the effect of the principal's instructional leadership, work commitment and work discipline on student achievement in SDN in Haur Gading District. The influence of the principal's instructional leadership variable (X), work commitment variable (Z1), work discipline variable (Z2) student achievement variable (Y). The data collected to see the direct and indirect correlation, by first doing the normality test, linearity test and homogeneity test. Furthermore, the research hypothesis in this study uses path analysis, as follows:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Correlation between instructional leadership on student achievement</head><p>The results of this study indicate that there is a direct correlation between the principal's instructional leadership on student achievement of 0.899. This indicates that in order to improve learning achievement, it can be done by improving the quality of the principal's instructional leadership.</p><p>Leadership is a person's ability to influence others to work together according to a plan to achieve predetermined goals. The principal has a role that can manage all existing school resources. Learning leadership is a competency possessed by school principals by focusing on developing a satisfactory work environment for teachers and ultimately being able to develop learning conditions that allow student learning outcomes to increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Astuti, 2011)</ref>. Instructional leadership is a part of success in student learning. Through the proper instructions of the principal and with a good system, achievement will be achieved easily. On the other hand, if the principal's leadership does not dominate the school, the student's learning achievement will also decrease. In conclusion, the principal's instructional leadership becomes a reference as well as student progress and achievement. The results of this study strengthen and support research studies by Sumarno; Herawan (2014), <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Naim (2017)</ref> </p></div>

This shows the results that the principal's instructional leadership has a positive and significant direct correlation with teacher work commitment. This means that if the principal's instructional leadership is getting better, the better the work commitment of the teacher will be.</p><p>According to Susanto (2016) the principal as a learning leader is leadership that emphasizes components related to learning, including the curriculum, learning process, assessment, teacher development, excellent service in learning and building learning communities in schools. In short, according to Usman (2014) instructional ADDIN CSL_CITATION {"citationItems":[{"id":"ITEM-1","itemData":{"ISBN":"9783540773405","ISSN":"1098-6596","PMID":"25246403","abstract":"The goals and role of competition law have been a recurrent theme underlying the previous chapters, which have mostly emphasised their importance attributed in the EU as a mechanism to integrate European markets, and create or preserve the EU single market.","author":[{"droppingparticle":"","family":"Usman","given":"Husaini","non-dropping-particle":"","parse-names":false,"suffix":""}],"containertitle":"Analysis of Micro-Earthquakes in the San Gabriel Mountains Foothills Region and the Greater Pomona Area As Recorded By a Temporary Seismic Deployment","id":"ITEM-1","issue":"hal 140","issued":{"dateparts":[["2014"]]},"page":"43","title":"Model Kepemimpinan Instruksional Kepala Sekolah","type":"articlejournal","volume":"1"},"uris":["<ref type="url" target="http://www.mendeley.com/documents/?uuid=9db8f411-2e4f-46df-be98-">http://www.mendeley.com/documents/?uuid=9db8f411-2e4f-46df-be98-</ref>5dbfd84b45a4"]}],"mendeley":{"formattedCitation":"(Usman, 2014)","plainTextFormattedCitation":"(Usman, 2014)","previouslyFormattedCitation":"(Usman, 2014)"},"properties":{"noteIndex":0},"schema":"<ref type="url" target="https://github.com/citation-">https://github.com/citation-</ref>style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}leadership is leadership that focuses on the process and student learning outcomes through professional teacher empowerment.</p><p>According to Herawan (2016) , teacher commitment is a key factor that affects the teaching and learning process. This implies that the teacher as an individual has involvement with the school, with the subject matter, learning objectives, and the teacher's intention to maintain organizational membership, all of which will affect the learning process he does. A teacher who is committed to his duties has at least several attitudes, including: his inner attitude exudes the figure of a teacher, ready wherever he is, and responsive to change. With the existing commitment, always trying to improve his competence as a teacher. Therefore, organizational personnel must have a high commitment so that they are able to devote their energy to providing the best service in accordance with their main duties and functions so that the sustainability and success of the organization (education) can be realized.</p><p>The results of this study strengthen and support research studies by Muliani; Sumardi; Munir (2015) , Verawati (2016), Hadiyanto and Saraswati (2016), Sukmawati's grandson; Endang Herawan (2016) , Sukowati, Afrizal and Wargianto (2018) and Herry, Lian and Fitriani (2020).</p></div>

This shows the results that the principal's instructional leadership has a positive and significant direct correlation with teacher work discipline in carrying out official duties as well as attitudes and behavior.</p><p>The leader in the school organization, the principal plays an important role in leading, regulating, directing and fostering all activities related to the school organization. Aspects of progress and setbacks in a learning process are also the responsibility of the principal according to Permendikbud number 6 of 2018 in managerial functions, planning, supervision, support functions and social functions. Of the several functions of the principal, it is very decisive in bringing the school he leads through the principal's efforts in forming a team for the advancement of the quality of education in schools, this is in accordance with the opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sallis, 2012)</ref> .</p><p>One of the impacts of instructional leadership is characterized by increasing the discipline of educators in schools. Discipline is an attitude of respect and obedience to the applicable regulations, both written and unwritten and being able to implement them. This attitude is formed by itself if there is a contribution of good instructional leadership. Thus the goal</p><p>The results of this study strengthen and support research Supriadi (2018), Lomu and Widodo (2018), Sukowati, Afrizal and Wargianto (2018) , Arasyiah (2020) , Ilyas (2021) and Permadani (2021).</p></div>

This shows that the teacher's work commitment has a positive and significant direct correlation with the learning achievement of State Elementary School students in Haur Gading District, Hulu Sungai Utara Regency. This means that the higher the work discipline of the teacher, the better the student's learning achievement.</p><p>Porter in Ridho (2019) defines commitment as an attitude, according to him people who have commitment are people who are willing to involve themselves in the organization. By being involved in the organization will automatically contribute everything that is in him for the benefit of the organization with the aim of becoming more advanced.</p><p>Glickman in Rosalina (2015) states that commitment is a person's willingness to sacrifice his time and energy relatively more than what has been set on him. In this study, the commitment in question is the responsibility of a teacher both to his work, laws and regulations, professional organizations, colleagues, students, workplaces, and leaders in the organization where the teacher works. This is in line with Juaini's research (2019) The Effect of Principal's Leadership Style, Teacher Work Commitment and Teacher Work Enthusiasm on Learning Achievement of Middle School Students in Banjarbaru City. The results showed that the work commitment of teachers had a very strong attachment in improving the learning achievement of junior high school students in the city of Banjarbaru.</p><p>The results of this study strengthen and support research <ref type="bibr">(Herawan, 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rosdiana, 2016)</ref>, (Hadiyanto and Saraswati, 2016), (Sukmawati &amp; Herawan, 2016) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sari, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>

This shows the results that teacher work discipline has a positive and significant direct correlation with student achievement. This means that the higher the perceived work discipline, the better the student's learning achievement and conversely the lower the perceived work discipline, the lower the achievement.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hasibuan (2015)</ref>, discipline is the sixth most important operative function of human resource management because the better the employee discipline, the higher the work performance that can be achieved. Without good employee discipline, it is difficult for the organization to achieve optimal results. Through discipline will reflect strength, because usually someone who succeeds in his work is those who have high discipline. In order to realize the company's goals, the first thing that the company must build and enforce is the discipline of its employees, as well as in the education environment.</p><p>The importance of the role of discipline is also stated by Musanef (2012:116) who argues that: Discipline is no less important than other principles, meaning that the discipline of every employee always affects work performance. Therefore, in every organization, it is necessary to emphasize the discipline of its employees. Through high discipline, employee work productivity can basically be increased.</p><p>The results of this study strengthen and support research <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Supriadi, 2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Sukowati, Afrizal and Wargianto, 2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lomu and Widodo, 2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Nurjannah;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">and Sumiyati, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
