<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Education is a basic need for human life. In addition, education is also a process to improve human resources. Human resources are a determinant of the quality of a nation and state. In other words, the progress of a nation or country will be determined by the quality of human resources. The quality of human resources will be determined by the quality of educators in a nation or country. The development of Indonesia 2020-2024 aims to form quality and competitive human resources so that they are expected to be able to compete with other nations. In this case, the strategic steps taken by the government include realizing relevant and highquality education (Directorate General of Vocational Education, 2020: 3). Schools are formal institutions that have a central role in the educational process. Because generally, most of the effective and productive time of human students is spent at school. Therefore, schools should not be handled haphazardly. In other words, educational goals to national development goals will be achieved optimal if schools are managed seriously and professionally. The teacher is an element of education that is very dominant in improving the quality of the learning process in schools. In line with this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rusman (2014)</ref> argues that the teacher is a very dominant determining factor in education because a teacher plays a crucial role in the learning process and is the core of the overall educational process in schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Performance</head><p>Teacher performance is closely related to what the teacher does in the classroom and how it affects students' learning activities. <ref type="bibr">Rachmawati (2013:16)</ref> defines teacher performance as the ability shown by the teacher in carrying out his duties or work. Teachers have the main task of educating, teaching, directing, guiding, assessing, training, and evaluating students. In addition, a teacher also must make lesson plans. As to Priansa (2018:78), a teacher's main task is planning, carrying out learning, assessing learning outcomes, and guiding and training students. The educational institution's progress and decline are strongly influenced by the performance of the individual teachers who serve in the institution. Likewise, the quality of education cannot be separated from the role of personal teacher performance in improving the quality of education. The role of personal teacher performance is very much needed in advancing the quality of education. Without good performance, it is impossible to achieve the goal of improving the quality of education. Thus, teachers' individual performance is essential and decisive in education <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Winarto, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mahmudi (2013: 20)</ref> states that performance is a multidimensional construct that includes many factors that influence it, namely: (1) personal/individual factors, including knowledge, skills, abilities, self-confidence, motivation, and commitment; (2) leadership factors, including quality in providing encouragement, enthusiasm, direction and support provided by the team leader; (3) team factors, including the quality of support and enthusiasm given by colleagues in a team, trust in fellow team members, cohesiveness and closeness of team members; (4) system factors, including work systems, work facilities or infrastructure provided by the organization, organizational processes, and culture/culture within the organization; and (5) contextual (situational) factors, including pressures and changes in the internal and external environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kapala School's Transformational Leadership</head><p>The leadership position in the world of education is very strategic to create changes in various educational organizations, both in schools and in madrasas. For this reason, the process of creating quality schools will completely depend on the school leadership figure, namely the principal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mondiani (2012)</ref> states that transformational leadership can inspire and motivate followers (subordinates) to achieve more significant results than originally planned and for internal rewards. Transformational leadership is an option for school principals to lead and develop quality schools. Burns <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Suriansyah, 2012)</ref> suggests that transformational leadership emphasizes the need for a leader to support his subordinates in carrying out more responsibilities than expected.</p><p>School Culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zamroni (2011)</ref> suggests that school culture is a pattern of basic assumptions, values, beliefs, and habits shared by all school members, believed and have been proven to be used to deal with various problems in adapting to a new environment and carrying out internal integration. The values and assumptions pattern can be taught to members and new generations to have the correct view of how they should understand, think, feel and act in dealing with various existing situations and environments. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Muhaimin (2011)</ref> argues that school culture is built from the result of a meeting between the values held by the principal as a leader and the values held by teachers and employees in the school. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mathis (2011)</ref> suggests that organizational commitment is the degree to which employees believe and accept the organisation's goals and will stay or will not leave the organization. According to Siahaan (2020), commitment will improve performance and encourage individuals to be actively involved in various essential issues in the organization. The desire to develop personal competencies that can make a meaningful contribution to the organization will arise if the individual has a strong commitment. With a strong commitment to the teacher's personality, the teacher's performance will increase, and the teacher's desire to remain in school becomes stronger. The achievement of high commitment by employees cannot be separated from the intervention of a leader. Juniarti (2020) said that when a principal has characteristics that can influence teachers and can be used as role models, it will impact teacher commitment at the school.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>This study describes the direct and indirect effects of a principal's transformational leadership on school culture; the principal's transformational leadership towards organizational commitment; the principal's transformational leadership on teacher performance; school culture on teacher performance; organizational commitment to teacher performance, principal transformational leadership on teacher performance through school culture; the principal's transformational leadership on teacher performance through organizational commitment.

Teacher performance using PKG. The questionnaire was prepared using a Likert scale tested for validity and reliability. The data collected were analyzed using path analysis to see the direct or indirect effect between variables by first conducting the analysis requirements test, namely the normality and linearity tests. In accordance with the conceptual influence model between variables, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>   Under the conceptual model, the analysis uses path analysis to answer seven research hypotheses, namely: H 1: there is an influence of principal transformational leadership on school culture; H 2: there is an effect of the principal's transformational leadership on organizational commitment; H3: there is an effect of the principal's transformational leadership on teacher performance; H 4: there is an influence of school culture on teacher performance; H 5: there is an effect of organizational commitment on teacher performance; H 6: there is an influence of the principal's transformational leadership on teacher performance through school culture; and H 7: there is an effect of the principal's transformational leadership on teacher performance through organizational commitment.</p></div>
