<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the factors affecting the health literacy levels of individuals on the factors affecting their rational drug use levels using path analysis and to reveal the path coefficients according to the degree of importance. The study population of the research consisted of patients and their relatives who received health services from pharmacies operating in Sakarya city centres. A populationbased cross-sectional research design was applied. Frequency analysis, explanatory factor analysis and path analysis techniques were applied to the research data. IBM SPSS 23 V and AMOS package programs were used in the analysis of the data. Functional health literacy levels of individuals has affected their; correct drug use, effective drug use and safe drug use levels in a statistically significantly and positive manner. In addition, it has been determined that the communicative health literacy levels of individuals affected their; correct drug use, effective drug use and safe drug use levels in a statistically significant and negative way. In this research, it is recommended to provide education and information programs to increase the health literacy level of the society and to raise awareness about the correct rational use of drugs.</p></div>

Education not only makes a successful contribution to the national economy and democracy but it is also considered as a key determinant of health <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Yen &amp; Moss, 1999)</ref>. The increasing elderly population and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases associated with lifestyle require new actions to enable people to take better care of their health and strengthen them. The main goal is to support their well-being and self-management by providing training and involving patients in the collective decision-making process. This requires a sufficient level of health literacy for both patients and those serving people with chronic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmad, Ellins Krelle &amp; Lawrie, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kayser, Karnoe, Duminski, Somekh &amp; Vera-Muñoz, 2019)</ref>. Limited health literacy levels are found in major population minorities and this fact is associated with poor self-care, poor general health status, and early death <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker et al., 2007)</ref>. A higher level of health literacy is associated with several positive outcomes, such as advanced disease management <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Thai &amp; George, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Health literacy is defined as the capacity of people to acquire, interpret and understand the health information and services which are necessary to make correct decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berkman, Davis &amp; McCormarck, 2010)</ref>. Health literacy has many dimensions, including the meaning of reading, understanding and communicating important medical and health information at different stages of life. Health literacy is at the heart of many health system priorities, including quality, cost control, safety and patient participation in health care decisions <ref type="bibr">(Parker, Ruth, Ratzan, Scott &amp; Lurie, 2003)</ref>. Health literacy is one of the biggest determinants of health, and the world is recommended to establish a union of all those affected by the disease to monitor and coordinate strategic activities to improve health literacy <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Health literacy is about the capacity of people to meet complex health demands in modern society. Due to the clear relationship between low health literacy and poor health outcomes and the potential to reduce these results, it is considered that the development of health literacy among people is crucial worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berkman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">DeWalt, Berkman, Sheridan, Lohr &amp; Pignone, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sudore et al., 2006)</ref>. Health literacy improves and supports individuals' ability to access correct information and health services, their ability to use these services, and their ability to read and understand health care instructions correctly. At the same time, it strengthens the proper allocation of resources, creating appropriate and qualified  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer &amp; Kindig, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Studies in the US in the 1990s linked literacy to health and showed a relation between low literacy and decreased drug compliance, decreased disease information, and reduced personal care management skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Parker, 2000)</ref>. While the individuals with adequate health literacy have sufficient health knowledge and benefit from health services effectively, they lead to an increase in the quality of life and the quality of health services, and a decrease in health care costs on the contrary. As the individuals with insufficient health literacy have insufficient health information, they have; a high risk of illness, low levels of understanding of treatment methods, high frequency of hospitalization, and they also increase healthcare costs (U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2010).</p><p>It was found that patients with low health literacy levels were hospitalized more frequently and for a longer period than those with adequate health literacy levels. However, the lack of health literacy is associated with poor quality of care and creates an additional burden on health resources (La <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Vonne &amp; Zun, 2008)</ref>. People with insufficient health literacy levels benefit less from healthcare services, misunderstand health information, often wait longer, and seek medical help only when their problems become critical <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ferguson, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>However, an insufficient level of health literacy is also associated with; irrational drug use, non-compliance with doctors' instructions, and a lack of well-being. For this reason, it is necessary to evaluate health literacy to reduce the possibility of the risk arising from an insufficient level of health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Peerson &amp; Saunders, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Rational drug use requires patients to take medication sufficiently and in time. Taking medications for a sufficient time not only enhances the therapeutic effect of the drugs but also reduces the side effects and adverse reactions of the drugs (Drug Administration &amp; Control Authority <ref type="bibr">[DACA], 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 1993)</ref>. At the same time, rational drug use recommends correct and appropriate usage by the guidelines and clinical needs, which decrease the cost for the supplier, the community and the patient. The purpose of rational drug use is also to teach the concepts of the right patient, the right medicine, the right dose, the right path and the right time. Rational drug use refers the patients to take medications; at the lowest cost for themselves and their communities, at doses that meet their individual needs for a sufficient period <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Although the drugs are important components of healthcare and play an important role in saving lives, their use as a whole is a complex issue for the doctor, the distributor and the patient. The WHO has developed some indicators to evaluate rational drug use practice in According to the World Health Organization, prescribing and dispensing inappropriate drugs is responsible for more than 50% of all drugs on the market, and irrational use of drugs results in various health risks and costs <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the evidence from former researches done with the general population and patients and their relatives, we speculate that the rational drug use levels of the patients and their relatives in Turkey is affected by the health literacy levels. To our knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted; to analyze the levels of health literacy and rational drug use of patients and their relatives with explanatory factor analysis, and to determine the structural relationship between health literacy and rational drug use level with structural equation modelling. Therefore, this study aimed to; (a) analyze the levels of health literacy and rational drug use of patients and their relatives with explanatory factor analysis, (b) determine the structural relationship between health literacy and rational drug use level with structural equation modelling (path analysis). The hypotheses we studied were that: (1) Patients and their relatives will show moderate or high levels of health literacy and rational drug use; (2) ensuring validity and reliability will show the existence of a structural relationship between health literacy and rational drug use; (3) health literacy will have a positive relationship with health literacy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics Approval</head><p>This research was carried out upon the approval of the ethics committee of Duzce University Scientific Research and Publication Ethics Committee (Date: 31.12.2020, Decision Number: 2020/282).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The data were collected from 657 patients and their relatives who received health services from pharmacies operating in Turkey with a face-to-face questionnaire technique.</p><p>The sampling was incidental, due to the accessibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Design</head><p>This was a cross-sectional study performed with face-to-face questionnaire from January 10, 2020, to March 10, 2020, in 657 patients and their relatives who received health services from pharmacies operating in Turkey. The study was designed and conducted by researchers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements of Variables</head><p>The survey form consists of three parts. In the first part, consisting of 34 propositions, there are statements about the level of rational drug use. While 28 propositions with expressions for determining the health literacy levels of individuals are included in the second part, there are statements about the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants in the last part. To determine the health literacy levels of the participants; The European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU), a 28-question health literacy level developed by the HLS-EU Consortium as part of the European Health Literacy Project 2009-2012, which is suitable for measuring health literacy at a global level due to its structural and contextual features, has been used. The scale used to determine the factors affecting the rational drug use levels of the participants was created based on the studies of <ref type="bibr">Çelebi (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Demirtaş et al. (2018)</ref> (rational drug use scale study).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>All statistical analyzes were performed by using IBM SPSS Statistic Base 23 V and AMOS programs. First of all, descriptive statistics were made to reveal the demographic characteristics of the participants and the scores of the tested constructs (health literacy and rational drug use). Secondly, explanatory factor analysis (EFA), by using IBM SPSS version 23 V, was performed to determine the health literacy levels of the participants and the behaviours towards rational drug use. Third, confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), using structural equation modelling in AMOS, were performed to assess different latent structure models of the relationship between health literacy and rational drug use levels. Criteria for determining confirmatory factor analysis model fit and measurement invariance were based on conventional standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Byrne, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Munro, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability of Research Data and Pilot Study Conducting A Pilot Study</head><p>A pilot study was carried out on 30 people with the draft scale, and the expression errors in the questionnaire statements, misunderstandings by the respondents, spelling mistakes etc. have been corrected. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test-Retest Reliability</head><p>For the test-retest reliability, the draft scale was administered to 30 people twice with a 2-week interval and the total scores from the scale are given below. The level (degree) of the Pearson correlation coefficient between the first and the second application is 0.91 (91%), meaning that there is a very strong positive correlation between the first and the second application. It can be concluded that the measurements taken at different times are very similar, hence, the scale is highly reliable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application of the Draft Scale to the Target Audience</head><p>A face-to-face survey technique was applied to 657 patients and their relatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performing Item Analysis For Internal Consistency Reliability</head><p>For the reliability analysis, "item analysis based on item-total correlation" was performed on the data obtained from the target population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Findings and Descriptive Statistics</head><p>A total of 657 respondents' responses were considered for the analysis of this study. It can be seen that 43% were males and 57% were females. And also 34% of the participants were between the ages of 18 and 25.51% of the participants were between the ages of 26 and 45.15% of the participants were between the ages of 46 and over. Of the participants; 9% had primary school, 12% had secondary school, 36% had high school, 42% had university, 2% had postgraduate education level. While 69% of participants preferred public hospitals, 31% preferred private hospitals. Also, 68% of participants did not have any chronic diseases and 32% of participants had several chronic diseases. Descriptive statisticsare given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>. The general reliability coefficient was found to be Alpha= 0.979. Ensuring validity and reliability shows the existence of a structural relationship between health literacy and rational drug use levels of the patients and their relatives. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explanatory Factor Analysis Results</head><p>An explanatory factor analysis was performed on the data about the health literacy levels of the participants and the behaviours towards rational drug use. The analyzes carried out in this direction are given below (Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref> The KMO value of the data analyzed to determine the sub-variables of the health literacy factors and the Bartlett test result seem to be acceptable for factor analysis (KMO value 0.975. Bartlett Test result p &lt;0.001). The total variance explained by the first of these 2 factors related to the scale is 66,048% and the second one is 4,021%.  The KMO value of the data analyzed to determine the sub-variables of rational drug use behaviour factors and the Bartlett test result seem to be acceptable for factor analysis (KMO value 0.995. Bartlett Test result p &lt;0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Model Fit Measures</head><p>The model fit was tested by different model fit indicators, which is given in table 4. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">4</ref>, it can be summarized that this studies' questions/items of the latent variables pass through all the major model fit indicators suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Munro (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">), Brown (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Byrne (2001)</ref>. The results for measuring the reliability and validity of the measurement model are illustrated in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> represents that the reliability and validity of the constructs applied in this study met the criteria. Since the calculated AVE values are greater than 0.5, the factors have fit validity. Also since the CR values are greater than 0.7, the factors have high construct reliability. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref> shows the results of the structural model.  The relationship between health literacy and rational drug use level and their properties are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Results of the Structural Model</head><p>When Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref> is examined, "functional health" which is one of the health literacy dimensions, is the right drug use of individuals (β= 1.534; p &lt;0.05), effective drug use of individuals (β= 1.169; p &lt;0.05) and safe drug use of individuals (β= 1.215; p &lt;0.05) is statistically significant and positively affected. In the light of these findings, the hypotheses numbered H1a, H1c and H1d were supported.</p><p>Similarly, when Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref> is analyzed, it is stated that "communicative health literacy", which is one of the health literacy dimensions, is the correct drug use of individuals (β= 0.758; p &lt;0.05), effective drug use of individuals (β= 0.365; p &lt;0.05). It was determined that drug use (β= 0.581; p &lt;0.05) and individuals' conscious drug use (β= 0.370; p &lt;0.05) were statistically significant and negatively affected. In the light of these findings, the research's hypotheses numbered H2a, H2b, H2c and H2d were supported, but the direction of the relationship was found different. This finding is somewhat inconsistent with the literature (hypothesis is supported, but unlike a positive relationship, a negative relationship emerged).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>This study, which was carried out; to analyze the levels of health literacy and rational drug use of individuals and to determine the structural relationship between health literacy and rational drug use level with structural equation modelling, was conducted on patients and their relatives who received health services from pharmacies operating in Sakarya and Düzce city centres. For this, the study hypothesized, 'health literacy has a direct impact on rational drug use. And also by conducting confirmatory factor analysis, it was observed that the relationships between health literacy and rational drug use had an acceptable index of fit. The general reliability coefficient was found to be Alpha= 0.979. According to the explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis results; health literacy level is gathered under two dimensions. These are; "functional health literacy" and "communicative health literacy". Rational drug use levels of individuals were gathered under four dimensions. These are; "correct use", "conscious use", "effective use" and "safe use".</p><p>In the results of the path analysis, it was determined that the individuals' health literacy levels had a statistically significant effect on their towards rational drug use. It was determined that "functional health literacy" which is one of the health literacy dimensions, affects the correct drug use of individuals, effective drug use of individuals, and safe drug use of individuals in a statistically significant and positive way. On the contrary, it was determined that "communicative health literacy", which is one of the health literacy dimensions, affects the correct drug use of individuals, effective drug use of individuals, safe drug use of individuals, and conscious drug use of individuals statistically significantly and negatively.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
