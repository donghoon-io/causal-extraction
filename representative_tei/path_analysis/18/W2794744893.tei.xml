<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to a company's strategic actions in carrying out its business activities in an ethical and social sphere <ref type="bibr">(Aguilera et al. 2007, Tai and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Chuang 2014)</ref>. The core concept of CSR is related to empowering stakeholders and taking advantage of available resources in business activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bhattacharya et al. 2009)</ref>. The scope of CSR activities is diverse, ranging from cooperation, maintaining good relationships with employees and other stakeholders, and even activities in protecting the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ismail 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Babiak and Trendafilova 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Frynas 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">, Torugsa et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The classical view of CSR only focused on charitable activities or solving social problems. Nowadays, this paradigm has shifted as the business responsibility to solve environmental and social problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Handayani et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Lee 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Secchi 2007)</ref>. The CSR scheme proposed that are conducted outside of the focus of healthcare activities are deemed to disrupt the services. By considering some aspects related to public awareness of the healthcare sector, this study attempts to empirically evaluate the effect of CSR on hospital value, reputation, and loyalty of patients in state-owned hospitals in Medan City, Indonesia. This study is valuable and has novelty due to the fact that CSR is generally done by the private sector (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Khan 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Lima Crisóstomo et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Fifka 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, Snider et al. 2003)</ref>. As a result of CSR usually being confined to the private sector, its practice in both government-owned agencies and healthcare sector has attracted less attention. Publication of CSR activities of private sector hospitals encourages public trust in the use of private services rather than government agencies, such as public hospitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pivato et al. 2008)</ref>. This leads to the phenomenon where private healthcare services have a higher demand than that of government-owned hospitals. This has encouraged the local government to start to implement CSR in the regional hospitals they own. In the last three years, government hospitals in Indonesia have consistently performed CSR activities such as free eye treatment and public health education, including healthy lifestyle activities targeting a range of people from elementary school children to students in higher education. For instance, the government hospitals in Medan City have been implementing such activities for the last three years. This study was driven by the interesting question of the extent to which the CSR in government hospitals is able to affect reputation, value, and customer loyalty. This ultimately is expected to have an effect on hospital performance in both satisfaction of customer and financial benefit. This study attempts to provide an insightful overview that focuses on the patient's perspective in evaluating the impact of CSR activities implemented by government hospitals, rather than focus on internal assessment of hospital service. Moreover, this study is unique in that it investigates CSR in the healthcare sector which is considerably different from previous studies that give more emphasis to the private sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Literature review</head><p>Corporate social responsibility and hospital reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schermerhorn (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kurniawan (2017)</ref> states that generally there are four levels of CSR actions: profitability, legitimacy, ethics, and philanthropy. These four are grouped into two main groups. The first group deals with the scope of the company's obligations that intersect with applicable law. The other group relates to the persuasive sphere leading to voluntary action. CSR is regarded as one of the most instrumental factors in beating the competition in the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wall 2008)</ref>. Now, the community is also strongly reacting to CSR activities that are considered beneficial to the community. CSR activities in the context of hospitals generally relate to the education of paramedical teams, health seminars, and charity activities for the public to improve public health in general. CSR will strengthen the reputation of the hospital as CSR activities conducted by the hospital increase. Some studies, such as those by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Susanto (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gazzola (2014)</ref>, identify a strong relationship between CSR and the company's reputation. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Inleh, Bartlett, and May's (2011)</ref> study reveals that one of the reasons companies do CSR is that they do not lose public reputation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Doda's (2015)</ref> study suggest a link between CSR practices and corporate reputation. This value is gained through a comprehensive set of actions, involving consumers, internal human resources, client networks and innovation exploration to add value to CSR practices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dean (2003)</ref> provides empirical evidence of a positive relationship between reputation moderated by certain types of donations with CSR practices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">McWilliams, A. (2000)</ref> states that CSR can be used as a means to enhance the company's reputation. Other studies provide similar evidence (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Morsing and Schultz 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Kotler and Lee 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Lai et al. 2010)</ref>. More specifically in the health sector, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bear et al. 2010)</ref> suggest that CSR ratings is less likely able to have a significant effect in the relationship between gender diversification in the board of directors and corporate reputation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clarke and Gibson-Sweet, (1999)</ref> disclose that firms with high levels of public scrutiny, as in the health sector, tend to use annual reports to improve the reputation of the community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corporate social responsibility and customer loyalty</head><p>Previous studies have suggested that loyalty plays an important role in the long-term growth and sustainability of a company's business. Loyalty becomes more than the ultimate goal of marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mandhachitara and Poolthong 2011)</ref>. In line with the concept of consumer behavior, consumers would be more loyal to products that contain ethical elements and companies that consistently implement CSR activities. Consumers consider CSR actions a factor in evaluating the product of a company that leads to loyal behavior <ref type="bibr">(Öberseder et al. 2013)</ref>. In this context, the hospitals must consistently implement and budget CSR activities in an effort to reach consumer loyalty.</p><p>Furthermore, a study from <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vlachos et al. (2009)</ref> which states that profit motive-based CSR has negative effect on overall CSR value, has relevance and implication on health sector, which generally implement social and humanity based CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grandón and</ref><ref type="bibr">Reinoso 2016, Mukhopadhyay et al. 2014)</ref>. In relation to loyalty, many studies show that CSR is more likely able to increase the consumer loyalty (García de los Salmones <ref type="bibr">Sánchez et al. 2005)</ref>. Whereas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sen and Bhattacharya (2001)</ref> reveal that under certain circumstances, CSR is able to reduce consumer interest in using company products. The model developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Luo and Bhattacharya (2006)</ref> demonstrates the relationship between CSR and customer satisfaction, which in turn can increase the market value of the company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corporate social responsibility and hospital value</head><p>People are now increasingly conscious of human rights and ethical behaviors which impacts the strong potential influence of a company's CSR activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brandao et al. (2013)</ref> reveal a new paradigm for an approach to social responsibility in hospital management in which hospitals can perform CSR activities actively or passively. The approach to social responsibility that has been developed and implemented by the private sector can now benefit the health services sector such as hospitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Semplici 2011)</ref>. In a competitive market, the proper implementation of CSR will likely increase the value of the hospital as CSR actions will improve the effectiveness and efficiency in providing health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brandao et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>CSR activities can attract the attention of workers as well as shape the behavior expected of patients and paramedics. This will encourage increased effectiveness and efficiency of health services provided. However, some previous researchers indicated that CSR has no impact or even a negative effect on the value of the hospital. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gherghina and Vintila (2016)</ref> show that there was no relationship between CSR and corporate value, particularly in the form of CSR stakeholders. In that study, the CSR activity was focused on environmental conservation. Communities are more receptive to CSR actions related to the environment than other forms such as education and counseling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Srivastava et al. (2012)</ref> asserts that CSR does not always bring increased value and is even likely to decrease the consumer's perceived value of the company. Since poorly implemented CSR actions may impair perceptions of value, the company's social responsibility to the environment in this case should be applied wisely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hospital reputation and customer loyalty</head><p>Marketing literature suggests that customers evaluate their perceived performance of a corporation and its product based on its reputation. A stronger reputation will gain more trust and customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Keh and Xie 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Shirazi et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Wahyuni and Ginting 2017)</ref>. Brand identification theory also suggests that there is a positive relationship between corporate reputation and customer loyalty. Hence, a well-known product will be more likely accepted by newcomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Marin et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>A study from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bontis, Booker, and Serenko (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Budiharseno (2017)</ref> suggest that reputation affects loyalty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Weiwei (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nugroho et al. (2017)</ref> state that with respect to the nature of intangible in service business, the use of the company's physical aspects, direct contact and communication is necessary to build a reputation for increasing consumer loyalty. In addition, some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Helm et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">, Walsh et al. 2009</ref>) also reveal direct relationship between company reputation and loyalty. In the context of health sector, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boshoff and Gray (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wu (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Naidu (2009)</ref> show that assurance and the service quality of hospital nurses has a positive impact on both satisfaction and patient loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hospital reputation and hospital value</head><p>As an action based on a cost-benefit analysis, CSR should be able to increase the company›s value through the creation of reputation and competitive advantage in the long term. However, the current study still does not provide sufficient evidence that CSR is likely able to increase the value of the company as a whole. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Doda (2015)</ref> shows that CSR activities do not have an impact on company value. CSR is no longer just about social charity; it has become an effective marketing tool used to promote the image and value of the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Folajin et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Geva 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The relationship between the reputation and value of a company has been identified as a valued relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Knight and Pretty 2001)</ref>. Companies that have a high reputation will likely attract the attention of better resources that can be used in increasing the value of the company. Moreover, consumer perceptions of company value will increase in well-known companies compared to those which are lesser known. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Haghkhah et al. (2013)</ref> states that reputation is a source of growth and development in an enterprise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Nicklin and Dickson (2009)</ref> state that reputation in the form of hospital accreditation plays an important role in the perception of the value of a hospital to the public.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Customer loyalty and hospital value</head><p>Many findings of previous studies suggest that companies carry out CSR activities to practically gain an edge and sustainable growth in the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carroll and Shabana 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Korkchi and Rombaut 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Nasieku et al. 2014</ref>). However, it is worth noting that CSR may not solely achieve decisive long-term benefits for the company; it is considered to have costs as well. CSR activities require a certain amount of costs to be incurred by the company. Some studies argue that CSR will not likely be able to increase the value of the company because of its very high level of uncertainty. Four percent of the economic intelligence units consider CSR to be entirely detrimental to the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lev 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In the health sector, such as in hospitals, the healthcare provider's reputation has an important role in attracting the attention of consumers to use the health services provided, in addition to attracting awareness from others in the health sector. This may be because a good reputation, for example in terms of a healthcare provider's service and hygiene, is considerably demanded by users. Most people will very likely not want to use the services of a hospital that does not have a good reputation. Most importantly, the hospital users will pay attention to hospital services and quality problems, especially regarding hospital success rate and risk of treatment failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Meyer et al. 2004</ref>). The patient's loyalty to the hospital also plays an important role in achieving long-term growth. Marketing experts identify that one of the expected behaviors of loyal consumers is the consumption of services rendered, or the use of repeat services in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kotler and Keller 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kotler and Keller (2012)</ref> state that customer loyalty is the key to achieving long-term growth and business continuity. The cost of acquiring new customers is generally five times more expensive than maintaining existing customers. Moreover, loyal customers will invite new prospects at no additional cost. It becomes a potential for generating profits for the company in the long term. The generated profits could be used as investment to increase effectiveness and efficiency of existing services that have an impact on better value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>In line with the literature study conducted, the research model was developed to meet the objectives of this study. The model proposed in this study is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>In accordance with the proposed model, this study proposed eight hypotheses as follows:</p><p>-H 1 : There is a direct positive influence of CSR on hospital reputation -H 2 : There is a direct positive influence of CSR on customer loyalty -H 3 : There is a direct positive influence of CSR on hospital value -H 4 : There is a direct positive influence of hospital reputation on customer loyalty -H 5 : There is a direct positive influence of customer loyalty on hospital value -H 6 : There is a direct positive influence of hospital reputation on hospital value -H 7 : There is a mediating role of hospital reputation in strengthening the relationship between CSR and hospital value -H 8 : There is a mediating role of customer loyalty in strengthening the relationship between CSR and hospital value</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>This study focuses on the patient's perspective in evaluating the impact of CSR activities imposed by government hospitals. Therefore, the sample criteria are the patients who know the CSR activity of the hospital. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ghozali (2011)</ref>, the minimum sample criterion for a path analysis is 200-300. To get representative samples from each hospital, 50 inpatients from each one were randomly invited to participate in this study. Participants were invited randomly according to the list of patients present in each hospital. If a selected sample was not willing to participate in the study or was unable to participate because the selected sample was out-patient, the sample would be replaced with a randomly selected sample that met the minimum requirements. In this study, all selected samples were able to participate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Location and time of research</head><p>In terms of research location, this study was conducted in the city of Medan, North Sumatra, that has four government hospitals: Putri Hijau Hospital, Haji Hospital, Pirngadi Hospital, and Adam Malik Hospital. This study was conducted from June to September, 2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research scheme</head><p>The researcher visited four government hospital in Medan to conduct the research. As the researcher visited, the participants were gathered in the hall. Researcher give the basic knowledge of CSR activities conducted in hospital, loyalty, reputation, and value to the participants before collecting the data. The researcher was accompanying the patients in case they had a question about the statements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>This research was conducted using questionnaires as the source of the data acquisition about patient perception of the variables. Questionnaires were arranged based on the Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The proposed model of CSR impact in government hospital literature review and adjusted in line with the current situation in government hospitals in Medan City. The study also interviewed inpatients who were randomly selected in an effort to obtain specific information regarding the actual situation in the government hospitals. Documentation was also conducted in an effort to obtain the necessary data in discussing this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity and reliability</head><p>The distributed questionnaire has passed the validity test, tested by Pearson Correlation, as well as a test of the reliability of the instrument by using Cronbach's Alpha. Both instruments were used to ensure that the data measured through the questionnaire is accurate and correct in measuring each variable. The research questionnaires were prepared with operationalization as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis technique</head><p>Data in this research was analyzed by using path analysis with regression method. The statistical tool used in assessing the path coefficient estimation was the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). A Likert scale was used to measure the patient's perception of research variables. The variable score of each patient is the average value of each variable with the consideration of the number of different indicators for each variable. This research proposes a CSR model with the assumption that CSR is able to affect the reputation of the hospital, patient loyalty, and the value of government hospitals. Reputation and loyalty both serve as mediating variables in an effort to increase the value of the hospital. This study evaluated direct, indirect, and total influence of the CSR on the hospital reputation, loyalty, and hospital value. The direct, indirect, and total influence were estimated by AMOS software, while the estimate of the significance of the indirect effect, of the relationship between the CSRhospital reputation -hospital value, and between the CSRthe customer loyalty -hospital value was evaluated by using Sobel Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sobel 1982)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Result and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive statistics</head><p>This study used descriptive statistical analysis to evaluate the perceptions of inpatients about CSR practices that have been implemented by hospitals, patient loyalty levels, hospital reputation, and their perception of overall hospital values. The value used is based on the average score of each variable. The value of the mean or average score used was to avoid score bias due to an unequal number of indicators in each variable. The descriptive statistical tools used in the analysis are the maximum, minimum, average, and standard deviation values. Descriptive statistical results are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows that inpatients assessed perceived the level of implementation of CSR at government hospitals as relatively good with an average score of 3.13 from a five-point Likert scale. The level of the standard deviation (STDEV = 1.08) indicates that the response of the patient varies considerably. Many implementations of CSR applied by government hospitals are not well perceived by the patient. A high range of answers confirm that although there are patients who are perceive CSR programs as very good, some do not feel the same way. They did not respond well to the CSR program that the hospital applied.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> also indicates that the general reputation of the hospital for patients has been good with an average score of 3.70 on a scale of 5.00. The hospital is perceived to have a good image in the public. This is a good sign for the ma nagerial practices of CSR of government hospitals, indicated by a small value of standard deviation. In line with the reputation, generally inpatients of government hospitals have a high level of loyalty. This is likely to enable the hospital management to expect future visits from these patients when they need health services or even advise others to seek treatment at the hospital. With regard to the hospital value, inpatients in the study on average consider that the value of public hospitals is relatively good. This assessment is based on three main aspects, namely financial services, effectiveness, and efficiency of hospital services rendered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis</head><p>The model evaluation performed using a path analysis with AMOS identified that CSR only explained 7.7 per cent of the variance of hospital patient loyalty. Moreover, CSR and the hospital reputation together account for 71 per cent of the variance of patient loyalty. In this case, reputation plays a major role in explaining the loyalty of the patient. In connection with the value of the hospital, the three variables of CSR, customer loyalty, and hospital reputation are able to explain 66 per cent of variance. Based on the statistical value of squared multiple correlation, the model proposed in this research is able to predict the impact of CSR on the government hospitals in Medan City.</p><p>The results of the estimation of the AMOS diagram used in evaluating the research model are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The results of the estimated value and hypothesis testing of direct influence between variables are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The direct effect</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> indicates that CSR has a positive and significant impact on the reputation of the government hospitals, indicated by the statistical result of hypothesis one of critical ratio (C.R) 3.282 and p-value 0.001. Hence, there is statistical evidence to suggest that the more appropriately the CSR is applied and well-perceived by the patient, the higher the reputation the hospital gains. Since the first hypothesis is supported by statistical analysis, the hypothesis one stating that there is a direct and positive influence of CSR on the hospital reputation is accepted.</p><p>The statistical analysis reveals that CSR has a positive and significant effect on the loyalty of inpatients, indicated by the value of C.R and p-value of hypothesis two of 2.970 and 0.00, respectively. Accordingly, hypothesis two stating the effect of CSR on customer loyalty is accepted. This allows that patients will likely become more loyal as CSR activity is implemented by the government hospitals.</p><p>Hypothesis three tests the effect of CSR activities on the hospital value. The statistical testing reveals that there is a negative and significant impact of CSR on the value of the hospital, indicated by the negative value of C.R -2.905. Although the relationship is significant, the negative sign proves that there is no direct influence of CSR on the hospital value. Therefore, hypothesis three testing the influence of CSR on the hospital value is not statistically supported.</p><p>Furthermore, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows that the reputation of the hospital is more likely perceived to have a positive effect on loyalty of patients. This is supported by the statistical result of C.R and p-value of 16.014, and 0.000, respectively. This result statistically supports hypothesis four stating that CSR has a direct and positive influence on the patient loyalty in hospital governments in Medan City. It means that the more CSR programs are implemented by hospital governments, the higher the customer loyalty will be.</p><p>Hypothesis five tests the impact of the hospital reputation on the hospital value. The statistical testing reveals that the reputation of hospital is likely perceived to have a positive and significant impact on the value of the government hospitals. This is indicated by the value of C.R of 1.983, and  significance level of 0.047. Accordingly, the hypothesis five is statistically It means that the higher the hospital' reputation, the higher the hospital value. Finally, hypothesis six tests the influence of customer loyalty on the hospital value. The statistical analysis shows that there is a positive and significant impact of customer loyalty on the value of government hospitals, indicated by the value of C.R of 7.319, and p-value of 0.000, meaning that the more loyal patients in the hospital are more likely to perceive increased value of the hospital.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The indirect effect</head><p>In order to evaluate the indirect effect of both mediating variables of hospital reputation and customer loyalty in strengthening the relationship between CSR programs and the hospital value, this study used the Sobel test. The test results of the Sobel test are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> shows the indirect effect of CSR on the hospital value through the mediating role of hospital reputation. The result of Sobel test, indicated by the p-value of 0.006 demonstrates that there is a positive and significant impact of CSR on the hospital value. This means that the mediating variable of customer loyalty is able to strengthen the relationship between CSR and the hospital value. Moreover, the relationship is likely to be stronger after the mediating variable of reputation is included, indicated by the p-value of 0.000, and the value of indirect effect of 0.161. This means that the reputation together with loyalty has a considerable role in an effort to increase the level of the hospital value by conducting CSR activities. The CSR, henceforth, is better able to enhance the reputation of government hospitals that will ultimately improve the patient's perception of the value of the hospital. Accordingly, the hypotheses seven and eight are statistically supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Total effect</head><p>The CSR Impact model proposed in this study provides the indirect effect of CSR on the value of government hospitals. Both the reputation and the loyalty of the patient are also proved to significantly play a role as intermediary variables that have an intervening effect on CSR in increasing the hospital value. The direct, indirect, and total influence are summarized in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows that although directly CSR has a negative impact on the hospital value, overall, CSR is more able to increase the hospital value by inserting the mediating role of the hospital reputation and patient loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effect of CSR on hospital reputation</head><p>The results indicate that CSR activities conducted by government hospitals will likely be able to improve the reputation of the hospital. According to reputation management, an organization had to carefully set policy and action in order to create hospital reputation among stakeholder in long-term <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Susanto 2009)</ref>. Our findings support the fact that many organization commit to do CSR due to threat of losing reputation for long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Inleh et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">). Susanto (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gazzola (2014)</ref> also stated that CSR will enhance organization's reputation. Any CSR activity that is announced or published will have more impact on the company's stakeholders. The community now has a very high awareness of the "green-activities" and CSR activities undertaken by the company, especially CSR that supports the welfare of stakeholders in general. In this study, patients were asked to respond to a credible form of CSR that has been implemented by the hospital. When CSR activities such as health education, providing free services, and doing devoted work are well perceived by the patients, in their minds it is also attached to the stronger reputation of the hospital. Reputation is associated with a good impression of the service, impression of service reliability, the impression of the service perception, the impression of good management, and most importantly a general good impression by stakeholders. Therefore, in order to gain much more reputation in public, government hospital must leave positive impression to their CSR act. The better their CSR activities perceived by patients, the better their reputation will be gained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effect of CSR on patients' loyalty</head><p>CSR activities applied by hospital and perceived by patient are more likely able to encourage patient loyalty. The results showed that statistically CSR will create patient loyalty to government hospitals in Medan. Patients, as part of the stakeholders, will interact directly with the CSR activities undertaken by hospital. Moreover, unlike common characteristics of CSR in the non-health sector, many of the hospital's CSR activities indeed take place in the hospital environment itself. Thus, the customer as an inpatient will become the first party to have opportunities to interact with CSR activities implemented. This activity will make people trust more in these activities. This result is in line with the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al. (2015)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ailawadi et al. (2014)</ref>, though these studies were not conducted specifically in the health sector. Moreover, the results of this study are also consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Diallo and Lambey-Checchin (2017)</ref>, demonstrating the positive impact of CSR on customer loyalty. When CSR conducted by government hospitals is positively perceived by inpatients, they increasingly show loyal behavior. They become more confident in communicating the good experience at the hospital and recommend it to their colleagues, as well as indicate the use of health care services in the future. Our finding showed that even though the statistical result of path coefficient is relative small (less than 0.1), CSR is significantly able to affect the patients' loyalty. Hence, patients will get more loyal to the government hospital as they perceived a better CSR activities implemented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effect of CSR on hospital value</head><p>The results indicate that CSR has a direct, negative and significant influence on the hospital value. The result imply that CSR activities, given there is no impact on reputation and loyalty, will reduce the overall hospital value. The results indicate that CSR has a direct and negative influence on the hospital value. This is seemingly caused by the budget implementation of CSR activities with regard to the imposition of operating costs that would make the patients perceive that the hospital will financially deteriorate at a given level. This result is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Srivastava et al. (2012)</ref>, suggesting that CSR does not always have a positive impact on hospital values. Although it is in its initial development, CSR would impose relatively large additional costs, though, in the end, the hospital CSR would provide benefits by increasing levels of effectiveness and efficiency of services in addition to improved financial performance hospital through the presence of a more skilled medical personnel and the potential for more patients. CSR alone can be perceived in negative thought such as inefficiency use of service time and personal resource, waste of operational fund, also inefficient schedule for the patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effect of reputation in patients' loyalty</head><p>The result regarding the positive relationship between reputation and loyalty, is also supported by previous studies (e.g <ref type="bibr">Ali et al. 2012, Helm and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tolsdorf 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shirazi et al. (2013)</ref> stated that a strong brand identity, for example, a hospital that has a high reputation, is more likely to result in consumer confidence leading to the loyal behavior of consumers. Hence, hospitals can update medical equipment and training of medical workers to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare services. Thus, the more reputable the hospital, the more loyal the patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effect of loyalty on hospital value</head><p>Customer loyalty will improve hospital value. In accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kotler and Keller (2012)</ref>, we believed that a loyal customer will behave in three possible action, (1) repurchase, (2) retain, (3) recommend. Each act of loyal customer will improve hospital value. Basically a loyal customer will bring more customer while retain themselves. If hospitals had much more loyal customer, it will bring more value to the hospital. Loyal customer become a source of continuous income that can be used to improve hospital value. Hospital may improve their equipment or undergo training for medical staff which improve their effectiveness and efficiency level healthcare services. This result is consistent with previous research that states that loyalty is key in improving the value of business development <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Haghkhah et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Keiningham et al. 2008)</ref>. The statistical analysis shows that loyalty is more likely able to improve the patients' perceived information regarding the financial aspect, effectiveness and efficiency of services, thereby improving the hospital value</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effect of reputation on hospital value</head><p>The statistical testing also shows that there is a positive and significant influence of hospital reputation on the perception of the hospital value. This is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Eccles et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Cole 2012</ref>) highlighting the positive relationship between the reputation and value of the company. Reputation has an important role in the effort to attract the attention of consumers and new resources for the hospital. For example, doctors who are more skilled or better paramedics will join a hospital that has a high reputation. This will encourage the effectiveness and efficiency of health services that impact on the overall value improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect effect of CSR on hospital value through loyalty</head><p>According to our research, most of CSR activities were directed to the inpatients, thus they will be more likely to experience the CSR conducted by hospital. It became the moment of truth between patients, paramedics, and hospital. As the CSR program delivered smoothly, it is more likely improving the patients' loyalty. The more they loyal the more future financial flow source established to hospital. Loyal patient will be likely to repurchase the services while spreading positive feedback to other. Loyal patients will be taken care more effective and efficiently through patient database for references. Also, the financial flow can be used to improve equipment to operate more efficiently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect effect of CSR on hospital value through reputation</head><p>Reputation management <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Susanto 2009</ref>) stated that some organization commit to do CSR to maintain their reputation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gazzola (2014)</ref> stated that CSR not only maintaining the reputation but also improve hospital reputation on public opinion. As public opinion increased, it will bring new source of human resource to improve service quality and service delivered to the patients. They will be more effective and efficiently while delivering the healthcare services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and implication</head><p>This study provides some important considerations regarding the applicability of CSR in the health sector. The statistical testing of the study model provides empirical evidence that CSR plays an important role in the creation of value through the creation of a government hospital reputation and patient loyalty. It should be emphasized that by analyzing the Sobel test, the direct negative impact of CSR will be covered by the strengthening role of hospital reputation and patient loyalty variables. CSR activities can encourage loyalty and reputation of the hospital directly. Overall, CSR is more likely to promote the value of the government hospitals. Hence, CSR activities should be applied strategically and should be implemented with regard to the core business of the hospital. CSR also has to be communicated properly in the effort to create the reputation of the hospital. Implementation of CSR is highly recommended in direct contact with hospital stakeholders such as patients and paramedics. Therefore according to our research we may conclude that CSR on government hospital will improve the patients' loyalty, reputation, and overall value. However we should pay attention that CSR should be conducted with care.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
