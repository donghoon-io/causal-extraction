<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sexually reproducing organisms often rely on various traits to judge the attractiveness of potential mates. Many mate choice preferences and traits have evolved through selection by those organisms' ancestors, with traits having been either costly (detrimental to survival) or noncostly in the environment of their evolutionary adaptation. A general mathematical analysis of the evolution of traits used in mate choice is presented. The analysis builds on a combination of Price's covariance equation and Wright's method of path analysis, and includes a set of Monte Carlo simulations. The usefulness of the mathematical analysis is demonstrated through the development of a small but important set of hypotheses and implications for the human species: (1) costly traits used in mate choice by humans should be generally less common and more attractive to the other sex than non-costly traits; (2) costly traits should be disproportionately less common in human females than in males; and (3) some harmful human mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, may have co-evolved as costs of attractive mental traits. It is also shown that similar analyses can be easily employed by evolutionary psychologists to theorize about the evolution of complex mate choice traits, and to test the resulting theories with modern humans through the method of path analysis.</p></div>

The term "costly", when applied to a trait, means that the trait has a negative impact on survival. Costly traits used in mate choice are defined as traits that increase mating success while at the same time decrease survival success. Non-costly traits used in mate choice are defined as traits that increase mating success and that do not have a negative effect on survival success.</p><p>The train (often and erroneously referred to as the "tail") displayed by the male of the peacock species is an example of costly trait used in mate choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(ZAHAVI and ZAHAVI 1997)</ref>. Having large trains with numerous eye spots significantly increases the mating success of male peacocks, while at the same time making them more vulnerable to predators <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(PETRIE et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">ZAHAVI and ZAHAVI 1997)</ref>. A related behavioral trait is the propensity to display the train to females in leks during the mating season, without which the train itself would not be of much use.</p><p>The ability and motivation of males of the fruit fly species Drosophila subobscura to engage in the species' rapid courtship dance are examples of non-costly traits used in mate choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(MAYNARD SMITH and HARPER 2003)</ref>. Males that show the ability and motivation to dance quickly and vigorously, in response to lead movements by females, increase their mating success. Those traits have no known negative impact on the survival success of males <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(MAYNARD SMITH and HARPER 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Both costly and non-costly traits used in mate choice are generally assumed, at their initial stages of evolution, to reflect the existence of underlying traits that increase survival success, primarily resistance against parasites <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(HAMILTON and ZUK 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">MAYNARD SMITH and HARPER 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">MILLER 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">WILSON 2000)</ref>. However, since preferences and traits usually co-evolve, an increase in the frequency of a preference for a trait in a population often leads to a concomitant exaggeration of the trait, to the point where the trait starts presenting a survival cost for those individuals that display it <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(FISHER 1930;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">KOKKO et al. 2002)</ref>. This is a different point than the one made in the paragraph above, and both points are consistent with one another, even though they may appear contradictory at first glance. That is, a mate choice trait may or may not have a survival cost, even though it reflects an underlying trait that was associated at early evolutionary stages with a survival advantage, such as resistance to parasites.</p><p>It has been argued that traits used in mate choice must be costly to be reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(IREDALE et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">ZAHAVI 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">ZAHAVI , 2003;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">ZAHAVI and ZAHAVI 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">GRAFEN (1990)</ref> has shown that costly traits are indeed useful in mate choice, primarily because they are hard to fake, but not that only costly traits are reliable. If traits used in mate choice had to be costly to be reliable, it is unclear why costly mate choice traits seem to be much less common in nature than non-costly ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DARWIN 1871;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">MAYNARD SMITH 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">ZAHAVI and ZAHAVI 1997)</ref>. The male peacock, for example, has a greater number of visible non-costly mate choice traits, such as the crest atop its head and the brightly colored feathers on its chest, than costly ones (of which the only obvious one is the train). It is also puzzling that costly traits are predominantly observed in males if they are so important for honest signaling. Males also choose females for mating.</p><p>Human males and females appear to employ costly and non-costly traits for mate choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(BUSS 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">GANGESTAD and THORNHILL 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">MILLAR 2010)</ref>. A hypothesized costly mate choice trait displayed by males and used by females in mate choice is the presence of facial features indicating high levels of testosterone (e.g., angular facial features), apparently because testosterone suppresses the immune system and thus is an indicator that the males in question have had a particularly effective immune system up until the time they reached reproductive maturity (GANGESTAD and THORNHILL 2003; RHODES et al. 2003; THORNHILL and GANG-ESTAD 2006). Non-costly mate choice traits also seem to be more common than costly traits in both human males and females; examples are height and upper-body musculature in males, and hip-to-waist ratio and skin condition in females <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(BUSS 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(BUSS , 1999;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">CARTWRIGHT 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">FINK et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">FURNHAM et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">MILLER 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">SHACKELFORD et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">SINGH and RANDALL 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The discussion presented here aims at shedding some light on the issues above through a mathematical analysis of the evolution of costly and non-costly traits. The results of the analysis have important implications for evolutionary psychologists, which are also discussed. The analysis builds on a combination of the Price Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(PRICE 1970)</ref> with the path analysis method developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">WRIGHT (1934</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">WRIGHT ( , 1960))</ref>, whereby a fundamental requirement for evolution of traits through selection is derived.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF MATE CHOICE TRAITS IN HUMANS</head><p>The general mathematical analysis presented here applies to the vast majority of sexually reproducing organisms where mate choice takes place.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The fundamental requirement for evolution of traits through selection</head><p>For any subpopulation (e.g., males of a sexually reproducing species) of a population of organisms (males and females) to evolve phenotypic traits related to their fitness, the variation in the frequency of each trait in that subpopulation must satisfy Equation (1) in terms of its relation with fitness. This is the famous Price Equation (PRICE 1970), developed by George R. Price, who was for a short time a collaborator of notable evolutionary theorists William D. <ref type="bibr">Hamilton and John Maynard Smith (FRANK 1995)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W Z ⋅Δ = , ( ) ( ). Cov W Z E W Z + ⋅Δ<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The term Z in Equation (1) refers to a numeric variable tracking the presence or absence in an individual in the subpopulation of a particular phenotypic trait that has a genetic basis (e.g., Z = 1 for presence of the trait, and Z = 0 for absence). The fitness W of an individual, which is defined as the number of surviving offspring of the individual, is assumed to be a linear function of each trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(FRANK 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">RICE 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The Price Equation has over the years become one of the most widely used algebraic formulations in evolutionary theorizing addressing a range of phenomena, from the evolution of morphological traits in various animals to the evolution of behavioral traits in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(FLETCHER and ZWICK 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">FRANK 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">FRANK , 1997;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">GRAFEN 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">GRAFEN , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">HENRICH 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">MCELREATH and BOYD 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">PAGE and NOWAK 2002</ref>; VAN VEELEN 2005).</p><p>The covariance term in the Price Equation generally refers to the change due to differential survival and/or mating success conferred by a trait, while the expectation term refers to change due to other factors such as mutation and recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(MCELREATH and BOYD 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">RICE 2004)</ref>. Therefore, the expectation term is usually set to zero when one wants to isolate the effects of environmental and sexual selection in the mathematical analysis of the likely evolution of a trait, and the comparative analysis of its evolution in relation with other traits. This leads to Equation (2), which is a simplified version of the Price Equation; the most widely used form in the analysis of the evolution of traits through selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(FRANK 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(FRANK , 1997;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">RICE 2004)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W Z ⋅Δ = , ( ). Cov W Z (2)</formula><p>The standardized equivalent of W can be obtained by subtracting its mean from it and dividing the result by the standard deviation of W. The same can be done for Z, leading to two dimensionless quantities that are the standardized equivalents of W and Z. These dimensionless quantities are referred to as w and z. Expressing W and Z in terms of w and z in the covariance term of Equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), and transforming it using covariance properties leads to Equation (3).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W Z ⋅Δ = , ( ) W Z Cov w S W z S Z ⋅ + ⋅ + = , ( ) W Z Cov w S z S ⋅ ⋅ = , ( ) W Z S S Cov w z ⋅ ⋅ ⇒ W Z ⋅Δ = , ( ).

The same is true for the product of the standard deviations of W and Z on the right side of the equation, as long as the covariance term is greater than zero. Therefore, the inequality expressed in Equation ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) defines the fundamental requirement for the evolution of any fitnessrelated trait through selection: , ( ) Cov w z &gt; 0.</p><p>(4)</p><p>As will be seen in the following sections, Equation (4) will prove particularly useful because it is expressed in terms of the standardized variables w and z, instead of the related non-standardized variables W and Z. The main reason for this is that Equation (4) can be used in the context of path modeling and analysis, two well developed methods for the analysis of complex relationships between variables that build on properties of standardized variables.</p><p>The evolution of independent traits used in mate choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">FISHER (1930)</ref> has shown that in any sexually reproducing population, mate choice traits generally co-evolve with preferences for the traits. A preference must appear first in the population for the trait to be considered attractive, and thus evolve, whether it is costly or non-costly at any stage of the evolutionary process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">KOKKO et al. (2002)</ref> have cogently shown that there is no reason to assume that selection necessarily favors preferences for either costly or non-costly traits. That is, what essentially matters from an evolutionary standpoint is the net contribution of the preference-trait combination to fitness, which is the reason why the probability of evolution of costly traits may be greater than zero. Thus the discussion presented here focuses on the evolution of mate choice traits, and assumes that preferences already exist for those traits. Moreover, it is assumed here that both preferences and traits appear stochastically in populations, either evolving in or being eliminated from those populations.</p><p>The discussion presented here builds on path analysis. This is a statistical analysis method that has been developed by Sewall Wright, one of the founders of the field of population genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DUNCAN 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">KENNY 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">MUELLER 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">WRIGHT 1934</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">WRIGHT , 1960))</ref>. It relies on the development of path models, which are diagrams that facilitate the visualization of the relationships between variables measuring phenotypic traits, any intermediate variables, and fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(RICE 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a path model with two standardized variables quantifying phenotypic traits of individuals in a subpopulation, x and y, where the traits are independent from each other. Error terms have been left out of the path model for simplicity. Both traits measured through x and y have positive effects on mating success (m), which is defined as the standardized measure of the total number of copulations in which an individual has participated during his or her lifetime. These effects are indicated as p mx and p my , and are due to x and y being traits used in mate choice; that is, the traits are perceived as attractive by individuals of the other sex. Trait y also has a negative effect on survival success (s), which is the standardized measure of the age of an individual at the time of death. This effect is indicated as p sy . Both m and s have positive effects on the standardized measure of fitness (w), indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> as p wm and p ws . Since an individual must be alive to have a copulation, it follows that s has a positive effect on m. All effects (p mx , p my , etc.) are measured as standardized partial regression coefficients, also referred to as path coefficients. They are of the same type as the coefficients generated in multiple regression analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(MUELLER 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">WRIGHT 1960)</ref>.</p><p>A fundamental property of path models is that the covariance between any pair of variables equals the sum of the products of the path coefficients in all possible paths connecting the two variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DUNCAN 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">MUELLER 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">WRIGHT 1934</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">WRIGHT , 1960))</ref>. Combining this property with Equation (4) for the trait x leads to the requirement for evolution of that trait expressed in Equation (5). (5) Equation ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) essentially states that if the effect of x on m is positive, then the trait measured by x will tend to evolve, because the effect of m on w is always positive. Or, in other words, if a mutation evolves in the individuals of the sex that is selecting a non-costly trait measured by x, where that mutation makes those individuals find the trait attractive, then the trait will tend to evolve. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">6</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">⎛ ⎞ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ - + ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎝ ⎠ .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>A comparison of Equations ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">6</ref>) reveals one important property, which is that the evolution of a costly trait y requires p my to be above a certain threshold. The threshold is represented by the product on the right side of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">6</ref>). There is no such threshold for the evolution of a non-costly trait x. This property is explicitly formalized in Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">7</ref>) and (8), where the threshold is referred to as ˆ: my p</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ˆmy p = ws sy m s wm p p p p ⋅ ⎛ ⎞ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ - + ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎝ ⎠ , (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">) my p &gt; ˆ. my p (8)</formula><p>A few important conclusions can be derived from the above discussion. The probability of evolution of a costly trait will be lower than the probability of evolution of a non-costly trait, because of the existence of a threshold that any costly trait will have to overcome to evolve. Also, more often than not the effect of costly traits on mating success (measured through p my ), namely the level of attractiveness of costly traits, will be higher than that of non-costly traits.</p><p>Focusing now on Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">7</ref>), it is clear that the threshold for evolution of a non-costly trait is proportional to the absolute value of the negative effect of the trait on survival success (p sy ) and to the term p ws / p wm + p ms . Therefore the magnitude of a costly trait's positive effect on mating success (p my ), which could be seen as the level of attractiveness of the trait, will be proportional to the negative impact of the trait on survival success. That is, the more costly a trait used in mate choice is, the more attractive it becomes.</p><p>The term p ws / p wm + p ms is particularly relevant for the discussion presented here because of the potentially high impact that one of its component terms, the ratio p ws / p wm , can have on the threshold for evolution of y traits and also the magnitude of the effect of those traits on mating success. Equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">10</ref>), derived from path model properties (DUNCAN 1966; WRIGHT 1934, 1960), show how p ws and p wm can be calculated from r ws , r wm and r ms ; these are the Pearson correlation coefficients between w and s, w and m and m and s, respectively: </p><p>Life history theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(ANDERSON 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">HILL and KAPLAN 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">KOKKO 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">LANDE 1982)</ref> provides a body of empirical findings and related theoretical conclusions that can be used in the understanding of the relationships between s, m and w, and their likely correlations (r ws , r wm and r ms ) in many species, including the human species. (Life history theory is not only a theory, but an area of research in biology.) Among the conclusions that can be reached based on life history theory, the following are particularly relevant for the arguments advanced here.</p><p>• The value of r ws will be generally high in a population of individuals when the level of offspring dependence on parents for survival to reproductive age is high; and more broadly when the level of parental investment required for raising offspring to reproductive age is high.</p><p>• The value of r wm will be generally low when there are factors hindering targeted copulation, such as ovulation being at least partially concealed and/or the use of fertility-cycle-dependent mating strategies (e.g., short-and longterm strategies); and when survival of offspring to reproductive age is highly dependent on factors other than number of copulations (e.g., parental care).</p><p>• The value of r ms will be generally low when reproductive maturity is reached relatively late in life; and when mating success is lightly dependent on factors other than survival success, which would be the case in a balanced-sexratio population of individuals with a tendency toward monogamy.</p><p>Life history theory allows for the expectation of high values for r ws and moderate to low values for r wm and r ms in certain species, such as modern humans and their ancestors during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene is the period in which much of the evolution of the genus Homo is believed to have taken place, leading up to the emergence of Homo sapiens <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(BOAZ and ALMQUIST 2001)</ref>. It goes from approximately 1.8 million to 11 thousand years ago.</p><p>From Equations ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">10</ref>) it can be seen that small differences between the correlation coefficients r ws and r wm can be amplified as differences between the path coefficients p ws and p wm even though the absolute values of the path coefficients are reduced. This in turn leads to high p ws / p wm ratios, and thus to high thresholds for evolution of y traits. Let us take for example the case in which r ws = .35, r wm = .25 and r ms = .25. This would lead to p ws = .31, p wm = .17 and p ws / p wm = 1.77. If we increased r ws to .45 and kept both r wm and r ms at .25 then the ratio p ws / p wm would become 2.82. Let us assume that a non-costly trait x evolved with a p mx of .25 under these latter conditions, and a costly trait y with a p sy (negative effect on survival success) of -.15 also evolved. That costly trait would have at a minimum a p my of .42 to have evolved, which would make it significantly more attractive to the selecting sex than the trait x. That is, (p my = .42) &gt; (p mx = .25).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does the path model assume linear relationships, and does it reflect what happens at the individual level?</head><p>At this point two fundamental questions must be addressed to clarify the nature of the relationships depicted by the path model. The first question is: Does the path model assume linear relationships? This is an important question because most relationships between variables describing natural phenomena are nonlinear <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(O'MEARA 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">WOLD et al. 2001)</ref>, and there is no reason to believe that this is a modern phenomenon. The second question is: Does the path model reflect what happens at the individual level? This is also an important question because the path model and related equations appear to break down at the individual level; e.g., an individual whose mating success is zero cannot leave offspring, and thus should have zero fitness, even though there is an alternative fitness-enhancing path in the model via survival success. Does the path model assume linear relationships? The answer is no. As noted by RICE ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>), the "covariance greater than zero" requirement for evolution, summarized earlier as the fundamental requirement for the evolution of any fitnessrelated trait through selection, has a very specific meaning. It states that the linear association between trait and fitness must be positive, whether the underlying relationship is linear or nonlinear. The reason is that the covariance between two standardized variables equals the correlation between the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(HAIR et al. 2009)</ref>, and the correlation is a measure of linear association <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(ROSENTHAL and ROSNOW 1991)</ref>. This is a point that was also stressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">HAMILTON and ZUK (1982)</ref> in their discussion of the evolution of mate choice traits. For example, let us assume that the relationship between a trait and fitness is logarithmic. The fundamental requirement for the evolution of the trait is still that it must be positively correlated with fitness, regardless of the logarithmic shape of the relationship (see also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">MCELREATH and BOYD 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does the path model reflect what happens at the individual level?</head><p>The answer is also no, because evolution is a population phenomenon. Strictly speaking, genotypes or individuals do not evolve; only populations evolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(GILLESPIE 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">HARTL and CLARK 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">LIEBERMAN et al. 2005)</ref>. Evolution refers to a process whereby a genotype appears in a population (in one or more individuals) and increases in frequency in the population, generation after generation, because the genotype codes for a phenotypic trait that confers a fitness advantage to those individuals that possess it. When this happens, it is frequently said that the genotype, and the trait it codes for, are "evolving" in the population.</p><p>A more correct assertion would have been that "the population is evolving" in regards to the genotype or trait. If the genotype codes for a trait that offers no fitness advantage, the genotype will not increase in frequency in the population via selection. The path model does not describe what happens at the individual level, it describes what happens in the population. A positive path coefficient between two variables reflects an underlying positive linear association between the two variables. Not all individuals in a population must express a trait for a positive linear association to exist between the trait and fitness, or between the trait and intermediate variables. Similarly, not all individuals in a population must mate for a positive association between mating success and fitness to exist; and not all individuals must survive to reproductive maturity for a positive association between survival success and fitness to exist.</p></div>

That is, as more independent mate selection traits are evolved, the probability that new such traits will evolve gradually decreases until it reaches zero. This does not mean that mutations that led to new traits will not appear in individuals in the subpopulation; they might, but they will not evolve, meaning that their frequency in the subpopulation will not increase. Their effect on fitness will be effectively zero, characterizing them as neutral mutations; at least until selective pressures change and "reawaken" them, so to speak.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> illustrates a situation where there are multiple independent traits used in mate choice.

Finally, let us assume that non-costly traits are 3 times as likely to evolve as costly traits. (This is consistent with the results of Monte Carlo simulations discussed later.) Given these conditions, a maximum of 12 traits used in mate choice could possibly evolve, 9 of which would be non-costly and 3 would be costly.

This can only be achieved if the traits present interdependencies; that is, if the measures of some of the traits are correlated with one another. From a mathematical perspective, the reason for this is that those interdependencies would generally reduce the values of the path coefficients between the traits and m, and thus allow for more traits used in mate choice to coexist.</p><p>Consistently with the above discussion, there are many traits used in mate choice among humans, and several show interdependencies.

The other interesting feature is that both thresholds can now assume negative values, thus making it easier for both costly and non-costly interdependent traits to evolve.</p><p>The addition of other interdependent traits significantly increases the complexity of the threshold equations, and the analysis of path models with any number of traits is beyond the scope of the arguments presented here. Nevertheless, two important conclusions can be reached based on the discussion so far. One conclusion is that the addition of new traits whose measures are correlated will generally lower the threshold for evolution of new costly and non-costly traits for mate choice. This is true whether the new traits are costly or non-costly. This effect will be counterbalanced by the crowding of the variance space caused by new traits being evolved. Another conclusion is that, as with independent traits, the more costly a trait used in mate choice is, the more attractive it is likely to be, even if its measure is correlated with that of one or more costly or non-costly traits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN FOR EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGISTS?</head><p>The mathematical analysis discussed above opens a number of avenues for future research in the field of evolutionary psychology. Among these, three are particularly important. The first refers to the use of path models similar to the ones discussed above to theorize about the evolution of complex mate choice traits (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">WELLS et al. 2009)</ref>, which would probably involve more complex paths than the ones discussed above. The second refers to the use of a sophisticated multivariate analysis method, namely path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DUNCAN 1966)</ref>, to explore modified theoretical path models leading to predictions about psychological traits in modern humans. The third avenue for future research in the field of evolutionary psychology is direct exploratory theorizing based on the basic results already suggested by the mathematical analysis, which could form the basis for novel empirical investigations on evolved psychological traits. These three avenues are discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using path models to theorize about the evolution of complex mate choice traits</head><p>The path models discussed so far are only a small subset of the models that can be developed by evolutionary psychologists to theorize about the various aspects of the evolution of mate choice traits in humans. Path modeling of the type employed in the mathematical analysis describes in a diagrammatic way the algebraic structure of the evolution of mate choice traits, as those traits spread or disappeared in ancestral populations.</p><p>Let us assume that an evolutionary psychologist has good reasons to believe that two psychological traits, one costly (y) and the other non-costly (x), have been caused by a precursor psychological trait (a) in our ancestral past. This could lead to a model like the one in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, which includes the precursor trait (a), and is thus more complex than a model incorporating only the two costly (y) and non-costly (x) traits. Let us assume, for the sake of discussion, that the psychological traits depicted above were the following: openness to new thoughts (a), degree of creative intelligence (x), and degree of schizophrenia (y). The model reflects a few theoretical expectations about the evolution of the traits among ancestral males, driven by female selection. Openness to new thoughts is hypothesized to positively influence the degrees of creative intelligence and of schizophrenia. The degree of schizophrenia of a male is hypothesized to negatively influence his mating success and survival success. That is, in this model both p my and p sy are hypothesized to be negative. The degree of creative intelligence of a male is hypothesized to positively influence his mating success. These hypotheses could be explicitly represented in the model, through plus and minus signs, for completeness.</p><p>By developing such a model a researcher must explicitly theorize relationships between evolutionarily relevant variables. This is likely to help researchers avoid naïve (a.k.a. Panglossian) evolutionary theorizing, which appears to be common in the field of evolutionary psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(CARTWRIGHT 2000)</ref>; and also convince other researchers that their theorizing is not naïve (e.g., a "just so" theory). Moreover, the relationships carry a very specific mathematical meaning. This meaning is that, for the evolution of the traits a and x to have taken place among ancestral humans, the sums of the products of the path coefficients in all possible paths connecting the two variables and fitness must have been positive.</p><p>It should be stressed that path models do not have to include all possible variables to be used in theorizing, because path models invariably assume the existence of uncorrelated error. The uncorrelated error terms refer to "hidden" variables; that is, variables that are not explicitly included in a model. This would be reflected in the assumption that a model with a small number of variables would only explain a certain percentage of the variance in the variable fitness. Mathematically speaking, that percentage of explained variance is calculated as the R-squared statistic for the variable fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(HAIR et al. 2009)</ref>, which is unlikely to equal 1 for a model with a small number of variables. Nevertheless, such a model would still be invaluable for evolutionary psychological theorizing, as it makes explicit testable relationships between traits, intermediate variables, and fitness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using path analysis to explore modified models for modern humans</head><p>Each of the path coefficients in a path model that refers to ancestral humans is a standardized partial regression coefficient. This is exactly the type of coefficient generated by multiple regression analysis and path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(HAIR et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">KLINE 1998)</ref>. Conceptually, multiple regression analysis is a special case of path analysis, as path models can be decomposed into simpler models, each with multiple independent variables pointing at a single dependent variable (i.e., multiple regression models). The same is true for most statistical tests employed in behavioral research, such as ANOVA and ANCOVA. Because these tests can be shown to be special cases of multiple regression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(RENCHER 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">ROSENTHAL and ROSNOW 1991)</ref>, they can also be shown to be special cases of path analysis.</p><p>Therefore a path model that refers to ancestral humans can be used as a basis for an empirical test involving modern humans. The results of the empirical test involving modern humans would in turn either support or falsify the original model (i.e., the one that refers to ancestral humans). Certain elements of the original model should be removed prior to the test (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). For example, the notion of fitness (w) in our ancestral past may carry little meaning in an urban population of modern humans who control their fertility, in which case the variable w should be removed. (This may not always be the case, such as in populations of modern isolated hunter-gatherers.) Survival success (s) may also be removed if the focus of the test is on the modern variable attractiveness, or a related variable (e.g., desirability as a short-term sex partner). The variable attractiveness, or a related variable, may replace, or be used as a surrogate for, mating success (m). The adaptation of an ancestral theoretical path model (i.e., that refers to ancestral humans) to produce a modern path model, as shown above, has two main advantages. One is that it allows for the retention of enough elements of the ancestral model to make it clear that the modern model tests evolved mate choice traits. The other advantage is that the analysis of the empirical data can employ any software tool that implements path analysis. Usually software tools that implement structural equation modeling, which is essentially path analysis with latent variables, also implement path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(KLINE 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">MARUYAMA 1998)</ref>.

This third avenue refers to direct exploratory theorizing based on the basic results already suggested by the mathematical analysis. Examples are provided in the following section and its subsections. These examples focus on the rarity and attractiveness of costly traits, frequency of occurrence of these traits in males and females, and undesirable side effects of costly traits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Costly traits used in mate choice by humans should be generally less common and more attractive than non-costly ones</head><p>Costly traits used in mate choice, whether they are independent of or dependent on non-costly mate choice traits, generally have a higher threshold to overcome in order to evolve than non-costly traits. That threshold is represented by the term my p ˆ in the equations, which is itself a function of the survival cost of each costly trait. Therefore, the probability of evolution of costly mate choice traits is generally lower than that of non-costly ones, which in turn suggests that costly mate choice traits should be less common in modern humans than non-costly traits. The Monte Carlo simulations (which are based on very conservative assumptions) suggest that the probability of evolution of a non-costly mate choice trait is approximately 4 times higher than that of an independent costly trait, and approximately 3 times higher than that of a costly trait whose measure is correlated with that of the noncostly trait.</p><p>Because of the higher threshold that they have to overcome in order to evolve, costly traits used in mate choice will be generally more attractive than non-costly traits, whether the costly and non-costly traits are independent or interdependent. The higher the threshold for evolution of a costly trait used in mate choice, the higher will also be: (a) the probability that the costly trait will be more attractive than a non-costly trait; and (b) the ratio of mean attractiveness of costly and noncostly traits. These of course will be true only if the costly trait evolves. The Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the probability that a costly trait will be more attractive than a non-costly trait will be 90% or higher for evolution threshold ( ) ˆmy p values of .3 and higher. In those cases, a costly mate choice trait is expected to be on average at least 70% more attractive than a non-costly trait. It is important to note that the threshold for evolution of a costly trait can be high even if the survival cost of the trait is relatively low. This will occur as long as the ratio p ws / p wm is high.</p><p>The above conclusions are consistent with non-costly mate choice traits appearing to be much more common than costly traits in both human males and females. Some examples of non-costly traits are height and upper-body musculature in males, and hip-to-waist ratio and skin condition in females <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(BUSS 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(BUSS , 1999;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">CARTWRIGHT 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">FINK et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">FURNHAM et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">MILLER 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">SHACKELFORD et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">SINGH and RANDALL 2007)</ref>. The above conclusions are also consistent with creative intelligence being considered to be one of the most attractive mental traits in human males <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(HASELTON and MILLER 2006)</ref>; creative intelligence seems to be strongly correlated with certain harmful mental disorders in humans, such as schizophrenia, which likely posed a significant survival handicap to our human ancestors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(KELLER and MILLER 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">NESSE and WILLIAMS 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Costly traits used in mate choice should be disproportionately less common in human females than males</head><p>The previous discussion based on life history theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(ANDERSON 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">HILL and KAPLAN 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">KOKKO 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">LANDE 1982)</ref> and its application to humans and their ancestors during the Pleistocene suggests that the ratio p ws / p wm may have had significantly higher values for females than males. The ratio provides a measure of the relative effect of survival on fitness compared with the effect of mating on fitness. It is likely to increase as the survival of the individual to which the ratio refers becomes more important than his or her mating success in the generation of surviving offspring. Survival success is likely to be significantly more important than mating success in females, in terms of their effect on fitness.</p><p>The above conclusion was prominently acknowledged by both DARWIN (1871) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">FISHER (1930)</ref> as being at the forefront of their thinking on sexual selection. It is also consistent with Bateman's principle, which states that females are a limiting resource in any population <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(BATEMAN 1948;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">HARTL and CLARK 2007)</ref>. It follows from several key observations, including the following: (a) human females are the ones that produce eggs, and thus the number of healthy females is highly correlated with the number of surviving offspring produced by any population of humans (this also applies to the vast majority of animals); (b) since males are much less selective of their sexual partners than females, the survival success of human females is of much more importance for the number of surviving offspring than their mating success; and (c) human females are the ones that provide the most care to infants, particularly during the years the infants are most vulnerable to survival threats.</p><p>Based on a detailed analysis of viability and reproduction tables for various human groups, FISHER (1930) also noted that the survival success of ancestral female humans was so important as to justify infanticide (or severe infant neglect) under very poor environmental conditions (e.g., extreme scarcity of food), so that the females could maintain their health to bear children when the environmental conditions improved. That discussion was presented as part of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">FISHER's (1930)</ref> formulation of what he refers to as the Malthusian parameter of population increase, which relates the coefficients of survival and mating in one single equation that applies to various populations under different conditions.</p><p>As noted earlier, the ratio of the effects of survival and mating on fitness, represented by the term p ws / p wm in the equations, has a disproportionately high impact on the probability of evolution of costly traits used in mate choice. The greater is the ratio, the lower is the probability of evolution of costly traits, with the probability quickly approaching zero as the term increases. For example, increasing the range of random variation of that term from 1 to 3 to the range 3 to 6 in the Monte Carlo simulations with interdependent traits makes the probability of evolution of a costly trait 3 times less likely (a reduction from approximately 30% to 10%). Similar probability reductions are observed regardless of the costly trait's dependence on other costly or non-costly traits. Based on this and the above discussion, one can thus conclude that the term p ws / p wm would likely have reached values in the Pleistocene that would have made costly traits used in mate choice much less likely to have evolved in ancestral females than in males, and thus much less common in modern human females than in males.</p><p>The above conclusion is consistent with costly mate choice traits being observed in human males but not in females. An example of costly trait displayed by men and found attractive by women is the presence of facial features indicating high levels of testosterone (e.g., angular facial features), since testosterone is hypothesized to suppress the immune system and thus act as a costly indicator of high immune system effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(GANGESTAD and THORNHILL 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">RHODES et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">THORNHILL and GANGESTAD 2006)</ref>. There apparently are no such costly mate choice traits in human females (see, e.g., BUSS 1995).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Certain harmful human mental disorders may have evolved as costs of attractive mental traits</head><p>Certain harmful mental disorders in humans, such as schizophrenia, are often seen as puzzles from an evolutionary perspective. In some cases, the heritability of mental disorders and their frequency in the population at various levels of severity suggests that they may have been evolved through selection, yet they often significantly decrease the survival prospects of those afflicted by them <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(KELLER and MILLER 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">NESSE and WILLIAMS 1994)</ref>. The question often asked is why have they evolved at all? Should not they have been eliminated, instead of maintained, by selective forces? The discussion in the previous sections allows for the conclusion that the most straightforward explanation for the existence of certain mental disor-ders is that they have co-evolved as costs of attractive mental traits. Not all mental disorders, however, can be explained in this way.</p><p>The telltale signs of a mental disorder that is likely to be a cost associated with a trait used in mate choice are: (a) many of the individuals afflicted are also found to have an attractive mental trait; and (b) the mental trait in question should be comparatively more attractive than other mental traits that have no apparent survival costs associated with them. The broad category of mental disorders generally referred to as schizophrenia is a good candidate in this respect because: (a) its incidence in human males is significantly correlated with creative intelligence, the type of intelligence generally displayed by successful artists, which is an attractive mental trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(MILLER and TAL 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">NETTLE 2006b)</ref>; and (b) creative intelligence is considered to be one of the most attractive mental traits in human males, to the point of females at the peak of their fertility cycles finding creative but poor males significantly more attractive than uncreative but wealthy ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(HASELTON and MILLER 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">CRESPI (2006)</ref>, in a response to a thorough and provocative argument by KEL-LER and MILLER ( <ref type="formula">2006</ref>) regarding the evolutionary bases of mental disorders, makes a point that is similar to the one made above (see, also, NETTLE 2006), and also notes that schizophrenia has a less debilitating effect on human females than males. Ancestral human females, due to their preference for males showing high levels of creative intelligence, might have also selected a co-evolved cost that affects not only males by also the females themselves through gene correlation between the sexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(GILLESPIE 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">MAYNARD SMITH 1998)</ref>. Other traits that differentiate females from males, however, may account for differences in the actual survival cost of schizophrenia in females and males. For example, males show a greater propensity toward risk-taking than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(BUSS 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">MILLER 2000)</ref>, and schizophrenia may positively moderate the negative relationship between risktaking propensity and survival success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Several original contributions were made in the preceding sections. A new mathematical framework for reasoning about evolution of traits through selection was presented whereby several important conclusions can be derived by means of simple algebraic operations. The framework combines the Price Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(PRICE 1970)</ref> with the path analysis method <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(WRIGHT 1934</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(WRIGHT , 1960))</ref>, by deriving a fundamental requirement for evolution of traits through selection that relies on the relationship between standardized measures of fitness and traits. Costly traits used in mate choice are defined, as part of the mathematical framework, as traits that increase mating success while at the same time decreasing survival success.</p><p>The mathematical framework is then used to show how path models can be used by evolutionary psychologists to theorize about the evolution of complex mate choice traits, and how theoretical models can be tested with modern humans through the method of path analysis. The mathematical framework is also used in the development of conclusions regarding the evolution of independent traits used in mate choice, the limit on the number of independent traits used in mate choice, the evolution of interdependencies among those traits, and the probability of evolution and relative attractiveness of those traits.</p><p>The conclusions stemming from the mathematical analysis are in turn used to develop key exploratory hypotheses, which can be summarized as follows: costly traits used in mate choice by humans should be generally less common and more attractive than non-costly ones, costly traits should be disproportionately less common in human females than males, and certain harmful human mental disorders may have co-evolved as costs of attractive mental traits.</p><p>It should be noted that the discussion presented here does not directly address the speed at which a trait may evolve in a population through selection. That speed, often measured in generations, is a function of the non-standardized impact of a trait on fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(HARTL and CLARK 2007)</ref>. That impact is the selective advantage that the trait confers on the individuals that possess it, in terms of how many more surviving offspring they generate. The equations included here are expressed in path coefficients, which are essentially standardized coefficients of association. For example, a non-costly trait measure may be strongly associated with fitness if both measures closely approach a line when plotted. But the trait's absolute, as opposed to standardized, impact on fitness may be much lower at a given point in time than that of a costly trait whose association with fitness is less strong. In this case, the costly trait will have the weakest association with fitness of the two and yet may evolve significantly faster.</p><p>The reason for the evolution of costly traits used in mate selection presented here differs from that proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">ZAHAVI (1975)</ref>, whose core argument is that for animal signals to be reliable they also must be costly (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">: ZAHAVI 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">ZA-HAVI and ZAHAVI 1997)</ref>. This is the essence of Zahavi's handicap principle, which applies to animal signals in general, of which many traits used in mate choice can be seen as a subclass. There is little doubt that costly traits are indeed useful in mate choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(GRAFEN 1990)</ref>; this is chiefly due to the fact they are hard to fake. However, the notion that mate choice traits must be costly to be reliable conflicts with a few simple facts: (a) they are a lot less common in nature than non-costly mate choice traits, even though they are presumably more reliable; and (b) they are predominantly observed in males, and rarely in females, even though males also choose females for mating.</p><p>The large train displayed by the male in the peacock species has been presented as strong evidence in support of the handicap principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(ZAHAVI and ZAHAVI 1997</ref>). Yet, the male peacock also has other traits that are apparently used in mate choice and that are not costly, such as the crest atop its head and the brightly colored feathers on its chest. If the costly trait, namely the train, is the only reliable one, it is puzzling that evolution would favor the existence of multiple costly and non-costly traits used for mate choice.</p><p>Costly traits used in mate choice appear to be less likely to have evolved, and as likely to have been more attractive than non-costly traits, if and when they evolved. The reason for their rarity and attractiveness is that costly traits must overcome a threshold to evolve, where the threshold is a function of their survival cost. They must be so attractive to the members of the opposite sex that their survival cost is offset by the mating advantage conferred by them. These conclusions are consistent with the fact that the male peacock has more non-costly than costly traits used in mate choice by females. The conclusions are also consistent with the finding by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">PETRIE et al. (1991)</ref> that the train of the male peacock, and especially the number of eye spots on the train, is by far the most attractive trait for the peahens.</p><p>Those conclusions arguably open the door for a new understanding of the evolution of mate choice traits in various species, including humans, where what is costly to evolve is not necessarily more reliable yet is (in terms of overall fitness) costly not to use.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
