<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research examined the link between conspiracy beliefs and political decisions in the context of the 2016 European Union referendum in the United Kingdom. In a longitudinal study, we surveyed British participants at two-time points (one week before the referendum vs. immediately after the referendum). At both time points, participants (n = 334) indicated their belief in conspiracy theories specific to the referendum, their general tendencies toward conspiracy theorising, their political orientation, and support for leaving the EU, followed by how they voted in the referendum, taken at Time 2. Using cross-lagged path analysis, we found that conspiracy beliefs specific to the referendum predicted both support for leaving the EU, and voting to leave the EU, above and beyond political orientation. We also found that the general tendency towards conspiracy theorising predicted belief in conspiracy theories relevant to the referendum, which subsequently led to increased support for leaving the EU. The chief novelty of this research lies in its longitudinal design, allowing us to conclude that conspiracy beliefs precede political behaviours in a temporal sequence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>Examining the links between conspiracy beliefs and the EU "Brexit" referendum vote in the UK: evidence from a two-wave survey</p><p>In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU), with a majority of 51.9% leave to 48.1% remain. This event has become commonly known as "Brexit", and studies have shown that factors such as concerns about immigration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abrams &amp; Travaglino, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Swami, et al., 2017)</ref>, negative intergroup contact with EU immigrants <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Meleady, et al., 2017)</ref>, and British collective narcissism (Golec de <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Zavala, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marchlewska, et al., 2018)</ref> all predicted support for the Leave vote. However, the media consumption patterns around Brexit was also blighted by disinformation and conspiracy theories that were polarized <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Del Vicario, et al., 2017)</ref>. Many conspiracy theories emerged about the fairness of the voting system, secret collaborations with the EU, and about the motives of politicians who abruptly 'defected' to the other side before the vote (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bienkov, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Payne, 2016)</ref>. In the current research, we empirically examine the influence of such conspiracy theories on people's voting in the referendum.</p><p>Conspiracy theories are attempts to explain the ultimate causes of significant social and political events and circumstances with claims of secret plots by two or more powerful actors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Douglas, et al., 2019)</ref>. Popular conspiracy theories blame governments, scientists, people of the Jewish faith and many others for the ills of society rather than attributing these ills to accidents or natural occurrences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cichocka et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jolley &amp; Douglas, 2014a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jolley, Meleady, et al., 2020)</ref>. Conspiracy theories are popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Oliver &amp; Wood, 2014)</ref>, and it is theorised that they resonate with so many people because they promise to satisfy important psychological motives <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Douglas, et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, people who are feeling anxious, uncertain, insecure, and powerless are more likely to subscribe to conspiracy theories, presumably in an attempt to reduce those feelings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abalakina-Paap, et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Grzesiak-Feldman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kofta, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marchlewska, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Prooijen &amp; Jostmann, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Running head: CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND BREXIT 4 4</p><p>Research has demonstrated that belief in conspiracy theories can increase throughout a political campaign (Golec de <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Zavala &amp; Federico, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kofta &amp; Sedek, 2005)</ref>, and indeed, conspiracy theories were a prominent feature in the Leave campaign in the run-up to the referendum <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Payne, 2016)</ref>. For example, popular Brexit-specific conspiracy theories proposed that the UK government planted Remain supports within the Leave campaign who 'defected' to the other side at crucial moments. Another conspiracy theory proposed that the government staged the voter registration website crash as a way to register as many Remain voters as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bienkov, 2016)</ref>. Finally, there was a significant amount of suspicion amongst Leave supporters that the British establishment and MI5 would erase their pencil votes and that they should, therefore, take a pen into the ballot box <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Griffin, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Research has shown that conspiracy theories change people's attitudes on important issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2008</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jolley, Mari, et al., 2020</ref> for reviews). For example, exposure to conspiracy theories has been shown to influence people's intentions to vote and engage in climate-friendly behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jolley &amp; Douglas, 2014a)</ref>, and to vaccinate their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jolley &amp; Douglas, 2014b)</ref>. Reading about conspiracy theories also makes people more willing to engage in low-level crime <ref type="bibr">(Jolley, et al. 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Other research has shown that conspiracy beliefs are positively linked to outgroup hostility (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Biddlestone et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Marchlewska, et al., 2019)</ref> and support for violence towards alleged conspirators <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jolley &amp; Paterson, 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, reading about anti-Semitic conspiracy theories increases prejudice and discrimination towards people of the Jewish faith <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jolley, Meleady, et al., 2020</ref>; but also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bilewicz, et al., 2013)</ref>. An important question to ask, therefore, is how conspiracy theories might have influenced people's attitudes, intentions, and voting behaviours surrounding the EU referendum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Swami et al. (2017)</ref> provided correlational evidence that such conspiracy theories may indeed have been influential. Their research examined relationships between Islamophobia, 5 perceived threat from Muslim immigrants, belief in Islamophobic conspiracy theories, and intentions to vote Leave in the referendum. Relevant to the current study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Swami et al. (2017)</ref> found that belief in Islamophobic conspiracy theories-that relate to Muslim immigration and proposed attempts to "Islamicise" Europe-mediated the link between Islamophobia and intention to vote Leave. Therefore, belief in conspiracy theories provided a link between negative attitudes toward one group (Muslims), and the intention to vote Leave in the referendum. However, the cross-sectional nature of this study provided little opportunity to examine these associations over time.</p><p>Another issue left open by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Swami et al. (2017)</ref> is the role of broader conspiracy beliefs in predicting support for leaving the EU. A consistent finding in the psychological literature is that beliefs in conspiracy theories are strongly correlated with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goertzel, 1994)</ref>. That is, people who already believe in one conspiracy theory are likely to also believe in other, even mutually contradictory conspiracy theories <ref type="bibr">(Wood, et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>This may indicate an underlying tendency to believe in conspiracy theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Douglas, et al., 2019)</ref>, which then may predict belief in other specific conspiracy theories, such as those surrounding Brexit. It is therefore possible that more general conspiracy theorising also influenced the Brexit vote, via the endorsement of Brexit-specific conspiracy theories.</p><p>It is also important to consider is the potential contribution of political orientation.</p><p>Research has shown that conspiracy beliefs are strongest at the political extremes.</p><p>Specifically, <ref type="bibr">van Prooijen, et al. (2015)</ref> demonstrated a quadratic effect ("U-shape"), in which conspiracy beliefs were strongest at the far left and far right. However, <ref type="bibr">van Prooijen et al. (2015)</ref> also found that conspiracy beliefs were stronger on the far right, which is a finding that has been supported by other scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Galliford &amp; Furnham, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">van der Linden, et al., 2020)</ref>. Focusing on the Brexit vote, YouGov (2016) provided evidence that the vote cut across party lines, where 65% of Conservatives voted Leave compared to 35% of Labour Running head: CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND BREXIT 6 6 voters. Also, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO)</p><p>were shown to predict people's intention to vote Leave (Golec de <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Zavala, et al., 2017)</ref>. In a similar vein, a meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr">Wilson and Sibley (2013)</ref> found that SDO and RWA predicted high levels of political conservatism. These findings highlight the role that political orientation may have played in predicting the Brexit vote. It is therefore important to examine the role of Brexit-specific conspiracy beliefs in predicting voting intentions and behaviours whilst taking into account voters' political orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Research</head><p>The current research aimed to explore the relationship between belief in conspiracy theories and support for leaving the EU, alongside reported voting behaviour in the EU referendum. In a longitudinal study with two waves (one week before the referendum vs.</p><p>immediately after the referendum), participants were asked to indicate their belief in Brexitspecific conspiracy theories and their support for leaving the EU (at Time 1 and Time 2) and how they actually voted (taken at Time 2) in the referendum. We also measured general conspiracy beliefs and participants' political orientation. We predicted that stronger belief in Brexit-specific conspiracy theories would predict both supporting leaving the EU and voting</p><p>Leave (at Time 2) and that more right-wing political orientation would also be associated with supporting leaving the EU and voting Leave (at Time 2). We also predicted that general conspiracy beliefs would predict specific (Brexit) conspiracy beliefs, resulting in an increased likelihood of supporting leaving the EU. A distinct contribution of this research is that a longitudinal design allows us to examine the causal relationship between conspiracy beliefs and political behaviours using cross-lagged path analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and design</head><p>Running head: CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND BREXIT 7 7</p><p>Four hundred participants (218 women, 178 men, 3 Trans/Other and 1 who would rather not say, Mage = 32.55, SD = 11.84) were recruited via the crowdsourcing platform Prolific at Time 1 (15 th June 2016, 1 week before the referendum vote that took place on 23 rd June 2016). The survey took approximately 7 minutes to complete, where participants were paid 85 pence for their participation (equivalent to £9.14 per hour, as advertised to participants on Prolific). Participants were invited to complete Time 2 measures on the day after the referendum (24 th June 2016) and were paid £1 (equivalent to £12.21 per hour). The analyses we report focus on data obtained from 350 participants who completed both waves of the study (a retention rate of 87.5% i ). Some exclusions were made. Participants were required to be British citizens who reside in the United Kingdom and must have passed an attention screen. Specifically, participants were asked if they devoted their full attention to the study and if there were any distractions. Participants who rated four and above (out of five, with five indicating no attention and many distractions) on the attention screen were removed from analyses. The final sample (n = 334) comprised of 184 women, 147 men, 3</p><p>Trans/Other and 1 who would rather not say, with a Mage = 33.35 (SD = 11.98).</p><p>In both waves, participants were asked to complete a series of measures which formed our predictor variables-specifically, belief in Brexit-specific conspiracy theories, general belief in conspiracy theories, and political orientation. At Time 1 and 2, participants were asked to indicate their support for leaving the EU, and Time 2 they were also asked to indicate how they actually voted, which formed our two criterion variables.</p></div>

These were answered on a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree). Participants also completed the single-item conspiracy belief scale to measure their general tendency to believe in conspiracy theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lantian, et al., 2016)</ref>. In this measure, participants were given a brief preamble and were asked to indicate if they agree that "I think that the official version of the events given by the authorities very often hides the truth", on a seven-point scale (1 = completely false, 7 = completely true).

We also added gender and age as covariates at Time 1 and regressed all Time 2 measures on these variables. This analysis used the maximum likelihood with robust standard errors, which is the default estimator for this type of analysis in Mplus. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the current research, participants with higher belief in Brexit-specific conspiracy theories measured at Time 1 were more likely to have supported leaving the EU, and have voted Leave, when voting behaviour was measured at Time 2. This finding occurred above and beyond the participants' political orientation. We also found that general conspiracy beliefs measured at Time 1 predicted Brexit-related conspiracy beliefs, which in turn predicted supporting leaving the EU at Time 2. This supports previous research linking general conspiracy theorising and with conspiracy theorising about real-world beliefs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Douglas, et al., 2019)</ref>. Together, this research suggests that Brexit-specific (and more general) conspiracy thinking may have played a part in the result of the EU referendum.</p><p>Previous research has shown that conspiracy theories influence people's social and political intentions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Douglas &amp; Sutton, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jolley, Mari, et al., 2020)</ref>. However, a limitation of existing research is that it has typically measured intentions rather than behaviours (with the exception of van der Linden, 2015). The present research, therefore, makes an important advance to our understanding of the consequences of conspiracy theories.</p><p>It is worth noting that even when controlling for political orientation, Brexit-specific conspiracy beliefs were a strong predictor of supporting leaving the EU and voting Leave.</p><p>Specifically, when we included Brexit conspiracy theories, the link between political</p><p>Running head: CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND BREXIT 12 12 orientation and Leave vote was found to be non-significant. This finding is important because we know from other research that right-wing political convictions predicted voting Leave (Golec de <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Zavala, et al., 2017)</ref>. The current research suggests that Brexit-specific conspiracy beliefs may have played a greater role in predicting the Brexit vote than people's political orientation.</p><p>The current research also provides evidence that general conspiracy beliefs predict specific conspiracy beliefs-in this case, Brexit conspiracy beliefs-which were associated with the likelihood of supporting leaving the EU. Previous research has shown that that conspiracy beliefs are often correlated with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goertzel, 1994)</ref>; however, this is the first study to provide longitudinal evidence that a general towards conspiracy beliefs predicts belief a specific conspiracy theory (Brexit), which can then translate into political decisions. Thus, whilst believing in the general idea that others are acting in secret for their own gain was not directly associated with the Leave vote, our findings showcase the indirect effect of endorsing more general beliefs in conspiracy theories.</p><p>Whilst the current research has noteworthy strengths, there are nevertheless some limitations. For example, whilst we recorded self-reported actual behavior (at  i Using a logistic regression model, we found that the variables used in the investigation at Time 1 (Brexit conspiracy belief, general conspiracy belief, support for Leave, and political orientation) did not predict attrition at Time 2.</p><p>ii We also included other measures that were part of a broader investigation and were not analysed as part of this study. Specifically, participants indicated their attitudes towards the European Union (EU), EU system justification, feelings of powerlessness, collective narcissism, UK identification, self-esteem, narcissism, trust, political hopelessness and alienation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>vote, do you think the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?" on a 7-point scale (1 = definitely remain, 7 = definitely leave), which was taken as a measure of support for leaving the EU. Participants were also asked at Time 2 how they actually voted in the EU referendum ("In the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, how did you vote?) with three possible responses (1 = I did not vote [23 participants, 6.9%], 2 = Remain [231 participants, 69.2%], 3 = Leave [80 participants, 24%]). Finally, participants completed a series of demographic questions, alongside 9 indicating their political orientation (0 = extremely left-wing; 11 = extremely right-wing).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>10 Time 1</head><label>101</label><figDesc>here] Time 2 support for leaving the EU was positively predicted by Time 1 Brexit specific conspiracy beliefs (B = 0.16, SE = 0.06, p = .01), but not Time 1 general conspiracy beliefs (B = -0.09, SE = 0.05, p = .06) or political orientation (linear, B = 0.05, SE = 0.03, p = .15; squared, B = 0.02, SE= 0.01, p = .052). Time 2 support for leaving the EU was also positively predicted by age (B = .01, SE= 0.01, p = .03), but not gender (B = -0.24, SE = 0.14, p = .08). Time 2 Brexit specific conspiracy beliefs were predicted by Time 1 support for leaving the EU (B = 0.17, SE = 0.03, p &lt; .001), and Time 1 general conspiracy beliefs (B = 0.10, SE = 0.04, p = .01). Time 2 general conspiracy beliefs were not predicted by Time 1 support for leaving the EU (B = 0.01, SE = 0.04, p = .84) but were positively predicted by Running head: CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND BREXIT 10 Brexit specific conspiracy beliefs (B = 0.21, SE = 0.06, p = .001). Neither Time 2 Brexit specific conspiracy beliefs nor general conspiracy beliefs were predicted by Time 1 political orientation (linear, B = 0.03, SE = 0.03, p = .33, squared, B = 0.01, SE = 0.01, p = .56; linear, B = -0.02, SE = 0.04, p = .51, squared, B = 0.01, SE = 0.01, p = .44, respectively).We then examined the indirect effect of Brexit-specific conspiracy beliefs mediating between general conspiracy beliefs and support for leaving the EU, controlling for political orientation. This can be achieved by testing the indirect effect of Time 1 general conspiracy beliefs on Time 2 Brexit-specific conspiracy beliefs by Time 1 Brexit-specific conspiracy beliefs on Time 2 support for leaving the EU<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cole &amp; Maxwell, 2003)</ref>. We estimated the effect with 5,000 bootstrapped resamples. The indirect effect was significant, estimate = .02 [0.001, 0.041]. Brexit-specific conspiracy beliefs accounted for the link between general conspiracy beliefs and increased support for leaving the EU.Next, we ran a model with Time 2 self-reported voting as the nominal outcome variable, predicted by both specific and general conspiracy beliefs. In this model, we examined the effects of specific and general conspiracy beliefs, and political orientation measured at Time 1 on the same variables as well as voting measured at Time 2. The model compared voting Leave (coded as 0 as a reference category) to voting Remain (coded as 1) or</figDesc></figure>
