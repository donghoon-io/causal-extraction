<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>citizens can monitor and infl uence government processes through access to government information and access to decision-making arenas" <ref type="bibr">(2012,</ref><ref type="bibr">13)</ref>.</p><p>A variety of platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and YouTube, allow public agencies to foster engagement with citizens and representative organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Criado, Sandoval-Almazan, and Gil-Garcia 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bertot, Jaeger, and Hansen (2012, 30)</ref> indicate that social media refers to a set of online tools that are designed for social interaction. Th e more precise term is "social network sites." Boyd and Ellison provide the following comprehensive defi nition: "We defi ne social network sites as web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semipublic profi le within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system" <ref type="bibr">(2007,</ref><ref type="bibr">211)</ref>.</p><p>Th e microblogging platform Twitter is a specifi c type of a social networking site in the sense that it enables the user to send only brief messages (140 characters). Twitter users can share messages with other groups by forwarding them or commenting on them. In addition, it is an asymmetric medium: users can follow an account without being followed. Th ese features make Twitter particularly useful for disseminating short messages to specifi c user groups.</p><p>Over the past several years, use of social media by governments to communicate with citizens has exploded (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mossberger, Wu, and Crawford 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mergel (2012a)</ref> shows that in 2012, the 698 departments, agencies, and initiatives of the U.S. federal government had already created 2,956 Facebook pages, 1,016 Twitter accounts, 695 YouTube channels, and 498 Flickr pages. Th is number is probably a low estimate, as it only acknowledges formal and central use.</p><p>Th e popularity of social media might be explained by its limited cost, and high expected benefi ts may explain the current surge in social media use. A key advantage of social media is that no expensive technology and no complex skills are needed to use them <ref type="bibr">(Mergel 2012b)</ref>. In contrast to previously introduced e-government systems, such as websites and forums, individual users can immediately start using social media. Organizations do not need to invest in expensive new technology, and the promise of social media is high <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bertot, Jaeger, and Grimes 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Criado, Sandoval-Almazan, and Gil-Garcia 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Many authors have explored social media from the perspective of government organizations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bertot, Jaeger, and Grimes 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Campbell, Lambright, and Wells 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crump 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mergel 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mossberger, Wu, and Crawford 2013)</ref>. Th ese analyses treat social media use as a strategic choice by government organizations, but it is important to note that the pattern of social media use results from the actions of both governments and citizens. Governments that only use social media to deliver messages to citizens and never ask for feedback or react to comments or posts from citizens limit their ability to communicate. However, communication may also take the form of informing, such that Social media use by public organizations has attracted the attention of scholars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mossberger, Wu, and Crawford (2013)</ref>, for example, have studied the increased adoption of Facebook and Twitter in local governments, and various scholars have shown how social media can be used strategically <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campbell, Lambright, and Wells 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mergel 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mergel and Bretschneider 2013)</ref>. However, the literature is still scant as to the eff ects of social media on citizens' attitudes and, specifi cally, on perceived legitimacy. Th is is particularly relevant to policing and perceived legitimacy because solving crimes and ensuring public safety greatly depend on cooperation from the community <ref type="bibr">(Tyler 2004)</ref>. Th erefore, this article analyzes how and to what extent social media contributes to perceived police legitimacy.</p><p>Some researchers believe that social media enhances legitimacy because of its presumed capacity to improve transparency and strengthen citizen participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bertot, Jaeger, and Grimes 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kim, Park, and Rho 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mossberger, Wu, and Crawford 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Oliveira and Welch 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yi, Oh, and Kim 2013)</ref>. A less understood reason is that social media use conveys the message that the police are a modern organization in touch with society (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bekkers and Homburg 2007)</ref>. Th is image of modernity might have a positive eff ect on the perceived legitimacy of the police. However, Twitter and other social media can actually decrease perceptions of police legitimacy. As the Twitter backfi re in New York City shows, Twitter can help citizens disseminate negative images and/or stereotypes of police, which may undermine their support for the police. Experimental evidence into government transparency seems to confi rm this negative eff ect (de Fine Licht 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grimmelikhuijsen et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, police and other public service providers are increasingly present on Twitter and other social media, but the eff ects on perceived legitimacy are debated and understudied. Th erefore, we examine the following central question: To what extent, how, and why does Twitter use by citizens contribute to perceived police legitimacy?</p><p>Th is article provides a key contribution to our understanding of the relationship between social media use and perceived police legitimacy by reporting fi ndings from a survey of 4,492 citizens in the Netherlands including social media users and nonusers. By using a large sample that is representative in terms of age, sex, and education, this survey can establish relationships and patterns between social media use and perceived legitimacy. Th e analysis is instrumental in understanding open government by testing the theoretical mechanisms through which social media use contributes to perceived legitimacy. In addition, the analysis shows the extent and magnitude of the relationship between social media and legitimacy using structural equation modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Media for Open Government</head><p>Social media communications can be seen as one of the technological drivers of open government programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mergel 2013</ref>). Meijer, Curtin, and Hillebrandt present the following defi nition of open government: "Openness of government is the extent to which Governments that only use social media to deliver messages to citizens and never ask for feedback or react to comments or posts from citizens limit their ability to communicate.</p><p>organizations. Suchman notes that in order to achieve legitimacy, an organization must meet the substantive needs of its audience. Ultimately, a strategy for seeking organizational legitimacy is "actually to produce concrete, meritorious outcomes" <ref type="bibr">(Suchman 1995, 587-88)</ref>. We call this source of legitimacy perceived eff ectiveness, and we expect this to be related to social media use because social media strengthens transparency and participation. Th e basic argument for the relationship between transparency and perceived eff ectiveness is that citizens perceive government as being eff ective if it informs them about policies that yield good results <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Grimmelikhuijsen and Meijer 2014)</ref>. As for the relationship between participation and perceived eff ectiveness, the reasoning is that citizens may enhance an organization's eff ectiveness by providing input. For example, citizens can use Twitter to help police forces solve crimes by providing additional information. Th e expectation is that this type of engagement results in a more positive evaluation of the organization's performance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fledderus, Brandsen, and Honingh 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, scholars have recently found that increased transparency can also have a negative eff ect on perceived eff ectiveness (see de Fine Licht 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grimmelikhuijsen et al. 2013)</ref>. For instance, when police tweet negative messages about their performance or make appeals for help with unsolved cases, the public may view the police as being less eff ective. Th at said, our focus is on the messages tweeted by the police, which are more focused on their achievements than on their failures. In that sense, only a one-sided form of transparency is being created. Considering the foregoing, we formulate the following hypotheses:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Higher levels of perceived eff ectiveness are associated with higher levels of perceived legitimacy.</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Informative use of Twitter by citizens (transparency) is associated with higher levels of perceived eff ectiveness.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Interactive use of Twitter by citizens (participation) is associated with higher levels of perceived eff ectiveness.</p><p>Another source of legitimacy is perceived procedural fairness. Th is dimension is based on citizens' perceptions of fair treatment by the police. Perceived procedural fairness has been found to be an important predictor of legitimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sunshine and Tyler 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tyler 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">Tyler , 2004))</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tyler and Degoey (1995)</ref> found that citizen support increases when people feel that procedures are fair and that positive, relational bonds with authorities determine procedural fairness. Perceived procedural fairness entails various dimensions of government-citizen interaction. For example, being treated with respect and being given voice are dimensions of citizen-government interactions (Van den Bos, Vermunt, and Wilke 1997). Overall, we expect perceptions of procedural fairness to result in more perceived legitimacy.</p><p>Twitter's ability to increase both transparency and participation may enhance this procedural source of legitimacy. Th e argument for a positive relationship between the transparency generated by social media and perceived procedural fairness is that we expect citizens only read government messages and never react or interact with these government organizations. Interactive patterns result from the actions of both governments and citizens.</p><p>Th is discussion highlights the need to analyze social media in the context of open government in terms of interactive and informative use of social media from the perspective of both government organizations and citizens. Currently, few studies have investigated how citizens use social media to communicate with governments and how these contacts infl uence their perceptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impacts of Social Media Use on Perceived Legitimacy</head><p>A key aim of social media policies is to improve perceived legitimacy. In his seminal work on legitimacy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Weber (1968)</ref> argued that people's adherence to the instructions of authorities is caused not only by the power that an authority wields over them. At the core of legitimacy is a voluntary compliance with authority. Voluntary compliance means that people do not "just" comply with the law out of fear of punishment but choose to do so voluntarily. Legitimacy stems from an internalized feeling to willingly obey authority or rules, without any actual coercion from authorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lipset 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tyler 1997)</ref>, which is a crucial notion for the eff ectiveness of law enforcement agencies such as the police. In this article, we adhere to the much-cited defi nition of legitimacy by Suchman: "Legitimacy is a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and defi nitions" <ref type="bibr">(1995,</ref><ref type="bibr">574)</ref>.</p><p>Th is defi nition fi rst shows that legitimacy is "generalized": it transcends a single incident. Legitimacy is not built overnight but takes time to develop and extend. Second, Suchman refers to "perception or assumption" in his defi nition. In this article, we focus on subjective legitimacy because of the importance of citizens' perceptions in social media use. Th ird, legitimacy is socially constructed. Th is part of the defi nition refl ects the consonance between the acts of the organization and the shared beliefs of a community. Th e quest for legitimacy is of specifi c relevance to the police because eff ective policing without legitimacy is hardly feasible: police work relies on legitimacy for voluntary citizen support <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hinds and Murphy 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tyler 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Legitimacy theorists stress that organizations continuously interact with relevant stakeholders in their environment to sustain their legitimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Elsbach 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Suchman 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Suddaby and Greenwood 2005)</ref>. Organizational legitimation through interaction with the environment has taken a new turn with the emergence of social media, which may contribute to two important sources of police legitimacy: perceived eff ectiveness and perceived procedural fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hawdon, Ryan, and Griffi n 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tyler 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">Tyler , 2006))</ref>. Perceived eff ectiveness is instrumental and based on police performance and outcomes, whereas perceived procedural fairness highlights the rightness of processes and treatment of citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Scharpf 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Suchman 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tyler 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Perceived eff ectiveness is an outcome-based source of legitimacy that results from positive citizen evaluations of the eff ectiveness of public Organizational legitimation through interaction with the environment has taken a new turn with the emergence of social media.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows that transparency is achieved mainly when citizens use Twitter passively to receive police information, whereas participation is attained by interaction and exchange of information. Furthermore, we should note that although we use theoretical assumptions about the direction of each separate causal eff ect, this study is cross-sectional and thus cannot provide any conclusive evidence about cause and eff ect in this model. We will go over this issue in greater detail in the Discussion section.</p><p>Institutional Context: Social Media in the Dutch Police Forces Until 2013, the Dutch police were divided into relatively autonomous regional police forces. In 2013, these regional forces were merged into the "National Police" with the idea that this would increase the eff ectiveness and effi ciency of the police force. One of the strategic priorities of this new organization is to enhance its legitimacy, which underlines the relevance of this study (Nationale Politie 2012).</p><p>Th e use of social media by the Dutch police force forms an interesting case, 1 as the police have gained an impactful and "exciting" image through crime reality television shows <ref type="bibr">(Fishman and Cavender 1998)</ref>. Th e expectation is that citizens will also be highly interested in police communications. In addition, police forces in the Netherlands are already using social media platforms such as Twitter extensively <ref type="bibr">(Meijer et al. 2013)</ref>. Although comparative studies are scant, this indicates that the Netherlands may be ahead of most countries with regard to strategic use of social media and Twitter by the police. Th is is perhaps related to the widespread use of social media in the Netherlands. According to Eurostat, an average of 40 percent of European Union citizens between 16 and 75 years old were using social media in 2011. In the Netherlands, this percentage was 60 percent, making the Netherlands the country with the most social media users in the European Union.</p><p>Th e Dutch police are mostly using Twitter but also, to some extent, YouTube, blogs, and Facebook to communicate with citizens. In 2012, there were more than 1,000 Twitter accounts in total, which sent more than 500,000 tweets. Th e police use Twitter to strengthen contacts with citizens, boost feelings of safety, improve their image and knowledge about its forces, and obtain information from citizens <ref type="bibr">(Meijer et al. 2013)</ref>. Th e content of social media use is quite diverse but includes information for citizens, requests for cooperation, and communication of "successes." For instance, the Dutch police tweet messages about criminals who have been apprehended, send informative messages about traffi c situations, and issue warnings about specifi c crime schemes. Th ey also ask citizens information about (petty) crime and inform them about neighborhood safety, urging citizens to stay alert for certain types of crime such as burglaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Methods and Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Data Collection</head><p>We carried out a cross-sectional survey for this study. Although we are aware this is not suitable for inferring causal relations empirically, this design enabled us to gather data on many variables on a large number of subjects. Data were collected using the LISS (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Science) panel. Th e LISS panel data, managed by CentERdata at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, is a representative sample of Dutch individuals citizens to view government as fair when they are informed about correctly followed procedures and when they are treated fairly <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Grimmelikhuijsen and Meijer 2014)</ref>. Th e participative function of Twitter may also increase perceived procedural fairness. Th e expectation is that citizens perceive government as fair when interaction is possible and government deals with their input in a fair manner. Th is argument underlies many initiatives of (online) citizen participation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bingham, Nabatchi, and O'Leary 2005)</ref>. Based on these arguments, we propose the following hypotheses:</p><p>Hypothesis 4: Higher levels of perceived procedural fairness are associated with higher levels of perceived legitimacy.</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Informative use of Twitter by citizens ( transparency) is associated with higher levels of perceived procedural fairness.</p><p>Hypothesis 6: Interactive use of Twitter by citizens ( participation) is associated with higher levels of perceived procedural fairness.</p><p>Apart from these cognitive relations between social media use and perceived legitimacy-changes in perceptions of eff ectiveness and fairness aff ecting perceived legitimacy-we suggest an aff ective relationship between social media use and perceived legitimacy.</p><p>Th is argument builds on the literature on trust, which identifi es two routes to trust: knowledge-based or cognitive trust and aff ective trust (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lewis and Weigert 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McAllister 1995)</ref>. For instance, the fact that the police have adopted social media-regardless of the exact content-as a modern communication channel may show citizens that the police are in touch with current developments in society to inform and interact with them. Th is type of "modern behavior" is expected to directly enhance police legitimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bekkers and Homburg 2007)</ref>. Evaluations of police may not necessarily be dependent on actual use of Twitter, but merely being aware of the police employing social media might give citizens the feeling that the police are legitimate. Th is aff ective relation is particularly heightened when citizens actually follow the police on Twitter. Th is argument forms the basis for our fi nal hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 7: Use of Twitter by citizens is directly associated with higher levels of perceived legitimacy.</p><p>We present a model to describe the relationships between variables in fi gure 1. of two steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Anderson and Gerbing 1988)</ref>: fi rst the measurement model is estimated, and then the proposed structural model is tested. Th e measurement model is estimated in this section, and the structural model (i.e., the actual theoretical model test) is presented in the Findings section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 Model of Relations between Police Communications and Legitimacy</head><p>We conducted a confi rmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the structure of the variables. Th is checks whether the theoretical distinction in three dimensions (latent variables) is supported by the data. CFA examines the fi t of the data with our theoretical model and shows whether and where the model needs modifi cations in order to improve the fi t. Next, we assessed reliability by examining the coeffi cients of Cronbach's alphas.</p><p>To determine the model fi t, we estimated the comparative fi t index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). CFI and TLI indexes of .90 or higher and a RMSEA of .08 or lower provide evidence of an acceptable fi t <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bentler 1990</ref>). After applying two modifi cations to the model (allowing error correlations between observed variables within the perceived eff ectiveness and perceived legitimacy construct: EFFECT1 and EFFECT3, LEGIT1 and LEGIT2), the overall fi t of the variable structure was acceptable (CFI = .977, TLI = .965, RMSEA = .071). Th is is a good fi t and means that the data support the theoretical concepts.</p><p>Th e remainder of our data analysis consists of the following two steps. First, we used descriptive statistics to estimate whether a form of social media use (passive or interactive) occurred in the sample and, if so, the extent to which the type of use occurred. Next, we used structural equation modeling to assert the signifi cance and magnitude of the relationship in our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings</head><p>On the basis of our empirical data, we determined what percentage of the total population uses Twitter to either obtain information from or interact with the Dutch police. In addition, we tested whether a signifi cant relationship is present for the various relations in the model. Also, we examined the magnitude of the relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Social Media Use by Dutch Citizens</head><p>Th e fi rst analysis assessed what percentage of the population actually uses Twitter to obtain information from the police or interact with them. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> uses descriptive statistics for this analysis.</p><p>who participate in monthly Internet surveys. Th e panel is based on a true probability sample of households drawn from the population register. Households that could not otherwise participate are provided with a computer and Internet connection. (More information about the LISS panel can be found at <ref type="url" target="http://www.lissdata.nl.">http://www.lissdata.nl.</ref>) In total, 4,492 respondents were included in the sample from 6,096 targeted respondents. Th e response rate was 73.8 percent, of which 73.7 percent (4,492) completed the questionnaire. Th e incomplete questionnaires were omitted from the data set and not used for further analysis.</p><p>Our sample is, by and large, representative of the Dutch population regarding three key background variables: percentage with a vocational education or higher (30.4 percent in the sample, 27.6 percent in the population), percentage female (53.6 percent in the sample, 50.8 percent in the population), and age (50.0 in the sample, 47.4 in the population). We took these background variables into account as control variables for any confounding eff ects on the outcome variables. In addition, we included the following control variables to allow for potential confounding eff ects such as perceived safety, measured on a scale from 1 ("very unsafe") to 5 ("very safe"), and recent victimhood of crime, measured as yes/no, regardless of the crime. A more detailed overview of our control variables can be found in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>A full inventory of all items and Cronbach's alphas is listed in the appendix. Th ese items are based on a literature review and were tested in a previous (small) online pilot study (N = 115). 2 To measure the transparency route toward legitimacy, we asked whether respondents used Twitter to-passively-follow a police account.</p><p>For the participation route, we asked respondents whether they had ever been in touch with the police because of something they had seen on Twitter. We included a question about whether participants had ever watched an informative television show to be informed about and interact with the police (both measured on a binary yes/ no scale). In doing so, we have the potential to compare our fi ndings pertaining to Twitter with a more traditional media outlet, which helps us interpret the results.</p><p>To measure perceived eff ectiveness, perceived procedural fairness, and perceived legitimacy, we translated and adapted from scales used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tyler (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hinds and Murphy (2007)</ref>. Tyler has been very infl uential in research on perceived legitimacy and procedural fairness, whereas Hinds and Murphy have applied Tyler's work to law enforcement agencies specifi cally. We measured perceived eff ectiveness by three items (alpha = 0.823, range 1-5), one of which is the item EFFECT1: "the police successfully fi ght crime." Perceived procedural fairness included items related to the perceived treatment of citizens by the police. For instance, PROCESS1 stated, "In the execution of their tasks, the police respect citizens' rights" (three items, alpha = .848, range 1-5). To measure our main dependent variable, perceived legitimacy (four items, alpha = .829), items included references to trust and citizen support for the police; for instance, LEGIT1 stated, "I have much respect for the work of the police."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Th e data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with R 3.0.2 (R Development Core Team 2008). Th is method consists Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows three model tests; based on our hypotheses, we expect the third model (the partial mediation model) to best fi t our data.</p><p>We will compare each model and assess whether model 3 has the best fi t indexes. Model 1 represents a direct eff ect of Twitter use only. However, the fi t indexes at the bottom of table 2 indicate that model 1 has a poor fi t with the data. Most notably, the goodnessof-fi t (GFI) index is below the commonly accepted threshold of .90, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of .105 is above the .05 or even .08 threshold. Th e two other models, the fully mediated and partially mediated model, provide far better fi t indexes. First, in both cases, the RMSEA statistic indicates a good model fi t (RMSEA = .052, .053). Further, the other measures of fi t, which compare the specifi ed model to a "perfectly fi tting" model, are well above the .90 threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bentler 1990)</ref>, refl ecting a good model fi t (goodness-of-fi t index = .956, .957). Th ese fi t indexes mean that our empirical data support theoretical models 2 and 3.</p><p>Th e next question is, which model is best supported by the data?</p><p>To assess this, we use the Akaike information criterion (AIC), an estimate that is often used to compare models with each other. A lower AIC indicates a better fi t with the data, and this shows that the partial mediation model has a slightly better fi t. Because the diff erences are so small, a more decisive test is the χ 2 (chi-square) diff erence test. Th is test works as follows: Models with the lowest χ 2 are preferred because this indicates a better fi t with the data. In case there is no signifi cantly lower χ 2 , the most parsimonious model (i.e., least complex, in our case the fully mediated model) is preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Yuan and Bentler 2004</ref>). To test this, we computed χ 2 and degrees of freedom for each model and then calculated whether the diff erences were signifi cant. Th e test showed that the most parsimonious model (full mediation model) had signifi cantly worse fi t than the less parsimonious model (i.e., the partial mediation model, Δχ 2 = 10.144, Δdf = 1, p &lt; .001). Th is means that the least parsimonious model-the partial mediation model-is the preferred model with the current data.</p><p>When we move to the standardized coeffi cients of the partial mediation model-that is, the specifi c relationships in the model-the following can be observed: First, perceived procedural fairness seems</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the descriptive results for all variables that will be entered into the equation. It indicates that people generally have a moderate level of support for the police. Based on a fi ve-point scale, perceived legitimacy is given a mean score of 3.59, which is slightly above the neutral score of 3.0. Th e same is true with regard to perceived eff ectiveness (3.30) and perceived procedural fairness (3.34) of the police. Looking at the control variables, we observe that slightly more women than men are included in the sample, and the average age is around 50 years old. In general, respondents indicated that they feel fairly safe in their neighborhood and/or city.</p><p>Noticeably, the independent variables show that only a limited number of respondents had ever used Twitter to contact the police: interactive use is thus minimal. Because of this very low N, we could not include these variables in the regression model because one or two respondents could easily bias the results. Th is means that the relation between the interactive use of social media and perceived eff ectiveness and perceived procedural fairness is not asserted. We can observe, however, that interactive use hardly occurs and therefore cannot have a substantial infl uence on police legitimacy.</p><p>Among the respondents, 155 indicated they follow police accounts on Twitter, which represents 3.4 percent of the total sample. Th is is a low percentage compared with 35.8 percent of respondents who "use" informative police television programs. In comparison, 15.2 percent said they use Twitter, but very few have used Twitter to interact with police forces. In sum, social media use may be on the rise, but the overall use for public purposes is still rather limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Signifi cance and Magnitude of Relationships</head><p>We ran three models to assess which one fi t best with our data. Th e fi rst model estimates only the direct eff ect of passive Twitter use on perceived legitimacy. Th e second model asserts a full mediation model, with perceived procedural fairness and eff ectiveness as mediating variables. Model 3 shows the results for a partial mediation eff ect-that is, both a direct eff ect and a mediated eff ect of Twitter on perceived legitimacy. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the results of the structural equation analysis on the three models. sense that they engage in surveillance without really being proactive responders. "Th e monitorial citizen is not an absentee citizen but watchful, even while he or she is doing something else" <ref type="bibr">(Schudson 1998, 311)</ref>. Twitter facilitates this type of monitorial citizenship: it can be used rather passively by seemingly inactive citizens, who can nevertheless be watchful of police behavior. Although Twitter does not result in immediate radically diff erent interaction patterns, there might be potential for better long-term monitoring of police behavior. Future research endeavors should look into these potential long-term eff ects.</p><p>Th e answer to the second part of the question provides the second contribution of this article because we gained more understanding of how and why social media relate to legitimacy. Our research shows that Twitter use aff ects perceived legitimacy of the police through both the cognitive route-eff ectiveness is communicated through social media, and this stream of communications strengthens citizens' perceptions of police eff ectiveness-and the aff ective route-the police demonstrate that they are in touch with society and "modern," and this strengthens their legitimacy. Furthermore, we found that of the two sources of perceived legitimacy, procedural fairness and eff ectiveness, only perceived eff ectiveness was signifi cant. Twitter messages more often communicate police successes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campbell, Lambright, and Wells 2014)</ref> and do not contain many cues for citizens to assess whether the police treat citizens fairly or not. Procedural fairness may be shaped more strongly in direct interactions with the police or by placing other content on Twitter: the police may want not only to communicate their results and actions but also promote safeguarding procedural fairness.</p><p>Th is study has a few limitations that call for follow-up research. A fi rst limitation is the focus on communication patterns omitting the content of the communication. In future research, it is important to analyze the relationship between the content of police social media communications and perceived eff ectiveness. A second substantial limitation is our exclusive focus on Twitter communications by government organizations. We only investigated the use of Twitter and its eff ect, and it remains unclear whether our fi ndings can be generalized to other social media platforms, such as YouTube or Facebook. Both have some distinct characteristics that aff ect how citizens receive information and/or interact with the police. YouTube is mainly based on video material instead of text, which makes police cases more accessible to a broader public. Facebook is a closed network that may attract fewer followers, yet those who do follow the police on Facebook might be more supportive of them and interact more. Future research should thus investigate these potentially diff erent eff ects on perceived legitimacy.</p><p>A methodological limitation is that the study design is crosssectional, that is, focused on one group at one moment in time. Th is type of research does not establish the direction of relations, and therefore making empirical causal inferences is not justifi ed. Although we have theoretical reasons to presume the direction of the social media eff ect, it is conceivable that reverse causality may occur as well. For instance, citizens who perceive the police as highly legitimate may be more likely to follow the police on Twitter.</p><p>to have a limited eff ect. Following Twitter does have a positive relationship with procedural fairness (β = .013), but it is insignifi cant. Second, table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that the indirect eff ect of social media use through perceived eff ectiveness is signifi cant and positive (β = .035, p &lt; .05). Th e third eff ect in the partial mediation model is the direct eff ect of Twitter on perceived legitimacy, .029 (p &lt; .01). Th is indicates a positive relationship between Twitter use and perceived legitimacy. Furthermore, the relationships between the two moderators and perceived legitimacy are strong, .545 for perceived procedural fairness and .418 for perceived eff ectiveness. Th e high beta coefficients are a warning sign of multicollinearity. However, the variance infl ation statistics were all below 2.0, and tolerance statistics were above 0.5. A tolerance of less than 0.20 or 0.10 and/or a VIF of 5 or 10 and higher indicates a multicollinearity problem, which is not the case here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Th e central question of this study was, to what extent, how, and why does Twitter use by citizens contribute to perceived police legitimacy? By answering the fi rst part of the question ("to what extent"), this study provides an important contribution about the magnitude of the eff ect of social media use on perceived legitimacy. Our analysis showed that only a small percentage of the population use Twitter (3.5 percent) to receive information. Furthermore, we observed that the participative use of social media for interaction (0.1 percent) is even too limited to carry out a meaningful statistical analysis. Interactive use does not strengthen police legitimacy in a signifi cant way. Comparing this to the low interactive use of informative police television shows (0.8 percent), these fi ndings can be placed into perspective: the proportion of interactive media users is apparently rather low, regardless of the type medium (social or "old" media). Th is is remarkable, given the many commentators who have highlighted the revolutionary and interactive possibilities of social media for the public domain.</p><p>Th is does not mean that social media use has no eff ect at all. Our analysis indicates that-in line with the current body of research in e-government and transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(de Fine Licht et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grimmelikhuijsen and Meijer 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Morgeson, VanAmburg, and Mithas 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tolbert and Mossberger 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Welch, Hinnant, and Moon 2005)</ref>-the relationship between Twitter use and perceived legitimacy is positive. Th is said, our fi ndings debunk the idea that Twitter heralds the dawn of an age of frequent interactions between citizens and government organizations. Even for the police-which greatly rely on contacts with citizens-participation through Twitter is limited.</p><p>Th e research clearly indicates that transparency, not participation, is the dominant eff ect of Twitter. Although participation may be very important for enhancing the eff ectiveness of police, as a few good tips may have a huge eff ect, our research provides no support for the value of online participation in strengthening perceived legitimacy in the near future. However, in the long run, Twitter, as a means of making government more open, could prevent the abuse of power through "monitorial citizenship" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Keane 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schudson 1998)</ref>. Monitorial citizens tend to be well informed and watchful, in the Our fi ndings debunk the idea that Twitter heralds the dawn of an age of frequent interactions between citizens and government organizations.</p><p>Likewise, those who are less supportive might not want to follow police Twitter accounts because they may not fi nd them a trustworthy source of information. Future experimental studies would be useful to establish the causality of these patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Th e capacities of social media to enable transparency and its participative nature have been lauded by many scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bertot, Jaeger, and Grimes 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mergel 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yi, Oh, and Kim 2013, 310)</ref>. Our article shows that this assumption should be more nuanced concerning Twitter, one of the major social media platforms. Twitter has a limited reach within the population, and it is hardly ever used to interact with the police, indicating that the debate about new technologies and citizen participation remains ongoing. Th e hopes about social media contributing to citizen participation are very similar to the initial hopes surrounding the Internet in the early 2000s (e.g., Th omas and Streib 2003; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tolbert and Mossberger 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Welch, Hinnant, and Moon 2005)</ref>; the limited degree of citizen participation through Twitter is similar to fi rst assessments of the contribution of the Internet to citizen participation.</p><p>Still, social media generally seem to off er the police an opportunity to "disintermediate" relations with citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Edwards 2006)</ref>. Th e news media tends to focus on mistakes and failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schillemans 2012)</ref>, whereas social media off ers the opportunity to highlight successes. Open government increases the opportunity for public scrutiny but also, at the same time, strengthens its capacity to shape public relations. For some police departments, this is exactly the reason for wanting to use social media <ref type="bibr">(Meijer and Th aens 2013</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Campbell, Lambright, and Wells 2014)</ref>. Possibly, journalists remain the main followers of Twitter accounts of local police departments and use information from Twitter to report on crimes and police behavior. Future research could also examine the relationship between journalistic descriptions, social media, and legitimacy. Because so few respondents use Twitter according to our study, this eff ect is perhaps more important than the eff ect caused by direct use.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that using Twitter to establish a direct channel of communication with citizens and to communicate successes helps the police-albeit slightly-strengthen perceived police legitimacy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Descriptive Statistics for All Variables(N = 4,492)    </figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Range</cell><cell>Mean</cell><cell>SD</cell><cell>N (if relevant)</cell></row><row><cell>Dependent variables</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Perceived legitimacy</cell><cell>1-5</cell><cell>3.59</cell><cell>.70</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Perceived effectiveness</cell><cell>1-5</cell><cell>3.30</cell><cell>.77</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Perceived procedural fairness</cell><cell>1-5</cell><cell>3.34</cell><cell>.77</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Use of social media (police)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Passive use of Twitter</cell><cell>0-1</cell><cell>.03</cell><cell>.18</cell><cell>155</cell></row><row><cell>Interactive use of Twitter</cell><cell>0-1</cell><cell>.00</cell><cell>.026</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>Control variables</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Passive use of old media (TV)</cell><cell>0-1</cell><cell>.36</cell><cell>.48</cell><cell>1,608</cell></row><row><cell>Active use of old media (TV)</cell><cell>0-1</cell><cell>.01</cell><cell>.087</cell><cell>34</cell></row><row><cell>Gender (2 = female)</cell><cell>1-2</cell><cell>1.54</cell><cell>.49</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Age</cell><cell>16-92</cell><cell cols="2">49.99 17.44</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Education (1 = high)</cell><cell>0-1</cell><cell>.30</cell><cell>.46</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Perceived safety (5 = very safe)</cell><cell>1-5</cell><cell>3.89</cell><cell>1.04</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Victim preceding year</cell><cell>0-1</cell><cell>.06</cell><cell>.25</cell><cell>289</cell></row></table></figure>
