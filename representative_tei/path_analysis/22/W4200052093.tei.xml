<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Pediatric nurses care for some of the most vulnerable patients in our healthcare system. Research on health care provider organizational behavior shows that the quality of care nurses provide is directly related to their well-being, influenced by Burnout and job stress, in the workplace. However, most of the research conducted on nursing populations neglects to separately study nurses who care for children. In a resource limited system where health care provider well-being is recognized as a priority, it is important for administrators to understand the environmental and attitudinal work factors most influential to pediatric nurse work outcomes in order to target optimization strategies. The aim of the study was to identify which modifiable work environment factors, e.g., [Incivility, Perceived Organizational Support, Quality of Work-life] make the greatest contribution to the work outcome of Burnout (i.e., Personal Accomplishment, Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization) in pediatric nurses.</p><p>Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used at a large quaternary care pediatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. We administered a survey to a convenience sample of all registered nurses with &gt;3 months experience in the Pediatric, Cardiac, and Neonatal Intensive Care Units from January 2021-March 2021. Path analysis was used to test our proposed model which was specified a priori based on a review of the literature.</p><p>Results: 143 nurses completed the survey. Path analysis of the tested model resulted in good fit. Quality of Work-life had the largest direct effect on Work Engagement (β = 0.582, S.E. = 0.111, p &lt; 0.001). Work Engagement had the largest direct effect on Personal Accomplishment (β = 0.68, S.E. = 0.53, p &lt; 0.001). Quality of Work-life had the largest indirect effect on Personal Accomplishment (β = 0.4, S.E. = 0.65, p &lt; 0.001), Emotional Exhaustion (β = -0.33, S.E. = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001), and Depersonalization (β =-0.17, S.E. = 0.41, p = 0.006), respectively. Work Engagement had the largest total effect on Personal Accomplishment (β = 0.68, S.E. = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001) and the third largest total effect on Emotional Exhaustion (β = -0.57, S.E. = 0.83, p &lt; 0.001). Quality of Work-life had the second largest total effect on Work Engagement (β = 0.58, S.E. = 0.11, p &lt; 0.001) indicating that Quality of Work-life is mediated through Work Engagement for its effect on Burnout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head><p>Pediatric nurses care for some of the most vulnerable patients in our healthcare system. These nurses skillfully manage the highly specialized care of children and the complex family dynamics that are inherent to the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Pediatric nurse well-being in the workplace has been shown to be directly and positively related to nurses' attitudes about engaging with patients and families <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, and the quality of care provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Pediatric nurses are a separate population from nurses who care for adults because of the specialized nature of providing care to children. Children are typically seen as a vulnerable population, and along with this, there is a high potential for empathetic engagement and inherent complexities in the relationships with families <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>. More specifically, pediatric/neonatal critical care nurses care for the most severely ill and injured children at the highest risk of death <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. As the stakes for this patient population are arguably the highest in the hospital, stressors of the work environment are enhanced; the care needs are highly complex and the stress to the families adds additional challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. Pediatric/neonatal critical care nurses are a subspecialty within a specialty. A supplydemand issue ensues as these nurses cannot be easily replaced or supplemented. Thus they are continually asked to do more (care for more patients, run more technology) with less (less time, resources, support) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Much of the organizational behavior research conducted to date on nursing populations has focused on general adult care nurses and excluded studying nurses who care for children <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>, particularly in pediatric critical care settings.</p><p>Work outcomes refer to occupational performance factors that are influenced by work attitudes and the work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. The current study focuses on the work outcome of Burnout as it is one of the most established organizational behavior concepts, with over 40 years of literature available on the topic across numerous industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Maslach and Jackson (1981)</ref> define Burnout by three components; Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and lack of Personal Accomplishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Emotional Exhaustion refers to nurses feeling emotionally drained from their work; Depersonalization is the development of cynicism, particularly toward patients; and lack of Personal Accomplishment refers to nurses' feelings of dissatisfaction with the care they are providing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Nurse Burnout impacts at the level of the provider, the patient, and the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Burnout is positively associated with nurses' intent to leave their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, decreased quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, and negatively associated with the safety of the work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>.</p><p>Nurses working in critical care commonly experience Burnout, with rates as high as 73% for Emotional Exhaustion, 60% for a lack of Personal Accomplishment, and 48% noting Depersonalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Most of the currently available literature on pediatric nurse work outcomes, such as Burnout, focus on factors like race, marital status, or the experience of death in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> or on high cost/low yield factors like nurses' personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. The former set of factors are nonmodifiable and cannot be feasibly changed (e.g., race), while high cost/low yield factors are technically modifiable but it would not be fiscally or temporally responsible to try and impact (e.g., personality traits) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. So while it is beneficial to be aware of the impact of these factors, they are not ideal targets for efficient modification by health care organizations. In a health care climate where resources are limited, it is important for administrators to know which environmental and attitudinal work factors make the greatest contribution to pediatric nurse work outcomes to target their optimization strategies in the most cost-effective way.</p><p>Our study began with a review of the literature on what is known about pediatric nurse Burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. From there, an additional search of the literature was undertaken to investigate factors that impact Burnout in the broader health care population. Using this data and the framework of the Theory of Reasoned Action we proposed a conceptual model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the proposed conceptual model where the pediatric nursing work environment influences work outcomes through work attitudes, thus influencing work outcomes directly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors Related to Burnout</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Environment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incivility in the Workplace</head><p>Workplace Incivility is defined as; "low intensity behaviors that are rude, lack consideration of others, in violation of workplace norms for respect, where the intent to harm is ambiguous" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. These behaviors serve as a pre-cursor for an exchange, or spiral, of coercive behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of Work Life</head><p>Sirgy et al. define quality of work life (QWL) as; "employee satisfaction with a variety of needs through resources, activities, and outcomes stemming from participation in the workplace. Thus, satisfaction from workplace experiences contributes to job satisfaction and satisfaction in other life domains. Satisfaction in the major life domains (e.g., work life, family life, home life, leisure life) contributes directly to satisfaction with overall life" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Organizational Support</head><p>Perceived organizational support (POS) is defined by the extent to which the employee perceives "the organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. POS is inversely related to nurse Burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>; POS is positively related to Work Engagement in nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>; and POS is inversely related to nurses' intent to leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Attitudes Work Engagement</head><p>Schaufeli, Bakker, &amp; Salanova (2006) define Work Engagement as; "a positive, fulfilling work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. To be able to increase nurses' engagement with their patients and families we must think about possible interventions in the same light. Highly engaged nurses are essential for ethical, safe, and comprehensive care <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Work Engagement may be challenging to directly modify, but work outcomes can be influenced through more easily modifiable factors of the work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Similar to work environment factors, pediatric nurses have not been separately studied in the nursing Work Engagement literature. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Objectives</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>This study used a cross-sectional survey design to test a model of the relationships between organizational and attitudinal factors and Burnout in a convenience sample of nurses at a large quaternary care pediatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board (#1000072502) at the Hospital for Sick Children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Setting</head><p>The study took place in a 300-bed tertiary care hospital with a 41-bed critical care unit and a 38-bed neonatal intensive care unit in Toronto, Canada. A total of 443 Registered Nurses (RNs) work in the Cardiac Critical Care Unit (CCCU), Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PICU) and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) combined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Recruitment</head><p>Inclusion criteria required that nurses had worked in the PICU, CCCU, or NICU for &gt;3 months. Nurses undergoing orientation were excluded. All nurses in this organization are Registered Nurses (RNs). Nurses on leave (medical, parental, or otherwise) were excluded from participation as they were not actively working on the unit and not contactable via the hospital email server. All nurses working on these units were contacted via email for participation in the study. QR codes linking to the survey were also advertised on posters throughout the units. Surveys were completed and submitted automatically and anonymously online through REDCap Software <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Data collection was conducted from January 6, 2021 to March 22, 2021. Of note, this data collection period was during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. For context, participants were asked if they have cared for a COVID-19 positive patient or patient under investigation for COVID-19. Participant consent was implied by survey submission. Participants were offered a $5 coffee card as a thank you for their participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Tools</head><p>The survey was made up of established instruments, previously used with nurses, that had good psychometric properties. Demographic information was also collected, along with a final open-ended question for nurses to include any other thoughts on the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maslach Burnout Inventory</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory for Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel [MBI-HSS(MP)]</head><p>with subscales for Depersonalization, Emotional Exhaustion, and Personal Accomplishment. Each subscale's items are scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 6, indicating the frequency that the item applies in the providers experience ranging from with 0 indicating "never" to 6 indicating a frequency of "everyday" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Attitudes Utrecht Work Engagement Scale</head><p>Work Engagement was measured by the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale shortened 9-item version (UWES-9). [All items are measured on a 7-point Likert scale (0 = never-6 = always) and Work Engagement scoring categories include "very high", "high", "average", "low" and "very low" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Environment Features Workplace Incivility Scale</head><p>The Workplace Incivility Scale (WIS), created by Cortina et al. was selected because it is a 7-item tool and measures a single construct of Workplace Incivility with an Cronbach's alpha = 0.89 and demonstrated validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. The tool is scored on a 7point Likert scale where respondents self-report how often they experience instances of Workplace Incivility on a scale from 0 = never to 6 = daily <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Survey of Perceived Organizational Support</head><p>The Survey of Perceived Organizational Support shortened 8item tool uses a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of Work Life Measure</head><p>The Quality of Work Life Measure, developed by Sirgy et al. in 2001, combines both needs satisfaction and spillover theories within the 7-factor, 16 item tool with response options on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very untrue to 7 = very true) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>Where multiple options or versions of tools were available, we selected the shortest version if there were similar psychometric properties to reduce the overall survey length. (Cronbach's alpha was calculated for each data collection tool; all had acceptable reliability with a Cronbach's alpha &gt;0.7 Data collection tools and their psychometric properties for this sample are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Sample demographics and scale scores were summarized using descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations (SD), counts, and proportions as appropriate for the type of data and scoring guidelines for the scales. In addition, a correlation matrix was estimated to determine the relationship between each of the variables used in the path model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Objective 1</head><p>Path analysis was used to test the model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) of the relationships amongst modifiable work environment features, work attitudes and Burnout among pediatric critical care nurses. Path analysis is a component of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM); a simple case that does not include latent variables. Path analysis is most appropriate for our study as our model does not contain latent variables, therefore no measurement model is needed. Three subscales of Burnout were included in the model: Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, Personal Accomplishment. Quality of Work-life, Perceived Organizational Support and Civility were the exogeneous variables, and Work Engagement was modeled to mediate the relationship between the exogenous variables and the outcome. In addition, a path for the direct effect of Perceived Organizational Support on Burnout was tested (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). STATA (Version 15) was used to conduct the path analysis and effect sizes were calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. Indirect effects were calculated using bootstrapping. Acceptable model fit was indicated by a non-significant χ 2 value, a comparative fit index (CDI) &gt;0.90, a Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) 0.0.90, a root mean square standard error of approximation (RMSEA) &lt;0.05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. Missing values were addressed using full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective 2</head><p>Modifiable work environment factors were ranked (by their correlation coefficient) based on their contribution to explaining Burnout among pediatric critical care nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size</head><p>Minimum sample size for our study was calculated using the N:q rule, there were q = 7 parameters that require estimates. The ratio of 10:1 was used, indicating a minimum sample size of n = 70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. In order to improve the trustworthiness of the results, we chose to use a ratio of 15:1, for a minimum sample size of n = 105 in order to adequately power the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response Rate</head><p>The survey link was distributed to 443 nurses in the PICU/NICU/CCCU. The distribution of respondents was 44.8% from PICU, 37.1% from NICU, and 17.5% from CCCU. Of the 158 surveys opened, 15 had no data thus were excluded, and 143 were fully or partially completed for a response rate of 32.3%. Surveys that had any complete instruments were used in the calculation of mean scores. Only surveys that had all instruments completed were used for the path model (n = 117). Surveys with missing data were analyzed for any commonalities. Distributions for years of experience, FTE, and highest degree achieved were all similar distribution to the fully completed survey sample. NICU incomplete surveys were slightly higher amongst the incomplete surveys, perhaps indicating a higher level of interruptions during completion. At baseline, NICU nurses carry a higher patient load (more 2:1 assignments) than the other two units.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Characteristics</head><p>The majority of respondents worked full time (&gt;0.8 Full-time equivalent) and completed a bachelor's degree as their highest degree held. Our sample was fairly evenly distributed by nurses of different years of experience. The majority of our sample had also taken care of a COVID-19 positive patient (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>).</p><p>A summary of each of the mean scores for each of the tools used in the path analysis can be found in  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). The correlations between Work Engagement, Quality of Work-life, Workplace Incivility, Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment were all significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective 1: Results of Path Analysis</head><p>Path analysis of the tested model resulted in good fit, as demonstrated by a non-significant (χ 2 (6) = 10.6, p = 0.1015), Root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.08, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.90, Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) 0.93, and CD = 0.33. Our model accounts for 27% of the variance in Work Engagement scores, 44% of the variance in Emotional Exhaustion scores, 16% of the variance in Depersonalization scores, and 46% of the variance in Personal Accomplishment scores. The coefficient of determination for the entire model is low (CD = 0.33) which is common for social science based research <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents the significant standardized coefficients from the path analysis.   <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Environment</head><p>Workplace Incivility is not associated with Work Engagement (β = 0.090, p = 0.333). Quality of Work-life is strongly positively associated with Work Engagement (β = 0.580, p &lt; 0.001) Perceived Organizational Support is not associated with Work Engagement (β = -0.053, p = 0.593) (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating Role of Work Engagement</head><p>Quality of Work-life impacted each of the relationships between the organizational factors and all three subcomponents </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>We tested a model of the relationships amongst modifiable environmental and attitudinal factors and Burnout, and ranked the strength of the relationship in order to guide managers and leaders on how to better support nursing staff.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct Effects of Work Environment on Burnout</head><p>We observed a significant positive relationship between Quality of Work-life and Work Engagement, a relationship that has been supported in previous work on registered nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. By addressing elements of work-life such as physical needs (e.g., compensation, time off, health benefits) and esteem and actualization needs (e.g., relationships, skill development, and the realization of one's potential) organizations can directly impact Work Engagement. Not only does this improve the well-being of clinicians, but their enhanced well-being has also been shown to improve patient care as well as increase hospital revenues <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. This is also in congruence with the Job-Demands Resources model (JD-R) that states greater job demands (stress) and lack of resources (defined as factors similar to those of Quality of Worklife) results in greater Burnout and the inverse results in greater Work Engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Additionally, we found that Work Engagement has significant negative/inverse relationships with all of the sub-components of Burnout; a result that is also consistent with the results presented by Hetzel-Riggin et al. in 2020 when evaluating nurses and nursing students <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>. By improving Work Engagement, organizations can significantly influence the experience of Emotional Exhaustion, Importantly, these results provide an evidence-based, directed strategy for administrators to target in a resource-limited system. The more engaged the nurse is with their work, the greater their sense of more Personal Accomplishment, and the less Emotional Exhaustion and feeling of Depersonalization (cynicism) they experience. This is supported by previous literature on the impact of Work Engagement on Burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>. Work Engagement can mediate the relationship between the demands of the job and nurse Burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>. Nurse Work Engagement also impacts the patients' experience of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>. Increased nurse Work Engagement has been shown to have positive effects on both personal and organizational outcomes. To be able to increase nurses' engagement with their patients and families we must think about possible interventions in the same light. Highly engaged nurses are essential for ethical, safe, and comprehensive care <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>. As Work Engagement is a work attitude that is difficult to directly influence, addressing areas of the work environment are instrumental in improving Work Engagement and, subsequently, Burnout. Quality of Work-life is not only directly correlated with Work Engagement, it is influenced by an employee's satisfaction with how their needs are being met through the resources, outcomes and activities that are derived from their participation in work, indicating that improving these factors of the work environment will also have a positive impact on nurse Burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>This study illustrates the importance of the impact of the work environment on Work Engagement and, subsequently, Burnout. We are hopeful that this data, and studies like it, will reinforce the thinking that workplace interventions can contribute in a meaningful way to reducing nurse Burnout. Many current workplace well-being recommendations focus only on self-care for pediatric nurse Burnout-our findings highlight that this recommendation is incomplete, and there are ways leadership can adapt the work environment to also optimize well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. More needs to be done at an organizational level to intervene on the factors that significantly impact pediatric nurse Burnout in the workplace, as demonstrated in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This is a single center study in a Western setting, thus local context and experience limits generalizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>. This is a crosssectional study with a modest response rate which limits causal and temporal inference. Nurses historically have fairly poor survey response rates (&lt;60%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>. The results are sufficient to provide targeted recommendations for interventions at this study site <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>, and, by providing a detailed description of the study context, the findings aim to be reproducible and adaptable to other health care settings and populations such as other pediatric critical care units and even pediatric nurses as a whole. The data reflects nurses who chose to participate in the study and may be influenced by selection bias. Effort was made to recruit a sample that is representative of the critical care nursing population at SickKids through distribution to all eligible participants, however despite our best efforts, the sample is not identical to the actual sample distribution. There is also vulnerability to possible bias in the responses due to perceived social desirability, despite anonymity. Participants self-selected to participate in the study; this could have introduced bias in that those with the most extreme feelings may be over-represented.</p><p>Path analysis is an explanatory technique and thus is guided by known or hypothesized relationships from the literature. It is important to note that the primary limitation of path analysis is that it does not infer causality or directionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>.</p><p>We acknowledge the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic and, specifically, its impact on front line essential workers such as pediatric critical care nurses. Nurses, now more than ever, are experiencing the impacts of their work on their well-being; these results will be timely and readily implementable. Further research to confirm and explore these results with pediatric critical care nurses is needed to fully illuminate the conclusions and to design practical interventions to address Burnout. Phase 2 of this study will aim to address this component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Contributions</head><p>At this time, and to our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have considered all of the concepts explored here simultaneously, nor could we find previous studies that have ranked the correlation of work attitudes and work environment factors' contributions to pediatric nurse Burnout. Therefore, the findings of this study advance the understanding of the impacts of the work environment and work attitudes on the work outcome of Burnout in pediatric critical care nurses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>We found that, in this single center study of pediatric critical care nurses, Burnout levels were high. Pediatric critical care nurse Burnout was most impacted by Work Engagement and quality of work life. Work Engagement is a significant mediator between the work environment and the subcomponents of Burnout. Future interventions for pediatric nurse Burnout by modifying work environment, particularly through the modulation of Work Engagement, have the potential to positively impact the wellbeing of nurses, and ultimately the care they provide to our most vulnerable patients.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | The relationship between factors of the work environment, work attitudes, and the work outcomes of Burnout.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,85.14,69.43,425.28,144.24" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_10"><head>TABLE 8 |</head><label>8</label><figDesc>Total effects with standardized coefficients.We identified Work Engagement as a significant mediator of the effect of Quality of Work-life on the subcomponents of Burnout. These results illuminate an important point: intervening on the work environment, without considering the mediating effects of Work Engagement, may have a limited effect on Burnout. Berta et al.'s study on Health Support Workers supports our model by where features of the work environment are related to Burnout through work attitudes, such as Work Engagement<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Addressing Quality of Work-life occurs at the interface of the work environment and individuals' role identities. Some strategies to address Quality of Work-life include decentralized organizational structures, improved team work, key stakeholder involvement in decision-making, performance feedback and role clarity, incentive plans, and promotion opportunities from within<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49)</ref>. By improving work-life, there is also an opportunity to improve employees' overall life, through the concept of spillover<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. Sirgy et al. explain that spillover occurs when our reactions to work-life spill over into our non-work life, and note that the reverse can also occur<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. These could provide strategies for organizational leaders to influence pediatric nurse Burnout through Work Engagement with the modulation of the work environment.All three subcomponents of Burnout were influenced by Work Engagement. This means that hospital leadership can address Burnout through the influence of Quality of Work-life on Work Engagement.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Coefficient</cell><cell>Standard error (S.E.)</cell><cell>z</cell><cell>P &gt; |z|</cell><cell>Standardized coefficient (β)</cell><cell>Rank</cell></row><row><cell>Work engagement</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Workplace incivility</cell><cell>0.095</cell><cell>0.098</cell><cell>0.97</cell><cell>0.333</cell><cell>0.090</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Quality of work-life</cell><cell>0.608</cell><cell>0.111</cell><cell>5.48</cell><cell>0.000</cell><cell>0.582*</cell><cell>2</cell></row><row><cell>Perceived organizational support</cell><cell>-0.0550</cell><cell>0.103</cell><cell>-0.53</cell><cell>0.593</cell><cell>-0.053</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Emotional exhaustion</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Work engagement</cell><cell>-6.411</cell><cell>0.832</cell><cell>-7.71</cell><cell>0.000</cell><cell>-0.571*</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>Workplace incivility</cell><cell>-0.6102</cell><cell>0.635</cell><cell>-0.96</cell><cell>0.336</cell><cell>-0.051</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Quality of work-life</cell><cell>-3.901</cell><cell>0.872</cell><cell>-4.47</cell><cell>0.000</cell><cell>-0.332*</cell><cell>5</cell></row><row><cell>Perceived organizational support</cell><cell>-2.271</cell><cell>1.101</cell><cell>-2.06</cell><cell>0.039</cell><cell>-0.196*</cell><cell>6</cell></row><row><cell>Depersonalization</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Work engagement</cell><cell>-1.845</cell><cell>0.576</cell><cell>-3.21</cell><cell>0.001</cell><cell>-0.292</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Workplace incivility</cell><cell>-0.176</cell><cell>0.189</cell><cell>-0.93</cell><cell>0.354</cell><cell>-0.026</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Quality of work-life</cell><cell>-1.122</cell><cell>0.406</cell><cell>-2.77</cell><cell>0.006</cell><cell>-0.170</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Perceived organizational support</cell><cell>-1.227</cell><cell>0.644</cell><cell>-1.91</cell><cell>0.057</cell><cell>-0.188</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Personal accomplishment</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Work engagement</cell><cell>5.065</cell><cell>0.525</cell><cell>9.66</cell><cell>0.000</cell><cell>0.683*</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell>Workplace incivility</cell><cell>0.482</cell><cell>0.500</cell><cell>0.96</cell><cell>0.335</cell><cell>0.061</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Quality of work-life</cell><cell>3.082</cell><cell>0.651</cell><cell>4.73</cell><cell>0.000</cell><cell>0.397*</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell>Perceived organizational support</cell><cell>-0.540</cell><cell>0.855</cell><cell>-0.63</cell><cell>0.528</cell><cell>-0.070</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="5">*denotes statistical significance at p &lt; 0.001.
