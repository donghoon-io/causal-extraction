<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The demand for communication services has been changing from traditional voice telephony services to mixed voice, data, and multimedia services. When data and realtime services are considered, it is necessary to jointly consider both physical layer issuers such as coding and modulation as well as higher layer issues such as network congestion and delay. It is also important to model these services using queueing concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. On the other hand, to meet the explosive demand for these services, relaying has been shown effective for providing higher wireless date rate and better quality of service. Therefore, relay has been included in LTE-A <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and WiMAX <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> standards, where both technologies support fixed and two-hop relays <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Consider a two-hop relaying system with one source node (S), one half-duplex relay node (R) and one destination node (D) under i.i.d. on-off fading. Under conventional decodeand-forward (DF) relay protocol, a scheduling slot is divided into two transmission phases, i.e., the listening phase (S-R) and the retransmission phase (R-D). The S-R phase must be followed by the R-D phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Under the instantaneous flow balance constraint, the system throughput is the minimum of the throughput from S to R and from R to D. Therefore, under random link connectivity, to achieve a non-zero system throughput (from S to D) within a scheduling slot, both the S-R and R-D links should be connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Now consider a finite buffer at R and apply cross-layer buffered decode-and-forward (BDF) protocol to exploit the random channel connectivity and queueing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Under BDF, due to buffering at R, a scheduling slot can be adaptively allocated for the S-R transmission or the R-D transmission, according to the R queue length and link quality. Then, the throughput to D can be made non-zero provided that the R-D link is connected. While the buffer at R appears to offer obvious advantages, it is not clear how to design the optimal control to maximize the average system throughput given a finite relay buffer. Buffering a certain amount of bits at R can capture R-D transmission opportunity (when only the R-D link is on) and improve the throughput in the future. However, buffering too many bits at R may waste S-R transmission opportunity (when only the S-R link is on) due to R buffer overflow. Therefore, it remains unclear how to take full advantage of the finite buffer at R to balance the transmission rates of the S-R and R-D links so as to maximize the average system throughput.</p><p>Recently, the idea of cross-layer design using queueing concepts has been considered in the context of multi-hop networks with buffers. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors consider the delay-optimal control for two-hop networks with infinite buffers at the source and relay. Specifically, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the authors obtain a delay-optimal link selection policy for non-fading channels. Then, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the authors extend the analysis to i.i.d. on/off fading channels and show that a threshold-based link selection policy is asymptotically delay-optimal when the scheduling slot duration tends to zero. However, it is not known whether the delay-optimal policy is still of a thresholdbased structure. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the authors consider a two-hop relaying system with an infinite backlog at the source and an infinite buffer at the relay. The optimal link selection policies are obtained to maximize the average system throughput. In the aforementioned references, the relay is assumed to be equipped with an infinite buffer and the proposed algorithms cannot guarantee that the instantaneous relay queue length is below a certain threshold. However, in practical systems, buffers are finite. The optimal designs for systems with infinite buffers do not necessarily lead to good performance for systems with finite buffers. In addition, in several practical networks, such as wireless sensor networks, wireless body area networks and wireless networks-on-chip, buffer size is limited. This is because that using buffers of large size would introduce practical issues, such as larger on-chip board space, increased memory-access latency and higher power consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Therefore, it is very important to consider finite relay buffers in designing optimal resource controls for multi-hop networks to support data and realtime services <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Lyapunov drift approach represents a systematic way to queue stabilization problems for general multi-hop networks with infinite buffers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Specifically, Lyapunov drift approach mainly relies on quadratic Lyapunov functions, and can be used to obtain stochastic control algorithms with achieved utilities that are arbitrarily close to optimal. The derived control algorithms usually do not require system statistics predict beforehand and can be easily implemented online. However, the traditional Lyapunov drift approach cannot properly handle systems with finite buffers. References <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> extend the traditional Lyapunov drift approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to design stochastic control algorithms for multi-hop networks with infinite source buffers and finite relay buffers. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> employ a new type of Lyapunov functions by multiplying queue backlogs of infinite buffers to the quadratic term of queue backlogs of finite buffers. Specifically, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the authors propose scheduling algorithms to stabilize source queues under a fixed routing design. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the authors propose joint flow control, routing and scheduling algorithms to maximize the throughput. References <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> adopt similar approaches to those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and design control algorithms to optimize network utilities for multi-hop networks with finite source and relay buffers. However, the gap between the utility of each algorithm proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the optimal utility is inversely proportional to the buffer size. In other words, for the finite buffer case, the performance gap is always positive. Therefore, in contrast to the algorithms for the infinite buffer case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the algorithms for the finite buffer case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> cannot achieve utilities that are arbitrarily close to optimal.</p><p>On the other hand, dynamic programming represents a systematic approach to optimal queueing control problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Generally, there exist only numerical solutions, which do not typically offer many design insights and are usually impractical for implementation due to the curse of dimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the authors consider delay-aware control problems for two-hop relaying systems with multiple relay nodes and propose suboptimal distributed numerical algorithms using approximate Markov Decision Process (MDP) and stochastic learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, the obtained numerical algorithms may still be too complex for practical systems and do not offer many design insights. Several existing works focus on characterizing structural properties of optimal policies to obtain design insights for simple queueing networks. However, most existing analytical results are for a single queue with either controlled arrival rate or departure rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, structural results for a single queue with both controlled arrival and departure rates are still unknown. Furthermore, if the single queue has a finite buffer, the analytical results are limited. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> characterizes structural properties of a single finite queue only for part of the queue state space. The challenge of structural analysis for finite-buffer systems stems from the reflection effect (when a finite buffer is almost full) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In general, the stochastic throughput maximization for multi-hop systems with fading channels and finite relay buffers is still unknown even for the case of a simple two-hop relaying system. In this paper, we shall tackle some of the technical challenges. We consider a two-hop relaying system with one source node, one half-duplex relay node and one destination node as well as random link connectivity. S has an infinite backlog and R is equipped with a finite buffer. We consider stochastic link selection and transmission rate control to maximize the average system throughput subject to a half-duplex constraint. We formulate the stochastic average throughput optimization problem as an infinite horizon average cost MDP, which is well-known to be a difficult problem in general. By using sample-path analysis and exploiting the specific problem structure, we first obtain an equivalent Bellman equation with reduced state and action spaces. By relative value iteration algorithm, we analyze properties of the value function of the MDP. Then, based on these properties and the concept of supermodularity, we show that the optimal policy has a threshold-based structure. By the structural properties of the optimal policy and Markov chain theory, we further simplify the original complex stochastic optimization problem to a static optimization problem over a small discrete feasible set. We propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve the static optimization problem by making use of its special structure. Furthermore, we obtain the closed-form optimal threshold for the symmetric case. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the performance gain of the derived optimal policy over the existing solutions.</p><p>Notations: Boldface uppercase letters denote matrices and boldface lowercase letters denote vectors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL</head><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we consider a two-hop relaying system with one source node (S), one relay node (R) and one destination node (D). S cannot transmit packets to D due to the limited coverage and has to communicate with D with the help of R via the S-R link and the R-D link.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> R is half-duplex and equipped with a finite buffer. We consider a discrete-time system, in which the time axis is partitioned into scheduling slots with unit slot duration. The slots are indexed by t (t = 1, 2, ...). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Physical Layer Model</head><p>We model the channel fading of the S-R link and the R-D link with i.i.d. random link connectivity. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Let G s,t , G r,t ∈ G {0, 1} denote the link connectivity state information (CSI) of the S-R link and the R-D link at slot t, respectively, where 1 denotes connected and 0 not connected. Let G t (G s,t , G r,t ) ∈ G G × G denote the joint CSI at the t-th slot, where G denotes the joint CSI state space.</p><p>Assumption 1 (Random Link Connectivity Model): {G s,t } and {G r,t } are both i.i.d. over time, where in each slot t, the probabilities of being 1 for G s,t and G r,t are p s and p r , respectively, i.e., Pr[G s,t = 1] = p s and Pr[G r,t = 1] = p r . Furthermore, {G s,t } and {G r,t } are independent of each other.</p><p>We assume fixed transmission powers of S and R, and consider packet transmission. The maximum transmission rates (i.e., the maximum numbers of packets transmitted within a slot) of the S-R link when G s,t = 1 and the R-D link when G r,t = 1 are given by R s and R r , respectively. Note that, to avoid the overflow of the finite R buffer, the actual transmission rate of S may be smaller than R s . In addition, the actual transmission rate of R may be smaller than R r , subject to the availability of packets in the R buffer. These will be further illustrated in Section III-A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Queueing Model</head><p>We assume that S has an infinite backlog (i.e., always has data to transmit) and consider a finite buffer of size N r &lt; ∞ (in number of packets) at R. Note that N r can be arbitrarily large. Assume N r &gt; max{R s , R r }. The finite buffer at R is used to hold the packet flow from S. We consider the buffered decode-and-forward (BDF) protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to exploit the potential benefit of buffering at R under random channel connectivity. Specifically, according to BDF, (i) S can transmit packets to R when the S-R link is connected, and R decodes and stores the packets from S in its buffer; (ii) R can transmit the packets in its buffer to D when the R-D link is connected. Using the buffer at R and BDF, we can dynamically select the S-R link or the R-D link to transmit and choose the corresponding transmission rate at each slot based on the channel fading and queue states, according to a link selection and transmission rate control policy defined in Section III-A.</p><p>Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the simple two-hop relaying system with on/off channel connectivity can be modeled as a single queue with controlled arrival rate and departure rate. Let Q t ∈ Q denote the queue state information (QSI) (in number of packets) at the R buffer at the beginning of the t-th slot, where Q {0, 1, • • • , N r } denotes the QSI state space. The queue dynamics under the control policy will be illustrated in Section III-B.</p></div>

In the following, we also refer to α * r as the optimal link selection policy. To obtain the optimal policy, it remains to characterize α * r .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Threshold Structure of Optimal Link Selection Policy</head><p>To further simplify the problem and obtain design insights, we study the structure of the optimal link selection policy. In the existing literature, structural properties of optimal policies are characterized for simple networks by studying properties of the value function. For example, most existing works consider the structural analysis of a single queue with either controlled arrival or departure rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. However, we control both the arrival and departure rates of the relay queue. Moreover, we consider a finite buffer, which has reflection effect when the buffer is almost full <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and general system parameters, i.e., R s , R r and N r . Therefore, it is more challenging to explore the properties of the value function in our system.</p><p>First, by the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> , we can iteratively prove the following properties of the value function.</p><p>Lemma 1 (Properties of Value Function): The value function V (Q) satisfies the following properties:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">1) V (Q) is monotonically non-decreasing in Q; 2) V (Q + 1) -V (Q) ≤ 1, Q ∈ {0, 1, • • • , N r -1}; 3) V (Q+R s +R r +1)-V (Q+R s +R r ) ≤ V (Q+1)-V (Q), Q ∈ {0, 1, ..., N r -(R s + R r + 1)}.</formula><p>Proof: Please see Appendix B. Remark 2 (Interpretation of Lemma 1): Property 1 generally holds for single-queue systems and is widely studied in the existing literature. Property 2 results from the throughput maximization problem considered in this work. This property does not hold for sum queue length minimization problems considered in most existing literature. Property 3 indicates that V (Q) is K-concave<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> with K = R s + R r ≥ 2. This stems from the relay queue with both controlled arrival and departure rates. In contrast, most existing works consider a single queue with either controlled arrival rate or departure rate, and the corresponding value function is 1-concave.</p><p>Next, define the state-action reward function as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> J(Q, a r ) ps pr V (Q) + p s pr V (min{Q + R s , N r })</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">+ ps p r min{Q, R r } + V ([Q -R r ] + ) + p s p r a r min{Q, R r } + V Q + ār min{N r -Q, R s } -a r min{Q, R r } .

Thus, we have the following theorem. Theorem 2 (Threshold Structure of Optimal Policy): There exists Q * th ∈ Q such that the optimal link selection policy for G = (1, 1) has the threshold-based structure, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">α * r (Q) = 1, if Q &gt; Q * th ; 0, otherwise.<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Q * th is the optimal threshold. Proof: Please see Appendix C. Remark 3 (Interpretation of Theorem 2): By Theorem 2, we know that when G = (1, 1), it is optimal to schedule the R-D link if Q &gt; Q * th and to schedule the S-R link otherwise. The intuition is as follows. When the relay queue length is large (Q &gt; Q * th ), the S-R transmission opportunities may be wasted when G = (1, 0) due to the overflow of the finite R buffer. Therefore, when Q &gt; Q * th , we should reduce the relay queue length at G = (1, 1). When the relay queue length is small (Q ≤ Q * th ), the R-D transmission opportunities may be wasted when G = (0, 1), as there may not be enough packets left to transmit. Therefore, when Q ≤ Q * th , we should schedule the S-R link at G = (1, 1). These design insights also hold for two-hop relaying systems with multiple relays which are equipped with finite relay buffers.</p></div>

Later, in Lemma 3, we shall show the relationship between q * th ∈ C and Q * th ∈ Q. As illustrated in Section V-A, we focus on the computation of the average throughput over the recurrent class C. Given q th , we can express the transition probability from i to j as p i,j (q th ), where i, j ∈ C. Let P(q th ) (p i,j (q th )) i,j∈C and π(q th ) (π i (q th )) i∈C denote the transition probability matrix and the steady-state probability row vector of the recurrent class C, respectively.

Thus, the computation time of the closed-form solution is negligible and does not change with |C|.</p></div>

CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we consider the optimal control to maximize the average system throughput for a two-hop half-duplex   relaying system with random channel connectivity and a finite relay buffer. We formulate the stochastic optimization problem as an infinite horizon average cost MDP. Then, we show that the optimal link selection policy has a threshold-based structure. Based on the structural properties of the optimal policy, we simplify the MDP to a static discrete optimization problem and propose a low-complexity algorithm to obtain the optimal threshold. Furthermore, we obtain the closed-form optimal threshold for the symmetric case.</p><p>Thus, we show that ∆ t ≥ 0 and ∆ t + Q * t+1 ≥ Q t+1 also hold.

Define ∆ t t τ =1 a * r,t u * r,t -a r,t u r,t . It is equivalent to prove ∆ t ≥ 0 for all t.

Thus, we have</p><p>To show that ∆ t ≥ 0 and ∆ t + Q * t+1 ≥ Q t+1 also hold, we consider the following two cases.</p><p>(1) If (a * s,t , a * r,t ) = (a s,t , a r,t ), we consider three cases.</p><p>where the last inequality is due to the induction hypotheses.

By ( <ref type="formula">28</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">29</ref>), we have</p><p>where the two inequalities are due to the induction hypotheses. APPENDIX C: PROOF OF THEOREM 2 First, we show that J(Q, a r ) in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is supermodular in (Q, a r ). By the definition of supermodularity, it is equivalent to prove ∆J(Q + 1) -∆J(Q) ≥ 0, where ∆J(Q) (J(Q, 1) -J(Q, 0)) /p s p r . By (9), we have</p><p>To prove ∆J(Q + 1) -∆J(Q) ≥ 0 using (49), we consider the following two cases.</p><p>(</p><p>(2) If N r ≥ R s +R r +1, we consider the similar three cases.</p><p>Therefore, ∆J(Q + 1) -∆J(Q) ≥ 0 holds which implies that J(Q, a r ) in ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) is supermodular in (Q, a r ).

Thus α * r (Q) has the threshold-based structure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> which completes the proof. APPENDIX D: PROOF OF LEMMA 2 Consider l = 0, i.e., N r = nR. Assume Q 1 = 0 is the initial state. According the Bézout's identity and the queue dynamics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, for all t = 1, 2, • • • and k = 1, 2, • • • , n, there exist integers x t,k and y t,k such that</p><p>In other words, each state s ∈ S is accessible from state 0. On the other hand, for any initial state Q 1 ∈ Q, we have Pr[Q t = 0] &gt; 0 for some t. The reason is that CSI may stay (0, 1) for enough consecutive time slots which implies that the relay buffer will be empty under any policy in Definition 1. Thus, state 0 is accessible from all states in Q. Note that S ⊆ Q. Therefore, by [30, Definition 4.2.5], state 0 is a recurrent state. Denote C = {0} ∪ S. Then, by [30, Theorem 4.2.1], C is a recurrent class. Note that, under the optimal transmission rate policy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, each state ∈ C is not accessible from state 0. Thus, by [30, Definition 4.2.5], the states ∈ C are all transient states. Therefore, if l = 0, the recurrent class of</p><p>Then, each state s ∈ S ′ is accessible from state N r . On the other hand, for any initial state Q 1 ∈ Q, we have Pr[Q t = N r ] &gt; 0 for some t. The reason is that CSI may stay (1, 0) for enough consecutive time slots which implies that the buffer will be full under any policy in Definition 1. Thus, state N r is accessible from all states in Q. Note that S ′ ⊆ Q. Therefore, state N r is a recurrent state and C 2 {N r } ∪ S ′ is a recurrent class <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Note that, state 0 and N r are accessible from each other. Thus, C C 1 ∪C 2 is a recurrent class. Similarly, by ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), the states ∈ C are all transient states. Therefore, if l = 0, the recurrent class of</p><p>We complete the proof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX E: PROOF OF LEMMA 3</head><p>By Lemma 2, for any given R s , R r , N r , the recurrent class C is fixed and does not change with the threshold Q th ∈ Q, and the ergodic system throughput in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> only depends on the steady-state probability vector π(Q th ) and the average departure rate vector r(Q th ) of C. Note that, by ( <ref type="formula">15</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), π(Q th ) and r(Q th ) only depend on the link selection control for the recurrent states in C. Since q * th and q * th,next are two adjacent recurrent states, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, any threshold</p><p>, Q ∈ Q} leads to the same link selection control for the recurrent states, and hence achieves the same ergodic throughput. Under the stationary unichain policies in ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), the induced markov chain {Q t } is an ergodic unichain. By ergodic theory, the time-average system throughput in (4) is equivalent to the ergodic system throughput in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, i.e., R * = r * . Thus, the optimal control to Problem 1 can be obtained by solving Problem 2. We complete the proof of Lemma 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX F: PROOF OF LEMMA 4</head><p>For two adjacent thresholds c k and c k+1 , the corresponding transition probability matrices P(k) and P(k + 1) only differ in the (k + 1)-th row. Thus, A(k) and A(k + 1) only differ in the (k + 1)-th column. Then, by partitioning A(k) and A(k + 1) into the form (20) using the permutation matrices K(k) and K(k + 1), respectively, we obtain the corresponding submatrices Â(k) and Â(k + 1). By exchanging the (k + 1)-th and (k + 2)-th columns of Â(k), we obtain Ã(k), i.e.,</p><p>where K(k) is the corresponding permutation matrix defined in Lemma 4. Thus, Ã(k) and Â(k + 1) differ only in the (k + 1)-th column, and Â(k + 1) can be regarded as a rankone update of Ã(k). Let</p><p>where a k+1 (k + 1) and âk+1 (k) are the (k + 1)-column of Â(k + 1) and Ã(k), respectively. Then, we have</p><p>, where v(k) is defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.

Thus, (51) is equivalent to ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">52</ref>) is equivalent to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. We complete the proof.</p><p>APPENDIX G: PROOF OF LEMMA 5</p><p>First, we show that Problem 2 can be equivalently transformed to Problem 3. Given a CSI sample path {G t }, let {(a s,t , a r,t )} and {(a s,t , a r,t )} be the sequences of link selection and transmission rate actions under a policy Ω in Definition 1, respectively. Let {Q t } be the associated QSI trajectory. By (1), we have T t=1 E [a r,t u r,t ] = RΩ . Hence, under the optimal transmission rate control in (5) and a threshold-based link selection policy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, the average arrival rate equals to the average departure rate. Therefore, without loss of optimality, we can also denote r i (q th ) as the average of the average arrival and departure rates at state i ∈ Q under the threshold q th . Then, in the symmetric case, we have</p><p>where state i ∈ {0, 1, • • • , n} represents state iR ∈ C and m = q th /R. By (53), we obtain the ergodic system throughput r(m) = (p+p p)R 2 -p pR 2 (π 0 (m)+π n (m)). Maximizing r(m) is equivalent to minimizing π 0 (m) + π n (m). Therefore, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, we have the discrete optimization problem in Problem 3.</p><p>Next, we obtain the optimal solution to Problem 3. By change of variables in Problem 3, i.e., letting x = pm , we have the following continuous optimization problem. </p><p>Letting the derivative of g(x), i.e., g ′ (x) = 2 pp 2 (x 2 -pn-1 ) ( p2 x 2 + pn+1 -2 px) 2 , equal to 0, we have x * = p n-1 2 . Since g ′ (x) ≤ 0 in [p n , p n-1 2 ] and g ′ (x) ≥ 0 in [p n-1</p><p>is the optimal solution to (54). Based on x * , we now obtain the optimal solution m * to Problem 3. If n is odd, then m * = n-1 2 ; if n is even, m * = n 2 -1 or n 2 . (Note that, n 2 -1 and n 2 achieve the same optimal value of Problem 3.) Then, by Lemma 3, we complete the proof.</p></div>			</div>
