<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship of types of family support on start-up activities in Indonesia through family cohesiveness as mediation and moderation; this study used respondents as many as 198 students from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. This study provides analytical information using path analysis with SEM-PLS applications. The results of this study explain that family cohesiveness as a mediation and moderation variable has astounding comparative results; in the effect mediation, if Family Cohesiveness as a mediation variable, it can make the direct relationship of FPS to SUA initially significant even if Family Cohesiveness as a moderation variable direct relationship FPS to SUA has a weak strengthening effect as evidenced by the value of F Square only 0.017 below 0, 02.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Youth unemployment in Indonesia is the highest among other age groups, approximately 16.73 percent <ref type="bibr">(Global Economy, 2019)</ref>. Youth unemployment refers to young people in the age of 15-24 years old without work, but are currently seeking or available for employment. In general, unemployment is a serious issue faced by both developed and developing nations because this issue leads to economic and social matters <ref type="bibr">(Akutson, Messiah &amp; Dalhatu, 2018)</ref> ¬. This suggest that youth unemployment problems cannot be separated from larger issues and questions among the discussion of economic growth.</p><p>We can all agree that getting a college degree does not guarantee employment for fresh graduates. Therefore, entrepreneurship courses are now being offered in most of colleges and universities <ref type="bibr">(Katz, 2015)</ref>. Another way to make a living other than getting employed is by selfemployment and new venture development, these activities can begin to help tackling the youth unemployment problems. Individual self-empowerment can be fostered by entrepreneurship activities, which also can serve as a tool to create jobs, economic growth, innovation, and reinvigoration of economic life <ref type="bibr">(Kelly et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Audretsch, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>One of the most important goals of a nation is to keep reducing the unemployment rate. Focusing on youth unemployment, providing entrepreneurial knowledge for students in schools and universities will increase awareness towards entrepreneurship as we know students are entering the working age. When developing new ventures is one of the main weapons in combating youth unemployment, understanding of factors which could possibly influence young people in starting up new business is extremely important. When looking at the index of easiness of doing business, Indonesia is ranked as 73th among the total of 190 economies that make business easier <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2018)</ref>. This rank stayed unchanged at 73 two years in a row,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW Family Support</head><p>Families play an important role in the company process in terms of the strong links between family integration and entrepreneurial outcomes or actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aldrich &amp; Cliff, 2003)</ref>. Especially for young nascent entrepreneurs, family plays an important role in majority of young entrepreneurs' activities especially when they do not have their own capital to support the business. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hatak &amp; Zhou (2019)</ref>, family or capital support strengthens a contractor's welfare and business performance. On one hand, family support affects entrepreneurs' willingness to work hard, hence increase business performance. On the other hand, Sieger &amp; Minola (2017) argues that support from family members reduces entrepreneurs' likelihood of establishing enterprises. The positive and negative perception of family support is a cause for debate. In this research, the discussion is focusing on four types of family support, financial, social, human, and physical support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Financial Support</head><p>The definition of family capital means financial resources, social, and human made available to individuals or groups through family affiliation. <ref type="bibr">(Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Danes, 2009)</ref>. It is undoubtedly true that every new venture and every business need financial capital to operate and therefore getting the return they deserve. According to <ref type="bibr">Pena (2002)</ref>, financial capital provides flexibility for entrepreneurs to handle a broader range of startup activities. Financial capital is very critical in every business' sustainability. Especially for new venture, entrepreneurs' first challenge is to get the financial capital from. In accidental external shocks, financial capital can protect businessmen from imitations by enabling them to implement more capital-intensive strategies <ref type="bibr">(Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon &amp; Woo, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chua, et al., (2011)</ref> found that the relation between family involvement and debt finance in new enterprises has a positive influence. When young student entrepreneurs, without previous experience of working, looking for early-stage funding, they are able to benefit from family financing or family connections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Social Support</head><p>Social capital is the second type of capital that parents or families can provide. Business capital is defined as the network of relationships which are closely connected with personal and organizational contacts according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bastie, et al., (2013)</ref>. For human-to-human activities that operate in a company, social capital is needed. Social players can use these relationships to access resources, information and social approvals <ref type="bibr">(Stuart &amp; Sorenson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hoang &amp; Antoncic, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Newbert, Tornikosli &amp; Quigley, 2013)</ref>. Although a family does not participate directly in business processes and initiatives, the social capital of the family can still influence 1532-5806-24-S1-118</p><p>Citation Information: Aliyyah, N., Siswomihardjo, S.W., Prasetyo, I., Rusdiyanto, Rochman, A.S., &amp; Kalbuana, N. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>). The effect of types of family support on startup activities in indonesia with family cohesiveness as moderation. Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences, 24(S1), 1-15.</p><p>risk creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aldrich &amp; Cliff, 2003)</ref>. Beside the direct impact of families on existing social networks in their families, family social capital enables additional resources to be mobilized to be successful in start-ups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Human Support</head><p>The human capital concept is embedded inside the idea that people own skills, knowledge, and experience with economic value for themselves and also their firms <ref type="bibr">(Centidamar et al, 2012)</ref>. Family human capital is the knowledge, abilities, and skills possessed by individuals in the family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Coleman, 1988)</ref>. Human capital is mostly contemplated to be the most important resource in any business. In the entrepreneurship literature, nascent entrepreneur who has entrepreneurial knowledge and experience background most likely are already exposed to the kinds of activities needed in order to start a business. One of many forms of family human capital is mentoring. <ref type="bibr">Chlosta, et al., (2014)</ref> suggests that the decision to start a business has a positive correlation with having family members or parents who are or were entrepreneurs, related to the mentoring facility for the children from entrepreneur parents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Physical Support</head><p>When seeing family capital from a bigger point of view, it includes the other types of capital namely social, financial, and also human capital, alongside other tangible assets also known as physical capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Danes et al., 2009)</ref>. Physical capital is considered as other tangible assets, family physical capital is tangible assets provided by the family such as house, family vehicle, computers, that are used for business purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dyer et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Cohesiveness</head><p>Family cohesiveness is defined as the calculation of connectivity and emotional attachments inside a family <ref type="bibr">(Lansberg &amp; Astrachan, 1994)</ref>. As young nascent entrepreneurs, family can be said to be one of the most used sources of capital. Family cohesiveness is crucial as young entrepreneurs are lacking of experience and also relationships with business people, therefore family connections are needed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Edelman, et al., (2014)</ref> argued that family cohesiveness magnified the effect generated by family social capital on students' startup activities. Therefore, the writer finds it interesting to see how family cohesiveness influence startup activities of young student entrepreneurs in <ref type="bibr">Yogyakarta. Pearson, et al., (2008)</ref> found that family "Time and stability all strengthen family capital, interdependency, interaction and closure. Supporting that finding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Edelman, et al., (2014)</ref>, argues that family cohesiveness had a positive moderating effect on three aspects of family support, namely social, human, and also physical capital support. Although there are positive moderating effects on three different types of capitals, the family financial capital was not significantly affected by family cohesiveness. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Edelman, et al., (2014)</ref> also found that family cohesiveness negatively influencing startup activities of young nascent entrepreneurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Financial Support from Family and Startup Activities</head><p>Due to its relatively younger age and lack of collateral or credit history, the majority of common means of early stage financial support for a company, such as cards or loans from banks, are less likely to be available for university students <ref type="bibr">(Ozgen &amp; Minsky, 2013)</ref>. In terms of looking for financial capital, young, student entrepreneurs have the ability to utilize their relationship with their families. A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chua, Chrisman, Kellermanns, Wu (2011)</ref> shows that family involvement positively influences new venture debt financing. Therefore, it is 1532-5806-24-S1-118</p><p>Citation Information: Aliyyah, N., Siswomihardjo, S.W., Prasetyo, I., Rusdiyanto, Rochman, A.S., &amp; Kalbuana, N. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>). The effect of types of family support on startup activities in indonesia with family cohesiveness as moderation. Journal of Management <ref type="table">Information</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Decision Sciences, 24(S1), 1-15.</ref> concluded that family-provided finance could be one of the most substantial sources of financial support for young entrepreneurs, especially students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Social Support from Family and Startup Activities</head><p>Families have a duty to assume responsibility for the actions of their members, which allow families to "borrow" the social capital of their families. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chua, et al., (2011)</ref>, for example, documented that family involvement has influenced debt financing by exploiting the relations between family members and resource owners. Children have the privilege of having access to parent-contractor social capital, including connections with business partners, vendors and potential customers and can benefit from their parent networks in order to start a new business <ref type="bibr">(Laspita et al., 2012)</ref>. Empirical evidence from the literatures about student entrepreneurship shows that students who had family business backgrounds derived from a specific familial context that has the possibility to influence their future career intentions <ref type="bibr">(Laspita et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Family Human Support and Startup Activities</head><p>Family human capital is the skills, knowledge, and abilities of individuals in the family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Coleman, 1988)</ref>. Young nascent entrepreneurs are typically lacking both entrepreneurial experience and managerial experience, therefore they turn to the family as a strategy to control their human capital needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hoang &amp; Antoncic, 2003</ref>). Children's future professional orientation is also influenced by their previous social education from parents as role models <ref type="bibr">(Carr &amp; Sequeira, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>One form of family human capital is mentoring. Research suggests that choice to start a new venture has a positive correlation with having entrepreneur parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chlosta, Patzelt, Klein, Dormann, 2010)</ref>. Thus, young entrepreneurs are who are facilitated with knowledge from the family in terms of entrepreneurship based on experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Family Physical Support and Startup Activities</head><p>Family physical capital includes assets owned by family, such as use of the family house as operational office for business, family-owned vehicles, gadgets, and other tangible needs to begin a new business <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dyer et al., 2014)</ref>. According to Sirmon &amp; Hitt, (2003), family's existing capital is able to help support businesses during the period of lower economic times or after a failed business extension and/or new market venture. Without such family support, student nascent entrepreneur has to find the other source of these tangible resources. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Hypothesis</head><p>Following these definitions, a hypothesis has been created based on these data that matches these research objectives and the overall conceptual framework:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical Data Analysis</head><p>The research has used the following phases of PLS-SEM analysis: 1. A reliability evaluation was conducted in two sessions, i.e. the evaluation of reliability markers and the assessment of internal consistency. 2). Conduct an assessment using convergent and discriminant validity of the information. 3) Perform the bootstrapping test in order to obtain P value and a statistical value. Testing of the mediation of indirect influences.  On the basis of the Convergent Test table, the value for fitness tests must be below the standard above 0,5 and in the first stage because the six CA variable values are above 0,7; CR above 0.7 and AVE above 0.5 then the model is automatically fit, and no indicators are eliminated so that it can continue testing hypotheses through the inner model test with bootstrapping features as follows:</p></div>

The 5% Table <ref type="table">value</ref> for the 198 respondents describes that if the T statistical value is higher than the T table of 1,96 the internal model is significant. In the above table it can be said that the original sample value is a coefficient value, which is shown in the latent variable's strength, whilst the medium value of the path coefficient is shown in the column mean (m), otherwise the std. dev and std.error show the value of deviation and errors in this sample.</p><p>T-statistics on the impact on start-up activity of family financial help shows that 3,235 is higher than T-table 1,96 with a probability of 0,001 which is less than five percent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Indirect Effects</head><p>Using the measuring indirect effect, Smart PLS includes the findings from the measurements of the variable mediator. Mediation occurs if a variable is directly linked to the dependent. This shows that variables dependent on the basic variables changed as a result of changing the basic variables. The author uses a simple mediation model in this article because a mediator variable is available. The author takes the flow provided by In order to investigate this simple mediation model <ref type="bibr">(Zhao, Lynch Jr, &amp; Chen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Curll &amp; Brown, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Erebak &amp; Turgut, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kelcey, Bai, &amp; Xie, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ramoz et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Toka, Recse, Cserep, &amp; Szabo, 2020)</ref>    <ref type="formula">5</ref>) the effect number is axb unimportant and c unimportant. The indirect influence of family financial support through family cohesiveness on start-up activities has a t-statistic value of 2,077 differences much smaller than the t-statistic value of the direct influence of FFS on SUA worth 3,235, which explains that FC as a mediation variable does not increase the value of influence strength but remains significant because it's higher than the 1.96 t table value so that the resulting mediation effect is complementary (partial mediation).</p><p>The indirect influence of social support through family cohesiveness on start-up activities has a t-statistic value of 2,215, slightly smaller than the t-statistic value of FSS's direct influence on SUA worth 2,443, which explains that FC as a mediation variable does not increase the value of influence strength but remains significant because it's higher than the 1.96 t table value value so that the mediation effect resulting is Complementary (partial mediation).</p><p>The indirect influence of family human support through family cohesiveness on startup activities has a t-statistic value of 2,433, much smaller than the T-statistic value of FHS's direct influence on SUA worth 3,028, which explains that FC as a mediation variable does not increase the value of influence strength but remains significant because it's higher than the 1.96 t table value so that the mediation effect resulting is Complementary (partial mediation).</p><p>The indirect influence of family physical support through family cohesiveness on startup activities has a t-statistic value of 1,340 difference much smaller than the t-statistic value of the direct influence of FPS on SUA worth 3,235, which explains that FC as a mediation variable is not able to increase the value of the direct influence of FPS to SUA instead weakens the power of FPS influence on SUA, which initially the relationship is directly significant even insignificant because below the T-table value of 1.96 so that the resulting mediation effect is Direct Only.   </p></div>
