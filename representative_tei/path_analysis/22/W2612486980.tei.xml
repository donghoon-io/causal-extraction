<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In mediation analysis, it is a standard practice to conduct a formal statistical test on mediation effects in addition to testing each of the individual parameters that constitutes the mediation effect. Over the past few decades, statistical methods have been developed to achieve valid statistical inferences about mediation effects. The sampling distribution of a mediation effect is complicated because the mediation effect is quantified by a product of at least two parameters. For this reason, numerous studies have proposed and recommended methods that do not rely on distributional assumption (e.g., bootstrapping) for testing mediation effects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bollen and Stine, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Shrout and Bolger, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">MacKinnon et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Preacher and Hayes, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>It is often a question of interest whether a mediation effect is the same across different groups of individuals or under different conditions, in other words, whether a mediation effect is moderated by another variable (called a moderator) that indicates the group membership or different conditions. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Levant et al. (2015)</ref> found that the mediation effect of endorsement of masculinity ideology on sleep disturbance symptoms via energy drink use was significantly different between white and racial minority groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schnitzspahn et al. (2014)</ref> found that time monitoring mediated the effect of mood on prospective memory in young adults, but not in old adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gelfand et al. (2013)</ref> showed that the effect of cultural difference (US vs. Taiwan) on the optimality of negotiation outcome is mediated by harmony norm when negotiating as a team but not when negotiating as solos. In these studies, the mediation effect was moderated by a categorical moderator (e.g., racial group, age group, experimental condition). With a categorical moderator, the moderated mediation effect concerns the difference in the indirect effect between groups. Treating a moderator categorical is appropriate when the moderator is truly categorical, but it is not appropriate to create groups based on arbitrary categorization of a continuous moderator <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Maxwell and Delaney, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">MacCallum et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edwards and Lambert, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rucker et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a popular choice for many researchers to test a mediation model and to conduct a formal test on mediation effects. In SEM, the mediation effect can be specified as an indirect effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alwin and Hauser, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollen, 1987)</ref> such as "the indirect effect of an independent variable (X) on a dependent variable (Y) via a mediator (M)" in which X affects M, which in turn affects Y. For incorporating a categorical moderator, there are two approaches in SEM: single-group and multi-group analysis. In the single-group analysis approach, the categorical moderator is represented by a variable, or a set of variables, in the model. On the other hand, the multi-group analysis approach uses the categorical moderator to separate the observations into groups at each level of the moderator, and the moderator does not appear in the model as a variable.</p><p>In this article, we present the single-group and multigroup analysis approaches to comparing indirect effects between groups, and introduce statistical methods in each approach for testing the group difference in the indirect effect and for testing the simple indirect effect in each group. Then we present a simulation study to compare the performance of the methods. In particular, we examine how robust the methods in single-group analysis approach are when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not satisfied (the assumption is described in a later section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GROUP DIFFERENCE IN INDIRECT EFFECT AND SIMPLE INDIRECT EFFECT IN EACH GROUP</head><p>We use the following example throughout this article. Suppose that we hypothesize a mediation model in which the effect of an independent variable X on a dependent variable Y is mediated by a mediator M (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>We also hypothesize that the X to M relationship is not the same in two groups of individuals (e.g., men and women). This model can be considered as a special case of the first stage moderation model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edwards and Lambert (2007)</ref> and the</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">FIGURE 1 | A mediation model.</formula><p>Model 2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Preacher et al. (2007)</ref>, in which the moderator is a categorical variable with two levels. When comparing the indirect effect between two groups, estimating and making statistical inferences about the following two effects are of interest. First, what is the estimated difference in the indirect effect between the groups? Second, what is the estimated indirect effect in each group (i.e., simple indirect effect)?</p><p>In the single-group analysis, a (set of) categorical variable indicating the group membership is used as a covariate in the model and an interaction term of X with the group membership (Group) is included to test the difference in the X to M relationship between groups (See Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</p><p>The interpretation of the parameters depends on how the group membership is coded. For example, when the group membership (Group) is dummy coded as 1 = Group 1 and 0 = Group 2, a 1 = simple effect of X on M in Group 2; a 2 = group difference in conditional mean of M for those whose level of X is at zero (i.e., conditional mean of M in Group 1-conditional mean of M in Group 2); a 3 = difference in simple effect of X on M between groups (i.e., simple effect of X on M in Group 1simple effect of X on M in Group 2). If a 3 = 0, it means that the relationship between X and M is not the same between groups.</p><p>When the relationship between X and M differs between groups, the indirect effect of X on Y via M is conditional on the group membership, because the indirect effect consists of X to M relationship and M to Y relationship. In the model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, an estimate of the indirect effect of X on Y via M is obtained by â1 + â3 Group b <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Preacher et al., 2007)</ref>. So the simple indirect effect (i.e., the conditional indirect effect) FIGURE 2 | (A) Single-group and (B) multi-group analysis models for testing group difference in the indirect effect. In (A) single-group model, Group is a categorical variable that indicates distinctive group membership. Group difference in the indirect effect   <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hayes, 2015)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">LR M diff Likelihood ratio test for a G1 b G1 = a G2 b G2 W M diff Wald test for a G1 b G1 = a G2 b G2</formula><p>In multi-group analysis, group membership is not used as a predictor variable in the model. Instead, a set of hypothesized models (e.g., a set of two models if there are two distinctive groups) are specified and estimated simultaneously (See Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). The group difference in the simple effect of X on M (that is estimated by a 3 in the single-group analysis) is estimated by âG1 -âG2 . The simple indirect effect is estimated by âG1 bG1 and âG2 bG2 in Group 1 and in Group 2, respectively. The estimated difference in the indirect effect is âG1 bG1 -âG2 bG2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STATISTICAL INFERENCES</head><p>There are numerous methods for making statistical inferences about the simple indirect effects and inferences about the group difference in the indirect effect. The methods can be categorized into the following branches: (1) normal-theory standard error, (2) bootstrapping methods, (3) Monte Carlo method, (4) likelihood ratio (LR) test, (5) Wald test 1 . Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the methods and shows the abbreviation to refer to each method. In the 1 In mediation analysis, the poor performance of the method based on the normality assumption is well-known. We included the normal theory standard error method in the simulation study. As expected, and consistent with the previous findings in the literature, the normal standard error method did not perform well. We introduce the method here for the purpose of reviewing previous literature but do not consider the normal-theory standard error method hereafter to avoid redundancy. The normal-theory standard error does not appear in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We do not present simulation results regarding this method.</p><p>abbreviation, the superscripts "S" and "M" indicate the singlegroup and multi-group approaches, respectively. The subscripts indicate which effect is tested by the method, e.g., "diff " means the group difference in the indirect effect, "ind" means the simple indirect effect in in each group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Normal-Theory Standard Error</head><p>The normal-theory standard error method is based on the assumption that the sampling distribution of the estimate follows a normal distribution. In testing an indirect effect, it is wellknown that the normality assumption is not appropriate to represent the sampling distribution of the indirect effect, and the normal-theory based method do not perform well in testing the indirect effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">MacKinnon et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Shrout and Bolger, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">MacKinnon et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Preacher and Selig, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In moderated mediation models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Preacher et al. (2007)</ref> has advocated the bootstrapping methods over the normal standard error methods for testing the simple indirect effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bootstrapping Methods</head><p>The bootstrapping methods can provide interval estimates without relying on a distribution assumption. For this reason, the bootstrapping methods have been recommended for testing indirect effects in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">MacKinnon et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Preacher and Hayes, 2004)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monte Carlo Method</head><p>The Monte Carlo method provides a statistical test or an interval estimate of an effect by generating parameter values with a distributional assumption (e.g., multivariate normal). For testing the group difference in the indirect effect in the multi-group analysis model, the parameter estimates and standard errors are used to specify a joint sampling distribution of the parameter estimates from which the parameter values are generated for a large number of replications, e.g., 1,000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Preacher and Selig, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ryu, 2015)</ref>, such that the joint distribution of the four parameters a G1 , b G1 , a G2 , and b G2 is a multivariate normal distribution shown below.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">    a G1 b G1 a G2 b G2     ∼ MVN         âG1 bG1 âG2 bG2     ,     σ 2 a G1 0 σ 2 b G1 0 0 σ 2 a G2 0 0 0 σ 2 b G2         (1)</formula><p>where âG1 , bG1 , âG2 , and bG2 are the estimates in the original sample, and σa G1 , σb G1 , σa G2 , and σb G2 are the estimated standard errors in the original sample. The parameters in Group 1 (a G1 , b G1 ) are independent of the parameters in Group 2 (a G2 , b G2 ) because Group 1 and Group 2 are independent as long as the assumption of independent observations is valid. In mediation model, the covariance between a and b paths are often replaced with zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Preacher and Selig, 2012)</ref>. So the covariance between a and b paths is zero in each group ( σb G1 ,a G1 = 0; σb G2 ,a G2 = 0). For a large number of replications, parameter values â+ G1 , b+ G1 , â+ G2 , and b+ G2 are generated from the multivariate normal distribution shown in (1). The superscript + denotes the parameter values generated by Monte Carlo method. In each replication, the simple indirect effect estimate is computed by â+ </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Likelihood Ratio Test</head><p>The likelihood ratio (LR) test and the Wald test can be used to test a (set of) constraint. The LR test <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bentler and Bonett, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bollen, 1989)</ref> is obtained by estimating two nested models with (M 1 ) and without (M 0 ) the constraints. The LR test results in a chi-square statistic with the degrees of freedom (df) equal to the difference in the number of freely estimated parameters in the two models.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">χ 2 = -2log L (M 1 ) L (M 0 ) = -2log [L (M 1 )] -{-2log [L (M 0 )]}<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where L (M k ) = likelihood of model k. The LR test can be used to test the group difference in the "X → M" relationship in the multi-group analysis model, by comparing two models with and without the constraint a G1 = a G2 , with df = 1 (LR M a ). Likewise, the LR test can be used to test the group difference in the indirect effect by comparing two models with and without the constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a G1 b G1 = a G2 b G2 , with df = 1 (LR M diff ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wald Test</head><p>The Wald test <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Wald, 1943;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bollen, 1989)</ref> evaluates a constraint in a model in which the constraint is not imposed. For testing group difference in the indirect effect, the constraint a 3 b = 0 is tested in the single-group analysis (W S diff ). The Wald statistic (with df = 1) is obtained by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W = θ 2 1 /avar θ1<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Where θ 1 = a 3 b and avar θ1 = estimated asymptotic variance of θ1 , i.e., estimated asymptotic variance of â3 b. Likewise, for testing group difference in the indirect effect in the multi-group model, the constraint</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">a G1 b G1 = a G2 b G2 is tested (W M diff ). The Wald statistic (df = 1) is obtained by (3) with θ 1 = a G1 b G1 - a G2 b G2 in the multi-group model.</formula><p>A previous simulation study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ryu, 2015)</ref> compared the performance of different methods for testing group difference in the indirect effect in multi-group analysis. In the previous study, the LR test performed well in terms of Type I error rate and statistical power. The percentile bootstrap confidence intervals for the group difference in indirect effect showed coverage rates that are close to the nominal level. The bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals were more powerful than the percentile bootstrap confidence intervals but the bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals showed inflated Type I error rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SINGLE-GROUP AND MULTI-GROUP APPROACHES</head><p>The multi-group analysis model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref> is less restrictive the single-group analysis model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>.</p><p>In the single-group model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, b and c ′ paths are assumed to be equal between groups, whereas b and c ′ paths are allowed to differ between groups in the multi-group model, unless additional equality constraints are imposed. It is possible to specify a single-group model that allow b or c ′ paths to differ between groups. In order to allow these parameters to differ between groups in the single-group model, additional parameters need to be estimated or additional interaction terms need to be added. If the model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref> is modified by specifying the path coefficients "Group → Y" and "X * Group → Y" to be freely estimated, that will allow c ′ to differ between groups. In order to allow b to differ between groups, the model needs an additional variable "M * Group" and the path coefficients "Group → Y" and "M * Group → Y" need to be freely estimated. The multi-group model can be simplified by imposing equality constraints bG1 = bG2 and / or ĉ′ G1 = ĉ′ G2 .</p><p>In the single-group model, the variance and covariance parameters are assumed to be equal as well, whereas in the multi-group model those parameters are not restricted to be the same between groups unless additional equality constraints are imposed. Specifically, in the single-group analysis model (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>) the residual variances of M and Y are assumed to be equal in both groups. The equal variance assumption in the single-group analysis is one of the standard assumptions in general linear models. The assumption is that the conditional variance of the dependent variable is homogeneous at all levels of the independent variables. For example, in regression analysis, the conditional variance of the dependent variable is assumed to be equal at all levels of the predictor variable. In between-subject analysis of variance or in t-test to compare two independent means, the within-group variance is assumed to be equal across all groups. It is well-known that the empirical Type I error rate can be different from the nominal level when the equal variance assumption is violated (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Box, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Glass et al., 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dretzke et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aguinis and Pierce, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to introduce the single-group and multi-group approaches in SEM to comparing indirect effects between groups, and to empirically evaluate the performance of the statistical methods. Specifically, we aim to empirically evaluate how well the statistical methods (summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) perform for three questions in the moderated mediation model: (i) comparing the a path (X → M) between groups, (ii) comparing the indirect effect between groups, (iii) testing simple indirect effect in each group. The methods we considered are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We also evaluate how robust the methods in the single-group analysis are when the assumption of equal variances does not hold between groups. We expected that the performance of the methods in multi-group analysis would not be affected by the violation of the assumption of equal variances, because the multi-group analysis model does not rely on the assumption. In the single-group analysis, we expected that the performance of the z S a3 and W S diff methods would be affected by the violation of the equal variance assumption, and that the confidence intervals produced by the bootstrapping methods (PC S ind , BC S ind ) would not be affected by the violation of the assumption. The estimates are expected to be unbiased regardless of the equal variance assumption violated. The bootstrap sampling distribution is constructed using the estimates in bootstrap samples. Therefore, as long as the violation of the equal variance assumption does not affect the unbiasedness of the estimates, the performance of the bootstrap confidence intervals is not expected to be affected by the violation of the assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SIMULATION</head><p>We used the mediation model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref> as the population model. There were two distinctive groups (denoted by G1 and G2). We considered a total of 63 conditions: 21 populations × 3 sample sizes.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, the 21 populations were created by combinations of three sets of parameter values for structural paths (Populations I, II, and III) and seven sets of parameter values for residual variances (Populations -0, -M1, -M2, -M3, -Y1, -Y2, -Y3). In Population I, there was no group difference in the indirect effect (a G1 b G1 = 0.165; a G2 b G2 = 0.165). In Population II, there was no indirect effect in G1; there was a small  indirect effect in G2 (a G1 b G1 = 0.000; a G2 b G2 = 0.055); the group difference in the indirect effect was a G1 b G1a G2 b G2 = -0.055. In Population III, there was no indirect effect in G1; there was a large indirect effect in G2 (a G1 b G1 = 0.000; a G2 b G2 = 0.165); the group difference in the indirect effect was -0.165.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Methods</head><p>In order to check the data generation and estimation, we first examined the bias of the estimates. Bias was computed by (mean of estimates-true value in the population). Relative bias was computed by (bias/true value in the population) for the effects whose population values were not zero. In the singlegroup analysis, we compared the following estimates to their corresponding population values: individual path coefficients â1 , â3 , b, the simple indirect effect in Group 1 â1 b, and the simple indirect effect in Group 2 â1 + â3 b. In the multigroup analysis, we compared the following estimates to their corresponding population values: individual path coefficients âG1 , bG1 , âG2 , bG2 , the simple indirect effects in each group âG1 bG1 , âG2 bG2 , and the group difference in the indirect effect âG1 bG1 -âG2 bG2 .</p><p>To evaluate the performance of the methods, we examined the rejection rates that can be interpreted as Type I error rate (when the effect was zero in population) or statistical power (when there was a non-zero effect in population) for each method. For the z test of a 3 path (z S a3 ), LR test (LR M a , LR M diff ), and Wald test (W S diff , W M diff ), we used α = 0.05 criterion. For confidence intervals (95%), we computed the rejection rate by the proportion of replications in which the interval estimates did not include zero. We also examined coverage rates, width of confidence intervals, rate of left-side misses, rate of right-side misses, and ratio of left-side misses to right-side misses for interval estimates.</p></div>

The estimates obtained in the single-group analysis were unbiased regardless of whether the assumption of equal residual variances was satisfied. In the multi-group analysis, the bias ranged from -0.004 to 0.007, and the relative bias ranged from -0.011 to 0.051.</p><p>We present the simulation results in three sections: methods for testing the group difference in a path, methods for testing the group difference in the indirect effect, and methods for testing simple indirect effect in each group.</p></div>

The Type I error rates of the LR M a method stayed close to the nominal level. But the z S a3 method resulted in inflated Type I error rates when the residual variance of M was smaller in the group with a larger sample size (Populations I-M1 to I-M3; n G1 = 200; n G2 = 100). The z S a3 method resulted in deflated Type I error rates when the residual variance of M was smaller in the group with a smaller sample size (Populations I-M2 and I-M3; n G1 = 100; n G2 = 200). Whether or not the residual variance of Y was equal between groups did not affect the Type I error rates of the z S a3 method.

For Population III in which the group difference in the indirect effect was larger, the differences in empirical power between the methods were greater with the sample size n G1 = 200; n G2 = 100, i.e., when the indirect effect was zero in the larger group and larger in the smaller group. When the residual variance of M was not equal between groups (e.g., II-M1,..., II-M3, III-M1,..., III-M3), the W S diff method yielded higher power than the other methods with the sample size n G1 = 200; n G2 = 100.

We adopted a conceptual model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Yeung (2007)</ref>. We compared the indirect effect of teachers' emotional support on math interest via math self-concept in Australia (AUS; N = 1,2551) and Austria (AUT; N = 4,597).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</head><p>When the research question involves comparing indirect effects between distinctive groups, researchers can choose singlegroup or multi-group analysis approach in SEM framework to incorporating the group membership as a categorical moderator.</p><p>In this article, we evaluated statistical methods for (i) comparing a structural path (in our example, a path or X → M relationship) between groups, (ii) comparing the indirect effect between groups, and (iii) testing simple indirect effect in each group. We continue to use the abbreviated names of each method to summarize and discuss the results (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The key findings in the simulation study are:</p><p>(1) In the single-group analysis, the z S a3 and W S diff methods may result in invalid statistical inferences when the assumption of equal variances is neglected.</p><p>(2) However, the performance of bootstrapping confidence intervals is robust even when the bootstrap estimates are obtained in the single-group model.</p><p>(3) The bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals are slightly more powerful than the percentile bootstrap and Monte Carlo confidence intervals, but at the cost of higher Type I error rate, and; (4) For comparing an indirect effect between groups, the likelihood ratio test in the multi-group analysis is as powerful as the other methods with the Type I error rate staying close to the desired level.</p><p>For testing the group difference in the a path, the assumption of equal variances was critical for the z S a3 method, but not for the LR M a method in the multi-group analysis. When the assumption was not satisfied, the z S a3 method showed inaccurate Type I error rates, as expected. The Type I error rates were  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for description of the methods.</p><p>FIGURE 6 | Coverage rates of 95% confidence intervals for the simple indirect effects in Group 1 in Population II. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for description of the methods. inflated when the variance was larger in the smaller group, and deflated when the variance was larger in the larger group.</p><p>For testing the simple indirect effect in each group, the bootstrap confidence intervals in the single-group analysis (PC S ind , BC S ind ) were not affected by the violation of the equal variances assumption. The PC S ind and BC S ind confidence intervals were obtained based on the set of 1,000 estimates in bootstrap samples. As shown in the simulation results, the estimates in the single-group analysis model were unbiased regardless of whether the assumption of equal variances is satisfied. So the empirical sampling distribution of the indirect effect is expected to be comparable with or without the assumption of equal variances satisfied. Therefore, the bootstrap confidence intervals obtained from the empirical sampling distribution were not affected by the assumption.</p><p>In the multi-group analysis, all methods did not show differences in their performance depending on whether or not the equal variances assumption is satisfied. These results were expected, because the variances were estimated in each group separately in the multi-group model.</p><p>In both single-group and multi-group approaches, the biascorrected bootstrap methods (BC S ind , BC M ind , BC M diff ) tended to show slightly higher Type I error rates, higher statistical power, and lower coverage rates than the percentile bootstrap methods (PC S ind , PC M ind , PC M diff ). This pattern of results is consistent with what has been found in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Preacher et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Preacher and Selig, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ryu, 2015)</ref>. The Monte Carlo methods (MC M ind , MC M diff ) performed similarly to the percentile bootstrap methods. The Type I error rates and the coverage rates of the confidence intervals were close to the desired level in all conditions. The empirical power was slightly lower than the bias-corrected bootstrap methods, but not by much. The largest difference in power was 0.091.</p><p>For the interval estimates of the group difference in the indirect effect, the average widths were comparable for all three methods in the multi-group analysis (PC M diff , BC M diff , MC M diff ). For the interval estimates of the simple indirect effects, the two methods in the single-group analysis (PC S ind , BC S ind ) showed similar average widths, and the three methods in the multigroup analysis (PC M ind , BC M ind , MC M ind ) showed similar average widths. The multi-group methods resulted in wider interval estimates of the simple indirect effects than the single-group methods.</p><p>The confidence intervals for the simple indirect effects were unbalanced with higher rate of left-side misses when the simple indirect effect was zero in population, and unbalanced with higher rate of right-side misses when there was a positive simple indirect effect in population. For both the group difference in the indirect effect and the simple indirect effects, the bias-corrected bootstrapping methods (BC M diff , BC S ind , BC M ind ) were most balanced in terms of the ratio of left-and right-side misses.</p><p>In the multi-group analysis, the likelihood ratio test (LR M diff ) and the Wald test (W M diff ) performed well in terms of Type I  See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for description of each method.</p><p>error rates. But the W M diff method showed lower power than the LR M diff and the confidence intervals methods for testing the group difference in the indirect effect. The empirical power of the LR M diff method was comparable to the power of PC M diff and MC M diff . These results are consistent with those found in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ryu, 2015)</ref>. In the single-group analysis, the performance of the Wald test (W S diff ) for testing the group difference in the indirect effect was affected by the violation of the equal variance assumption, particularly with unequal group sizes. The Type I error rates were higher than the desired level when the variance was larger in the smaller group. The Type I error rates were smaller than the nominal level when the variance was larger in the larger group.</p><p>In many cases, studies are conducted to address questions on means (unconditional or conditional) and relationships between variables, and the variance estimates are often neglected. It is important for researchers to pay attention to variance estimates, even when they are not of key interest. When the research question involves moderation effect by a distinctive group membership, it is recommended that the variance parameters are examined first with no restriction that the variances are equal in all groups. When it is reasonable to assume that the variances are equal, researchers may choose to adopt single-group or multi-group analysis approach. When it is not reasonable to assume equal variances, multi-group analysis is recommended. The single-group analysis resulted in unbiased parameter estimates even with the assumption violated. But some methods for statistical inference were affected by the violation of the assumption. If single-group analysis is adopted, statistical methods must be chosen with careful consideration.</p><p>Multi-group analysis approach has advantages over singlegroup approach in incorporating a categorical moderator in the model. First, the multi-group approach does not depend on the assumption of equal variances, and so the parameter estimates and statistical inferences are not affected by the assumption satisfied or violated. Second, it is less complicated to specify and test the group difference in more than one indirect effect. For example, suppose that a mediation model is hypothesized in which three indirect effects are specified between one independent variable (X), three mediating variables (M1, M2, and M3), and one dependent variable (Y). In order to specify a model that allows the three indirect effects to differ between groups, the single-group approach requires at least three additional product terms to represent the interaction with the group membership. The number of required product terms can increase if there are more than two levels of the categorical moderator, or if both the relationship between X and the mediators and the relationship between the mediators and Y differ between groups. In the multigroup analysis, however, the group differences can be specified and tested without increasing the number of variables in the model.</p><p>In conclusion, when the data are from more than one distinctive group, we recommend that researchers first examine parameter estimates (including variance parameters) in each group with no restriction before choosing to adopt singlegroup analysis. For testing the group difference in the indirect effect in multi-group analysis, the likelihood ratio test is more powerful than Wald test, with Type I error rate close to the desired level. For confidence intervals of the group difference in the indirect effect, bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals were more powerful and more balanced than the percentile bootstrap and Monte Carlo confidence intervals, but at the cost of higher Type I error rates and lower coverage rates. For the simple indirect effect in each group, biascorrected bootstrap confidence intervals were more powerful than the percentile bootstrap and Monte Carlo confidence intervals, but again the Type I error rates were higher with bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. Taken together, we recommend the likelihood ratio test along with the percentile or Monte Carlo interval estimates for the group difference in the indirect effect. We recommend the percentile or Monte Carlo interval estimates for the simple indirect effect.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>estimate is â1 + â3 (1) b = â1 + â3 b in Group 1 (coded 1), and â1 + â3 (0) b = â1 b in Group 2 (coded 0).
