<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Satellite communication system is expected to play a vital role for realizing various remote internet of things (IoT) applications in 6G vision. Due to unique characteristics of satellite environment, one of the main challenges in this system is to accommodate massive random access (RA) requests of IoT devices while minimizing their energy consumptions. In this paper, we focus on the reliable design and detection of RA preamble to effectively enhance the access efficiency in highdynamic low-earth-orbit (LEO) scenarios. To avoid additional signaling overhead and detection process, a long preamble sequence is constructed by concatenating the conjugated and circularly shifted replicas of a single root Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence in RA procedure. Moreover, we propose a novel impulse-like timing metric based on length-alterable differential cross-correlation (LDCC), that is immune to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and capable of mitigating the impact of noise on timing estimation. Statistical analysis of the proposed metric reveals that increasing correlation length can obviously promote the output signal-to-noise power ratio, and the first-path detection threshold is independent of noise statistics. Simulation results in different LEO scenarios validate the robustness of the proposed method to severe channel distortion, and show that our method can achieve significant performance enhancement in terms of timing estimation accuracy, success probability of first access, and mean normalized access energy, compared with the existing RA methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>W ITH the ongoing deployment of 5th-generation (5G) cellular systems, research focus toward the nextgeneration wireless communications has been put on the agenda by both academics and industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Driven by the explosive growth of smart devices and data traffic, 6th generation (6G) system is aimed at building a largedimensional and autonomous global network able to support massive and unlimited wireless connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In this regard, the emerging wide-area wireless communication technologies for internet of things (IoT) scenarios, such as narrow-band IoT, LoRa, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication, are far from satisfying the seamless coverage requirement of ubiquitous devices in 6G-enabled global IoT. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, for many IoT applications, devices are usually distributed over an extremely wide area or located in remote areas lacking of terrestrial infrastructure, which makes low-earthorbit (LEO) satellite communication a promising solution in realizing remote data interaction given its global coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>To perform uplink data transmission, each IoT device needs to initiate a random access (RA) procedure for network connection with the base station. When a device attempts to access the base station, it randomly selects one of the available preambles from the given preamble set to transmit on a RA time slot. Upon successful detection of the preamble sequences, the base station allocates the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) resources <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and replies the RA response messages to the corresponding devices in the subsequent step of RA procedure. However, different from the terrestrial communication scenarios, a massive number of devices exist in the satellite beam with a wider coverage, they usually initiate simultaneous access requests to the loadlimited satellite receiver for emergency alarm and status report <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this case, severe preamble collision and congestion will unavoidably occur, leading to frequently access retries and extra time spent on the RA procedure for the collided devices, which causes additional energy consumptions to their already limited energy supplies. It is therefore imperative to study how to improve the access efficiency of IoT devices to minimize the energy consumption in satellite communication scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Relative Work</head><p>There have been a limited works focusing on designing energy-efficient RA schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, in which the aforementioned RA overload problem, caused by the deficient contention resource of preambles and PUSCHs, was regarded as the main driver of energy consumption. The solutions to this problem can be categorized into preamble collision mitigation, access class control, resource allocation, as well as power control, all of which, nevertheless, are dependent on the premise of a successful preamble detection at the first step of RA procedure. However, this fundamental premise may not be guaranteed by taking into account the unique characteristics of LEO satellite environment, such as wide beam coverage, long propagation distance, and rapid relative movement between satellite and ground, which bring great challenges in effective design and detection of RA preamble.</p><p>With the massive footprint of a satellite beam, the length of preamble must be sufficiently extended to absorb the significantly increased propagation delay, compared to that in terrestrial scenarios. Such that, the durations of cyclic prefix (CP) and guard time (GT) should be lengthened for the intersymbol interference (ISI) avoidance among the adjacent subframes, and in the meanwhile, a longer preamble sequence is also required to fulfill the requirements of coverage performance. With the long propagation distance resulting in a high path loss, the preamble detection process should work reliably in the conditions of low received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Besides, the rapid relative movement between LEO satellite and IoT device signifies a high-dynamic communication environment, and thus can give rise to the considerable Doppler shift and channel dispersion, which requires the preamble detection method be capable of having the robustness to large carrier frequency offset (CFO) and multi-path effect. Given the above, special attention should be paid to the reasonable design and reliable detection of RA preamble for LEO satellite-based IoT communications.</p><p>With regard to this critical issue, some preamble design and detection methods presented in long term evolution (LTE)satellite systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> could be considered for reference. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, He et al. leveraged the preamble design principles in LTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to estimate the differential round trip delay and then compensated it before preamble transmission, such that both the durations of CP and GT can be greatly reduced. Even though, the sequence duration has to be lengthened in large scale to provide a sufficient beam coverage, which results in a small sub-carrier interval of RA preamble more vulnerable to large CFO. By considering the system compatibility, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed to cascade the same terrestrial Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences to constitute the preamble sequence. Although the fractional timing advance (TA) could be effectively achieved, an extra preamble is required to transmit for determining the integral TA. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Zhen et al. further designed a long preamble sequence based on multiple short sequences generated by cyclic shifting a root ZC sequence with large sub-carrier spacing, so that both the fractional and integral TA of each user can be determined by performing once power delay profile (PDP) calculation, which notably improves both the access efficiency and performance. However, the fractional and integral TA values need to be estimated separately, and the residual CFO will also lead to a decline of timing estimation accuracy. In addition, the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> presented to exploit the conjugate-symmetric ZC sequences to eliminate the impact of integral CFO on timing estimation, but both methods suffered from the obvious performance degradation in the presence of fractional CFO. Recently, 3GPP had offered some potential solutions in preamble design for 5G integrated satellite network <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, wherein Gold/m-sequence was considered as one of the candidate preamble sequences. Nevertheless, the additional processing procedures are indispensable, and thus a high computational complexity will be introduced that may be difficult to sustain for the load-limited satellite receiver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Contribution</head><p>It is foreseen from the features of 6G-enabled IoT communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> that, RA procedure is one of the most frequently used and energy consuming operations in devices. As the foremost step in RA procedure, an appropriate design and effective detection of RA preamble can remarkably enhance the success probability of first access, and is consequently conducive to reducing both the energy consumption and average access delay, so as to improve the access efficiency for massive IoT devices. However, the assumption of perfect preamble detection in the existing energy-efficient RA schemes might be too optimistic by considering the complicated and changeable LEO satellite environments, which make the previously presented preamble design and detection methods for pute satellite line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios no longer applicable. In consequence, a more reliable one with the robustness to severe channel distortion is required for energy-efficient RA procedure, especially in LEO satellite-based IoT. Inspired by this fact, we are dedicated to developing a new RA preamble and the corresponding timing detection method with the aims of achieving the resistivity to CFO, the mitigation of noise, as well as the insensitivity to channel dispersion. The main contributions of this work are as follows:</p><p>1) We propose an enhanced single-root cascaded long sequence (E-SCLS). By only replacing the first subsequence of SCLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to its conjugate form, it absolutely inherits the advantage of SCLS in supporting coverage extension, and more importantly, can achieve one-step TA estimation by directly detecting the elaborate conjugate root sequence without additional signaling overhead and detection process. 2) We present a novel timing metric according to the construction features of E-SCLS. Specifically, by jointly utilizing the starting two sub-sequences of E-SCLS, a length-alterable differential cross-correlation (LDCC) with an impulse-like shape, instead of the conventional periodical correlation, is designed as the correlation function, which not only is immune to CFO, but also can take advantage of the whole correlation products between the two sequences. 3) We investigate the statistical properties of the proposed timing metric for different classifications of timing positions within the detection window. It is found that our timing metric with a flexibly adjusted correlation length is capable of effectively restraining the adverse impact of noise on timing estimation, and the detection threshold used to accurately track the first arrival path can be easily determined with no need for noise variance estimation. 4) We validate the feasibility of the proposed timing estimation method in different LEO satellite channels, from the aspects of timing mean square error, success probability of first access, and mean normalized access energy. We further analyze and compare the characteristics of our methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and in this paper, and give suggestions on choosing a more appropriate method according to the actual communication scenario parameters, e.g. user location and elevation angle. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We describe the RA preamble design in satellite environments and formulate the received signal model in Section II. Section III elaborates the proposed E-SCLS, the timing metric based on LDCC as well as its statistical analysis. Numerical results and discussions are presented in Section IV. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BACKGROUND AND SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. RA Preamble Design in Satellite Environments</head><p>RA preamble is used for user identification and TA estimation, which usually has an uniform time-domain structure in terrestrial communication systems. Because of the long propagation delay and large beam radius, the maximum differential round trip delay can reach to several milliseconds in satellite scenarios, which can be hundred times longer than that in terrestrial scenarios. Such that, the preamble duration should be greatly enlarged to cope with the time uncertainty, causing an obvious increment in detection complexity. Besides, the more noteworthy problem is the high sensitivity of RA preamble to Doppler and other sources of CFO. Since the subcarrier spacing is the reciprocal of sequence duration, it would be substantially compressed in regard to a long sequence, leading to a significant timing performance degradation in the presence of large CFOs. Therefore, it is necessary to design a more appropriate preamble format for the load-limited satellite communication systems.</p><p>For this purpose, we had proposed an enhanced RA preamble format in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, wherein the long sequence is constructed by concatenating a string of short sequences immune to CFO. By effectively designing the subcarrier spacing of short sequence in terms of the maximum Doppler shift related to the user mobility<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> , the adverse impact of CFO on preamble detection can be mitigated in advance. In this case, the cascaded sequence not only can satisfy the coverage requirements within the beam, but also achieves the CFO-mitigation capability. Specifically, let us denote the durations of long sequence and short sequence as T LS and T SS , respectively, K = ⌊T LS /T SS ⌋ time-domain short sequences are utilized to construct the long sequence, while ZC sequences are chosen to generate the short sequence defined as S n = exp[-jπun(n + 1)/N ] for 0 ≤ n ≤ N -1, where u ∈ {1, . . ., N -1} is the root index and N denotes the sequence length. Without loss of generality, the transmitted signal model of the long sequence can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x n =          S 1 n , 1 ≤ n ≤ N S 2 n-N , N + 1 ≤ n ≤ 2N . . . S K n-(K-1)N , (K -1)N + 1 ≤ n ≤ KN (1)</formula><p>where x n denotes the nth element of the long sequence for 1 ≤ n ≤ KN , and S k is the kth short sequence for 1 ≤ k ≤ K. By considering the fact that ZC sequences obtained by cyclically shifting a single root sequence are mutually orthogonal <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we put forward to adopt the same root sequence with a fixed cyclic shifts to constitute each short sequence, i.e. S k n = S n ((n + (k -1)N CS )modN ), where N CS = ⌊N/K⌋ is the cyclic shift offset. In this case, the timing detection for the long preamble only needs to be performed in one shot by merging all the short sequences achieved from the same root sequence. In consequence, utilization of such preamble sequence, named as single-root cascaded long sequence (SCLS), not only can avoid the non-orthogonal interference introduced by using different root sequences, but also is conducive to reduce detection complexity for the loadlimited satellite receiver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Received Signal Model</head><p>In the beam coverage area, when a machine node attempts to access the satellite, it will select one of the available preamble sequences to transmit on a periodical RA slot, and then initiates the RA procedure. After passing through a satellite multi-path fading channel with the relative path delays {τ l , 0 ≤ l ≤ L -1} and the path gains {h l , 0 ≤ l ≤ L -1}, the received signal sample has the following form of</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r n = e j2πεn/KN L-1 ∑ l=0 h l x n-τ l -τ + w n ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where L, τ , and ε represent the number of arriving paths, the first-path delay, and the CFO normalized by the RA subcarrier interval, respectively, while w n is a complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) sample with mean zero and variance σ 2 w . Then, the satellite receiver performs a reversed procedure corresponding to the RA preamble transmission. Specifically, K sub-sequences with length of N in time domain can be obtained by a decascading process with CP removal, equispaced division, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), sub-carrier demapping, and inverse DFT. Subsequently, the receiver carries out the timing detection based on the obtained K sub-sequences to identify different users and estimate their individual values of TA. By means of the estimated TA, each user could adjust the transmission time in advance to ensure the sent signals of multi-users arriving at the satellite simultaneously, such that the uplink synchronization is finally achieved.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, a timing detection scheme based on SCLS had also been presented in terms of PDP calculation, peak search and TA estimation. By the utilization of piecewise accumulation of the received sub-sequences, the PDP calculation can be performed only once to capture all the correlation peaks in the concentrated detection window, such that both the fractional and integral TA can be determined according to the unique feature of its cyclic shift set, which effectively reduces the computational complexity of the satellite receiver. Although satisfactory timing estimation performance is achieved in the satellite LOS channel, this method may experience a significant performance degradation when applied to the satellite multi-path channel with severe channel distortion, which is mainly caused by the following reasons:</p><p>1) Absence of CFO resistance: ZC sequence is susceptible to CFO in OFDM systems with small sub-carrier interval. Since there is no effective CFO resistance in the correlationbased PDP calculation, large CFOs due to the high Doppler shift and the instability of oscillator make the correlation peak shift or decrease, and further affect the TA estimation result.</p><p>2) Vulnerable to strong noise: When the received SNR is relatively low, the detection threshold needs to be correspondingly increased for mitigating the adverse impact of noise, such that some weak correlation peaks can not be successfully extracted, resulting in a TA estimation error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Sensitive to channel dispersion:</head><p>In case where the scattering path dominates, the correlation peak corresponding to the scattering path is likely to exceed the detection threshold and thus the wrong peak position will be captured, which also reduces the multi-peak joint TA estimation accuracy <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</p><p>From these points of view, the previously presented RA preamble design and detection method may have great difficulties to be applied to the complicated and changeable LEO satellite channel, and consequently a more robust one with significant performance improvement is required for realizing reliable satellite-based IoT. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ROBUST DESIGN OF RA PREAMBLE AND DETECTION METHOD</head><p>In this section, we concentrate on the design of the RA preamble and detection method with the aim of achieving the robustness to severe satellite channel conditions. To be specific, we first consider constructing a more reasonable preamble sequence, and further present the corresponding timing detection scheme for TA estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. An Enhanced Preamble Sequence E-SCLS</head><p>SCLS comprises of a root ZC sequence and its cyclic shifted replicas. As aforementioned, the detection performance degradation for the long sequence may occur in the presence of large CFOs, strong noise, and serious channel dispersion. This undesirable result is mainly caused by the non-uniqueness of captured correlation peaks since each sub-sequence in SCLS employs the same root index. Moreover, it can be found that the value of TA is actually corresponding to the propagation delay of the first sub-sequence in the received RA preamble. Therefore, a feasible solution is to improve the sequence component of SCLS to make the first sub-sequence obviously different from the others, so as to extract a unique and correct correlation peak in the PDP detection window.</p><p>Since the periodical correlation result between different root sequences is not zero, the introduction of extra root sequences leads to inevitable non-orthogonal interference during the preamble detection procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Motivated by this fact, we present an enhanced single-root cascaded long sequence (E-SCLS) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, wherein only the first subsequence of SCLS, i.e. the short root ZC sequence, is replaced with its conjugate form, and can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S 1 n = exp[jπun(n + 1)/N ] for 0 ≤ n ≤ N -1.</formula><p>In this case, all the sub-sequences of the proposed E-SCLS are still constructed based on a single root sequence, and thus the non-orthogonal interference can be effectively suppressed. More importantly, the adoption of the proposed E-SCLS is of great help to further enhance computational efficiency during the preamble detection procedure, in comparison with those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This is because the value of TA can be completely determined by effectively detecting the elaborate conjugate root sequence, without performing two correlation operations to estimate the fractional and integral TA, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Proposed Timing Metric Design Based on LDCC</head><p>According to the structure characteristics of the proposed E-SCLS, TA estimation is actually to determine the time index corresponding to the start of the received conjugate root sequence. Towards this end, the corresponding timing detection method for E-SCLS should be able to achieve a unique and distinct correlation peak at the desired timing position, which is easily captured in the detection window and could be further utilized for correct timing estimation. However, the high sensitivity of ZC sequence to large CFO makes this target greatly challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, especially for the LEO satellite scenario with high Doppler shift and unpredictable oscillator error.</p><p>There are two major solutions to cope with the adverse influence of large CFO: 1) Setting larger sub-carrier spacing for physical RA channel (PRACH) based on the maximum Doppler shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Since ZC sequence is capable of resisting to CFO less than half a sub-carrier interval, if the sub-carrier interval is set to be greater than or equal to two times of maximum Doppler shift, the impact of CFO on timing detection can be restrained in advance. 2) Using the conjugate-symmetric ZC sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. By combining a root ZC sequence with its conjugate sequence to construct the preamble sequence, the integral CFO can be effectively eliminated because the effects of integral CFO on the two correlation peaks are just the opposite. Unlike existing solutions that adopt conventional periodical correlation as timing metric, our solution takes a further step by designing a novel timing metric with the robustness to CFO.</p><p>As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, differential cross-correlation (DCC), that is immune to CFO, has been widely adopted for the timing detection of pseudo-noise (PN) sequence. In the following, we first utilize this function as the timing metric for E-SCLS, and study its timing estimation performance in RA preamble detection. As aforementioned, as long as the initial position of the first short ZC sequence is found in the detection window, the differential round-trip delay of the transmitted preamble can be determined, that is, the value of TA. Let S = {S 1 , . . . , S N } denote the first short ZC sequence of E-SCLS, and each element of local differential vector is generated by conjugate multiplication of the adjacent elements in S, i.e. S n * S n+1 for n = 1, . . . , N -1, where (•) * denotes the complex conjugate operator. In the same way, the received differential vector can be constructed by the received sequence r d = {r 1 d , . . . , r d N } at time index d, where the nth element r d n is also expressed as r d+n . By performing the cross-correlation between the two reconstructed sequences, the timing metric based on DCC can be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T (d) = 1 N -1 N -1 ∑ n=1 (S * n S n+1 ) * ( r * d+n r d+n+1</formula><p>) .</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">)<label>3</label></formula><p>We now analyze the influence of CFO on the correlation peak of DCC. At the correct timing position d c , a full-sequence pattern match occurs, thus we have d c = τ + τ l for the lth arriving path. In this case, substituting (2) to (3) and neglecting the noise term, the correlation peak T (d c ) can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T (d c )= 1 N -1 N -1 ∑ n=1 |h l | 2 (S * n S n+1 ) * (S * n S n+1 e j2πε/KN ) =e j2πε/KN |h l | 2 N -1 N -1 ∑ n=1 |S n | 2 |S n+1 | 2 .</formula><p>(4) It is found from (4) that the impact of CFO on T (d c ) becomes a constant exponential factor, i.e. e j2πε/KN . By performing the modular operation on T (d c ), this factor is equal to one, which is independent of the desired peak value at the correct time index. Thus, the adverse effect of CFO on preamble detection can be eliminated.</p><p>To clarify, we further depict the magnitude of the DCCbased timing metric under a noiseless LOS channel for different normalized CFOs in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, where the parameters K, N , h l , and τ are set as 3, 839, 1, 1200, respectively. It can be observed that, even if CFO is larger than one subcarrier interval, the magnitude of timing metric still obtains its maximum value at the correct timing position, and meanwhile, is not affected by the varying CFOs. Nevertheless, its timing curve has a triangle shape, and the peak difference between adjacent positions is great small. This is due to the specific characteristics of ZC sequence that the differential vector generated by one single ZC sequence will no longer possess perfect zero auto-correlation property, and thus its timing metric is not a impulse-like shape as expected. It is foreseeable that the timing estimation of single ZC sequence based DCC is highly susceptible to noise and multi-path effect, and will suffer from serious performance degradation when applied to the poor satellite environment with low received SNRs and severe channel dispersion. Based on the above analysis, we focus attention on designing a more robust timing detection function with a notably distinguishable correlation peak, which not only can resist to large CFO, but also is capable of mitigation of noise.</p><p>Knowing that excellent correlation property will not maintain for the differential sequence built from one single ZC sequence, we try to jointly use the two ZC sequences, i.e. the first and second short sequences of the long preamble, to generate the local differential matrix. Let S 1 = {S 1  1 , . . . , S 1 N } and S 2 = {S 2  1 , . . . , S 2 N } be the first and second short sequences, which represent the conjugate and cyclic shift forms of a root ZC sequence, respectively. By leveraging diverse differential intervals between the two sequences, we can construct the local joint differential matrix with (N -1) × (N -1) dimen- sions as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C=        (S 1 1 ) * S 2 2 ( S<label>1</label></formula><p>2</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">) * S 2 3 • • • ( S 1 N -2 ) * S 2 N -1 ( S 1 N -1 ) * S 2 N ( S 1 1 ) * S 2 3 ( S<label>1</label></formula><p>2</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">) * S 2 4 • • • ( S 1 N -2 ) * S 2 N 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In addition, the total number of non-zero elements for correlation reaches to be N (N -1)/2, which is far greater than that in (3), i.e. (N -1). As demonstrated later, this remarkable increment in the number of available correlation terms will lead to a better timing detection performance. Next, r 1,d = {r 1,d 1 , . . . , r 1,d N } is denoted as the first received short sequence at time index d, and r 2,d = {r 2,d 1 , . . . , r 2,d N } is the second received short sequence next to r 1,d .

On the other hand, it is observed that the number of available correlation terms in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">7</ref>) is (N/2) times of that in (3), which means the utilization of two preamble sequences can effectively increase the correlation length. Because the preamble sequence is uncorrelated with noise samples, the difference between the correlation results in the absence and presence of two sequences (i.e. at the wrong and correct timing positions) will be significantly greater than that in the case of using one sequence for correlation. Therefore, increasing the correlation length can remarkably suppress the effect of noise on timing estimation (This point is further verified by the mathematical analysis in the following section). In order to achieve the best tradeoff between performance and computational complexity, the design parameter M can be flexibly adjusted according to an excepted timing performance, thus we name the two sequences-aided correlation function as length-alterable DCC (LDCC).</p><p>For the existing RA preamble detection methods, the length of preamble sequence is always taken as the normalization factor. However, their timing metrics are more sensitive to the inevitable power fluctuation, and thus may not be able to carry out the accurate TA estimation under low SNRs. With the aim of eliminating the adverse effect of power fluctuation, the normalization function is designed as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, such that the detection threshold can be set in a fixed range from 0 to 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R (d) = M ∑ m=1 N -m ∑ n=1 R d m,n<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Finally, by combining the correlation function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the normalization function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, the proposed two sequencesaided timing metric based on LDCC can be obtained as proposed metric has an impulse-like shape compared to DCC, and obtains its maximum value of 1 at the correct time index, which verifies the correctness of the designed normalization function. In Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>(b), the proposed timing metric is affected by low SNR, but it can still achieve a notably distinguishable correlation peak, which further demonstrates its feasibility in the satellite LOS channel with strong main path.

Fortunately, we can utilize the summation property of probability inequations to resolve this problem, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">P b ( M ∑ m=1 |P m (d w )| &gt; γE{R(d w )}) ≤ M ∑ m=1 P b (|P m (d w )| &gt; γE{R(d w )} M ).<label>(42)</label></formula><p>By substituting (42) to (41) while considering the probability density function (PDF) of Rayleigh random variable, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">P F A ≤ M ∑ m=1 exp[-( E{R(d w )}γ M ) 2 /V ar{P m (d w )}] ≤ M exp[-( E{R(d w )}γ M ) 2 /V ar{P 1 (d w )}].<label>(43)</label></formula><p>Further, by exploting ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_67">36</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_71">37</ref>), the above inequation can be further derived as</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">P F A ≤ P F Amax M exp[- π(2N -M -1) 2 16(N -1) γ 2 ],<label>(44)</label></formula><p>where P F Amax is defined as the tolerated maximum value of false alarm probability.

This remarkable improvement is mainly attributed to the ingenious design of timing metric that can eliminate the influence of noise variance on determining γ. Furthermore, because the setting of threshold does not need noise variance estimation, the computational efficiency is also enhanced during the procedure of RA preamble detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Proposed Timing Estimation Method</head><p>Based on the statistical analysis of the proposed timing metric at different timing positions, the corresponding timing estimation method for satellite multi-path fading channels can be concluded as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_82">d = arg max d {T p (d)}<label>(46)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_83">d opt = arg f irst d path {T p (d path ) &gt; γ} , d path ∈ { d -τ max , d }<label>(47)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_84">γ = √ - 16(N -1) π(2N -M -1) 2 ln( P F Amax M )<label>(48)</label></formula><p>In ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_82">46</ref>), d denotes the timing position corresponding to the strongest arrival path, which can be obtained by capturing the maximum value of the timing metric. If d is determined, the ideal timing position d, corresponding to the first arrival path, is ensured to exist in the range of the channel delay spread {0, τ max }. Hence, by searching forward d path corresponding to the first value of the timing metric greater than the predefined threshold, d opt can be finally achieved as shown in (47). Here, to achieve a reliable timing estimation, the threshold γ in (48) could be correspondingly chosen according to the correlation length and the desired probability of false alarm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>To assess the timing performance of our method by computer simulation, we consider a 5G-enabled LEO satellite RA scenario reported in the latest 3GPP TR 38.821 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and Table I lists the detailed configurations of system parameters. In this scenario, the max differential delay is 1.7 ms, and thus the CP duration T CP must be greater than or equal to twice of this value to avoid ISI, such that we set T CP to be 3.4 ms. To satisfy the coverage performance within the beam, the duration of E-SCLS, T LS , is calculated based on the link budget <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> as 6.4 ms. In consideration of system compatibility, the subcarrier interval is set to be the value adopted in LTE/NR PRACH, i.e. 1.25 KHz, and consequently the duration T SEQ of sub-sequence of E-SCLS is 0.8 ms. That is to say, the proposed E-SCLS consists of K = 8 short ZC sequences with length of N = 839. Further, for preamble sequence design, the root index u can be flexibly chosen from the set {1, 839}, and the cyclic shift offset N CS is configured to be 101. Here, both AWGN and frequency selective fading (FSF) channels are utilized for performance evaluation of the proposed method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Performance Validation of The proposed Method</head><p>First, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method in AWGN channel, so as to validate the effectiveness of theoretical analysis in Section III. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, we show the simulated and analytical results of the output power ratio of signal to noise, β, for different number of correlation rows, M 0 . We notice that the numerical results nearly coincide with the analytical results for different M 0 , which demonstrates the validity of statistical derivation at the correct timing position, and the inappreciable difference between them for the same M 0 is mainly due to the approximation of the noise statistics. Furthermore, it can be also seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> that, β is always larger than 1 and merely increases with the number of correlation rows, which fully shows that the noise-mitigation capability of the proposed method can be further enhanced with the increment of the number of correlation rows. We adopt the mean square error (MSE) as the evaluative criteria of timing estimation, and investigate the timing performance of our method versus SNR with different correlation lengths used in LDCC. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, the timing accuracy gradually enhances with the increment of correlation length, since the proposed timing metric with larger M is able to obtain a better anti-noise capability. Moreover, it is evident that the amplitude gain between the MSE curves with different M becomes higher as SNR increases, for instance, the gain between two MSE curves with M = 16 and M = 1 can reach to be greater than 10 3 at SNR = -10 dB. That is to say, our method can achieve a significantly improved the timing estimation performance by increasing the correlation length. Here, it is worth noting that computational complexity is also one of the key issues in the practical implement of the satellite station. If the complexity is the main concern, we could choose relatively less correlation rows in LDCC, e.g. M = 1 or M = 2; otherwise, we configure M = 4 or M = 8 for achieving a better timing estimation performance, on condition that the system can afford such complexity.</p><p>Further, we continue to study the impact of CFO on the proposed timing estimation. Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> depicts the timing MSE curves in various normalized CFO, ε, wherein the proposed method and DCC as well as the existing methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> are illustrated at SNR = -11 dB. Although DCC is immune to CFO, its performance is seriously affected by noise, and thus it has a considerable timing MSE in low SNR. Thanks to having a larger sub-carrier spacing, our previous method </p></div>

Timing estimation performance of the proposed method in different CFOs.</p><p>[19] can effectively work in case that CFO is lower than half of the sub-carrier spacing, however, its estimation accuracy becomes worse as ε increases. For both the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, a relatively lower timing MSE can be achieved only in the presence of integral ε, but their performance experience severe degradation if the fractional ε exists, and will get worst when CFOs are exactly the multiples of half of the subcarrier spacing. By contrast, the proposed method obtains a stable MSE performance versus different CFOs, because the influence of CFO can be effectively eliminated by modulus operation of the timing metric in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Besides, its performance could be also improved with the increment of M , and notably outperforms the other methods in the case of M = 16.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Performance Comparisons With The Existing Methods</head><p>In order to reveal the feasibility of the proposed method in different satellite communication environments, we make performance comparisons with the related works under two FSF channels in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Here, a 7-paths Rician channel is used to describe the satellite LOS scenario (e.g. the access device is located at a country/suburban or has a large elevation angle), in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MSE</head><p>He <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> Zhen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Proposed M = 4 Proposed M = 8 Proposed M = 16</p><p>Fig. In the following, we perform performance comparisons for different RA methods from the aspects of timing MSE, the success probability of first access, and the mean normalized access energy, respectively. Notice that the preamble designs of the referenced methods are based on the system parameters listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> exhibits the timing MSE performance curves of different RA methods in a 7-paths Rician channel. Here, the residual CFO is 250 Hz after frequency compensation, and the target false alarm probability is set to be the same value specified in 5G RA, i.e. 10 -3 . It can be seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> that, since the timing estimation performance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> with small sub-carrier spacing is greatly affected by CFO, this method suffers from a considerable timing error at different SNRs. By reusing the terrestrial 5G RA preamble format in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, both methods have a relatively larger sub-carrier interval compared to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and thus could be effectively used for tracking the first and strongest arrival path in satellite LOS scenario. It is notable that, the timing estimation performance of the proposed method can be continuously improved by increasing the correlation length. To clarify, at an appropriately correlation length, that is when M is set as 8 or 16, the proposed method can achieve a significantly lower timing MSE compared to the existing methods.</p><p>Further, we compare the timing MSE performance of the aforementioned methods under a 4-paths Rayleigh channel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. Here, the CFO and the target false alarm probability are set as 0 and 10 -3 , respectively. Note that all the methods have high timing errors at extremely low SNRs; however, with the increment of SNR, the influence of multipath effect dominates, which may greatly affect their timing estimation performance. To be specific, there is no further performance improvement for the methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> when SNR &gt; -10 dB. This is because both methods can only indicate the strongest LOS path, which is not the first arriving path in this satellite NLOS scenario. On the contrary, due to the reasonable design of detection threshold, the proposed method can effectively track the first path, and consequently obtain a much better timing accuracy in contrast with the conventional methods. Again, its performance is also improved as the correlation length increases. As we know, the success probability of channel access is one of vital evaluation criteria of access efficiency in satellite RA, which can be utilized to indicate energy efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and access delay. To demonstrate the performance benefit of channel access success probability, we compare the proposed method with our earlier method given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, wherein CFO is set to 0 for fair comparison. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>, it is observed that our method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> could achieve an acceptable success probabilities in both AWGN channel and 7-paths Rician channel. However, in the 4-paths Rayleigh channel, its performance is extremely degraded due to the existence of stronger scattering paths. By contrast, attributable to the efficient resistance of multi-path effect, the proposed method has an obviously higher success probabilities in different channel conditions.</p><p>We shall now evaluate the energy efficiency of our proposed method. The energy efficiency of our proposed method is directly due to the high access probability which keeps the number of attempts for a successful channel access low. We show the mean normalized access energy for each method, which is the energy consumption for the channel access normalized to the energy consumption of a single access. The average energy consumed for a successful channel access depends on the access probability. Since each channel access attempt is independent, the channel access attempt can be described by a Geometric process, and mean number of attempts for a success access can be determined. Given that each  channel access consumes the same energy, the mean number of a successful attempt can be used directly to describe the mean normalized energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. To illustrate the energy efficiency of the proposed method in various satellite environments, we again compare the proposed method with our previously presented method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for different channel conditions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref>. Likewise, CFO is set to 0 for fair comparison. We immediately see adequately low normalized energy consumption for the proposed scheme for the channel access. The results further indicate that the proposed method can be applied to various satellite environments, regardless of severe channel dispersion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Discussions and Suggestions</head><p>Based on the above simulation results, we have shown the robustness of the proposed method to severe channel distortions. In this section, we further discuss and summarize the characteristics of our methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and in this paper, and give some suggestions on how to choose a more appropriate method according to the real satellite communication scenario.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>, by adopting SCLS as the preamble sequence, our previous method only uses the least root ZC sequences for generating all the available sequences, and thus On the other hand, for the proposed method that adopts E-SCLS, each available RA preamble has its own root ZC sequence, and consequently a larger number of root sequences is required to generate all the available sequences. Such that, a relatively higher detection complexity is achieved compared with that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, since each used root sequence needs one time correlation detection. Meanwhile, in the case of massive users access, interference-suppression capability of the proposed method gradually weakens as the number of users increases. Nevertheless, because the timing metric based on LDCC is not only robust to CFO, but also has a the flexibly adjusted correlation length, while considering the elaborately design of first-path detection threshold that independent of noise statistics, the proposed method is distinctly superior to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in terms of CFO-resistance capability, noise-mitigation capability, and anti-multipath fading capability.</p><p>In summation, according to the actual communication scenario parameters (such as user location, elevation angle, and etc.) and the available computing resources, the satellite receiver can adaptively choose an appropriate method based on the own unique advantages of two methods. For instance, if the access device is located at a country/suburban or has a large elevation angle, LOS path exists and Doppler shift is relatively lower, the previous method could be chosen for RA preamble design and detection; in case the access device is located at a densely built city or has a small elevation angle, NLOS scenario with large Doppler shift may occur, it is more reliable to choose the proposed method in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we focused on the robust design and detection of RA preamble for high-efficiency LEO satellite-assisted 6G IoT. First, we proposed an enhanced preamble sequence, referring to as E-SCLS, by concatenating the conjugated and circularly shifted replicas of a single root ZC sequence, so as to perform one-step TA estimation to avoid additional signaling overhead and detection procedure. Then, we presented a novel timing metric based on LDCC that can achieve the immunity to CFO and mitigation of noise, and revealed its superiority according to the statistical analysis at the correct timing index. We further derived the first-path detection threshold according to the target false alarm probability and finally showed the proposed timing estimation method for satellite multi-path fading channels.</p><p>Numerical results in different LEO scenarios validated the effectiveness of statistical analysis, and demonstrated that the proposed method with the robustness to severe channel distortion can significantly improve both the access performance and efficiency as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of timing MSE, success probability of first access, and mean normalized access energy. Moreover, we have also summarized the characteristics of our methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and in this paper, and given suggestions with respect to choosing a more appropriate method based on the actual communication scenario parameters. Note that, since each available preamble employs an individual root ZC sequence in the proposed method, the utilization of extra root sequences will introduce a high detection complexity as well as non-orthogonal interference in the case of massive access. In the future work, it is of great interest to further design the related successive interference cancellation (SIC) method with an acceptable complexity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
