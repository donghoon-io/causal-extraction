<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Indonesia's tourism sectors are the fastest contributes in service sector and become the largest industry. Indonesia's government always noticed about the infrastructure, like communication and information technology, access, health and also about hygiene as well as improving marketing strategies to attract travelers. Bandung has become one of the most popular destinations in Asian region. Remarkably West Java can reach the 4th position of capital after Bangkok, Seoul and Mumbai. The source of the information comes from an independent survey of foreign and domestic travelers, based on social network site. Besides being ASEAN's favorite, Bandung also reach the fifth ranked in Asia Pacific region and get the 21st ranked in world or global scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Bandung has become potential and popular city in Indonesia for develop a tourism business, likes attracting to foreign or domestic travelers. Data from BPS showed a decline on number of visitors in recent last year both in foreign or domestic visitors. The cause of decline because the fail of innovation to attract the domestic and foreign tourists, the visitors judges that Bandung is less attractive, so the visitors more interested to visit other cheaper country like Vietnam. However, because there is no change from year to year there arises a sense of saturation towards these tourists. In addition, the layout of the city around also becomes a factor especially with traffic jams in the city of Bandung. The decline for number visitors to Bandung were caused by the execution of 2018-2019 General Election <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The large number of aviation industries in Indonesia made every airline compete to provide the best services. Some airlines in Indonesia like Garuda Indonesia, Citilink, Lion Air, Batik Air, Sriwijaya Air, and Nam Air. One of the airlines that provides full service is Garuda Indonesia. The Garuda Indonesia Experience concept based on the five senses or "5 senses" (sight, sound, scent, taste, and touch). Sight is where Garuda Indonesia offers a variety of beauties such as traditional textiles that present bright colors on employee clothes. Sound is where Garuda Indonesia performs traditional music in the customer service office and on the plane. Scent is where Garuda Indonesia provides floral scents like those on the plane and at the customer service office. Taste is where Garuda Indonesia provides flavors that are rich in spices when giving food during flight. And Touch is where Garuda Indonesia provides Indonesian hospitality services that always greet after giving service to consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Garuda Indonesia is only airline that is highly committed as a full services airline with Indonesian services. To concretize the quality of service that refers to the distinctiveness of Indonesia as stated in its vision, Garuda Indonesia launched new service concept called by "The Garuda Experience". With the introduction of the Garuda Indonesia Experience concept, Garuda Indonesia launched a proud feature, while increasing Indonesia's image on international scope. Garuda Indonesia is one of the Indonesian airlines that uses the Experiential Marketing strategy. With various similar competitors Garuda Indonesia always strives to provide unique experiences for its customers. Experiential Marketing is considered capable of producing a good influence so that it will increase the attractiveness of consumers to come and use the products and services available to Garuda Indonesia. For consumers their experience of a product or service will influence their purchasing decisions on an item, whether to make a purchase or not. For this reason, companies must be able to see various conditions from the company side and must be able to read the characteristics of consumers and must pay attention to any aspect that supports the creation of good experiential marketing.</p><p>Garuda Indonesia has made changes in an effort to win the hearts of its company-oriented customers to be customer oriented by carrying the Garuda Experience theme. From just 'service' it is more directed at 'caring service'. In the Indonesian community, Garuda Indonesia can be known as an airline that has become a major pioneer in the world of aviation with high security performance and passenger safety guarantees and high service quality and is always improved from time to time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Experiential marketing considers recognition from customers after receiving or feeling an internal or external stimulus to an item or service, which will encourage consumers to make purchases of the goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The selection of experiential marketing that is summarized in the indicators of feeling, feeling, thinking, acting, and connecting is considered satisfying the needs of consumers will consider making consumer purchasing decisions. Based on the phenomena previously described, researchers interested to find out implementation the application of experiential marketing to brand trusts and the impacts on purchasing decisions of Garuda Indonesia Airline in Bandung 2019.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>Experiential Marketing, is defined as an ability to give goods / services products in offering emotional experiences to touch the hearts of consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The experience gained by customers involves several elements of Experiential Marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, including: 1) Sense marketing is defined as how to create experience with consumers through touching the human senses; 2) Feel marketing is a strategy and implementation in binding consumers to be happy with the company and brand through the experience of service providers; 3) The think marketing campaign is a marketing method model that encourages customers to think creatively about the company and its brands; 4) The marketing act strategy is carried out to create customer experiences that are linked to individual behavior, social behavior, and lifestyle, as well as experiences that arise through social interaction; and 5) Relate marketing is the experience of developing feelings felt by individuals which is an experience.</p><p>Brand Trust, is defined as the desire of customers to rely on brands with the risks they face because brand expectations will produce positive results. There are 3 factors that triggers the brand trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. The three factors such as: 1) Brand characteristics have vital tasks on decide consumer trust to a brand; 2) Company characteristics, the knowledge of consumer about the company that produces a brand is the basic consumer understandings of the brands; and 3) Consumer-Brand characteristics are consists of two groups that can affect the brand trust, that are consumers and brands.</p><p>Purchasing Decision, was an integration process that combines the consumer's knowledge to evaluate more than one behaviors alternative and then choose either of them. The process of purchasing decisions consist five stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, such as: 1) Introduction of needs, are the first step in process of purchase decisions which consumers will recognize a need or problem; 2) Information seeking, namely the step of making purchase decisions where consumers have been interested in seeking more information; 3) Evaluation of various types of alternatives, called the process where consumers will use the information to evaluate all of the brands available in various choices; 4) Purchasing decisions, namely the step of making purchase decisions where consumers actually buy the products or services; and the last one is 5) Post-purchase behavior, namely the stage of evaluating the purchase decisions that have been made previously whether they are in accordance with the desires. Theoretical framework can be seen on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. METHODS</head><p>Quantitative research with a causal approach is the research method was used in this study. A method of research based on nature of positivism called by Quantitative, where this method is used to checked currents population or sample. Then the data collection based on research instruments or statistical data, where the aim of this method to predetermined the hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The causal model determine is used covarization information to decide if there are a associative relationship between the cause (independent and intervening variable) and the effect (dependent variable) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The generalization area that consists of subjects or objects that have a certain number quantities and characteristics determined by researchers to be studied and become describe the conclusion called by populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. If the population is too large, and researchers are not want to learn all off the population, then researchers can only use the sample where taken from the population. The part of number quantities and the characteristics possessed by the population called by sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Population in this research were all Garuda Indonesia passengers who have been take flight in Bandung, with 100 respondents sample based the calculation of Lemeshow formula.</p><p>Path analysis is a multivariate data analysis method where the aims of knowing the direct and indirect effects of several (exogenous) causal variables on endogenous variables with patterns that can be observed directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The two-way analysis structural equation includes X as an independent variable (exogenous variable); and Y as mediating variables (intervening variables) and Z as dependent variables  The level of significance (α) in this study is determined by the examiner based on the difficulty level of data collection. In this recent study, researchers used a significance level of 5%. So using t table (α / 2) and df (n-k) then the value of t table = 0.05 (two-way test), and df (100-2) = df (98) = 1,984.</p><p>Based on the results of these calculations, it can be concluded that the testing criteria of this hypothesis, namely hypothesis 1 (H1) is accepted if t count (72,792) &gt; t table <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr">984)</ref> or significance value (0,000) &lt; alpha (0,05), then H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted. Thus, it can be concluded that the regression coefficient predictor of Experiential Marketing (X) has a significant and positive effect on Brand Trust (Y). The magnitude of the influence of Experiential Marketing (X) on Brand Trust (Y) is seen from the standardized coefficient (beta) which is equal to 0.991. From the results of the analysis the results of the correlation coefficient partially (R) of 0.991, which indicates that the relationship between variables belongs to the very strong category. The independent variable Experiential Marketing (X) is able to explain the relationship that occurs with Brand Trust (Y) or called the coefficient of determination (D) indicated by R Square of 0.982 or 98.2%. While the remaining 1.8% or 0.018 is explained by other unknown variables. So, the model of the path regression analysis equation for the first substructure is: The level of significance (α) in this study is determined by examiners based on the difficulty of collecting data. In this study, researchers used a significance level of 5%. So using t table (α / 2) and df (n-k) then the value of t table = 0.05 (twoway test), and df (100-2) = df (98) = 1,984.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y = βYX + Y = 0,991X + 0,018</formula><p>Based on the results of these calculations, it can be concluded that the testing criteria of this hypothesis, namely hypothesis 3 (H3) is rejected because t count (1.387) &lt; t table <ref type="bibr">(1.984)</ref> or significance value (0.169) &lt;alpha (0.05), then H0 is accepted and H3 is rejected. Thus, it can be concluded that the regression coefficient predictor of Experiential Marketing (X) does not significantly and positively affect Purchase Decision (Z). The magnitude of the influence of Experiential Marketing (X) on Purchasing Decisions (Z) is seen from the standardized coefficient (beta), which is equal to 0.317.</p><p>Based on the results of these calculations, it can be concluded that the testing criteria of this hypothesis, namely hypothesis 2 (H2) is accepted if t count (2.792) &gt; t table <ref type="bibr">(1.984)</ref> or significance value (0.006) &lt; alpha (0.05), then H0 is rejected and H2 is accepted. Thus, it can be concluded that the Brand Trust (Y) predictor regression coefficient has a significant and positive effect on Purchase Decision (Z). The magnitude of the influence of Brand Trust (Y) on Purchase Decisions (Z) is seen from the standardized coefficient (beta) which is equal to 0.638. For the level of significance (α) for this simultaneous test, the researcher uses a significance level of 5%. The value of F table is searched by determining the degree of freedom (df) numerator (denator) and df denominator. Numerator = many independent variables (X, Y), while denominator = N-m-1. F table = F α; (df1, df2) = F5%; df1 (3-1); df2 (100-2-1) = F5%; df1 (2); df2 (97) = 3.09.</p><p>From the table above, it can be seen that the ratio of F count (478,803) &gt; F table <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">09)</ref> and significance value = 0,000 &lt; alpha = 0,05, then H0 is rejected and H4 is accepted. Then it can be concluded that the regression coefficient value of X and Y predictors is significant and there are influences from the Experiential Marketing (X) and Brand Trust (Y) variables on the Purchase Decision variable (Z) simultaneously. From the results of the analysis the results of the simultaneous correlation coefficient (R) of 0.953, which indicates that the relationship between variables belongs to the very strong category. The independent variables Experiential Marketing (X) and Brand Trust (Y) are able to explain the relationship that occurs with a Purchase Decision (Z) or called the coefficient of determination (D) indicated by R Square of 0.908 or 90.8%. While the remaining 9.2% or 0.092 is explained by other unknown variables. So, the path regression analysis equation model for the second substructure is as follows: Z = βZX + βZY + Z = 0,317X + 0,638Y + 0,092 From the calculation of substructure 1 and 2, there is a direct effect, indirect effect and the total effect: 1) Direct effect: The effect of Experiential Marketing (X) on Purchase Decision (Z).</p><p>X to Z (ρZX) = 0,317.</p><p>2) Indirect effect: Effect of Experiential Marketing (X) through Brand Trust (Y) on Purchase Decision (Z).</p><p>X to Z through Y = ρYX x ρZY = 0,991 x 0,638 = 0,632258</p><p>3) Total effect: The effect of Experiential Marketing (X) &amp; Brand Trust (Y) totally on Purchase Decision (Z).</p><p>X and Y to Z = ρZX + (ρYX x ρZY) = 0,317 + (0,991 x 0,638) = 0,949258 From the calculation above, it can be concluded that the Experiential Marketing (X) variable through Brand Trust (Y) influences the Purchasing Decision (Z). The magnitude of the effect of variable X through Y on Z is 0.632258. While the magnitude of the total influence, namely the influence of Experiential Marketing (X) and Brand Trust (Y) together affect the Purchasing Decision (Z) of 0.949258. Calculation for all paths of influence has been completed, then a path diagram will be created for the path analysis model as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, with some sub-structure below.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Discussion</head><p>Based on the common results from above calculations, it can be concluded that the testing criteria of this hypothesis, namely hypothesis 1 (H1) is accepted if t count greater than t table or significance value smaller than alpha, then H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted. Thus, it can be concluded that the predictive regression coefficient value of Experiential Marketing (X) has a positive and significant effect to Brand Trust (Y). From previous research, there was a positive and significance effect from experiential marketing to brand trust, based on all dimensions of experiential marketing, such as sense, feel, think, act, and relate <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Experiential marketing be the most effective way for marketers to build brand trust through the all five aspects or dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the common results from above calculations, it can be concluded that the testing criteria of this hypothesis, namely hypothesis 2 (H2) is accepted if t count greater than t table or significance value less than alpha, then H0 is rejected and H2 is accepted. Thus, it can be concluded that the Brand Trust predictor regression coefficient (Y) has a significant and positive effect to Purchase Decision (Z). Previous results produce that the brand trust has an effect on purchase decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Based on the common results from above calculations, it can be concluded that the testing criteria of this hypothesis, namely hypothesis 3 (H3) is accepted if t count greater than t table or significance value smaller than alpha, then H0 is rejected and H3 is accepted. Thus, it can be concluded that the predictive regression coefficient value of Experiential Marketing (X) has a significant and positive effect on Purchase Decision (Z). Previous research shows that experiential marketing variable in that study has a significant influence on the variable consumer purchasing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Advances in Economics, Business and Management Research, volume 151 V. CONCLUSION Experiential Marketing has a significant effect on Brand Trust with a direct effect of 98.2%, meaning that the application of good Experiential Marketing to Garuda Indonesia airlines will also form a good Brand Trust. The influence of Experiential Marketing on Purchasing Decisions through Brand Trust intermediaries is 90.8%. From these results it can be seen that there needs to be an Intervening Brand Trust variable (Y) between the influence of Experiential Marketing (X) and Purchasing Decision (Z). It is proven by the magnitude of the indirect effect coefficient which is greater than the magnitude of the direct coefficient on sub-structure 2, which is 0.632258 higher than 0.317.</p><p>The advice given is that the company should maintain the implementation of Experiential Marketing that is on Garuda Indonesia airlines because the implementation has been considered good in the minds of consumers. As well as improving the Experiential Marketing strategy so that its influence becomes greater for Brand Trusts and Purchasing Decisions. Then look for ways and other factors that can improve possible purchasing decisions such as price levels, service quality, promotion intensity, and others.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>bellow.
