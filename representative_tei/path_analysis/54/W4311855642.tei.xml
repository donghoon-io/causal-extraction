<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The quality educational process is determined by various elements and elements in education. This element forms the so-called educational system. The educational system is related to the educational process carried out. Education in Indonesia faces many problems, including the quality of education in education units, especially in primary and secondary education. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to improve the quality of education which is determined by the readiness of human resources involved in the educational process. Great attention should be paid to improving the quality of education by improving teachers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Teacher performance refers to the commitment and responsibility of the decision-making teacher in relation to the delivery of instruction and training, which includes learning planning, instruction delivery and student assessment. Facilitating learning means optimizing all components related to the process, with many components involved in the learning process <ref type="bibr">(Majid, 2018:91)</ref>. The component comes from school input which is then processed through learning activities to produce outcomes, including student learning achievement. Components that relate specifically to learning are teachers and learning resources. It is undeniable that teachers play a major role in learning in schools, especially in the classroom. The teacher as a pedagogical professional who is directly related to learning must understand not only philosophical and conceptual problems about learning, but also know and apply operational problems. something The realization of the teacher's skills is reflected in the effectiveness of his teaching, which is reflected in the teacher's actions when: (1) planning learning activities; (2) engage in learning activities; and (3) conducting learning assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Supardi 2013</ref>). Based on the preliminary studies, it was found that the problem arising from the knowledge that school-based management in madrasas is still low lies in the lack of a school-to-teacher approach. School administration is also not transparent to teachers, lack of attention to facilities and infrastructure and school development. It can be said that the services of several madrasahs, especially in North Banjarmasin are not in a good category because some people are not satisfied with school services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY</head><p>This research uses a quantitative approach. The information obtained was analyzed through statistical tests to find out the facts about each of the variables studied and to find out the effect between free variables and bound variables. The research method employed the cross sectional method. In this study, the researchers tried to examine in depth how strong the effect of free variables (school-based management) on bound variables (teacher performance) through teacher commitment, and the use of learning resources at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin. The population of this study only consisted of teachers of Madrasah Ibtidayah in North Banjarmasin based on the information from the Ministry of Religious Affairs Office for the 2020/2021 Academic Year. Thus, the research sample taken was 173 people. The hypothesis test design was used to test the effect of free variables (school-based management) on teacher performance-bound variables through teacher commitment and the use of learning resources in Madrasah Ibtidaiyah, North Banjarmasin Regency using path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Based on the results obtained, the coefficients of direct and indirect effect as described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. There is a direct effect of school-based management on teacher performance through teacher commitment 0,006 Accepted H2 There is a direct effect of school-based management on teacher performance through the use of learning resources 0,000 Accepted</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3</head><p>There is a direct effect of school-based management on teacher performance 0,032 Accepted H4</p><p>There is a direct effect of commitment on teacher performance 0,009 Accepted H5 H6</p><p>There is a direct effect of the use of learning resources on teacher performance There is an indirect effect of school-based management on teacher performance through teacher commitment 0,000 0,002</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Accepted</head><p>Based on the results of the analysis, this study managed to find the effect between variables that can be explained as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Direct Effect of School-Based Management on Teacher Performance through Teacher Commitment at Madrasah</head><p>Ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin The analysis of the results showed that SBM had a positive and significant effect on teacher performance through teacher commitment. Indicators of teacher performance can arise from learning planning, learning implementation, learning assessment, mentoring and the implementation of sustainable professional development. Therefore, the role of the teacher is very important to improve the results. This can be achieved well if there are factors that encourage teachers to do their job as well as possible. One such factor is the implementation of good governance in schools. In this regard, SBM is an administrative model that gives more</p><p>The Effect of School-Based Management on Teacher Performance through Teacher Commitment and Utilization of Learning Resources at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin autonomy to schools. With greater autonomy, schools have greater authority to manage their schools, so that schools are more independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Suharno, 2008)</ref>. The results of this study support the research conducted by Fitra (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Titi (2011)</ref> which showed that school-based management (X) positively affects teacher performance (Y).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Direct Effect of School-Based Management on the Performance through the Use of Learning Resources at</head><p>Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin The effect of school-specific management on teacher performance through the use of learning resources from the results of the calculations shows that there is a significant effect between school-specific leadership on teacher effectiveness through the use of learning resources at a significant level α = 0.05. School-based management has a very significant and significant effect on the performance of teachers. A very significant effect between school-based leadership and the use of learning resources can predict the good and bad performance of teachers. The contribution of school-specific administrative variables to teacher performance was 38.7%, a figure indicating a significant contribution of sub-examinations. School-based leadership has been found to have a significant effect on teacher performance. The results of the research stated above are in line with the assumption that school based leadership plays a very important role in determining quality, without good school-based leadership the quality improvement process cannot be carried out and implemented. School-based management directly effects and determines the effectiveness of the curriculum, various learning tools, learning time and learning process. According to <ref type="bibr">Mulyasa (2014:22)</ref>, to improve the quality of teaching, in addition to improving the quality of teachers and developing learning resources, we must first improve school management. The direct effect of school-based leadership on teacher performance at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin. The analysis of the results showed that SBM had a positive and significant effect on teacher effectiveness and an adjusted R² coefficient of determination of 0.037. These results can be interpreted to mean that 3.7% of teacher effectiveness in Madrasah Ibtidaiyah, North Banjarmasin, is effected by variables consisting of school-based leadership. The remaining 66.3% was effected by other variables that were not included in the research model. School-based management is defined as a political approach aimed at reimagining school management by empowering school leaders and increasing community participation in efforts to improve school performance which includes teachers, students, school leaders, parents, and the community <ref type="bibr">(Fattah, 2013:38)</ref>. The factors that affect performance are environment, leadership behavior, work planning, performance appraisal, feedback and salary management. Meanwhile, according to Kopelmen, performance is determined by four factors, namely the environment, individual characteristics, organizational characteristics and workplace characteristics <ref type="bibr">(Supardi, 2014: 50)</ref>. The results of this study support the research studies by Titi (2011) &amp; Fitra (2011), and the results of the study showed that School Based Management (SBM) has a positive and significant effect on teacher effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Direct Effect of School-Based Management on Teacher Performance at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in North</head><p>Banjarmasin Based on the results of calculations that have been carried out above, it shows that between the teacher's commitment to teacher performance there is a significant effect on the significant level of α = 0.05. This also means that teacher commitment contributes significantly to teacher performance The contribution made by the teacher commitment variable to teacher performance is 3.4%, this figure indicates a meaningful contribution from partial testing. It was found that there was a meaningful effect of the teacher's commitment to teacher performance. The findings of the above research are in line with the opinion of Willes in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bafadal (2002)</ref> affirming the desire of teachers in performance including teacher commitment where there is a sense of security, pleasant working conditions, a sense of participation, a safe environment, and appreciation for donations, participating in policy formation, harmonious correlations. This research is in accordance with research by Budi (2013) &amp; Umam (2018) that there is a significant direct effect of teacher commitment on teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The Direct Effect of Commitment on Resources on Teacher Performance at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin</head><p>The effect of the use of learning resources on teacher performance from the calculation results shows that the variable use of learning resources shows a very significant correlation with teacher effectiveness. This significance is shown by the effect of these two factors on teacher performance, which is 11.4%, meaning that there are still other factors, namely 88.6% that affect teacher performance. Confirmation of this effect means that teacher effectiveness can be predicted using an independent two-variable approach. This approach is sufficient because the two variables are free to support each other in striving for better teacher effectiveness. The results of the research above are in line with the research study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Umam (2018)</ref> between the use of learning resources in the form of teacher activities has a significant effect on student learning outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The indirect effect of Learning Resources on Teacher Performance through Teacher Commitment at Madrasah</head><p>Ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin The analysis of the results of the study showed an indirect effect of school-based management on teacher performance through teacher commitment at madrasah ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin district in a positive and significant way. The results mean that the hypothesis that reads "There is a significant effect between the indirect effect of school-based management on teacher performance through teacher commitment at madrasah ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin" is accepted. The effect of school-based management (SBM) on teacher performance by 3.1% and by 96.9% is another factor that can affect teacher performance. In the context of school-based management (SBM), the paradigm developed is that one of the ways that is considered strategic towards improving quality and relevance is democratization, participation, and accountability of education <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Suriansyah 2014</ref>). This research is supported by research conducted by Fauziah (2018) &amp; Umam (2018) revealing that there is a positive and significant effect of school-based management on teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. The Indirect Effect of School-Based Management on Teacher Performance through the Use at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah</head><p>Learning Resources in North Banjarmasin Analysis of the results of the study showed an indirect effect of school-based management on teacher performance through the use of learning resources at madrasah ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin positively and significantly. The results indicated that the hypothesis that "There is a significant effect between the indirect effect of school-based management on teacher performance through the use of learning resources at madrasah ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin" is accepted. The effect of school-based management (SBM) on teacher performance by 90.7% and by 9.3% is another factor that can affect teacher performance. The successful performance of educational institutions can be seen from the performance of teachers or teaching staff who teach at the educational institution. Therefore, every educational institution demands that teachers be able to perform at their best, because the poor performance achieved by teachers affects the performance and success of educational institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Normianti &amp; Aslamiah, 2019)</ref>. In terms of learning, the School Management model emphasizes active learning, effective learning and enjoying learning. In this way, the student is completely immersed in his learning and feels at home in the classroom because the teacher does not appear as the person who knows best, but as a dynamic and creative facilitator <ref type="bibr">(Supriono, 2001</ref>). This research is in line with the research studies by Scholihah (2017) &amp; Fauziah (2018) on the implementation of school-based management to improve the quality of teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>The results of this study showed that there is a direct effect of school-based management on teacher performance through teacher commitment at madrasah ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin. There is a direct effect of school-based management on teacher performance through the use of learning resources at madrasah ibtidaiyah in North Banjarmasin.
