<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The professional commitment of lecturers at the university level is one of the important factors necessary to produce qualified graduates. Empirical research was conducted to discover factors that significantly influence lecturers' commitment variables. This study was conducted among 252 lecturers in four private universities located in Bogor, Indonesia. The data were obtained by means of a valid and reliable questionnaire. The purpose of this research was to ascertain the effects of organizational variables, which were the organizational climate, individual characteristics which was self-efficacy, and job involvement as the intervening variable. The data analysis employed the path analysis method. The research findings showed that there was a significant influence of self-efficacy on professional commitment, and there was a significant influence of job involvement on professional commitment. Conversely, there was no significant influence of organizational on professional commitment. However, there was a significant influence of organizational climate on professional commitment through job involvement. In addition, there was a significant influence of self-efficacy on professional commitment through job involvement. This study proposed some recommendations for the principals of universities in Bogor to improve the Organizational Climate, Self-efficacy and Job Involvement indicators that have a high loading factor. By improving those indicators, it can be predicted lecturers' professional commitment will improve.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There are many roles of lecturers that cannot be replaced by technology. Lecturers have a noble mission and the task of teaching and training students so that they will be able to achieve their ideal job or fulfil their vision for the future. It is important for lecturers to have a level of high professional commitment, that is commitment to their profession as a lecturer, in which they are willing to identify the critical factors of his/her duties and strive to improve those factors as the responsibilities of his/her profession.</p><p>Educators as lecturers are expected to demonstrate strong and healthy collegial relationships in an educational setting in order to reduce isolation and increase professionalism. The benefits of collegiality are consistently highlighted in the literature. Educational researchers and scientists have suggested that developing the ability among school personnel to function as professional collegial communities can lead to effective outcomes and substantial school improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barth 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">DuFour 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Little et al. 2003)</ref>. Lecturer professional commitment was also identified as an important factor in determining and influencing the achievement of organizational and professional goals. Organizational commitment is essential to organizational and professional productivity, quality, and performance (Lee, Carswell, Allen 2000; Meyer, Allen 1997).</p><p>Lecturers with a high level of professional commitment will work as a professional both in academic and non-academic fields. Lecturers are not solely instructors who convey knowledge, but also educators who instill values that provide direction and guide students to succeed in learning. The success of students in learning will lead to a high quality of education. An educator has the responsibility to internalize ideal values of educational goals and social norms in his/her students. The university has to realize that they need to drive lecturers to have a level of high professional commitment in conducting their job. A high level of professional commitment will become a determining factor in achieving organizational goals.</p><p>A high level of commitment from a lecturer is important for a university, where commitment to the profession of a lecturer will make the lecturer open to self-development and be willing to make the best efforts he can for advancement of the profession, which in turn will be seen externally (the outcome) in the form of graduates who are qualified, superior and able to compete in the world of work. Lecturers with a high level of professional commitment are characterized by strong affective commitment which is shown by having an emotional bond to the profession, as well as self-involvement in the interests of the profession. Those lecturers have strong continuance commitment which shown by awareness of the disadvantages of leaving the profession and the desire to remain in the profession. Furthermore, those lecturers have strong normative professional commitment which shown by the attitude of willingness to do something more for advancement of the profession, as well as an attitude of obligation towards professional duties. Again, a lecturer who has a high level of professional commitment shows dedication to the profession, professional ethics and a sense of calling to do more for advancement of the profession (Attri, Devi 2017). Low job involvement will reduce performance and be detrimental to the institution and profession. An individual's positive attitude and involvement have a great influence on their performance.</p><p>This study started by conducting a preliminary survey in order to identify the condition of lecturers' affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative commitment. The survey used a questionnaire consisting of 15 self-report items that was given to 32 lecturers from four universities in Bogor City (the questionnaire was inspired by the questionnaire on organizational commitment developed by <ref type="bibr">Mowday, Streer and Porter (1979)</ref>). The survey had several findings as follows:</p><p>1. 39% of the lecturers had problems in affective professional commitment, which is evident from the number of lecturers who have problems with emotional bonds to the profession, in personal involvement for the sake of the profession and with positive feelings towards the profession. 2. 62% of the lecturers had problems with continuance professional commitment, which is evident from the number of lecturers who have problems with the awareness of losses when leaving the profession and the desire to remain in his profession. 3. 31% of the lecturers had problems with normative professional commitment, which is evident from the number of lecturers who have problems with the willingness to do more for professional development and obligatory attitudes towards their professional tasks.</p><p>As part of the survey an interview with those 32 lecturers was also conducted in order to identify the factors that might have influenced their affective, continuance and normative professional commitment as mentioned above. Those factors are classified into four categories, which are: organizational mechanisms, group mechanisms, individual characteristics and individual mechanisms (Colquitt, Lepine, Wesson 2015). The results of the interview showed that most of the lecturers indicated several factors that might have influenced their professional commitment. Those factors were the organizational climate that was too bureaucratic (one of the factors from the organizational mechanisms), most of the lecturers had low self-efficacy (one of the factors from individual characteristics), and there were indications that the lecturers had low job involvement (one of the factors from individual mechanisms).</p><p>Based on the preliminary survey findings above, it can be assumed that the problem of the lecturers' professional commitment was related to some problems of the universities' organizational climate, the lecturers' self-efficacy and the lecturers' job involvement. Some prior research identified that the organizational climate, self--efficacy, and job involvement are the factors that have an influence on professional commitment <ref type="bibr">(Raman et</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>Considering the results of the preliminary survey and several research findings mentioned above, the assumptions that lecturers' professional commitment is related to the universities' organizational climate, the lecturers' self-efficacy, and the lecturers' job involvement as an intervening variable, were made. Based on those assumptions, the objective of the study is to investigate the relations we formulated as follows:</p><p>1. The direct effect of organizational climate on professional commitment. 2. The direct effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment. 3. The direct effect of job involvement on professional commitment. 4. The direct effect of organizational climate on job involvement.</p><p>5. The direct effect of self-efficacy on job involvement. 6. The indirect effect of organizational climate on professional commitment through job involvement. 7. The indirect effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment through job involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Review</head><p>The Nature of Professional Commitment <ref type="bibr">Goswami et al. (2007, pp. 13-27)</ref> posit that professional commitment refers to the psychological relationship between an individual and his work based on the affective reaction to that work. Someone with high work commitment identifies himself with his job and has positive feelings about his work. The dimensions of professional commitment are: a) affective commitment, that is, one's emotional attachment to their work, b) normative commitment, which is a sense of one's obligation to keep working, c) continuance commitment, namely commitment that involves an individual's assessment of material loss if he leaves his job.</p><p>Cohen (2007, pp.  argues that professional commitment is the extent to which individual members identify with their profession and support its values. The dimensions of professional commitment are: a) affective commitment is a positive feeling for one's work, b) ongoing commitment (continuance) is the material sacrifice as a consequence of leaving one's work, c) normative commitment refers to the obligation to work.</p><p>As defined by Lee et al. (in: Sezgin, Ağar 2012, pp. 21-25), professional commitment is the relative strength of identification and involvement in a particular profession, as well as the willingness to exert effort for advancement of the profession and a desire to maintain membership in it. The dimensions of professional commitment are: a) affective commitment is a person's emotional attachment to his work, b) normative commitment is one's sense of obligation to stay at his job, c) ongoing commitment is an individual's assessment of the material consequences of leaving his job.</p><p>According to Wang and Shen (2012, pp. 156-166), professional commitment (PC) is a type of work commitment that emphasizes the importance of the profession (work) in one's life. The dimensions of professional commitment are a) affective commitment, namely the commitment to career achievement (feelings attached to the career), b) normative commitment, namely commitment that arises because of strong group norms, commitment that arises because of strong group norms, c) ongoing commitment, i.e. commitment to the consequences of material loss if one leaves their job.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Nature of Organizational Climate</head><p>Uhl-Bien, Schermerhorn and Osborn (2014, p. 13) state that organizational climate refers to members' shared perceptions of the organization in terms of management policies and practices. The indicators of organizational climate: 1) superior-subordinate relations, 2) communication between members of the organization, 3) members' perceptions of organizational policies, 4) members' perceptions of management practices (fairness).</p><p>Adenike (2011, pp. 151-165) argues that organizational climate is the perception of the members of the organization about its organization, and where this perception affects the attitudes and behavior related to work. Organizational climate is measured by the following indicators: 1) management and leadership style, 2) participation in decision making, 3) challenging work, 4) boredom and frustration, 5) other benefits, 6) personnel policy, 7) working conditions, 8) the presence of an adequate career path. <ref type="bibr">Belausteguigoitia et al. (2007, pp. 5-24)</ref> posits that organizational climate is understood as an employee's interpretation of the work environment and organization. The dimensions of the organizational climate are: 1) management support, 2) policy clarity, 3) freedom of self-expression, 4) contribution (performance), 5) recognition of position and achievement, 6) task challenges.</p><p>Boateng et al. (2014, pp. 166-177) state that organizational climate is a shared perception felt by members in a particular organization, which includes a set of attributes that exist in an organization. The indicators of organizational climate are: 1) employee responsibilities, i.e. feelings of being trusted to carry out important tasks, 2) organizational structure, i.e. feelings about barriers and freedom to act, 3) warmth that is the existence of friendly social groups, 4) conflict management, i.e. the feelings that managers and other coworkers want to hear different opinions, 5) identity, that is, the feeling that you are part of an organization and that you are a valued member of a work team, 6) appreciation for work performance.</p><p>The Nature of Self-Efficacy <ref type="bibr">Bandura (1994, pp.</ref> 71-81) suggests that self-efficacy is one's belief in his ability to carry out a task. People who are confident in their abilities tend to succeed, while those who always feel like they are failing, tend to fail. Self-efficacy when associated with professional commitment is if someone has high self-efficacy, he tends to have commitment to his duties.</p><p>In the work of <ref type="bibr">Gibson et al. (2006, pp.</ref> 161-162) self-efficacy is defined as the belief that a person can perform adequately in certain situations. The dimensions of self-efficacy are a) magnitude, namely the level of difficulty of the task that a person believes he can achieve, b) strength, refers to the beliefs about how strong the magnitude is (the magnitude of the task), c) generality, and the extent of expectations of success in different situations.</p><p>Ivancevich (2010, p. 217) argues that self-efficacy is the belief that a person can perform well in certain situations. The indicators of self-efficacy are a) motivation to engage in behavior that will make them perform well, b) motivation to learn more and apply the learning outcomes to improve performance, c) motivation to set higher goals.</p><p>Boyd and Bee (2009, p. 281) suggested that self-efficacy is one's belief in his ability so that what is desired manifests itself or becomes reality. The indicators of self-efficacy are a) the perception of a similarity of ability to that of fellow group members, b) motivation from information sources that are considered important, c) the experience of success in similar activities.</p><p>Kinicki and Fugate (2012, pp. 125-127) argued that self-efficacy is one's belief in the chance of successfully completing a certain task. The indicators of self-efficacy are a) previous success experiences, b) social persuasion (group support), c) behavioral models and d) physical and emotional states.</p><p>According to Luthans (2011, p. 203), self-efficacy is a person's beliefs about his ability to motivate, cognitive resources and real actions needed to successfully carry out tasks in certain situations. The dimensions of self-efficacy are: a) magnitude, which measures the magnitude or level of difficulty of a task that someone believes he is able to carry out, b) strength, that is the strength of that magnitude to be able to exercise perseverance when difficulties arise in carrying out the task, c) generalization, namely perception or the expectation that similar successes can occur in other assignments in different situations depends on the situation, tasks and conditions of the person concerned.</p><p>Feist, Feist and Roberts (2013, p. 493) argued that self-efficacy is one's belief about ability to cope with certain situations, shown by behaving as expected. The factors that affect one's self-efficacy include: a) previous success experiences; this tends to increase self-efficacy, b) social modeling; self-efficacy tends to increase when someone sees other people who are considered equivalent capable of doing the same task, c) social persuasion, where meaningful expressions from influential or trusted people, this can reduce or increase one's self-efficacy, d) physical and emotional states; anxiety, fear and excessive stress can potentially reduce self-efficacy. , job involvement is defined as the extent to which a person is physically and cognitively busy with, involved in, and concerned with his work.</p><p>Hallberg and Schaufeli (2006, pp. 119-127) report that job involvement is positively correlated with feedback and negatively correlated with the intention to leave one's job.</p><p>From the literature review above, it can be stated that a person who has a positive perception about their organizational climate and has high self-efficacy will show high professional commitment. In addition, a person who has high involvement in their job has strong emotional ties to their profession. The research findings conducted by Raman, Chang and Khalid (2015) and Dwiharto, Nirwanto and Manan (2017) stated that there is a positive effect of organizational climate on professional commitment. Moreover, the research findings by Sumual (2014) reveal that there is a positive effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment. Masoud <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pourkaini et al. (2014)</ref> found that there is a positive effect of organizational climate on job involvement. Srivastava et al. and Yang, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kao, Huang (2006)</ref> found that there is a positive effect of self-efficacy on job involvement. There is a positive effect of job involvement on affective, continuance and normative commitment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Khan et al. (2011)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Method</head><p>This study used the quantitative method, applied path analysis, and used questionnaires as intruments for data collection. Organizational climate and selfefficacy are independent variables, while professional commitment is a dependent variable, and job involvement is an intervening variable.</p><p>Descriptive and regression statistics were used to find the relationship among the research variables and the initial solution to the encountered problem. It means that increasing the organizational climate and self-efficacy will lead to an increase in professional commitment.</p><p>The study was conducted at four private universities in Bogor, Indonesia, from March to 2019. This study was conducted in Bogor because we found indications of the existence of professional commitment issues in the area (pre-survey data). This study mainly used quantitative data (from questionnaires). By using simple random sampling, a sample of 252, calculated by the Slovin formula at p &lt; 0.05, was randomly selected from 683 lecturers as the population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>Based on the results of the initial confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the items of professional commitment were not yet fit but after modification the items became fit. Chi-square test results = 17.97, d.f. = 12, p-value = 0.1165 and RMSEA = 0.050. This shows that the one-factor (unidimensional) model is acceptable, where all the indicators measure only one factor, namely professional commitment. From the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> above, it can be seen that the having emotional ties to the profession indicator has the highest loading factor among the other indicators, which is 0.79.</p><p>Based on the results of the initial CFA, the items from the organizational climate were not yet fit, but after modification the items became fit. Chi-square test results = 29.48, d.f. = 19, p-value = 0.05882 and RMSEA = 0.052. This shows that the onefactor (unidimensional) model is acceptable, where the all indicators only measure one factor, namely organizational climate.  After calculating the goodness of fit (GOF), the next is step is to test the hypothesis with a path coefficient. Path coefficients indicate the degree of significance in hypothesis testing. The hypothesis used in this study is a two-tailed hypothesis. Therefore, the accepted hypothesis assessment has a t-statistic value of more than 1.64 or a p-value of less than alpha 0.05. Path coefficient testing is divided into direct and indirect methods. The table below shows direct influence testing between the variables. Hypothesis 2 states that there is a direct positive effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 2.13 is more than 1.64; therefore the decision to accept H2 means that there is a positive influence of self-efficacy on professional commitment of 0.29. Hence, along with an increase in self-efficacy, professional commitment will increase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors</head><p>Hypothesis 3 states that there is a direct positive influence of job involvement on professional commitment. Based on the table above, the t-statistics value of 3.59 is more than 1.64; therefore the decision to accept H3 means that there is a significant positive influence of job involvement on professional commitment of 0.52. Hence, along with an increase in job involvement, professional commitment will increase.</p><p>Hypothesis 4 states that that there is a direct positive effect of organizational climate on job involvement. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 2.04 is more than 1.64; therefore the decision to accept H4 means that there is a significant positive effect of organizational climate on job involvement of 0.13. Hence, along with an improvement in organizational climate, job involvement will increase.</p><p>Hypothesis 5 states that there is a direct positive effect of self-efficacy on job involvement. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 8.43 is more than 1.64; therefore the decision to accept H5 means that there is a significant positive effect of self-efficacy on job involvement of 0.75. Hence, along with an increase in self-efficacy, job involvement will increase. Hypothesis 6 states that there is an indirect positive effect of organizational climate on professional commitment through job involvement. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 1.75 is more than 1.64; therefore the decision is to accept H6. This means that there is an indirect positive influence of the organizational climate on professional commitment through job involvement of 0.07. Hypothesis 7 states that there is an indirect positive effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment through job involvement. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 3.63 is more than 1.64; therefore the decision is to accept H7. This means that there is an indirect positive effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment through job involvement of 0.39.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>1. There is a direct positive effect of organizational climate on professional commitment. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 1.16 being less than 1.64 means that there is no significant positive effect of organizational climate on professional commitment. 2. There is a direct positive effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment.</p><p>Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 2.13 being more than 1.64 means that there is a positive influence of self-efficacy on professional commitment of 0.29. Hence, along with an increase in self-efficacy, professional commitment will increase. 3. There is a direct positive influence of job involvement on professional commitment. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 3.59 being more than 1.64 means that there is a significant positive influence of job involvement on professional commitment of 0.52. Hence, along with an increase in job involvement, professional commitment will increase. 4. There is a direct positive effect of organizational climate on job involvement.</p><p>Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 2.04 being more than 1.64 means that there is a significant positive effect of organizational climate on job involvement of 0.13. Hence, along with an improvement in organizational climate, job involvement will increase. 5. There is a direct positive effect of self-efficacy on job involvement. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 8.43 being more than 1.64 means that there is a significant positive effect of self-efficacy on job involvement of 0.75. Hence, along with an increase in self-efficacy, job involvement will increase. 6. There is an indirect positive effect of organizational climate on professional commitment through job involvement. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 1.75, being more than 1.64 means that there is an indirect positive influence of organizational climate on professional commitment through job involvement of 0.07. 7. There is an indirect positive effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment through job involvement. Based on the table above, the t-statistic value of 3.63 being more than 1.64 means that there is an indirect positive effect of self-efficacy on professional commitment through job involvement of 0.39. The scope of this study had limitations. The population and sample of lecturers enrolled in this study was only lecturers at four private universities in Bogor, Indonesia; hence the results of this study can be generalized to its population only. This study only investigated three variables (organizational climate, self-efficacy and job involvement) that had a relationship with professional commitment. Theoretically, it can be stated that many variables might have influenced professional commitment. We recommend further studies involving a larger population and sample as well as investigating more variables that might influence professional commitment.</p><p>Based on the indicator analysis results above mentioned above, it had to be further evaluated which indicator should be recommended to be improved first and then which next. This process utilized expertise judgment in the form of a qualitative approach to make a rank in order of priority of those indicators. The first priority to be recommended is to improve the organizational climate variables, namely the freedom in expressing ideas. By improving the freedom in expressing ideas, it will make lecturers more innovative in developing ideas and they will have high self-confidence in developing their ideas. The second priority to be recommended is to improve the self-efficacy variables, namely the success experience; this can be improved by self-efficacy training to increase optimism in achieving performance targets. The third priority to be recommended is to improve the job involvement variables, namely the view that work maintains self-esteem. This can be started by establishing a teamwork pattern for lecturers that can be done not only for lecturers within the same faculty but also workgroups among lecturers across faculties.</p></div>

W celu wskazania czynników mających znaczny wpływ na zmienne zaangażowania wykładowców przeprowadzono badania empiryczne wśród 252 wykładowców na czterech prywatnych uniwersytetach w Bogor w Indonezji. Dane zebrano za pomocą aktualnych i rzetelnych ankiet. Celem badania było ustalenie wpływu zmiennych organizacyjnych, takich jak klimat organizacyjny, cech indywidualnych, takich jak poczucie skuteczności zawodowej, oraz zaangażowania w pracę jako zmiennej pośredniczącej. W analizie danych zastosowano metodę analizy ścieżek. Wyniki badań wykazały znaczący wpływ poczucia skuteczności zawodowej oraz zaangażowania w pracę na zaangażowanie zawodowe. Nie wykryto natomiast istotnego wpływu zaangażowania organizacyjnego na zaangażowanie zawodowe. Jednakże badania ujawniły, że klimat organizacyjny ma istotny wpływ na zaangażowanie zawodowe poprzez zaangażowanie w pracę. Również poczucie skuteczności zawodowej znacząco wpływa na zaangażowanie zawodowe poprzez zaangażowanie w pracę. W niniejszym opracowaniu przedstawiono zalecenia dla władz uniwersytetów w Bogor w celu poprawienia wskaźników klimatu organizacyjnego, poczucia skuteczności zawodowej oraz zaangażowania w pracę, które mają wysoki współczynnik obciążenia.

The indicators of self-efficacy are: a) a can-do attitude, b) having energy (motivation), c) sources (situational factors), d) understanding of the right direction of action (role perception), e) competence or ability to perform tasks.Lunenburg (2011, pp. 1-6) suggests that self-efficacy refers to beliefs about a person's ability to complete certain tasks that affect the task someone chooses to do and the goals they set. Self-efficacy also affects the level of effort and persistence of a person when doing difficult tasks. The four sources of self-efficacy are: a) past performance, b) experience of success, c) verbal persuasion and d) emotional state.The Nature of Job involvementAccording to<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mullins (2008,</ref> p. 844), job involvement is the level of commitment of the members to their work or organization. The indicators of job involvement are: a) moral involvement based on an individual's involvement due to beliefs and values in the individual, b) target involvement based on job involvement due to being attracted by the goals of the organization. Britt et al. (2007, pp. 145-150) define job involvement as the extent to which a job is related to one's self-image. This leads to involvement, mean that a person gives their best effort in doing their work, involving cognitive, emotional, and physical investment in their work. Involvement in organizational goals (involvement works because they are attracted to / called by the goals to be achieved by the organization). The components of job involvement are: a) job clarity, b) prospects for achievement, c) self-development opportunities, d) the importance of work for individuals. According to Shaheen and Farooqi (2014, pp. 6-12), job involvement is psychological identification or individual commitment to one's work. The indicators of job involvement are: a) the work done is decent and appropriate for him, b) the work is considered very important in his life, c) the work is important for his self-esteem. As stated by Hackett et al. (Aderibigbe, Onyinye, Panan 2014, pp. 15-22)</figDesc></figure>
