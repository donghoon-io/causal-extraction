<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The expertise of teachers has a significant impact on improving education system quality. Teachers are educational agents who carry out learning in schools, therefore this is the case. The improvement of a teacher's quality will have an influence on the quality of pupils. Having proficiency in their particular professions is one measure of boosting the quality of instructors. Teachers' quality may be observed in how they plan, manage, and assess their students' learning. Learning shall be carried out in a professional and responsible manner by qualified instructors. Improving teacher quality has a significant impact and influence on teacher performance. Teacher performance is a key factor in deciding whether or not a student receives a good education. Teacher performance in the classroom as a portrayal of a teacher carrying out learning activities Because of the teacher's experience in providing learning, the quality of the teacher's performance is directly proportionate to learning results. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Trianda and Thomas (2014)</ref>, there is a 36 percent correlation between teacher performance and student learning outcomes. Because the teacher is the one who executes and assesses the learning process, good teacher performance can increase the quality of learning. Poor teacher performance has an effect on the learning process, lowering the educational quality. Teacher performance, according to <ref type="bibr">Supardi (2013:54)</ref>, is the ability of instructors to carry out learning activities in schools and be accountable for students under their supervision through improving student learning outcomes. Teacher performance is the result of an assessment of the process and work accomplished by teachers in carrying out their duties, as stated in the Regulation of the Minister of National Education of the Republic of Indonesia Number 35 of 2010 concerning Technical Instructions for the Implementation of Functional Positions of Teachers and their Credit Scores. Teacher performance may be defined as a condition that demonstrates a teacher's capacity to carry out his responsibilities at school and the activities that instructors engage in during the learning process. The community's attention is focused on the lack of instructors (Alfandi, <ref type="bibr">November 22, 2021)</ref>. As a result, pupils were forced to leave before the class was completed. When teachers leave the classroom while students are learning, it indicates that the teacher's performance is poor. Many parents or guardians of pupils demonstrate because of the numerous vacant hours, according to media reports <ref type="bibr">(Yusuf, March 23. 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, the quality of teacher professional competence remains inadequate. The lack of utilization of learning material and understanding of information technology exemplifies this. Spiritual intelligence and teacher performance are linked. Teachers with spiritual intelligence will act honestly, be more transparent, and do their jobs to the best of their abilities, making them happier and more productive. The development of excellent spiritual intelligence will help to balance body and soul, making studying more enjoyable. Humans' evolution into perfect physical and spiritual beings is aided by spiritual intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Srivastava, 2016)</ref>. It is vital to have high levels of work motivation in order to attain effective teacher performance. Teachers with a high work ethic can create passion in the classroom, which can lead to improved performance. This is in accordance with the results of Fauzyah's research (2020: 51) concluding that there is a positive and significant relationship between teacher work motivation and teacher performance. Work motivation and work discipline are two different things but have a relationship in the activities of an organization. Work motivation is a very important element in an effort to improve the work discipline of employees in order to achieve maximum work results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>The purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the following direct and indirect relationships: spiritual intelligence with teacher performance, work motivation with teacher performance, work discipline with teacher performance, spiritual intelligence with work discipline, work motivation with work discipline, spiritual intelligence with teacher performance through work discipline, work motivation with teacher performance through work discipline, spiritual intelligence with teacher performance through work discipline, work motivation with teacher performance through work discipline. This research had a total of 199 participants, all of whom were instructors. The research sample consisted of 113 persons who were picked using Cronbach's Alpha to determine proportionate random sampling. Data collection was carried out using instruments consisting of spiritual intelligence (intentions, high level of awareness, ability to overcome difficulties, independence and optimism in life), work motivation (pushing factors and health factors), work discipline (official assignments, time, work atmosphere, community service, and behavior) and teacher performance (quality, accuracy, initiative, ability and communication). Pearson's Product Moment Correlation was used to assess the instrument's validity and reliability. The data for this study were gathered and analyzed using path analysis to discover the link between variables after performing preparatory tests such as normality, linearity, and homogeneity in agreement with the conceptual connection factors listed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Conceptual Relationship Model between variables</head><p>According to the conceptual model, path analysis is used to answer seven research hypotheses: H1: there is a direct relationship between spiritual intelligence and teacher performance; H2: there is a direct relationship between work motivation and teacher performance; H3: there is a direct relationship between work discipline and teacher performance; H4: there is a direct relationship between spiritual intelligence and work discipline; H5: there is a direct relationship between spiritual intelligence and work discipline; H6: there is a direct relationship between spiritual intelligence and work discipline  The path analysis results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> are used to answer the seven research hypotheses that have been formulated and the decisions are given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Furthermore, Table <ref type="table">2</ref> is a summary of the decisions H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 with a significance value criterion of less than 0.05, then hypothesis is accepted. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> is a summary of the decisions for testing the H6 and H7 hypotheses provided that if the indirect correlation coefficient is less than the direct correlation coefficient, then the hypothesis is accepted. Based on the results of the analysis in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,</ref><ref type="table">2</ref>, and 3, this study found a relationship between variables that can be explained as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Based</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The direct relationship between Spiritual Intelligence and Teacher Performance</head><p>Based on the results of the data analysis of this study, the correlation coefficient between spiritual intelligence and performance is 0.592. This means that there is a direct relationship with the moderate category between spiritual intelligence and performance. Thus spiritual intelligence is directly proportional to the teacher's performance.</p><p>Teachers who have spiritual intelligence will behave honestly, be more transparent and can carry out their duties as well as possible. This is in line with Tischler's statement ( Wibowo, CT: 2015) which states that people with higher spiritual intelligence have healthier, happier and happier lives. productive at work.</p><p>Teachers with high levels of spiritual intelligence have self-awareness in carrying out their duties. This self-awareness will be able to communicate with himself before with others. Communication as a form of self-introspection in overcoming difficulties and problems encountered. Teachers with high spiritual intelligence will always pray, and try to be independent in their work, so they can manage time well.</p><p>The results of this study support the research of Baharuddin &amp; Zakaria (2018), Annisa and Mayliza (2019), Angelica, Graha &amp; Wilujeng (2020), Ratnasari, Supardi &amp; Nasrul (2020)., Wibowo, A., &amp; Febrianto, RA (2021) .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The direct relationship between work motivation and teacher performance</head><p>The results of the data analysis of this study found that there was a direct relationship between work motivation and performance with a very low category of 0.142. Thus motivation will move and improve performance and be responsible for work. This is in accordance with the motivation theory by Herzberg (Hasibuan: 2014) teacher work motivation can be measured through (1) driving factors which include achievement, recognition, improvement, responsibility and the work itself. and (2) health factors which include interpersonal relationships with colleagues, interpersonal relationships with subordinates, interpersonal relationships with superiors, job security, personal life, policies and administration, opportunities for growth, status and working conditions.</p><p>Work motivation is a driving force and is able to create work enthusiasm, so that it can generate, direct, and behave in work. Teachers who have high work motivation will try to carry out their duties and obligations well. This means that work motivation can contribute to its performance. The role of motivation in work is very important, especially in the world of education. If you have high work motivation, the teacher is more active and diligent in working.</p><p>The results of this study strengthen the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Riyadi &amp; Mulyapradana (2017)</ref>., <ref type="bibr">Ardiana (2017)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Direct Relationship between Work Discipline and Teacher Performance</head><p>The results of this study found evidence of a positive and significant relationship between work discipline and performance of 0.250. This means that there is a direct relationship with the low category between work discipline and teacher performance. Discipline is an attitude of respect, respect, obedience and obedience to applicable regulations. Work discipline reflects the magnitude of one's responsibility for the tasks given which can encourage work enthusiasm in realizing organizational goals, (Iswan &amp; Hadidah, 2019).</p><p>Teachers with high work discipline will work and be responsible for their duties, so they can organize and discipline themselves. The higher the level of work discipline, the better time management can be, so that the planned targets can be completed as expected. The fulfillment of targets has an impact on good performance, so that organizational goals are achieved.</p><p>This study ascertains the previous research study conducted by <ref type="bibr">Shelviana (2015)</ref>, Hadiati (2018), Ginting, &amp; Wau (2019), Oktaviani, &amp; Putra (2021) and Roswirman, &amp; Elazhari (2021).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The direct relationship between Spiritual Intelligence and Teacher Work Discipline</head><p>The coefficient of spiritual intelligence on job discipline is 0.741, according to the research. This demonstrates that spiritual intelligence and job discipline have a direct link with a strong category.</p><p>The teaching profession necessitates that all efforts be made to carry out their duties with honesty and accountability. The way he takes responsibility for completing the assignment reflects his spiritual wisdom. This is in keeping with Goleman's (2015) assertion that spiritual intelligence is founded on 5 (five) elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, and social skills, and that spiritual intelligence defines a person's place in learning practical skills.</p><p>Spiritual intelligence can determine a person's position in learning practical skills including elements of self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, and social skills. Teachers with good spiritual intelligence have an attitude of selfawareness, empathy and have effective relationships. This can encourage himself in carrying out his duties and have a perception in terms of order, self-regulation at work without any violations that harm himself, others, or the environment.</p><p>This research supports previous research study including: Sarom (2014), Ismatullah (2015), Budiantoro, Sunaryo, &amp; Abs, (2019) and Fathurrohman, &amp; Ibrahim (2021).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Connection Work Motivation on Teacher Work Discipline</head><p>Work motivation and teacher work discipline have a 0.255 association relationship. This shows that there is a clear link between low-level instructors' enthusiasm to work and their discipline. Motivation influences a person's work discipline, implying that growing a person's discipline is impacted by his work motivation.</p><p>Motivation is the driving force that inspires people to be enthusiastic about their job, causing them to want to collaborate, work efficiently, and combine all of their efforts in order to attain fulfillment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hasibuan, 2014)</ref>. Internal/Intrinsic Motivation is a source of motivation for work that comes from within an individual's knowledge of the value, advantages, and purpose of the work he conducts. External or extrinsic motivation is the driving force for work that comes from outside the individual, in the form of a condition that requires him to carry out work optimally <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Prihartanta, 2015)</ref>. Motivation is useful for organizations, because it functions as a driver, influence, and driver of actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sjukur, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>This </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Indirect relationship between Spiritual Intelligence on performance through work discipline</head><p>The correlation coefficient of the indirect association between work spiritual intelligence and performance through teacher work discipline is 0.185 based on the findings of this study. As a result, there is an indirect association between spiritual intelligence and performance through teacher work discipline with a very low category.</p><p>Teachers who are intelligent, moral, creative, and solution-oriented are capable of achieving educational and organizational objectives. This attitude becomes ingrained in one's mind, resulting in heightened awareness when performing things to the utmost extent possible. This will have an impact on the teacher's ability to instruct. Work discipline that stems from spiritual knowledge and drive fosters excellent discipline and is acceptable to everybody. Teachers who have empathy are able to meet social needs, are more disciplined in carrying out their work. This means that empathy as an indicator of spiritual intelligence and social needs as well as a dimension of teacher work motivation can jointly improve teacher work discipline.</p><p>The results of this study are in line with the research of Choiriah (2013), Sari (2019), Annisa and Mayliza (2019), Ratnasari (2020), <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wibowo, &amp; Febrianto (2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Indirect relationship between work motivation and performance through work discipline</head><p>The correlation coefficient of the indirect association between work motivation and performance through work discipline is 0.064, according to the results of study data analysis using route analysis. This demonstrates that there is a positive indirect association with a very low category, particularly between work motivation and teacher performance, through work discipline.</p><p>Discipline is a system of respect, compliance, and obedience to appropriate norms that maintains order among all individuals. Good work discipline indicates the size of a person's responsibility for the duties allocated to him, which fosters excitement for achieving organizational objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Iswan &amp; Hadidah, 2019)</ref>. According to Maslow's theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sunyoto, Danang, 2013)</ref>, the hierarchy of human needs is as follows: Physiological Needs (a), Security Needs (b), and Social Needs (c) are the three types of needs. Appreciation Needs and Self-Actualization Needs are two types of needs. This will motivate instructors to work harder, more consistently, and more systematically. Teacher work motivation will support the development of improved work discipline in the classroom.</p><p>In general, a person's values and values in connection to his work or career include discipline, responsibility, motivation, hard effort, curiosity, and innovation. The stronger a teacher's spiritual intelligence and job drive, the more discipline and performance he or she will have. The results of this study support research <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rozalia (2015)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Based on the findings of this study's analysis and discussion, it can be inferred that spiritual intelligence, work motivation, work discipline, and teacher performance are all linked or have a direct correlation. Furthermore, there is an indirect correlation between spiritual intelligence and work discipline performance, as well as an indirect relationship between work motivation and work discipline performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>on the findings, the data calculation using the Statistical Program for Social Science gives the following meanings: Intelligence and Work Motivation with Performance through Work Discipline of State Vocational High School Teachers in Hulu Sungai Utara Regency</figDesc></figure>
