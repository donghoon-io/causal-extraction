<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The use of additive biomanufacturing (ABM) technologies will define many future pathways for next-generation medical devices and implants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. One form of ABM technology, melt electrowriting (MEW) has the capacity to design and print innovative medical devices and implants with highly organized architectures, particularly for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TE&amp;RM) applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. With MEW, an applied high voltage prevents the fluid jet break up, which is delivered to a nozzle at very low flow rates. This electrified molten jet, which travels linearly towards a grounded or oppositely charged collector, can be sustained at flow rates (typically less than 50µL/h) by the applied voltage. Similarly to existing direct-writing AM technologies, the melt can be deposited via the pre-programmed relative movement between the collector and the print head <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>However, due to its multi-parametric nature including electrohydrodynamic and motion-driven effects, MEW is a complex fibre processing technology. Understandably, there are numerous medical polymers with different properties that would be of interest to process with this technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. For each different polymer, numerous system parameters determine the fabrication quality: the shape and diameter of the emerging fibre, the layering and bonding behaviour and subsequently the morphology of the resulting scaffold <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, an in-process control is required within this multiparametric environment to readily identify the most stable MEW operating conditions for consistent and reproducible fabrication. Such outcomes are essential not only to achieve commercially translatable, 3D-printed medical devices and implants but also compare data sets between different research labs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The MEW fabrication technology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) is based on the creation of a micron-scaled and molten polymer jet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), which accelerates towards the collector due to three principal forces (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). The viscosity and mass flow rate into the Taylor cone are defined by the applied pressure and processing temperature, in combination defined as "polymer pushing force" (FPush). Increasing air pressure and therefore increasing fluid to the jet increases the final diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Higher temperatures are reported to increase the diameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> since lower viscosity polymers will flow to the nozzle faster and provide less physical resistance to stretching <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Mobile charge carriers due to the applied voltage initiates the formation of a stable jet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. This physically accelerates the jet towards the grounded collector due to electrostatic forces, termed here as FElect.. This force has been reported to have a small thinning effect on melt electrospun membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. While the F Elect. draws the charged polymer along the electrostatic field lines, the moving collector drags the ejected jet into a catenary shaped curve, which creates a lag in deposition similar to viscoelastic fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref> and<ref type="figure">c</ref>). The collector speed initiates mechanical drag forces (F Mech ) on the jet and leads to enhanced stretching and significant thinning of the final diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Unstable MEW processing regimes exist where too high mass flow rate to the nozzle leads to so-called "pulsing" behaviour within the jet <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Due to the low viscosity of the extruded melt, the material is released at periodic intervals. This led to an unstable flight path as well as to the deposition of fibres with different diameters.</p><p>In comparison to many other AM technologies, MEW is rather young. However, the technology is distinct in that it can manufacture low diameter fibres that can be direct-written in to mechanically tune strength while maintaining a low volume fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The capability of expanding the range of polymers processable via MEW <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> provides even more opportunity to develop innovative biomedical devices. Attempting to process and formulate different polymers rapidly for MEW is difficult due to a large amount of data that is generated. Such large datasets, however, are essential to further investigate this multi-parametric environment and to more precisely identify the effects of all system parameters on the scaffolds. In fact, a few studies provided important findings to the MEW community <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. These studies were typically conducted via analysing the results with microscopes in separate facilities in a time consuming and inefficient manner. This manual method is not feasible in embracing the influence of variations of multiple system parameters at the same time.</p><p>However the MEW jet with a distinctive profile can facilitate numerous parameter changes simultaneously during the print process. In a quest for large and reproducible data acquisition within a multi-parametric space, "Printomics" is required to gain advanced understanding of MEW. We apply this approach to the most widely studied polymer for MEW; a medical-grade poly(ε-caprolactone) (mPCL) that has been used in a significant number of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>The small diameter fibre associated with MEW requires a special approach for in-process control as the micron-scaled fibres are difficult to visualize without a microscope. An automated in-process monitoring system was designed and inhouse built, that defines the process stability of MEW via continuously analysing and characterising the geometry of a MEW jet. This in-process system includes two cameras to detect the fibre and the related diameters in real time. The fibres are also collected onto a conveyor belt rather than an xy collector and removed with a brush (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) after the visual data has been obtained. This combination of visual data and a conveyor belt collector enables the generation of large data volumes that can readily be subjected to statistical models. This, in turn, helps to derive understanding regarding the stability of the MEW process via explorative analysis. Finally, we apply the most stable settings and verify the experiment with other, conventional, MEW printers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1</head><p>In-process controlled MEW machine design for parameter control An in-house designed MEW device <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was complemented by the integration of an in-process control system, (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The MEW printer configuration consists of three main units: a parameter control unit, a computing unit, and a printing enclosure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Parameter control unit</head><p>Similar to previous MEW studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>, the following system parameters were studied; Processing Temperature (PT), Applied Pressure (AP), Collection Speed (CS), and Applied Voltage (AV) were all controlled via the parameter control unit. The parameters were automatically adjusted with the electronic prototyping platform Arduino (Arduino Mega 2560, Arduino LLC, Italy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Printing enclosure</head><p>A Perspex enclosure contains a MEW print head, a fibre collection system (conveyor belt) and two cameras to capture the jet flight path and the diameter of fibre on the collector. Camera 1 (AM413ZT, Dino Lite, USA) was mounted horizontally at a distance of 100 mm to focus on a region of interest of 15 x 15 mm to monitor the shape of the flight path. The fibre appears as a dark line in front of an in illuminated background. A microscopic setup was modified with 3D printed components to fit a microscopic camera (TP-305000A, Eyepiece, USA) equipped with a 10x magnification lens, referred as Camera 2, to focus on a region of interest of 200 x 200 μm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Computing unit</head><p>The software environment operating in a high-performance personal desktop computer (WINDOWS 64bit, USA) was designed in MATLAB (MATLAB R2015b, MathWorks Inc., USA) to allow communication with the control unit and access the data base. In parallel, the computing unit received the images from the monitoring unit to transform them into integer values. The set up to control the system parameters and the hardware can be seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">System parameters and design of experiments</head><p>An orthogonal array designed in Minitab Statistical Software (Minitab 17, United Kingdom), defined the experimental approach to print the parameter combinations. The resulting 81 different printing scenarios, (Appendix 1), were conducted in an ordered manner (n=3) while capturing 30 images of the diameter and the angle respectively, every 3 s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Characterisation</head><p>The software was written in MATLAB to determine the diameter of the deposited fibre and the angle of the flightpath in real time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). A threshold is applied to both images to convert them to black-and-white to enhance the accuracy. The diameter means were calculated via 160 measurements (every 10 pixels). The angle of the flight path was determined by similarly converting the images to greyscale. The subsequent application of curve fitting and extrapolation models verifies the point of deposition to determine the angle. The diameter and angle values were calculated within 3 ± 0.5 s and sent to the library, which resulted in a total of 14,580 data points. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Statistical model</head><p>Due to the large data volume (14,580 values), the statistical software SPSS (SPSS STATISTICS 23, IBM, USA) was exploited to apply a linear model using Generalised Estimated Equations, see Appendix 2. This permitted the correlations of the four process parameters and the reproducibility of the repeated printing sequence (81 different conditions; n=3 prints). The results were visualised in heat maps, two dimensional colourized plots, which support the establishment of enhanced understanding of complex multi-parametric environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Discussion</head><p>The results of the Generalised Estimated Equations were visualised in 2D heat maps to allow for an explorative interpretation. Each diagram consists of nine fields, which individually represent the applied voltage over the collection speed. The first row of the nine fields (I-III) refers to the lowest applied pressure (AP = 1.0 bar) with increasing processing temperature levels from left to right.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Angle</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Electrical acceleration forces on the fibre (applied voltage)</head><p>Increasing the electrostatic force decreases the angle of the flightpath in all instances. The higher applied voltages lead to larger electrostatic forces, which are increasingly effecting the extruded melt and accelerate it towards the collector <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. The establishment of these forces physically attracts the fibre towards the collector and force it to travel in parallel along the electrostatic field lines, hence reducing the angle <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. The lowest collection speed used in this experiment was 1000 mm/min, with all angle values being greater than zero. Interestingly, we observed that the reduction in angle due to applied voltage is more apparent at small and medium AP = 1.0 and 1.75 bar and at high temperatures of the polymer (MT = 91˚C). This suggests that the degree of the electrostatic material acceleration is correlated to the charge density within the melt and its characteristic flow properties, which depend on the viscosity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Mechanically induced drag forces (collector speed)</head><p>Horizontally acting mechanical forces increase the angle at higher collection speeds, as described in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> and initiate a lag in the point of deposition on the collector. To put the mechanically-and electrostatically-induced forces in context, the former appears to be more dominant in determining the angle. Furthermore, changes in angle due to the collection speed are most prevailing in the cases of lowest pressure (AP = 1.0 bar). An average increase of the angle can be observed from 14.9° at lowest collections speeds to 43.8° at highest collection speed, which represents an approximate threefold increase. In cases of high mass flow (AP = 2.5 bar), the respective average angles range from 32° to 51.3°, which represents an increase of approximately two-thirds. Although, in the second case a larger initial angel exists (32°), the smaller influence can be traced back to the greater amount of extruded mass. Based on this, we assume, that a fibre is more likely affected by the horizontally acting mechanical forces if it contains more molten polymer.</p><p>In addition, the electrostatic forces appear to mainly influence the angle at lower collection speeds (CS = 1000 mm/min). In these cases, the percentage in decline of angle are approximately two fifths, from (AP = 1.0 bar), 46.1% to 32% at (AP = 2.5 bar). In contrast, the decrease of the angles at highest speeds are significantly less impactful and the values are comparably small, ranging from approximately 2.1% at (AP = 1.0 bar), 5.9% at (AP = 1.75 bar) to 4.0 % at (AP = 2.5 bar). In the framework of this experiment and based on an explorative analysis, it was determined that first, the forces induced by collector movement prevail as the most dominant; second, the electrostatic effect is mainly present at the lowest collection speeds (CS= 1000 mm/min), and third, the most significant changes in angle occur in cases of the lowest viscosities. Latter underlines the strong dependencies of the angle on the mechanical resistance forces of the fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>, explained in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Influence of mass flow and the dependency on viscosity (applied pressure, processing temperature)</head><p>In general, increasing pressure leads to larger angles, whereas rising temperatures to smaller angles, yet only at lower to medium pressure levels, i.e. material flow. The increase of the angle along higher mass flow can be explained by the relation between the amounts of implemented charge carriers into the volume of the extruded material. This ratio defines the specific charge density and significantly influences the tendency of the viscous polymer to be physically attracted towards the grounded element <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>. Charge effect and migration mechanisms are relatively under-investigated in the fields of MEW. However, amplified voltages do increase the ratio of charge carriers per volume unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>, which more likely overcome the fluid's resistance against being physically stretched <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. For instance, and seen in all cases of low to medium pressure, a smaller volume of extruded material is more affected by the greater electrostatic forces, i.e. generates smaller angles at higher voltages. Oppositely, the influence of the mechanical drag by the collector speed becomes more influential at higher mass flow.</p><p>Secondly, the variations in the heat map also indicate a dependency of the angle on the viscosity of the polymer. Higher temperatures result in lower viscosities and therefore increases the mass flow of the melt at the same applied pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. This generates less resistance of the fibres to be electrostatically accelerated <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>, leading to smaller angles. However, we examined this temperature induced influence predominates at lower melt extrusion rates (AP = 1.0 bar). At lower temperatures, the angles are generally higher and vice versa, while there is no significant viscosity related difference in the cases of high mass flow (AP = 2.5 bar). We hypothesize, that the larger volumes of the polymer are more likely to form stronger macromolecular cohesions than thin fibres. Therefore, the temperatures can be assumed as less influential at higher mass flows. The influence and interaction of mass and viscosity determining the angle can be best explained by comparing fields three and seven (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Under the same electrostatic forces and collection speeds, the former provides low viscosities and low mass flow, while seven reveals high mass flow and highest viscosities. The angles differ by approximately the double and decrease at low collection speeds (CS = 1,000 mm/min) from 19° to 4° in field one and, in comparison from 37° to 28° in field seven (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). This is an approximate decrease of 80% for the first and 25% for the second. This difference underlines that the pressure strongly influences the angle of the fibre, and, in parallel, the applied temperature, defining the fluidity of the molten polymer, majorly acts in cases of small extrusion rates </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2</head><p>Fibre diameter</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Electrical acceleration forces on the fibre (applied voltage)</head><p>As known from MEW literature, the electrostatic forces accelerate the molten polymer towards the collector and the majority of published work describes an intense thinning behaviour of the jet <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48]</ref>. This experiment is conducted under a relatively short working distance (12 mm), which introduces a lack of excessive electrostatically induced thinning, observable in cases one to seven in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. Significant diameter increase occurred along amplified voltages in the cases six, eight and nine, seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Interestingly, latter reveal high mass flow and/or low viscosities. Within this study, increasing voltages might lead to more electrostatically driven polymer flow, as the increased number of charge carriers impart more kinetic energy into the liquid <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49]</ref>. This leads to greater polymer extrusion rates and hence, enlarges the average diameter of the MEW fiber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Mechanically induced drag forces (collector speed)</head><p>For all experiments, increasing the collector speed resulted in smaller fibre diameters. This is in accordance with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> due to the mechanically stretching of the molten jet. Similar to the angle, discussed in 3.1, the comparisons between the electrostatically and mechanically induced forces reveal that the later are dominant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Influence of mass flow and the dependency on viscosity (Applied Pressure, Processing Temperature)</head><p>The applied pressure defines the amount of extruded material, which is known as one the major factors determining the size of the final diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and can be confirmed by the results of this experiment. Further, the extruded mass is in a strong correlation with the temperature induced viscosity changes of the material, and we observed significant diameter increases with increasing temperatures. This is different to some findings from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref> however, in these cases, electrical instabilities occurred, and non-woven material was collected. This transition from MEW to electrospinning has also previously been shown to occur with higher processing temperatures. Furthermore, the fixed collector distance of 12 mm used here potentially prevents enhanced thinning of the elastic fibre in its flight phase. We conclude here that diameter increases with temperature are due to the reduced viscosity producing a higher mass flow rate rather than jet stretching. The deviations in the diameters are known from literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and expressed in the heat map in form of black error bars. Minimum deviations are verified in the following chapter to establish the MEW library, see Appendix 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Verification of the results</head><p>The results of the Generalised Estimated Equations were subject to a mathematical selection process to create a library, which contains the most stable printing conditions. First, the diameters were listed in an ascending sequence and experiments (#) with similar diameters were grouped into sections. In order to identify the cases of maximum stability (diameter and angle), a mathematical normalisation of their standard errors was applied. Subsequently, the mean value of both normalised values was calculated, defined as the stability coefficients (sc).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝑁𝑁(𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, 𝑖𝑖𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎) =</head><p>(Xi -MIN(Xi, Xj)) (MAX(Xi, Xj) -MIN(Xi, Xj))</p><p>; � 𝑋𝑋 + 𝑖𝑖 𝑗𝑗 𝑖𝑖=1</p><p>(Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>) 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑁𝑁 �𝑁𝑁(𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖), 𝑁𝑁(𝑖𝑖𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎)� (Equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>)</p><p>where N describes the normalised value of the angle or diameter respectively, X the value of the angle or the diameter of the specific experiment (#1 -#81) and sc the mean value of both normalised values. Hence, the most stable printing conditions are defined by the lowest values of the sc and describe the least diameter and angle deviations at the same time, see attacchment 4.</p><p>The verification was conducted by applying the settings to print 7 µm, 11 µm and 15 µm on conventionally used in-house designed bench-top MEW devices. The angles (n=30) were captured with the same USB camera, used for the conveyor belt experiment and the fibres were printed on a microscopic slide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>). An inverted light microscope was used to capture the images of the diameters (n=30). Both results were analysed using ImageJ (Version 1.51q, National Institutes of Health, USA). The result for all three parameter settings revealed that printing the targeted diameters is possible. The results show averages and standard deviations of 7.2 µm (±1.15 µm) for V_1, 11.6 µm (±1.06 µm) for V_2 and 15.3 µm (±1.35 µm) for V_3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7 b,</ref><ref type="figure">c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). The measurements of the angles for the three cases revealed 41.1 ° (±1.7°), 39.5° (±1.45°) and 29.3° (±1.85°), respectively. Similar to observations with the diameters, the arising deviations from the target values are negligible. The overall trends of the parameters within the library are well aligned with the derived results from both heat maps: increasing voltages, collection speeds and air pressure levels lead to larger diameters and oppositely, higher collection speed initiates enhanced fibre stretching. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>In summary, a high-throughput MEW device was engineered and built with an automated parameter control system to analyse a spectrum of printing variables. The inprocess control loop allowed for an automated parameter adjustment and parallel monitoring of the diameter as well as the flight path of the fibre. The influence of the key system parameters on the fibre flightpath and the diameter was detected, applying statistical models. Further, we successfully verified the findings by transferring the results to a standard bench-top MEW device in which jet visualization can be implemented to determine process stability. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the integration of automation and monitoring systems allows for the generation of large data sets for analysis. These can be used to develop a rapid, yet holistic, understanding of MEW parameters for a specific polymer. We further identified the stable printing conditions of the most widely used polymer for both MEW and TE&amp;RM, namely PCL, and therefore will play an important role in biofabricated products.
