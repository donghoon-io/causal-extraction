The method used in this study was quantitative associative with the subject of employees in the Labor and Industrial Agency of Padang City. Sample was determined through proportionate stratified random sampling. By using the Slovin formula, sample of 47 respondents was obtained. In this study the data were collected using a Likert scale questionnaire which has been tested for its validity and reliability. Before analyzing with path analysis model, the classical assumption and regression tests were first performed. Hypothesis test results prove the existence of a significant influence of each exogenous variable (job satisfaction, equity satisfaction and disconfirmation satisfaction) on endogenous variables (delivery, professio nalism and service quality) both simul taneously and partially. Each of these variables had a different influence on the quality of service in the Labor and Industrial Agency of Padang City.
