<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs) are high-temperature electrochemical devices that can be used in either fuel cell (SOFCs for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) or electrolysis mode (SOECs for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells). The high operating temperatures (≈750-850°C) allow reaching very high efficiencies without the use of expensive electro-catalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In addition, SOFCs can be fed under a large range of fuels, from hydrogen to hydrocarbons, contrary to the low-operatingtemperature technologies such as Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) or Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the same way, SOECs are able to co-electrolyze carbon dioxide and steam to produce a syngas composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, despite all these advantages, the elevated operating temperatures activate materials aging with chemical decomposition, reactivity between the cell components and electrode microstructural evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. These phenomena result in a significant degradation in cell performances upon operation, limiting the SOCs lifetime and delaying the deployment of this technology in the marketplace.</p><p>SOC is composed by a dense electrolyte in Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) sandwiched between two porous electrodes. The hydrogen electrode is usually made of Nickel and YSZ cermet (Ni-YSZ) while Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors (MIECs), such as Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferrite (LSCF) are used as oxygen electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Recently, it has been proposed to add Cerium Gadolinium Oxide (CGO) in LSCF to form a LSCF-CGO composite electrode exhibiting high performances even at intermediate operating temperatures (≈650-750°C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. It is worth noting that a barrier layer in CGO is usually added between the oxygen electrode and the electrolyte in order to limit the chemical reactivity between LSCF and YSZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Nevertheless, despite the barrier layer, several authors have shown that secondary phases such as SrZrO3 zirconates can appear during the cell manufacturing due to the high temperature of the electrode sintering <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>Nowadays, it is widely recognized that a significant part of the overall cell degradation upon 'normal' operation comes from the oxygen electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Among all the underlying mechanisms that affect the oxygen electrode stability (chromium poisoning, delamination, formation of secondary phases, etc.), the LSCF demixing is considered as one of the most detrimental phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. It consists in the migration and segregation of the Sr La ' from the perovskite lattice resulting in the formation of a SrO strontium oxide film at the LSCF surface.</p><p>As the SrO is an electrical insulating compound blocking the reactions of oxygen exchange, the process leads to the LSCF surface passivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. For example, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have shown that the global exchange kinetic constant 𝑘 after ageing at 700°C-800°C is decreased by an order of magnitude and they attributed this evolution to the LSCF surface passivation. However, Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> have recently suggested that the decrease of 𝑘 'cannot be accounted for only the surface coverage of inactive Sr segregation' and they proposed that the kinetic constant could also be affected by the stoichiometry change with Sr deficiency on the 'clean' part of the LSCF surface. Moreover, the oxygen chemical diffusivity (or ionic conductivity) of LSCF is also decreased by the loss of Sr in the bulk of electrode due to the LSCF decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. All these phenomena are expected to cause the degradation of the electrode performances even if their impact on the electrode response remains nowadays unclear. In this context, the exact role of the operating conditions on the demixing is still under investigation. Nonetheless, it has been shown that the rate of the phase decomposition is strongly accelerated by the anodic current <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. For instance, Frey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have shown that the demixing of the LSCF material is enhanced for a stack operated in SOEC mode compared to stacks operated in SOFC mode. Laurencin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have proposed that the depletion of oxygen vacancies within the electrode under anodic current, i.e. in SOEC mode, could activate the LSCF decomposition.</p><p>Since the electrochemical behavior depends strongly on the elementary reaction mechanism taking place at the electrode surface, its deep knowledge is of fundamental importance in order to better analyze the degradation. However, in spite of many studies, the LSCF and LSCF-CGO reaction mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Nevertheless, it is generally admitted that the bulk path (related to the oxygen solid-state diffusion in LSCF and the oxygen exchange at the electrode surface) is predominant for the electrode operated under cathodic current <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. It has been more recently highlighted that a change of reaction mechanism arises at low anodic over-potential, from the bulk to the surface path (defined by the direct charge transfer at the Triple Phase Boundary lines (TPBls)) <ref type="bibr">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref>. Regarding the LSCF-CGO composite, some studies have suggested that the reaction mechanism is entirely controlled by the surface path whatever the electrode polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32]</ref>.</p><p>To date, many models have been already published for the LSCF electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref>. Adler and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> were the first to propose an analytical model to express the impedance at the Open Circuit Potential (OCP) for the porous MIEC. In their work, they considered an equivalent homogenous electrode taking into account the bulk path with one global step of oxygen exchange between the gas and the MIEC, which was treated as a pure chemical reaction. With the simplification of an infinite electrode thickness, the solution is equivalent to a Gerischer-type impedance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> and is referred as the so-called 'ALS' model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This approach has been used and improved by many authors for analytical or numerical models for the LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43]</ref>. For instance, Mortensen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> have proposed an analytical solution to compute the impedance diagrams for MIEC-CGO composite electrodes. In our group, numerical stationary and dynamic models have been developed for the porous LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes by taking into account the bulk and surface paths <ref type="bibr">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39]</ref>. The whole mechanism was splitted into four steps considering only neutral oxygen adatom species attached on the LSCF surface. Therefore, no interaction between the adsorbed species was assumed and the surface coverage at equilibrium was related to the oxygen partial pressure by the Langmuir isotherm. It has been found that this approach is able to predict accurately the electrode polarization curves as well as the impedance diagrams at 𝑃 = 0.21 atm under cathodic and anodic dc currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32]</ref>. However, it is well known that charged oxygen species are likely to be found on oxide surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. Fleig et al.</p><p>[ <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref> have underlined that the charge of adsorbed oxygen ions on the surface could affect the global electrode kinetic and its dependence with the oxygen partial pressure, due to electrostatic interactions. A model assuming a uniform double layer induced by the negative adsorbed species counterbalanced by the positive holes in LSCF was proposed to take into account those interactions.</p><p>From this context, the modeling with a full elementary description could improve the models predictability especially for the oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrode kinetics.</p><p>However, it must be emphasized that the experimental validation remains questionable due to the large number of unknown parameters. Indeed, in the particular case of porous electrodes, in contrast to well-defined geometries such as the pattern electrodes, it is essential to know all the microstructural properties characterizing the electrode morphology (volume fractions, tortuosity factors, specific surface areas and density of TPBls). The measurements of these parameters of 3D electrode reconstructions allow decreasing the number of fitted parameters and hence to enhance the relevance of the validation.</p><p>To date, very few full elementary models have been specifically dedicated for porous LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes. None of them has been validated with the knowledge of real microstructural parameters. Gong et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> have proposed a stationary model for the MIEC in which the reaction mechanism was divided in five reactions taking into account the presence of oxygen ions on the electrode surface. Even if the model was not validated, they found a transition from the bulk to the surface path arising under cathodic polarization when applied to LSM-type electrode. Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> have recently published a stationary elementary kinetic model for porous LSCF coupled with Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. The model was validated on one i-V curve taken from the literature at 800°C under 𝑃 =1 atm. In contradiction to the statements reported in <ref type="bibr">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref>, they claimed that the surface path is negligible even in SOEC mode and all the kinetic simulations were carried out only considering the bulk path. Yurkiv et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref> have proposed a dynamic elementary kinetic description for the LSCF-CGO composite in which the LSCF and CGO was modeled as an equivalent medium for oxygen solid-state diffusion and by neglecting the surface path. For the validation, the simulated impedance diagrams at OCP under air was confronted with the experimental data measured between 500-800°C. However, although the three contributions in the impedance diagrams at high, medium and low frequencies were identified, the agreement between the simulated on the experimental spectra was not fully satisfactory. Finally, Donazzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> have built a quasi-elementary model taking into account both the surface and bulk paths for the LSCF-CGO composite. The authors have considered a dissociative adsorption step followed by an ionization on the LSCF surface. The model was validated on impedance diagrams at OCP from 560°C to 700°C and three oxygen partial pressure (𝑃 =0.05; 0.1 and 0.21 atm). In this case, it has been found that the reaction mechanism would be controlled by the surface path.</p><p>From this literature review, it appears that there are still a controversy on the dominant reaction pathway for the LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes. Indeed, a full validation for the elementary model simultaneously applied to both the LSCF and LSCF-CGO porous electrodes is still missing with the knowledge of the microstructural properties and a set of relevant electrochemical characterizations.</p><p>In this work, our previous models for the porous LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes have been extended with a full elementary kinetic description for both the surface and bulk paths. The set of partial differential equations has been solved by keeping the full non-linearity of the system to compute the dynamic electrode response even for non-linear perturbations. Because of the large number of unknown parameters inherent to this kind of approach, a special attention has been paid to achieve a thorough and relevant model validation. For this purpose, the microstructural properties of the tested LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes have been extracted from 3D reconstructions obtained by Focused Ion Beam  Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography. Besides, in order to reduce as far as possible the uncertainties on the parameters estimation, a wide range of experimental conditions have been explored</p><p>(polarization curves, impedance spectra at OCP and under dc currents at different temperatures and oxygen partial pressures). It was checked that the fitted values for the reaction rate constants and diffusivities were similar for both electrodes. Thanks to the detailed surface reaction mechanism of this elementary model, the impact of the phase demixing on the LSCF based electrode response has been investigated through a sensitivity analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Materials and studied cells</head><p>Two symmetrical button cells made of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3δ/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ (50/50 wt. %), respectively, were prepared by screen-printing the electrodes (thickness = 35 μm, diameter = 11.2 mm) on both sides of a circular 8YSZ electrolyte (thickness = 260 μm, diameter = 25 mm) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). To avoid any misalignment between the Working Electrode (WE) and the Counter Electrode (CE), a particular attention was paid during the cell manufacturing to position both electrodes at the center of the electrolyte disk. Indeed, even a slight dissymmetry between the two electrodes can lead to major distortions in the impedance diagrams <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref>. Finally, a CGO barrier layer (thickness = 2 μm) was added between the electrodes and the electrolyte to prevent the formation of secondary phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Experimental set-up</head><p>The symmetrical cells were tested using a three-electrode set-up (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). The Reference Electrode (RE) consisted of a platinum wire ring applied on the edge of the electrolyte membrane as far as possible from the WE. In this configuration, the geometrical rules for the reference electrode positioning were fulfilled <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Two platinum grids with a mesh of 3600 meshes•cm -2 and a surface equal to the area of the electrodes were used as current collectors. It can be noticed that a 1 mm thick disk in porous gold was inserted between the ceramic housing and the platinum grid in such a way that each electrode surface can be considered as equipotential. An additional weight of 0.7 kg was added on the top of the cell chamber, in order to enhance the electrical contact between the grids and the electrodes (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). It is worth noting that the entire set-up was made of alumina to avoid any contamination of the sample in operation. The supplied gas was a synthetic mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, which was introduced in the cell housing using inlet and outlet pipes as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref> (with a total O2 and N2 flow rates of 0.44 Nl•h -1 and 1.66 Nl•h -1 , respectively). According to the design of the chamber, it is roughly estimated that around one third of the inlet flux was passing through each electrode (i.e. each electrode was fed with an inlet flux of around 𝐹 ≈ 0.146 Nl•h -1 •cm -2 and 𝐹 ≈ 0.553 Nl•h -1 •cm -2 , respectively). Finally, a thermocouple was positioned close to the cell to monitor constantly its temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Testing and measurements conditions</head><p>Before starting the measurements, the cells were heated at a rate of 1°C•min -1 up to 800 °C.</p><p>This temperature was maintained for 48 hours to improve the electrical contact between the electrodes and the current collectors. During this period, the cells were monitored periodically by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) until the complete stabilization of the diagrams at OCP. Afterwards, the electrochemical measurements were carried out at 750°C, 700 and 650 °C under air condition, keeping a high oxygen gas flow rate in order to limit as much as possible the electrode overpotential due to the gas conversion (𝑃 =0.21 atm and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐹 = 0.146 Nl•h -1 •cm -2 )</formula><p>. At each operating temperature, polarization curves were recorded in galvanostatic mode with a current step of 1 mA•s -1 together with impedance diagrams at OCP. At the reference temperature of 700°C, the experimental dataset was complemented by the acquisition of impedance diagrams under anodic and cathodic dc currents (idc = ±50 mA•cm -2 ) for both studied cells. Besides, the impedance diagrams were recorded at OCP by changing the gas composition in the oxygen partial pressure range from 0.10 atm to 1 atm.</p><p>The EIS diagrams were acquired in a frequency range of 10 kHz-0.01 Hz by applying a sinusoidal perturbation on the current with an amplitude of | iac | = ± 10 mA•cm -2 . Ten points per decade are required at least and an integration time of 1 s per point was chosen.</p><p>All the measurements were conducted using an Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT302N coupled with a frequency response analyzer (FRA2). For the sake of clarity, the series resistances (𝑅 corresponding to the resistive contributions of the YSZ pellet plus the contact resistances) were taken at the intercept with the real axis of the impedance data at high frequencies and removed from all the presented impedance diagrams. Moreover, the electrode polarization curve was obtained by removing the ohmic loss from the recorded voltage 𝐸 : 𝜂(𝑉/𝑟𝑒𝑓) = 𝐸 (𝑉/𝑟𝑒𝑓) -𝑅 𝑖.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">FIB-SEM reconstructions</head><p>The microstructural properties of the studied electrodes were obtained by FIB-SEM tomography reconstruction. The details of this technique and its modus operandi have been already described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. For the LSCF electrode, a volume of 22.84 x 21.36 x 22.14 μm 3 with a voxel size of 10 nm has been specifically acquired for the present study (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). For the LSCF-CGO composite electrode, a reconstructed volume of 19.87 x 11.5 x 11.5 µm 3 with a voxel size of 10 nm was already obtained and presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). For both reconstructions, the raw image has been segmented according to the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref> before extracting a cubic subvolume of 10 x 10 x 10 μm 3 for the analyses. A set of numerical tools thoroughly detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref> were used to compute all the microstructural parameters required for the simulations. They correspond to the interfacial specific surface areas, the mean pores radius, the volume fractions, the tortuosity factors of the phases and the density of TPBls for the composite electrode. For what concerns the LSCF electrode, the density of TPBls and the LSCF/CGO interfacial specific surface area have been measured on a region of interest corresponding to a rectangular volume of 10 x 4 x 10 μm 3 taken at the CGO barrier layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model description</head><p>The model considers an equivalent homogeneous medium of an isothermal slice of porous LSCF or LSFC-CGO electrode including the CGO barrier layer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). The effective properties for the model are computed on the 3D reconstructions and are expressed through the electrode microstructural properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. The model was developed to simulate the electrode response for both stationary and dynamic behaviors. The reaction mechanism, which is composed of the bulk and surface paths for the oxygen transfer, has been divided in a sequence of pure elementary steps. For this purpose, the presence of neutral oxygen atoms, adsorbed ions and molecules have been assumed on the LSCF surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Reaction mechanism</head><p>For the sake of clarity, the implemented reaction mechanism is described hereafter only for the LSCF-CGO electrode in anodic polarization. The model for the LSCF electrode can be deduced from the composite one by considering that the reactions occurring at the TPBls and at the LSCF/CGO interface do not extend in the whole electrode volume but are restricted at the interface with the electrolyte.</p><p>The detailed reaction mechanism is described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> in which the blue and red arrows are related to the bulk and surface paths, respectively. All the reactions implemented in the model are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref> using the "Kröger-Vink" notation along with the expressions of their kinetic rates. The bulk path is composed by the migration of the oxygen ions in CGO, followed by the ionic transfer at the LSCF/CGO interface (R1), the oxygen diffusion in the bulk and a final oxygen excorporation (R2). For this last step, the oxygen ion in LSCF reacts with a hole coming from the electrode to produce an oxygen ion attached on the surface. In parallel, the surface path is defined by the direct electrochemical oxidation at the TPBls (R3). The two parallel pathways merge in a common path depicted by green arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>. In this last part of the reaction mechanism, the oxygen ions diffuse on the LSCF surface and are further oxidized to form neutral oxygen ad-atoms (R4). After diffusion, these species can react to produce attached O2 molecules (R5) that can also diffuse before being released into the porosities (R6). Finally, the O2 gaseous molecules can be transferred by gas diffusion in the porosity network up to the gas channel.</p><p>Because of this elementary kinetic description, the presence of adsorbed charged species (oxygen ions) is assumed on the LSCF surface. As proposed by Fleig <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>, a double layer can arises at the LSCF/gas interface due to the accumulation of oxygen ad-ions whose charges are counterbalanced by holes in LSCF. This local double layer yields a surface electrostatic potential step χ which is characterized by a capacitance 𝐶 𝑑𝑙 surface :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">χ(z) = χ -χ = 𝛤𝐹θ (𝑧) 𝐶 (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where Γ is the density of available sites on the LSCF surface, F is the Faraday's constant and θ the surface coverage of the oxygen ad-ions. It is worth noting that Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">7</ref>) stands for a low concentration of adsorbed species (i.e. for a diluted solution) when there is no restriction on the number of available sites. This electrostatic potential is supposed to vary with the coverage rates all along the electrode thickness. On the other hand, the electrode potential E is classically expressed as the difference between the local electronic potential in LSCF (φLSCF)</p><p>and the local ionic potential in CGO (φCGO):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝐸(𝑧) = 𝜑 (𝑧) -𝜑 (𝑧) = + µ  𝐹 - µ •• 2𝐹<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where µ  and µ •• denote the electrochemical potentials (J•mol -1 ) for the holes in LSCF and the oxygen vacancies in CGO.</p><p>The transport equations for the fluxes and the mass and charge conservations are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>.</p></div>

It can be noticed that the charge transfer at TPBls (R3) is an electrochemical reaction and its kinetic is dependent on the local electrode potential E(z) through the classical Butler-Volmer equation (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)). Even if there is no change in the oxidation state between the products and reactants for the ionic transfer R1, this reaction is still supposed to be affected by the electrode potential at the LSCF/CGO interface. Its kinetic is thus written using a Butler-Volmer formalism as reported in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. The oxidation/reduction steps (R2 and R4) arising at the LSCF surface are two electrochemical reactions and their kinetic rates are also assumed to be affected by the surface potential step χ(z) (cf. Eqs. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">4</ref>)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. Finally, the association and desorption steps (R5 and R6) are pure chemical reaction and their kinetics is written in classical way (Eqs.</p><p>(5) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_32">6</ref>)). The activity for all the surface species i is given by the product of the number of available site on the LSCF surface 𝛤 and the surface coverage 𝜃 considering an ideal solution.</p><p>In other words, a Langmuir isothermal hypothesis is adopted assuming a monolayer of adsorbed species on the LSCF surface without interaction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ + θ O + θ + 𝜃 = 1<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where the subscripts 𝑂 -𝑠 , O -𝑠 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑂 -𝑠 denote the oxygen ad-ions, neutral ad-atoms and ad-molecules.</p><p>All the kinetics have been multiplied by the corresponding microstructural parameter in order to take into account the local geometry of the porous electrode. Therefore, the velocity for all the surface steps is dependent on the LSCF/gas specific surface area.

It is worth noting that this approach can be considered valid only if the concentration overpotentials are limited (that is to say at OCP or under small dc current with a high inlet oxygen flux as considered in the experiments).

The evolution of CGO ionic conductivity with the temperature was determined in the model using an activation energy of 65 kJ•mol -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>. The oxygen vacancy self-diffusivity for LSCF was taken in order to obtain the same chemical diffusivity than the one used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> at 700°C under air with an activation energy of 156 kJ•mol -1 . It can be noticed that these values are consistent with data reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">68]</ref>. The capacitance of the LSCF/CGO double layer was taken at 0.5 F•m -2 as estimated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. For what concerns the surface capacitance 𝐶 , a wide range of data spreading from 0.1 F•m -2 up to 100 F•m -2 is reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. In the present model, a low value of 0.2 F•m -2 was chosen for the simulations to be consistent with the assumption of the low oxygen ions coverage at the LSCF surface. All the mentioned input parameters are provided in Tab. IV at the reference temperature of 700°C at 𝑃 =0.21 atm.</p><p>In order to reduce further the number of unknown parameters, two supplementary assumptions have been considered. Firstly, as generally observed and admitted for the studied electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref>, the oxygen ionic transfer (R1) across LSCF/CGO interface was supposed as not limiting (𝑘 ≫ 0).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental results and model validation 4.1 Electrode 3D reconstructions and electrochemical characterizations</head><p>The rendering volumes for the 3D reconstructions after segmentation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> for the two studied electrodes. The LSCF, CGO and YSZ phases appear in blue, yellow and orange, respectively. At a first sight, it can be noticed that the microstructure for the two electrodes seems well representative of classical SOC electrodes. To confirm this claim, the microstructural properties have been computed on the reconstructions and the corresponding data are listed in Tab. V. As expected, all the values lie in the range of the properties reported for classical LSCF and LSCF/CGO electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71]</ref>. The microstructure properties are used as input parameters for the model validation.</p><p>For the electrochemical characterizations, it is worth mentioning that all the results reported for the LSCF electrode have been obtained in the frame of the present study while the ones for the composite electrode have been already detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</p><p>As a preliminary remark for the LSCF electrode, it is worth mentioning that a perfect superposition has been found between the impedance spectra for the WE and CE versus the RE (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref> given in the supplementary information). Therefore, it can be stated that the setup allows obtaining a quasi-ideal symmetry between the two LSCF electrodes, indicating the accuracy of the measurements. For this LSCF electrode, the experimental polarization curves measured at 750°C, 700°C and 650°C under air are shown in Fig 4a . The electrode overpotential is lowered with increasing temperature as it could be expected from a thermal activation of the electrode reaction mechanism for LSCF-based electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">73]</ref>.</p><p>Regardless of the operating mode (SOEC or SOFC), the evolution of the current density can be regarded as linear at all temperatures for electrode overpotentials below 0.05 V/air. An activation is evidenced for higher electrode overpotentials for temperatures up to 700 °C. At 750 °C, the polarization curve is symmetric and linear but it is likely to be due to the narrow overpotential range. These results are confirmed by the plot of the polarization resistance 𝑅 as a function of the current density 𝑖 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c-4e</ref>). Indeed, a strong dissymmetry of 𝑅 = 𝑓(𝑖) is observed at 650°C that becomes less pronounced at 700°C, while a constant value is found at 750°C. These observations at 650°C may suggest a change either in the reaction mechanism or in the rate-determining steps. This change turns into a gradual transition at 700°C and, finally, into a unique dominant mechanism with the same co-limitations at 750°C. However, as already mentioned in this case, the investigated range of current densities and overpotentials are restricted close to the equilibrium.</p><p>The EIS at OCP are plotted in the Nyquist representation in Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref> to 5c. It is worth mentioning that the polarization resistance decreases with increasing the temperature in good agreement with the evolution of the polarization curves. Besides, all the diagrams present a kind of Gerischer-type element whatever the investigated temperature. It can be noticed that a small contribution appears at low frequencies for the diagram at 750°C. This contribution is ascribed to the limitation associated to the gas conversion and it is typically observed for electrodes exhibiting a low polarization resistance at high temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. As shown in the Bode plots reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref> to 5f, the characteristic frequency slightly increases with the operating temperature (i.e. 𝑓 ≈ 12 Hz, 19 Hz and 34 Hz at 650°C, 700°C and 750°C, respectively), in agreement with the variation recorded for a LSCF-CGO composite <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. However, these values remain quite close to each other. To conclude, it can be stated that the unaffected shape of the impedance diagrams would suggest that the electrode is dominated at OCP by the same reaction mechanism in the range of studied temperatures.</p><p>The EIS under dc current density at idc= +/-50 mA•cm -2 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref> to 6d. As at OCP, the shape of the diagrams presents a kind of Gerischer-type element. The frequency distribution increases with increasing the dc current from cathodic to anodic polarization (𝑓 ≈ 7 Hz at idc = -50 mA•cm -2 and 𝑓 ≈ 24 Hz at idc = +50 mA cm -2 ) as it has been already observed by Monaco et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The same electrochemical characterizations have been performed for the LSCF-CGO electrode.</p><p>As already mentioned, all the results have been already presented and discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. For the model validation, the polarizations curves at 650°, 700°C and 750°C are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref> while the EIS diagrams are reported in the supplementary. As a brief summary, the polarization curves have been found symmetric at 700°C and 750°C whereas a dissymmetry appears at the lowest operating temperature (650°C). Moreover, all the EIS diagrams exhibit a Gerischer-type impedance. It can be remarked that the performances of the LSCF-CGO composite is lower than the LSCF electrode, which is contradictory with our previous statement in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. However, in this case, the performance of the two electrodes cannot be directly compared. Indeed, the two type of electrodes exhibit very different microstructures since they were produced using different manufacturing conditions.</p><p>Finally, in complementarity with the previous characterizations, a specific attention has been paid in this work to study the effect of the oxygen partial pressure on the LSCF and the LSCF-CGO electrodes response. The evolution of the impedance diagrams at OCP are given in Fig <ref type="figure">7a</ref> and 7b for oxygen partial pressures ranging from 0.1 to 1 atm. It can be noticed that the electrode polarization resistance significantly decreases when increasing the oxygen content, as already experimentally observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75]</ref>. The reaction order m was estimated fitting the experimental data with the following relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">𝑅 = (𝑃 ) (<label>38</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">)</formula><p>where 𝑅 is the polarization resistance extracted from the EIS at OCP (measured as the difference of the intercepts with the real axis at high and low frequencies).</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>, the results are plotted in logarithmic coordinates for the LSCF electrode. A slight evolution of the slope is found with an exponent decreasing from 0.17 for 0.10 atm ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 0.21 atm down to 0.09 for 𝑃 &gt; 0.21 atm. These reaction orders are in rather good agreement with literature data. For instance, an exponent of 0.12 was deduced for a LSCF nanorod electrode operated at 717 °C in a range of oxygen partial pressure 𝑃 ∈ [0.10 -0.20] atm <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref>.</p><p>For the LSCF-CGO composite, the evolution of the slope in Fig. <ref type="figure">7d</ref> is less pronounced than for the LSCF electrode. In this case, the exponent decreased from 0.20 for 0. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Model calibration</head><p>The model unknown parameters detailed in section 3.4 were determined by fitting the simulated data on the experimental electrode polarization curves at the three investigated temperatures. In other words, the computed i-η curves have been adjusted on the experimental data through an iterative process. Because of the nonsymmetrical shape of the electrode response (especially at 700°C and 650°C), it is worth mentioning that this process has led to determine a unique value for each of the missing parameters. The results of the fitting procedure are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref> and in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref> for the LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes, respectively. As expected, the calibrated model is able to simulate accurately the shape of the measured i-η curves at each operating temperature for both studied electrodes. Indeed, for the LSCF electrode, the fitting procedure led to obtain a root-mean square deviation of 0.014, 0.0015 and 0.006 at 650°C, 700°C and 750°C, respectively. For the LSCF-CGO composite, the root-mean square deviation was found equal 0.017, 0.0028 and 0.0048 at 650°C, 700°C and 750°C, respectively.</p><p>All the model fitted parameters are reported in Tab. VI. Firstly, it can be noticed that low values were obtained for the surface coverage at equilibrium (for 𝑃 =0.21 atm) in good agreement with the assumption of a diluted solution considered for Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">7</ref>). Moreover, the activation energies for the diffusivities and kinetic constants are quite consistent between the two electrodes. Indeed, a good agreement is found for these fitted parameters with a mismatch of less than 18% except for the activation energy associated to the charge transfer at TPBls. In this case, the difference increases up to 39%. Besides, the diffusion coefficients as well as the kinetic constants for the oxygen ionization and adsorption, which are reported in Table VI at 700°C, are also coherent between the two investigated electrodes. However, a discrepancy was found for the excorporation kinetic constant. This unexpected result could be explained by different surface states for LSCF in the two types of electrode affecting the reaction of excorporation/incorporation. Finally, it can be noticed that the kinetic constants for the charge transfer at TPBls cannot be compared since they do not have the same dimension. As a general matter, in spite of some differences, it can be claimed that the parameters fitted on the i-η curves are consistent between the LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Impedance diagrams</head><p>In order to validate the model, impedance diagrams were computed in the same conditions of the experiments without any additional fitting. The comparison between the simulated and measured EIS for the LSCF electrode at OCP is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. From the diagrams represented in the Nyquist plot in Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref> and 5b at 650°C and 700°C, it can be seen that the model is able to predict quite accurately the shape of the experimental EIS characterized by a kind of Gerischer type-element. For instance, the root-mean square deviation for the LSCF impedance at 700°C and OCP is equal to 0.007. It is worth noting that the agreement between experimental and simulated impedance diagrams in the low frequency range at high temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>) suggests that the CSTR model (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_14">31</ref>)) is well adapted to capture the effect of gas conversion that appears at 750 °C. In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the impedance diagrams recorded under polarization are compared to the simulated ones at 700°C. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref> and 6b for the Nyquist plots, the model is also able to reproduce quite correctly the global shape of the impedance diagrams under cathodic and anodic polarizations. It can be noticed that, in the range of investigated polarizations, the EIS still exhibit a Gerischer type-element behavior suggesting that the LSCF electrode mechanism remains unchanged in these operating conditions.</p><p>The computed and experimental frequency distributions are compared at OCP in Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref> to 5f</p><p>and under polarization at 700°C in Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref> and<ref type="figure">6d</ref> for the diagrams plotted in the Bode plan. It can be observed that the increase of the characteristic frequency with the temperature and the polarization is well retrieved with the model. This evolution of the characteristic frequency at OCP with the temperature and under polarization at 700°C is explained by a higher contribution of the surface path as detailed in section 5. Nevertheless, a frequency lag between the simulations and the measurements is obtained for all the diagrams. Indeed, the computed frequency distribution is systematically lower than the experimental one. The precise origin of this frequency shift is still unclear. The disagreement may come from an uncertainty on the determination of the microstructural properties using a 3D reconstruction that could be not fully representative of potential inhomogeneities in the whole electrode volume. Indeed, the electrode microstructure can play a major role on the frequency response of the electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">78]</ref>. Moreover, it could be also mentioned that even a slight change in the bulk to surface ratio for the reaction mechanism could have a strong impact on the simulated frequency distribution as discussed in section 5.1. Besides, the experimental conditions could affect the measurements of the frequency distribution partially explaining the discrepancy between the simulations and the experimental data.</p><p>The comparison for the experimental and simulated impedance diagrams for the LSCF-CGO electrode are reported in the supplementary information (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) It is worth mentioning that the same results than the LSCF electrode have been obtained for this composite material, i.e. the model is also able to reproduce correctly the shape of the experimental impedance diagrams whatever the temperature or the polarization. All the evolutions of the frequency distribution with the operating conditions are also well retrieved with the model even though a frequency shift is also observed for the composite electrode. To conclude, despite the systematic error on the frequency distribution, it can be asserted that, without supplementary fitting, the model is able to predict quite correctly the impedance response for the two types of studied electrodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Effect of the oxygen partial pressure</head><p>To go further in the model validation, its capability to simulate the dependency of the electrode response with the oxygen partial pressure has been investigated for both studied electrodes. For this purpose, impedance diagrams at OCP have been computed changing the oxygen content in the gas (without fitting). The graphs of 𝑅 as a function of 𝑃 have been plotted in logarithmic coordinates and compared to the experimental data in Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">7d</ref> for the LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes, respectively. In the two cases, it can be seen that the model predicts accurately the gradual increase of the polarization resistance when decreasing the oxygen partial pressure. Moreover, the model also captures correctly the higher dependency with 𝑃 for the LSCF electrode compared to the composite one. A slight distortion of the low frequency part of the impedance diagram recorded for the LSCF electrode at 700 °C can be detected at low 𝑃 values (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>), as it was evidenced at 750 °C under air (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>). This contribution was also observed by Mosialek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref> in the same experimental conditions confirming that a gas conversion impedance arises also at low oxygen partial pressures.</p><p>This good agreement between the model and the experiments is also confirmed by the reaction order m drawn from the simulated data for both studied electrodes. Regarding the LSCF electrode, the fitted value was found equal to 0.15 for 0.10 atm ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 0.21 atm and to 0.09 for 𝑃 &gt; 0.21 atm (Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>). For the LSCF-CGO electrode, a fitted value of 0.27 was calculated for 0.10 atm ≤ 𝑃 ≤ 0.21 atm while a value of 0.16 was obtained for 𝑃 &gt; 0.21 atm (Fig. <ref type="figure">7d</ref>).</p><p>All these exponents are very close to the ones fitted on the experimental data (cf. section 4.1).</p><p>For instance, the error on the reaction orders for the LSCF electrode is less than 12%. The consistency between the experimental and computed exponents would indicate the relevance of the model assumption regarding the reaction mechanism and the presence of oxygen ions on the LSCF surface. Therefore, as pointed out by Fleig et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, the description of the reaction mechanism with elementary reactions in the porous electrode allows the good prediction of the electrode response as a function of the 𝑃 .</p><p>As a general comment, it was possible using the same model to reproduce the polarization curves for the LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes by identifying for the two cases a set of consistent data (kinetic constants and surface diffusivities).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Study of the reaction mechanism as a function of the temperature, polarization and oxygen partial pressure</head><p>Effect of polarization and temperature on the reaction pathway under air condition -To study the reaction pathway under air at the three studied temperatures, the ratio of the surface to the bulk path has been computed as a function of the current density for LSCF (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>) and LSCF-CGO (Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>), respectively. The ratio is defined by the integration of R3 and R2 over the electrode thickness for the LSCF-CGO composite, while R3 is limited at the electrolyte interface for the LSCF electrode.</p><p>For both electrodes, this ratio is an increasing function of the anodic current, regardless of the operating temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). This behavior is associated to the concentration of the oxygen vacancies in the LSCF material. Indeed, as already discussed in <ref type="bibr">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39]</ref>, the LSCF understoichiometry tends to zero by increasing the anodic polarization. In this condition, the bulk path becomes more and more limited, while the direct oxidation at the TPBls is promoted (without limitation due to the accumulation of adsorbed oxygen species on the LSCF since the surface coverage of the adsorbed oxygen species at equilibrium is low). This evolution is illustrated for the LSCF electrode in Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref> by plotting the kinetic rates of both the charge transfer at TPBls and the oxygen incorporation/excorporation (integrated along the electrode thickness). Accordingly, the reaction of oxygen excorporation becomes bounded under anodic polarization while the charge transfer at TPBls is strongly activated. On the contrary, an opposite behavior is highlighted under cathodic polarization (i.e. the incorporation step is activated while the reaction at TPBls is bounded). As already shown for the LSCF electrode <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>, a transition from the bulk to the surface path occurs by increasing the anodic polarization at all the operating temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). Even if a slight increase of the ratio is detected as a function of the operating temperature, the bulk path appears to be the dominant pathway for the LSCF electrode at OCP (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). This result is in good agreement with the Gerischer typeelement observed for the diagrams obtained in this condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[80]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Moreover, a steep variation of the ratio is found at 650°C indicating a well-defined threshold for the transition from the bulk to the surface path. However, this evolution and the transition become smoother by increasing the operating temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). This behavior is in accordance with the derivatives of the polarization curves as a function of the current density. Indeed, a clear dissymmetry occurs close to the OCP at 650°C (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>), while a more linear evolution is observed at 750°C (Fig. <ref type="figure">4e</ref>). From the analysis of the ratio at 750°C (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>), it can be stated that the constant value measured experimentally is due to the fact that the investigated range of current density is not sufficiently extended to detect the transition to the surface path (taking place at a higher anodic dc current ≈+200 mA•cm -2 ). At 700°C, the ratio starts to be higher than the unity only at ≈+90 mA•cm -2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). This result explains why no change in the impedance diagrams was observed since the experiments were conducted for a lower dc current (± 50 mA•cm -2 : cf. section 4.1).</p><p>The ratio has also been computed at 800°C for the LSCF electrode taking advantage of the fitted activation energies. As it can be noticed in Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>, the ratio increases very slowly with the current density, probably due to the small overpotential values. Thereby, the transition to the surface path is much less abrupt and it is decayed at high anodic current density (≈300 mA•cm -</p><p>2 ). This result may explain the apparent discrepancy between our statements and the conclusions of Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> who claimed that the LSCF remains dominated by the bulk path in both anodic and cathodic polarizations at 800°C. Furthermore, it is worth noting that in their model, the chemical diffusivity depends exponentially on the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">LSCF (𝐷 = 𝐴exp 𝐵 𝐶 •• -𝐶 ••</formula><p>). With this model, the steep increase of Dchem at the electrolyte interface prevents the limitation of the bulk path under anodic current. In our case, the dependence of the chemical diffusivity with the concentration of vacancies is given by the thermodynamic factor computed using the local oxygen partial pressure in the electrode and the thermogravimetric data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref> (cf. Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">27</ref>)). With this approach, the chemical diffusivity increases only slightly on the investigated range of oxygen partial pressure (i.e. 𝑃 ≥ 0.10 atm).</p><p>This evolution is in good agreement with several articles that have referred only a very slight evolution of Dchem for 𝑃 ≥ 0.10 atm [30, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">68]</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>, the reaction mechanism for the LSCF-CGO electrode is completely dominated by the surface path whatever the polarization at 750°C and 700°C. This result could have been anticipated since the surface pathway is favored by the multiplication of the active sites in the whole electrode volume. However, the reaction mechanism starts to be fully controlled by the bulk path under low cathodic overpotentials when the temperature is lowered down to 650°C (Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>). This change in the reaction pathway is also experimentally confirmed by the dissymmetric shape of the i-η curve recorded at 650°C (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>). All these results deduced from the present elementary model are fully consistent with the analysis reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> using the simplified version of the model (taking into account only the presence of adsorbed neutral oxygen atoms on the LSCF surface).</p><p>Impact of the ratio on the impedance response -Impedance spectra have been computed below and above the transition at 700°C under air for idc=+50, +90, +120 and +150 mA•cm -2 to gain insight on the effect of the predominant reaction path on the electrode impedance response. The corresponding diagrams plotted in the Nyquist and Bode plans are given in the supplementary (Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>). A change in the shape of the diagram has been highlighted with an evolution starting from a slightly depressed Gerisher type-element towards a complete flattened semi-circle at idc=+150 mA•cm -2 . This evolution is in good agreement with the experimental results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Furthermore, a sharp increase of the characteristic frequency has been found when the dc current is raised above the threshold (at around +90 mA•cm -2 ). Indeed, the apex frequency is augmented from 0.7 Hz at idc=+50 mA•cm -2 up to 13 Hz at idc=+150 mA•cm -2 (with 1.9 Hz and 4.9 Hz for the intermediate values corresponding to +90, +120 mA•cm -2 , respectively). This statement shows that the simulated frequency distribution is strongly impacted even by a slight change in the ratio of the surface to bulk path for the reaction mechanism. Therefore, the mismatch between the computed and experimental frequencies highlighted in section 4.3.1 could be partly due to a slight under-estimation of the surface path in the modeling results.</p><p>Effect of oxygen partial pressure on the reaction mechanism at OCP -Taking advantage of the elementary model capability to predict the electrode response depending on 𝑃 , the effect of oxygen partial pressure on the reaction mechanism for the LSCF electrode has been investigated at OCP. For this purpose, simulations have been carried out at 700°C changing step by step the oxygen partial pressure from 𝑃 = 0.1 atm to 1 atm. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>, the increase of oxygen content in the gas phase enhances gradually the contribution of the surface path in the reaction mechanism. For instance, the ratio of the surface path to the bulk path close to the OCP rises from 0.29 at 𝑃 = 0.1 atm up to 1.05 at 𝑃 = 1 atm (Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>). On the one hand, this evolution can be explained by the decrease of the LSCF under-stoichiometry at equilibrium when the oxygen partial pressure is increased. As for an anodic polarization, the low concentration of vacancies at high oxygen partial pressure tends to block the bulk path towards a lower bound (Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>). As expected, the integrated reaction rate of oxygen incorporation/excorporation (R2) is a decreasing function of the oxygen partial pressure. On the other hand, the increase of 𝑃 also leads to enhance the oxygen activities for the adsorbed species promoting the reaction kinetics involved in the surface path. This statement is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref> by the continuous increase of the rate of charge transfer at TPBls (R3) with the oxygen partial pressure. As a result, it can be noticed in Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref> that the sum of the two contributions increases with 𝑃 explaining the continuous decrease of the electrode polarization resistance as previously discussed (cf. sections 4.1 and 4.3.2). It can be mentioned that the same explanation stands for the LSCF-CGO electrode. Nevertheless, the promotion of the reactions involved in the surface path is less sensitive to oxygen activities on the surface since, in this case, there is not a limitation in the density of available TPBls for the reaction step R3. Therefore, the improvement of the electrode performances with the oxygen partial pressure is less pronounced than for the LSCF electrode. Indeed, the ratio of the surface path to the bulk path rises at OCP only by a factor of 2.2 for the LSCF-CGO electrode when 𝑃 varies between 0.1 and 1 atm at 700 °C (see supplementary, Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</p><p>To identify the rate-determining steps for the LSCF electrode at OCP, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted with the model changing the kinetic constant one after the other. The impedance simulations have been performed at 700°C for two oxygen partial pressures at 𝑃 =0.15 and 0.30 atm. For the chosen conditions, the ratio of the surface path to the bulk path is equal to 0.39 and 0.58, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>). For both oxygen partial pressures, it has been found that the adsorption R6 and ionization R4, which belong to the common path, co-limits the reaction mechanism. Indeed, the division by two of their respective kinetic constants leads to raise significantly the polarization resistance, i.e. the relative increase of the polarization resistance ∆𝑅 /𝑅 is found equal to 8 % (resp. 6 %) for 𝑘 /2 and to 14 % (resp. 11 %) for 𝑘 /2 at 𝑃 =0.15 atm (resp. 0.30 atm). When the mechanism is dominated by the bulk path at low oxygen partial pressure, the reaction of oxygen incorporation/excorporation (R2) is identified as an additional rate-determining step whereas the role of the reaction at TPBls (R3) becomes more and more negligible. Indeed, the division by two of their kinetic constants yields an increase of 𝑅 of 17% for 𝑘 / /2 and 5% for 𝑘 /2. As expected, this result tends to be reversed when increasing the oxygen partial pressure to 0.3 atm. In that case, the diminution of the electrode performances due to the decrease of 𝑘 / is of 15% whereas it reaches almost 10% when reducing the charge transfer at TPBls. In this case, the reaction mechanism becomes also more and more dependent on the surface diffusion coefficient of the oxygen ions (hindering the oxygen transport away from the TPBls restricted at the electrolyte interface).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Impact of the LSCF decomposition on the electrode performances</head><p>As mentioned in the introduction, the LSCF decomposition upon operation is liable to decrease global exchange kinetic constant 𝑘 due to the LSCF surface passivation. Besides, the loss of strontium can affect the chemical diffusivity by modifying the oxygen stoichiometry in the bulk of the material. To date, few data are reported in the literature to estimate the decay of 𝑘 and 𝐷 due to the demixing for the classical La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ compound. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref> have estimated a decrease of 𝐷 and 𝑘 of 50% after an isothermal ageing of symmetric cells at 800 °C for 800 hours. However, the same authors have also reported a decrease of around 85% for 𝑘 with no significant change in 𝐷 for LSCF electrodes annealed at 700-800°C for the same period <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In addition, Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> have found a severe decrease of 𝑘 estimated to 85% whereas the deviation in the chemical diffusivity is only of 8% for sintered LSCF pellets after a thermal ageing at 800°C for 800 hours. For an ageing at 750°C during 1012 hours using complete cells, Endler-Schuck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[82]</ref> have found that the 'performance degradation in the LSCF electrode seems to be caused by a decrease of the bulk diffusion while the exchange coefficient remains almost constant'. At 600°C, they have found that both parameters decrease with the ageing time. Therefore, there is still a large uncertainty on the real impact of the LSCF demixing on the values of 𝐷 and 𝑘 . Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have proposed that this apparent discrepancy could be explained by a potential slight deficiency on the A-site of the perovskite that could lead to different Sr segregation. Furthermore, it can be suspected that the experimental conditions such as the presence of residual steam in the gas stream may also influence the results.</p><p>In spite of this scattering of the published results, the elementary model has been used to assess the impact of the LSCF demixing on the electrode response. Firstly, the electrode surface passivation was simulated by decreasing the specific surface area between the LSCF and the gas phase (𝑆 / ). Indeed, the kinetics of the surface reactions for the common path as well as the reaction of oxygen incorporation/excorporation (R2) for the bulk path are proportional to this parameter (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>). It is worth noting that the combination of all these reaction kinetics results in the global exchange kinetic constant 𝑘 usually estimated at OCP according to the 'ALS' model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">82]</ref>. Secondly, the loss of ionic conductivity due to the Sr release from the perovskite lattice was simulated by decreasing the oxygen chemical diffusivity (𝐷 ). The sensitivity analysis was carried out for the LSCF electrode computing the impedance diagrams at 750°C under air at OCP and for a dc current of ±50 mA•cm -². The electrode degradation was simulated by decreasing each parameter by 10% up to 50%. This range was chosen since a decrease of 10% can be roughly seen as a lower bound for the degradation, while a decrease of 50% remains in the scale of the reasonable published values.</p><p>Finally, it can be mentioned that the bulk path is prevailing in the chosen conditions for the simulations. Indeed, the bulk path must be favored to determine the effect of the oxygen chemical diffusivity on the polarization resistance.</p><p>Degradation at OCP -The evolution of the impedance diagrams and frequency distribution in the Nyquist and Bode plots are respectively shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">10a</ref> and 10b as a function of the surface passivation at OCP. An enlargement of the spectra for the contribution at low frequencies is found (Fig. <ref type="figure">10a</ref>), which is accompanied by a slight shift of the frequency distribution towards lower values (Fig. <ref type="figure">10b</ref>). These evolutions are explained since the LSCF/gas specific surface area impacts the excorporation (R2), deionization (R4) and desorption (R6) identified as the rate-determining steps at OCP. Indeed, it has been observed that all these reactions are at the origin of the skewed semicircle arising at low frequencies in the spectrum.</p><p>Regarding the loss of ionic conductivity, the decrease of 𝐷 induces a swelling of the contribution at intermediate frequency in the Gerischer type-element (Fig. <ref type="figure">10c</ref>). This behavior is associated to the diffusion of the oxygen vacancies in LSCF co-limiting the electrode response <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. This evolution is concomitant with a very slight increase of the apex frequency in the Bode plots (Fig. <ref type="figure">10d</ref>). At OCP, it can be noticed that the impact of the specific surface area on 𝑅 (Fig. <ref type="figure">10e</ref>) is higher with respect to the loss of ionic conductivity (Fig. <ref type="figure">10f</ref>).</p><p>Considering a decrease of 30% for both studied parameters, the polarization resistance is increased by 25% for the surface passivation, while an augmentation of only 12% was simulated for the loss of ionic conductivity. This result means that the co-limitation at OCP due to the reactions involved in the bulk path is higher than the resistance induced by the oxygen vacancies diffusion in LSCF.</p><p>Degradation under polarization-As expected, the same trends than the ones found at OCP have been observed for the evolutions of the impedance diagrams under dc currents. The degradation of the electrode polarization resistance due to the surface passivation in SOFC and SOEC modes is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">11a</ref>, while the impact of the loss of ionic conductivity is shown Fig. <ref type="figure">11b</ref>. It is found that the decrease of the specific surface area is more impacting when the electrode is operated in the electrolysis mode compared to the fuel cell mode (Fig. <ref type="figure">11a</ref>). In other words, the surface passivation is more detrimental under anodic current. This result can be correlated with the higher contribution of the surface path under anodic polarization. In this condition, the two pathways become co-limited by decreasing the surface reaction belonging to the common path.</p><p>Besides, it is worth reminding that the flux of the adsorbed oxygen ions, which have been identified as a rate-determining step for the surface path (cf. section 5.1), also depends on the LSCF/gas specific surface area. Therefore, the decrease of this flux due to the surface passivation prevents the activation of the surface path.</p><p>In contrast to the passivation, the electrode performances are more impacted by the decrease of 𝐷 when it is operated under fuel cell mode (Fig. <ref type="figure">11b</ref>). Indeed, as already mentioned, the bulk path is co-limited by the oxygen solid-state diffusion in the perovskite. Therefore, the decrease of the ionic conductivity due to the LSCF demixing is especially harmful when this reaction pathway is predominant.</p><p>It can be noticed in Fig. <ref type="figure">11a</ref> and 11b that the impact of the surface passivation on the electrode response seems to be higher than the one induced by the loss of ionic conductivity. This result would indicate that the contribution of the LSCF demixing on the loss of electrode performances is more related to the surface deactivation than to an evolution of the LSCF bulk properties. This suggestion is in good agreement with the statement made by some authors who have observed an electrode recovery thanks to an LSCF surface etching treatment after aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">83]</ref>. Therefore, the present modeling result would strengthen the claim that 'the degradation is most likely due to the emergence of surface inhibited species on LSCF electrode' <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the sum of the degradation due to the surface passivation and the loss of ionic conductivity, is higher in electrolysis mode (Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>). In other words, the impact of LSCF degradation is higher under anodic polarization, addressing a double penalty for this operating mode since the Sr segregation seems to be also promoted in this operating mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">86]</ref>. Finally, it is worth mentioning that, even for the considered lower bound for the LSCF decomposition, the impact on the electrode performance is not negligible meaning that the demixing remains an important issue for the SOCs durability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>An elementary kinetic model was developed to predict the electrochemical response of the LSCF and LSCF-CGO porous electrodes. The model describes the mass and charge fluxes in the porosity and in the bulk of the solid phases along with the transport of adsorbed species at the surface of the electrode particles. In this frame, the presence of oxygen ad-ions has been assumed onto the LSCF particles leading to take into account a surface electrostatic potential.</p><p>For impedance simulations, the mass and charge conservations are solved in the time domain by taking into account the kinetic rates and the transient terms for all the considered species.</p><p>The model was validated thanks to experiments performed on symmetrical cells using a threeelectrode setup. The missing parameters corresponding to the kinetic constants and surface diffusivities have been determined by fitting the polarization curves obtained at three temperatures (650°C, 700°C and 750°C). It is worth mentioning that it was possible to identify a single solution of the fitted parameters for both electrodes thanks to the dissymmetry of the curves, especially at low temperature. Besides, the two sets of values have been found to be consistent between the two types of studied electrodes. After the calibration, it has been shown that, without additional fitting, the model is able to simulate accurately the experimental EIS diagrams at OCP and under polarization for all the investigated temperatures. Moreover, the evolution of the electrode polarization resistance with the oxygen partial pressure is also well captured by the model. Indeed, a very good agreement has been found between the experimental and simulated reaction orders for both electrodes. Nevertheless, it can be mentioned that a systematic frequency lag was obtained between the measured and simulated spectra. For this reason, further investigations are still required to elucidate the origin of this discrepancy.</p><p>Once validated, the model has been used to analyze deeply the LSCF and LSCF-CGO reaction mechanisms. It has been confirmed that, at low and intermediate temperatures (700°C), the LSCF exhibits a net change of reaction pathway from the bulk to the surface path at low anodic polarization. However, this transition has been found to be smoother and delayed at higher anodic current with increasing the temperature (800°C), probably due to the small overpotential value. On the contrary, the LSCF-CGO electrode remains fully controlled by the surface path except at low temperature and high cathodic polarization. Besides, the dependency of the reaction mechanism with the oxygen partial pressure has been also studied at 700°C. For both electrodes, the decrease of the electrode polarization with 𝑃 is associated to a higher contribution of the surface path in the reaction mechanism. This behavior has been ascribed to the combined evolution of oxygen at the surface and in the bulk of LSCF as a function of 𝑃 .</p><p>In addition, the rate-determining steps at OCP have been identified for the LSCF depending on the oxygen partial pressure. When the reaction mechanism is mainly controlled by the bulk path at low 𝑃 , the global kinetic rate is co-limited by the oxygen excorporation, the surface ionization and the desorption. For a higher contribution of the surface path at higher 𝑃 , the charge transfer at TPBls and the surface diffusion of oxygen ad-ions become more and more co-limiting while the ionization and desorption remain two rate-determining steps.</p><p>Finally, the impact of the perovskite decomposition on the LSCF electrode response has been studied with the model at OCP and under anodic and cathodic dc currents. The surface passivation and the loss of ionic conductivity have been simulated by decreasing the specific surface area and the chemical diffusivity, respectively. At OCP, the impact of the demixing on the evolution of the impedance spectra have been discussed. It has been shown that the passivation affects the contribution at low frequency in the Gerisher-type element while the loss of ionic conductivity enlarges the contribution at intermediate frequency.</p><p>It has been stated that the surface passivation is more affecting the electrode response when the performances are evaluated under electrolysis mode. On the contrary, the electrode polarization resistance is more sensitive to the decrease of ionic conductivity when the response is evaluated in fuel cell mode. Finally, whatever the conditions, it appears that the surface passivation would be more impacting than the decrease of the ionic conductivity. Moreover, the sum of the degradation induced by the two phenomena is higher when the electrode response is computed in anodic polarization. Therefore, the LSCF decomposition would be more detrimental for the electrode performances in electrolysis mode.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUPPLEMENTARY Information</head><p>Some of the results for the LSCF and LSCF-CGO electrodes are reported in the supplementary.</p><p>The impedance diagrams for the WE and the CE versus the RE measured on the LSCF symmetrical cell are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>. The superimposition of the two spectra confirms that the rules for the positioning of the RE are fulfilled. This result allows validating the reliability of the measurements.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref> and<ref type="figure">S3</ref>, it is shown that the LSCF-CGO model is able to predict accurately the shape of the impedance diagrams obtained in different conditions of temperature or polarizations. As for the LSCF electrode, a systematic frequency shift is observed between the simulations and the experiments. However, the increase of the characteristic frequency with the temperature and the polarization is well retrieved by the model.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>, the impedance diagrams as a function of the anodic polarization have been computed for the LSCF model at 700°C at 𝑃 = 0.21 atm. An improvement in performances have been found with the increasing of the dc current. In this condition, it can be noticed that a contribution due to the gas conversion in the electrode appears in the impedance spectra at low frequencies.</p><p>Finally, in Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>, it is shown that the composite electrode is completely controlled by the surface path at 700°C (except at low oxygen partial under high cathodic polarization). Besides, as for the LSCF electrode, the contribution of the surface path is enhanced with increasing the oxygen partial pressure.  </p></div>			</div>
