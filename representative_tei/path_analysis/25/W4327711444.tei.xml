<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating role of Social Comparison and Loneliness in the relationship between Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) and Subjective Well-Being (SWB) in adolescents. For this purpose, the research is conducted according to the relational survey model, one of the descriptive research models. 1000 adolescents (505 females and 495 males) participated in the study. Participants are selected using stratified sampling method, which is one of the random/probability sampling methods. In this study, proportional stratified sampling method, which is based on the selection of sampling elements for each stratum depending on the distribution rate of that stratum in the population, is used. Four scales including Fear of Missing Out Scale, Adolescent Subjective Well-Being Scale, Social Comparison Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale-Short Form and a personal information form including of sociodemographic questions were used as data collection tools in the study. The mediating role of social comparison and loneliness in the relationship between fear of missing out in social settings and subjective well-being in adolescents is analyzed using structural equation modeling. Pearson product-moment correlation analysis and path analysis, one of the structural equation modelling techniques, were used in data analyses. The results of the correlation analysis show that there is a significant relationship between FoMO, SWB, social comparison and loneliness. According to the results of the study, there is a negative relationship between adolescents' FoMO and their SWB. According to the results, as adolescents' FoMO increases, their SWB levels decrease. In addition, it was also concluded that as the level of adolescents' FoMO, their selfworth decreases and their loneliness levels increase. Path analysis results show that social comparison mediate the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adolescents. Path analysis results show that loneliness also has a mediating role in the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adolescents. The results of the research are discussed in the light of the literature and previous studies and recommendations were presented.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Adolescence is one of the most important phases in the course of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dolgin, 2014)</ref>. In this time period, the adolescent is in educational environments that shape his future and has to interact with people intensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Toprakçı, 2017)</ref>. Therefore, it is crucial to pass upon this critical period in a healthy way, as it is when many physical, cognitive, emotional and social changes occur in an individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Steinberg, 2013)</ref>. Sudden changes can be observed in the emotions of adolescents during this period when they get prepared for adult lives. Adolescents may see themselves as inadequate and worthless during this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Yavuzer, 2008)</ref>. Adolescents' concerns about future may become apparent and their life satisfaction may decrease depending on their relationships with other people. However, it is not correct to state that all adolescents experience developmental problems in this stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Michalcakova, Lacinova, &amp; Jelinek, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Montserrat, Dinisman, Bălţătescu, Grigoraş, &amp; Casas, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Adolescence can be a very challenging life stage in which various mental health issues can be observed, but it can also become an "age of opportunities" in which adolescents solve their problems with the gains they will achieve by using their cognitive, emotional and social skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jach, Sun, Loton, Chin, &amp; Waters, 2017)</ref>. Subjective well-being (SWB), which can be defined as feeling positive emotions more than negative emotions and obtaining a high level of satisfaction from life, is one of the important gains that can contribute to spending this critical period in a healthier way for adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Diener, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eryılmaz, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>SWB is affected by various variables such as personality traits, coping skills and self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Diener, Oishi, &amp; Lucas, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lyubomirsky, 2001)</ref>. Another factor affecting SWB is basic psychological needs <ref type="bibr">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2001)</ref>. When individuals can fulfil their needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness their SWB increases, while it decreases in individuals who cannot fulfil their basic psychological needs <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref>. Adolescents primarily care about their relationships with their peers. In an environment where online activities are becoming increasingly widespread, adolescents who cannot sufficiently meet their psychological needs try to connect with others by using the internet, social media and social networking sites intensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Wartberg, Kriston, &amp; Thomasius, 2020)</ref>. By year 2022, 5.07 billion people worldwide used the internet. The number of active social media users worldwide is <ref type="bibr">4.74 billion (WAS, 2022)</ref>. Approximately one-third of internet users worldwide are adolescents between the ages of 11-18 (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, 2017). In Turkey, there are 65.80 million internet users. Sixty million people have social media accounts. The number of internet and social media users is gradually increasing. Worldwide, users stay connected to the internet for an average of 6 hours and 37 minutes per day. Internet users between the ages of 16-64 in Turkey use the Internet for an average of 7 hours and 17 minutes per day, which is above the world average <ref type="bibr">(WAS, 2022)</ref>. Based on the data shared by <ref type="bibr">WAS (2022)</ref>, it can be concluded that digital networks and social media are widely and intensively used both in the world and Turkey. In this context, it can be said that the main factor behind the intensive use of the internet, social networking sites and social media is the fear of missing out (FoMO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker, Krieger, &amp; LeRoy, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Beyens, Frison, &amp; Eggermont, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Przybylski, Murayama, DeHaan, &amp; Gladwell, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Adolescents frequently use the Internet, social networking sites and social media. The intensive use of digital technologies brings with it FoMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Beyens, et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tomczyk &amp; Selmanagic-Lizde, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Tuncer, 2016)</ref>. FoMO, a type of social anxiety, can be defined as an individual's constant attempt to stay in contact with others with the concern that he/she will miss these rewards while other individuals have rewarding experiences. Due to FoMO, individuals try to follow each other constantly to avoid falling behind other individuals. The widespread use of the Internet, social networking sites and social media has facilitated the tracking of individuals' daily life activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>. Although FoMO is seen in people from different age groups, today's adolescents who use digital communication tools frequently experience it <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Beyens, et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It can be stated that FoMO is a result of the individual's desire not to lag behind others <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hodkinson &amp; Poropat, 2014)</ref>. However, it is also thought to be related to the desire of fulfilling basic psychological needs, such as SWB. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref>, positive feedback or rewards received from other individuals increase intrinsic motivation and contribute to the fulfilment of autonomy and competence needs. Individuals try to share more when their posts on social media and social networking sites are liked <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alutaybi, Al-Thani, McAlaney, &amp; Ali, 2020)</ref>. In this context, it can be stated that the reason why individuals share intensively about their daily lives on social media and social networking sites is to try to fulfil their autonomy and competence needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>. Another reason for FoMO is the need to be in contact and relatedness with other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kuss &amp; Griffiths, 2017)</ref>. Individuals who cannot sufficiently fulfil their need to connect in the offline world use social media to communicate and deepen their relationships with other individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>. With the concern of losing the feelings of establishing a relationship and being connected, individuals try to follow other individuals on digital networks, not to overlook the posts made by others, and to share their own lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alutaybi et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>As can be understood from the explanations made so far, digital networks can strengthen communication between adolescents and contribute to fulfilling their relatedness needs. However, on the other hand, contrary to expectations, the intensive use of digital technologies may lead to an increase in adolescents' loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barry &amp; Wong 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dossey, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fumagalli, Dolmatzian &amp; Shrum, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kaya, Vangölü, Marufoğlu &amp; Özdemir, 2023)</ref>. In the dictionary sense, loneliness is defined as not having anone around/present with an individual (TDK, 2020). However, loneliness does not only mean being away from others. Loneliness can be defined as being deprived of the desired friendships while desiring to be with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Peplau, 1955)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Perlman and Peplau (1998)</ref> explain loneliness with a model called "the inconsistency model". The inconsistency model is based on the idea that loneliness is caused by the inconsistency between desired relationships and real life relationships. The inconsistency model has two different perspectives: "social needs" and "cognitive inconsistency". From the social needs perspective, loneliness is a result of basic needs that aren't fully met in social life. From a cognitive perspective, loneliness is caused by the incompatibility of people's desires and expectations with social reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Perlman &amp; Peplau, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Adolescence is one of the stages of life when social support and quality relationships are most needed. However, most adolescents feel lonely <ref type="bibr">(Dolgin, 2014: 488)</ref>. Adolescents who cannot adequately meet their social needs in offline environments use the internet, social networking sites, social media and smartphones intensively to cope with loneliness, to meet their needs by staying in contact with other individuals and not to miss rewarding social experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Beyens, et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tomczyk &amp; Selmanagic-Lizde, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Tuncer, 2016)</ref>. However, research shows that intensive use of the internet, social networking sites, social media and smartphones increases adolescents' feelings of loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Çakır &amp; Oğuz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Yiğit, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Çakır and Oğuz (2017)</ref> found a positive relationship between smartphone addiction and loneliness in adolescents. In another study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Esen (2010)</ref>, a positive relationship was found between loneliness and internet addiction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Türkel and Dilmaç (2019)</ref> concluded that there is a positive relationship between the frequency of social media use and adolescents' loneliness levels and that as the loneliness levels of adolescents increase, their life satisfaction decreases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt, Marx, Lipson and Young, (2018)</ref> concluded that limiting social media use to half an hour a day for 3 weeks significantly reduced the loneliness and depression levels of individuals. Research shows that adolescents isolate themselves to spend time on social networking sites and social media, which negatively affects their real-life friendships and social lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fumagalli et al., 2021)</ref>. Adolescents use the internet, social networking sites and social media intensively in order not to fall behind others and to meet their social needs, but as their usage levels increase, their loneliness levels also increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Çakır &amp; Oğuz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fumagalli et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Türkel &amp; Dilmaç, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Yiğit, 2019)</ref>. In addition, loneliness has a negative effect on the SWB of individuals, including adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Tu &amp; Zhang, 2014)</ref>. Loneliness causes individuals to feel more negative emotions and decreases their life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Türkel &amp; Dilmaç, 2019)</ref>. Studies reveal that there is a negative relationship between loneliness and SWB, and as the loneliness level of individuals increases, their SWB decreases. Therefore, it can be stated that FoMO causes loneliness and loneliness causes a decrease in adolescents' SWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Apaolaza, Hartmann, Medina, Barrutia, &amp; Echebarria, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kong &amp; You, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>FoMO leads not only to loneliness but also to social comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bais &amp; Reyes, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ghaiumy Anaraky, Freeman, Aragón, Knijnenburg, &amp; Tallapragada, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Piteo &amp; Ward, 2020)</ref>. Social comparison is when individuals compare themselves with others in order to obtain information about themselves and evaluate their position in situations where they cannot make evaluations using objective measurement tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Festinger, 1954)</ref>. For example, an individual can learn how tall he/she is by using a metre. However, he/she can determine how good a life he/she has or how talented he/she is by social comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Klein, 1997)</ref>. As stated above, social comparison is based on the desire to obtain objective information about oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Festinger, 1954)</ref>. Researchers show that other reasons for social comparison are the individual's need to maintain personal development, strengthen self-worth and establish relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buunk &amp; Gibbons, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kağıtçıbaşı &amp; Cemalcılar, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wayment &amp; Taylor 1995)</ref>. Another reason is the individual's desire to compete with other individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hodkinson &amp; Poropat, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Reagle, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In previous years, individuals generally made these comparisons with other individuals who were in a similar position with them and who were in their immediate environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Festinger, 1954)</ref>. Today, which is characterised as the information age, these comparisons can be made in a much broader environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Reagle, 2015)</ref>. Especially social networking sites and social media posts can have adversely affect on individuals. Photographs or images shared by other individuals on social media cause individuals to compare these posts with their own lives. As a result of these comparisons, individuals may think that they lag behind others, are left out of the enjoyment, and cannot live well <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ghaiumy Anaraky et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Giagkou, Hussain ve Pontes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Müller, Wegmann, Stolze ve Brand, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Piteo &amp; Ward, 2020)</ref>. In the study conducted by Ghaiumy <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Anaraky et al. (2019)</ref>, it was determined that social comparison is associated with low self-esteem, reduces the sense of enjoyment of social media users, and decreases their SWB. In another study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Piteo and Ward (2020)</ref>, it was concluded that there is a positive relationship between the intensive use of social networking sites and depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents, and that fear of missing developments and social comparison mediate this relationship. Research results reveal that intensive use of digital technologies is largely related to the fear of missing developments in social environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barry, Sidoti, Briggs, Reiter, &amp; Lindsey, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bekman, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Çetinkaya, 2019)</ref>. Intensive use of digital technologies, especially social networking sites and social media, causes individuals to frequently compare their lives with others. As a result of these comparisons, individuals' self-worth decreases. Individuals feel negative emotions more, show symptoms of depression and anxiety, their life satisfaction decreases and their SWB decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ghaiumy Anaraky et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Giagkou et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Müller et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Piteo &amp; Ward, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Reer, Tang, &amp; Quandt, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wirtz, Tucker, Briggs, &amp; Schoemann, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>When the literature is examined, it is seen that there are various studies examining the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alt, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Milyavskaya, Saffran, Hope, &amp; Koestner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Roberts &amp; David, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Stead &amp; Bibby, 2017)</ref>. In the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alt (2015)</ref>, it was determined that there was a negative relationship between FoMO and SWB. In the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt et al. (2018)</ref>, similar results were obtained, and it was determined that FoMO negatively affected the SWB of individuals. According to the results of the research, FoMO causes the emergence of depression and anxiety symptoms in individuals, reduces their life satisfaction, and their SWB by causing them to experience negative emotions more <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fabris, Marengo, Longobardi, &amp; Settanni, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kelly, Zilanawala, Booker, &amp; Sacker, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Oberst, Wegmann, Stodt, Brand, &amp; Chamarro, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>As stated above, although there are various studies examining the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adults, only one study <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kartol &amp; Peker, 2020)</ref> examining the relationship between FoMO and happiness in adolescents was found. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kartol and Peker (2020)</ref> concluded that there was no significant relationship between the variables in their study examining the relationship between FoMO and happiness in adolescents. Studies reveal that the main reason for the intensive use of the internet, social networking sites, social media and smartphones is FoMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Beyens et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>.

Digital technologies are frequently used by adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Beyens et al. 2016)</ref>. It is thought that the results of this study may contribute to supporting adolescents who face various risk factors such as addiction and mental health problems with the intensive use of digital technology and digital networks. In the literature, there is no study examines the mediating effects of social comparison and loneliness on the relationship between FoMO and SWB in both adolescents and individuals in other developmental periods. Studies reveal that both loneliness and social comparison are effective on SWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Apaolaza et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kong &amp; You, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Müller et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Piteo &amp; Ward, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Reer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tu &amp; Zhang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Türkel &amp; Dilmaç, 2019)</ref>. In this respect, this is the first study examine the mediating role of social comparison and loneliness in the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adolescents. It is crucial to determine the levels of FoMO, SWB, social comparison and loneliness of adolescents, who are in a critical period in the transitioning from childhood to adulthood, and the factors affecting them. Therefore, determining the mediating roles of social comparison and loneliness in the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adolescents constitutes the primary purpose of this study.</p></div>

Factor analysis was performed to determine the construct validity of the scale. As a result of the factor analysis, the unidimensional structure of the scale was confirmed. As a result of Study I (α = .79) and Study II (α = .78), Cronbach's alpha values determined that the internal consistency of the scale was at an acceptable level. The test-retest reliability of the scale was found to be .86 in Study III. As a result of the study, it was concluded that the scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that can measure the fears of individuals between the ages of 15-72 in Turkey about missing developments in social environments.

The Spearman Brown value of the scale was .83 and the reliability value based on the test-retest method was .83. As a result of the analyses, it was determined that the adolescent SWB scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that can measure the SWB of adolescents. Cronbach α internal consistency coefficients within the scope of this study were .89 for the whole scale, .85 for the subscale of satisfaction in relationships with family, .72 for the subscale of satisfaction in relationships with significant others, .89 for the subscale of life satisfaction, and .79 for the subscale of positive emotions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allan and Gilbert (1995)</ref>. The original scale consisted of 5 items. During the adaptation into Turkish by Şahin and colleagues, the number of items was first increased to 6 and then to 18 <ref type="bibr">(Şahin &amp; Şahin, 1992)</ref>. The scale items have a bipolar structure and are marked between 1 and 6 points. High scores obtained from the SCS indicate positive self-schemas of the participants. In the adaptation study, the Cronbach α internal consistency coefficient of the scale was .87. In this study, the Cronbach α internal consistency coefficient of the scale was .88. During the adaptation study, criterion-related validity was compared. The correlation between the SCS and Beck Depression Inventory was : -.19 (p&lt;.000), was found. The correlations between the SCS and the subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory were 0.14 and 0.34. In the study on construct validity, it was concluded that the groups with scores below 9 and above 17 on the Beck Depression Inventory could be separated according to the Social Comparison Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Savaşır &amp; Şahin, 1997)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Data Analysis</head><p>The data are analyzed via descriptive statistics, parametric analysis techniques and path analysis. SPSS.21 was used for descriptive statistics and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation, while path analysis was conducted via LISREL 8.80.</p><p>The researchers started the procedure with the analysis of missing data, and concluded that there were no missing data. They calculated the z score for each variable in order to identify one-variable outliers and removed 11 responses which were out of the interval of |3.29| <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tabachnick and Fidell, 2020)</ref>. Multi-variable outliers are analyzed by calculating Mahalonobis distance, and 11 more responses were removed from the data set as they were higher than the critical value ( 2 (4) = 18.465, p&lt;.001). Therefore, data analysis was conducted with a data set of 978 participants. Values of skewness and kurtosis were calculated to identify if the data set met the normality assumption. As is clear from the values of skewness and kurtosis given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, coefficients of skewness as to the variables varied between -.66 and -.36, and their coefficients of kurtosis varied between -.53 and .12, which means that they met the normality assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tabachnick and Fidell, 2020)</ref>. Table 1 also shows that coefficient of skewness z scores of all the variables in the current study were out of the critical intervals of |1.96| (p &lt;.05) or |2.58| (p &lt;.01) <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson &amp; Tatham 2014)</ref>, whereas coefficient of kurtosis z scores of all the variables except Loneliness were within the critical intervals. The values of kurtosis (γ ̂1,p = .90, p&lt;.05) and skewness (γ ̂2,p = 25.30, p&lt;.05) as to the Mardia given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> show that the data deviated from the multi-variable normality at a statistically significant level <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Byrne, 2013)</ref>. Then, the researchers examined the data set to see if there was multi-collinearity problem, and calculated the correlation among variables as well as tolerance and VIF values, and the results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As is seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, correlation values among the variables varied between -.53 and .57 (r &lt;.90), tolerance values varied between .59 and .93 (tolerance value&gt;.10) and VIF values varied between 1.08 and 1.70 (VIF&lt;10), and there was no multi-collinearity problem among variables <ref type="bibr">(Çokluk, Şekercioğlu &amp; Büyüköztürk, 2010)</ref>. In the light of these results, the researchers decided that the data set met the pre-requisites for analysis and started to test the hypothesis of the current study. The current study aims at testing a model that examines the mediating effects. In the current model, FoMO is the independent variable, SWB is the dependent variable, social comparison and loneliness are mediating variables. All the variables are added to the model as an observed variable. The hypothesis of the current study were tested via structural equational modelling (SEM), Maximum Likelihood Robust -MLR as the prediction method and three-step mediating model suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref>, the acceptance of a variable as a mediating variable depends on three criteria. Accordingly, the independent variable (fear of missing developments in social settings) should significantly affect the dependent variable (SWB). At the same time, the independent variable (fear of missing out in social situations) should also significantly affect the mediating variables (social comparison and loneliness). The third criterion is that the mediating variables (social comparison and loneliness) affected by the independent variable should significantly affect the dependent variable (SWB).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>Before testing the hypothetical model, the relation between FoMO, the independent variable of the study and SWB, the dependent variable was analyzed via the method of simple linear regression. The results of the analysis showed that FoMO predicted SWB at a statistically significant level (β = .15, t = 4.59, p &lt;.01), which means that the first assumption suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> was met. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> below presents the model which examines the direct effect of FoMO on SWB as well as its indirect effect on social comparison and loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Path Analysis Model</head><p>Parameter estimations obtained at the end of the path analysis are given in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. As is clear in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, all the paths among the variables were statistically significant (p &lt;.01 and p &lt;.05). Both parameter predictions and goodness of fit values were important in evaluating the model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kline, 2019)</ref>. The value of S-B 𝜒2(1) of the model was found to be 206.19 (p&lt;.001), while other values of goodness of fit were calculated as RMSEA = .46 [%90 G.A .41; .51], CFI = .78, TLI = -.33 and SRMR = .17. The analysis showed that although all the paths among the variables were seen to be statistically significant, the values were not sufficient for the model fit. <ref type="bibr">Kline (2019: 158)</ref> states that one of the reasons why the hypothetic model does not have the sufficient values of model fit is that the model might be complicated. According to <ref type="bibr">Kline (2019: 158)</ref>, when the values are not sufficient for the model fit, it is possible to develop relatively simple models that can be accepted as the sub-groups of the main model considering the theoretical foundation and the research hypothesis of the study, and then to analyze the sub-models. At this stage, the researchers developed two different models as Model A and Model B including the variables of social comparison and loneliness separately. The path analysis as to Model A and Model B are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>   Right after developing the model, the researchers tried to find out if the models were defined or not, and concluded that both of the models given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> were defined (sd = 0). After defining the models, the researchers moved on to evaluate the fit of the models.</p></div>

On the other hand, it is clear that social comparison positively predicted SWB at a statistically significant level (β = .56, t = 19.18, p &lt;.01). Starting from this point, it is possible to state that the second and third assumptions suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> were met.

In the model, SWB has R2 = .02, while social comparison has R2 = .34. Lastly, the researchers found out that while the relation between the independent variable, FoMO and dependent variable, SWB (β = .15, t = 4.59, p &lt;.01) was statistically significant before the mediator, social comparison was included in the model, this relation turned out to be statistically insignificant when social comparison was included in the model (β = -.04, t = -1.29, p&gt;.01).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS</head><p>The current study aims at examining the mediating role of social comparison and loneliness in the effect of FoMO on SWB in adolescents. According to the study results, FoMO negatively predicts adolescents' SWB. The finding that SWB is negatively predicted by FoMO complies with other studies in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hunt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Milyavskaya et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Stead &amp; Bibby, 2017)</ref>. The fact that individuals experience positive emotions more than negative emotions increases their SWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Diener, 2000)</ref>. Research results reveal that GCR increases negative emotions while decreasing positive emotions in online and offline environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dempsey, O'Brien, Tiamiyu, &amp; Elhai, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fabris, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Yin, Wang, Nie, Guo, Feng, &amp; Lei, 2019)</ref>. In adolescents, FoMO is also associated with mental symptoms caused by high levels of negative affect and low levels of positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barry et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Beyens et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Oberst et al., 2017)</ref>. Especially the inadequacy and worthlessness beliefs of adolescents who think that their posts on digital networking sites are not liked or interacted enough increase. It can be stated that the beliefs that they are behind other individuals cause adolescents to show symptoms of depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Oberst et al., 2017)</ref>. The cognitive component of SWB is life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Diener, 2000)</ref>. FoMO also affects adolescents' life satisfaction in a negative way <ref type="bibr">(Barrry &amp; Wong, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dempsey et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Przybylski et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Uram &amp; Skalski, 2022)</ref>. To summarise, FoMO may lead adolescents to think that they are behind their peers and other individuals, that they cannot compete with other individuals, and that they do not have a life as desirable as that of other individuals. This situation causes adolescents to feel unhappy, their life satisfaction decreases, and their SWB levels decrease.</p><p>Another result of the study is that FoMO predicts social comparison negatively in adolescents. This result can be evaluated within the scope of the self-worth that adolescents gain as a result of social comparisons. It can be stated that FoMO may cause adolescents to decrease their self-worth and see themselves as inadequate or worthless. The negative prediction of social comparison by FoMO in adolescents can also be evaluated within the framework of social comparisons decreasing the satisfaction obtained from social relationships. The use of digital networks for socialising helps to meet the psychological needs of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alutaybi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Oberst et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rozgonjuk, Ryan, Kuljus, Täht, &amp; Scott, 2019)</ref>. However, social comparisons in digital networks reduce the potential contribution of online activities in satisfying psychological needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Yang, 2016)</ref>. It can be stated that adolescents who use digital networks, especially with the desire to be related and communicate with other individuals, may avoid social comparisons in order not to reduce their perception of need satisfaction. At the same time, it can be said that adolescents' thinking that they are left behind their peers and other individuals and that they cannot compete with others due to the effect of FoMO may negatively affect their selfconfidence and lead to a decrease in their self-worth.</p><p>In this study, it was determined that FoMO positively predicted loneliness in adolescents. This result is consistent with the results of studies in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barry &amp; Wong, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fumagalli et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Uram &amp; Skalski, 2022)</ref>. Although the intensive use of digital networks due to FoMO may increase the amount of social contacts and interactions of the individual, it decreases their quality. As low-quality interactions in the online environment prevail over higher-quality face-to-face interactions, the individual's satisfaction from social relationships also decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fumagalli et al., 2021)</ref>. Comparisons made in online environments and inability to meet expectations sufficiently also increase individuals' perception of loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barry et al., 2017)</ref>. Another reason why FoMO increases loneliness is that the desire to compete with other individuals that triggers FoMO weakens relatedness established with other individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Becker, Hartwich, &amp; Haslam, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Reagle, 2015)</ref>. It can be stated that adolescents who think that they are not liked enough in their social lives, that they are not accepted by others, and that they are left out of the enjoyment, generally try to fulfil their basic psychological needs in online environments. However, their intensive use of digital technologies can negatively affect adolescents' social lives. Intensive use of digital technologies can prevent even adolescents who are physically together from communicating with each other. Loneliness does not mean that there is no one around the individual. If the individual does not have the harmonious and satisfying social relationships he/she desires, he/she may feel lonely even in crowds. Therefore, it can be stated that the intensive use of the internet and social media in order not to fall behind others makes adolescents lonely. In addition, it can be said that eye-catching posts, especially on social media, decrease adolescents' life satisfaction and increase their feelings of loneliness at the same time. From time to time, feelings of envy and jealousy can be added to the thought of being left behind others. This situation may negatively affect adolescents' social relationships.</p><p>The current study concludes that social comparison predicts SWB in the positive direction in adolescents. This result can be evaluated in the context of adolescents' self-worth. Social comparisons are a determining factor on individuals' self-worth <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kağıtçıbaşı &amp; Cemalcılar, 2014)</ref>. Studies have reported that as individuals' self-worth increases, their SWB also increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Diener, Oishi, &amp; Lucas, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Du, King, &amp; Chi, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Eryılmaz, Şiraz, &amp; Yılbaş, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Villanueva, Prado-Gascó, Montoya-Castilla, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yang, Tian, Huebner, &amp; Xinxin, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wu, Cao, Lin, Zhou, &amp; Chi, 2022)</ref>. High self-worth supports individuals' ability to cope with problems, increases their life satisfaction and makes them feel positive emotions more. When positive emotions are felt and a high level of satisfaction with life is obtained, SWB also increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Diener &amp; Diener, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Diener, Oishi, &amp; Lucas, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Du et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Villanueva et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wu et al., 2022)</ref>. Adolescents generally make social comparisons in order to evaluate themselves objectively, improve themselves, establish healthy relationships with other individuals, and strengthen their self-worth. As a result of these evaluations, they acquire various ideas about themselves and their own lives. These ideas can be positive or negative. When adolescents compare themselves with their peers or other individuals, they may have positive or negative ideas about themselves and their lives. This may cause them to feel happy or unhappy. It can be stated that as adolescents' positive thoughts about themselves increase, their positive emotions and life satisfaction will increase and their SWB levels will increase positively.</p><p>The current study concludes that loneliness predicts SWB in the negative direction in adolescents. The results of this study are in parallel with the studies examining the relationship between loneliness and SWB in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Apaolaza et al,, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hombrados-Mendieta, García-Martín, &amp; Gómez-Jacinto, 2012)</ref>.

Therefore, it can be stated that when adolescents cannot establish harmonious and satisfying social relationships with their peers and other individuals, they experience negative emotions more and their SWB decreases.</p><p>In this study, it was determined that social comparison has a full mediating effect in the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adolescents. In the literature, there is no study examining the mediating effect of social comparison in the relationship between FoMO and SWB. However, there are various studies showing that both FoMO and social comparison are effective on SWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alt, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Milyavskaya et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Roberts &amp; David, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Stead &amp; Bibby, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wirtz et al., 2021)</ref>. The comparisons made by adolescents who use digital networks intensively in order to compete with other individuals and stay in contact with them cause them to feel inadequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Nesi &amp; Prinstein, 2015)</ref>. The low number of followers on social media or social networking sites, the thought that their posts are not liked enough by others, and the attractive posts made by the people they follow cause adolescents to think that they are behind other individuals they compete with, to feel negative emotions such as inadequacy and worthlessness, and to decrease their life satisfaction. It can be stated that this situation may also negatively affect adolescents' SWB.</p><p>In this study, it was determined that loneliness has a full mediating effect in the relationship between FoMO and SWB in adolescents. There are various studies revealing that FoMO is related to loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barry &amp; Wong, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fumagalli et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Uram &amp; Skalski, 2022)</ref>. Some studies have also found a negative relationship between loneliness and SWB in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Apaolaza et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hombrados-Mendieta et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Türkel &amp; Dilmaç, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Yurcu &amp; Kocakula, 2015)</ref>. FoMO is one of the main reasons for the intensive use of digital networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barry et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bekman, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dempsey et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>. Intensive use of digital networks in isolation negatively affects the social lives of individuals and makes individuals increasingly lonely <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Çakır &amp; Oğuz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fumagalli et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hunt et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Türkel &amp; Dilmaç, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Yiğit, 2019)</ref>. In addition, the desire to compete with others weakens the relatedness that adolescents establish with other individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Becker et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Reagle, 2015)</ref>. In this respect, it can be stated that competitiveness is one of the important reasons why adolescents become lonely. Loneliness can sometimes be a situation that individuals especially prefer. However, if it is not a preference for the individual, loneliness usually causes a decrease in the positive feelings of individuals. Establishing healthy relationships with other individuals is one of the basic psychological needs of individuals. Therefore, it can be stated that loneliness may cause adolescents to feel unhappy and sad, their life satisfaction may decrease because they cannot meet their basic psychological needs sufficiently, and this situation may lead to a decrease in their SWB.</p><p>FoMO has a negative effect on SWB among adolescents. Social comparison and loneliness mediate the relation between FoMO and SWB. These findings can establish a ground for psychoeducation studies for the sake of increasing SWB among adolescents. In this line, it would be helpful to plan some practices in the light of the current study findings in order to improve adolescents' communication and social skills. Studies aimed at increasing self-worth may also positively affect adolescents' SWB. The findings imply that it would be beneficial to design suitable interventions in order to prevent the fear of missing out among adolescents. The variables included in the current study can be examined in a further descriptive research. In the current study, adolescents' SWB was measured via the total scores they got from "Adolescent Subjective Well-Being Scale". The relations among the subdimensions of SWB in adolescents, which are satisfaction in the relation with family, positive emotions, life satisfaction and satisfaction in relations with important others, FoMO, social comparison and loneliness can be examined in another research.</p><p>Limitations: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the data collection study, data could be obtained mostly from students with internet access, as education in schools was carried out online, which reduces the generalisability of the results. </p></div>

Araştırmacılar internet, sosyal ağ siteleri ve sosyal medya gibi dijital teknolojilerin yoğun kullanımının temel nedeninin sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkusu (GKK) olduğunu ifade etmektedir <ref type="bibr">(Baker Vd., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beyens Vd., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Przybylski Vd., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>İnternet, sosyal ağ siteleri, sosyal medya ve akıllı telefonlar gibi dijital teknolojiler günümüzde ergenler tarafından sıklıkla kullanılmaktadır. Dijital teknolojilerin yoğun olarak kullanımı ise beraberinde GKK'yı getirmektedir. Bir sosyal kaygı türü olan ve diğerlerinden eksik kalmama arzusundan kaynaklanan GKK, aynı zamanda bireylerin fiziksel dünyada gideremedikleri temel psikolojik ihtiyaçlarını (yetkinlik, özerklik, ilişkili olma) çevrimiçi dünyada giderme çabalarının bir sonucudur <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kuss &amp; Griffiths, 2017)</ref>. Ergenler diğer bireylerle iletişim kurmak, özerklik ve ilişkili olma ihtiyaçlarını gidermek için internet, sosyal ağ siteleri ve sosyal medyayı yoğun olarak kullanmaktadır. Dijital teknolojilerin yoğun olarak kullanılmasının bir diğer nedeni yapılan paylaşımlara gelen olumlu geri bildirimler neticesinde onaylandıkları hissini yaşamak ve yetkinlik ihtiyaçlarını gidermektir <ref type="bibr">(Alutaybi Vd., 2020)</ref>. Bununla birlikte, internet, sosyal ağ siteleri ve sosyal medyanın izole ve yoğun bir biçimde kullanılması ergenlerin sosyal ilişkilerinin kalitesinin düşmesine ve yalnızlaşmalarına yol açmaktadır Yalnızlık ise ergenlerin öznel iyi oluşlarını negatif yönde etkilemektedir <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barry &amp; Wong 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fumagalli Vd.., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tu &amp; Zhang, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkusu ergenlerin kendilik değerlerini de olumsuz yönde etkilemektedir. Akranları ve diğerleri tarafından nasıl görüldüklerini bilmek ergenler için oldukça önemlidir. Bu noktada, ergenler kendi durumlarını değerlendirebilmek için sosyal karşılaştırmalar yapmaktadır. Önceleri genellikle yakın çevredeki bireylerle yapılan karşılaştırmalar, dijital teknolojilerinin kullanımının yaygınlaşmasıyla birlikte çevrimiçi ortamlara taşınmıştır <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Reagle, 2015)</ref>. Hem çevrimiçi hem de çevrimdışı dünyada yaptıkları sosyal karşılaştırmalar neticesinde diğerlerinin gerisinde kaldıklarını, yeterince takdir edilmediklerini ve gerekli sosyal desteği göremediklerini düşünmeleri ise ergenlerin hem öznel iyi oluşlarını hem de kendilik değerlerini düşürmektedir <ref type="bibr">(Reer Vd., 2019)</ref>. Bu noktadan hareketle, bu araştırmanın amacı ergenlerde sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkusu ile öznel iyi oluş (ÖİO) arasındaki ilişkide sosyal karşılaştırma ve yalnızlığın aracılık rollerinin incelenmesi olarak belirlenmiştir.</p><p>Yöntem: İlişkisel tarama desenindeki bu çalışmada GKK, sosyal karşılaştırma ve yalnızlığın ÖİO üzerindeki yordama güçlerini bir model çerçevesinde araştırmak amaçlanmıştır. Araştırmaya seçkisiz örnekleme yöntemlerinden olan oranlı tabakalı örnekleme yöntemi kullanılarak belirlenen, 505'i (%50,5) kız, 495'i (%49,5) erkek olmak üzere toplam 1000 lise öğrencisi katılmıştır. Araştırmada veri toplama aracı olarak kişisel bilgi formu, Ergen Öznel İyi Oluş Ölçeği, Eksik Kalma Korkusu Ölçeği, Sosyal Karşılaştırma Ölçeği ve UCLA Yalnızlık Ölçeği Kısa Formu kullanılmıştır.</p><p>Veri analizinde betimsel istatistikler, parametrik analiz teknikleri ve yol analizi kullanılmıştır. Betimsel istatistikler ile Pearson Momentler Çarpım Korelasyonu için SPSS.21 ve aracılık etkisinin incelendiği yol analizi için LISREL8.80 programlarından yararlanılmıştır.</p><p>Araştırma hipotezlerinin test edilmesinden önce veri setinin, yol analizi için gerekli sayıltı ve koşulları sağlayıp sağlamadığını incelenmiştir. Verilerin yol analizine uygunluğunu değerlendirmek için veri seti, kayıp veri, tek ve çok değişkenli uç değerler, tek ve çok değişkenli normallik ve çoklu doğrusal bağlantı sorunları açısından incelenmiş ve sonuçları rapor edilmiştir. Araştırma hipotezlerinin test edilmesi amacıyla yapısal eşitlik modellemesi (YEM); kestirim yöntemi olarak güçlü en çok olabilirlik (Maximum Likelihood Robust -MLR) kestirim yöntemi ve <ref type="bibr">Baron ve Kenny (1986)</ref> tarafından önerilen üç aşamalı aracılık modeli kullanılmıştır.</p><p>Bulgular: Hipotetik model test edilmeden önce, GKK ile ÖİO arasındaki ilişki, basit doğrusal regresyon analizi ile test edilmiştir. Analiz sonucunda GKK'nın, ÖİO'yu (β = .15, t = 4.59, p &lt;.01) anlamlı bir şekilde yordadığı belirlenmiştir. Yol analizi sonucunda değişkenler arası yolların tümünün anlamlı (p &lt;.01 ve p &lt;.05) olduğu ancak, modelin yeterli uyumu göstermediği belirlenmiştir. Bu aşamada, aracılık etkileri incelenen sosyal karşılaştırma ve yalnızlık değişkenlerine ayrı ayrı yer verilen, Model A ve Model B olarak adlandırılan iki farklı model oluşturulmuştur. Model oluşturulmasından sonra, modellerin tanımlı olup olmadığı sorusunun cevabı aranmış ve her iki modelin de tanımlı modeller olduğu (sd = 0) görülmüştür.</p><p>Model A'ya ait standardize edilmiş yol katsayıları incelendiğinde, GKK'nın ÖİO'yu (β = -.04, t = -1.29, p &gt;.01) ve aracı değişken olan sosyal karşılaştırmayı (β = -.21, t = -5.80, p &lt;.01) negatif yönde anlamlı bir şekilde yordadığı, sosyal karşılaştırmanın ise ÖİO'yu pozitif yönde anlamlı (β = .56, t = 19.18, p &lt;.01) anlamlı bir şekilde yordadığı belirlenmiştir. Sosyal karşılaştırma modele dahil edilmeden önce, GKK ile ÖİO arasındaki ilişkinin (β = .15, t = 4.59, p &lt;.01), sosyal karşılaştırma modele eklendikten sonra anlamsız hale geldiği (β = -.04, t = -1.29, p&gt;.01) belirlenmiştir. Bu bağlamda sosyal karşılaştırmanın GKK ve ÖİO arasındaki ilişkide tam aracılık etkisine sahip olduğu kabul edilmiştir.</p><p>Model B'ye ait standardize edilmiş yol katsayıları incelendiğinde, GKK'nın, ÖİO'yu negatif yönde anlamlı (β = -.04, t = -1.23, p &gt;.01) bir şekilde ve aracı değişken olan yalnızlığı ise pozitif yönde (β = .25, t = 7.82, p &lt;.01) yordadığı, yalnızlığın da ÖİO'yu negatif yönde anlamlı (β = -.46, t = -15.80, p &lt;.01) anlamlı bir şekilde yordadığı belirlenmiştir. Model uyum indeksleri incelendiğinde modelin yeterli uyumu gösterdiği ve tam tanımlı bir model elde edildiği belirlenmiştir. Aracı değişken olan sosyal karşılaştırma modele dahil edilmeden önce, bağımsız değişken olan GKK ile yordanan değişken olan ÖİO arasındaki ilişkinin (β = .15, t = 4.59, p &lt;.01), sosyal karşılaştırma modele eklendikten sonra anlamsız hale geldiği (β = -.04, t = -1.23, p&gt;.01) belirlenmiştir. Bu bağlamda yalnızlığın, GKK ve ÖİO arasındaki ilişkide tam aracılık etkisine sahip olduğu kabul edilmiştir. Elde edilen bulgulara göre; GKK ergenlerin öznel iyi oluşlarını negatif yönde yordamaktadır. Bu sonuç alan yazındaki çalışmalarla uyumludur <ref type="bibr">(Hunt Vd., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Milyavskaya Vd., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Roberts &amp; David, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Stead &amp; Bibby, 2017)</ref>. GKK olumsuz duyguları artırmaktadır. Dijital ağlarda yaptıkları paylaşımların beğenilmediğini düşünen ergenlerin yetersizlik ve değersizlik inançları artmaktadır. GKK nedeniyle diğerlerinin gerisinde kaldıklarını düşünmeleri ergenlerin yaşamlarına dair olumlu düşüncelerini azaltmakta ve yaşam doyumlarını da negatif yönde etkilemektedir.</p><p>Araştırmada ulaşılan bir diğer sonuç, ergenlerde GKK'nın sosyal karşılaştırmayı negatif yönde yordadığıdır. Bu sonuç alan yazındaki çalışmalarla uyumludur <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Yang, 2016)</ref>. GKK ergenlerin kendilik değerlerinin düşmesine neden olmaktadır. Aynı zamanda, diğer bireylerle ilişkili olma ve onlarla bağ kurma amacıyla dijital ağları kullanan ergenlerin, ihtiyaç doyumu algılarının azalmaması için sosyal karşılaştırmalardan kaçınabilecekleri de ifade edilebilir.</p><p>Bu araştırmada Ergenlerde GKK'nın yalnızlığı pozitif yönde yordadığı belirlenmiştir. Bu sonuç alan yazındaki çalışmaların sonuçları ile paralellik göstermektedir <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barry &amp; Wong, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fumagalli Vd., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Uram &amp; Skalski, 2022)</ref>. Dijital ağların yoğun kullanımı bireyin sosyal temas ve etkileşimlerinin miktarını artırabilse de kalitesini düşürmektedir. İzole bir biçimde dijital teknolojileri kullanmaları ergenlerin yalnızlık algılarını da artmaktadır.</p><p>Çalışmamızda ergenlerde sosyal karşılaştırmanın ÖİO'yu pozitif yönde yordadığı sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Sosyal karşılaştırmalar neticesinde benlik değerleri arttıkça ergenlerin öznel iyi oluşları da artabilir.</p><p>Yapılan bu araştırmada yalnızlığın ÖİO'yu negatif yönde yordadığı sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Yalnızlık ergenlerin olumsuz duyguları daha fazla hissetmelerine ve yaşam doyumlarının düşmesine yol açmaktadır.</p><p>Bu araştırmada ergenlerde GKK ile ÖİO arasındaki ilişkide sosyal karşılaştırmanın tam aracılık etkisinin olduğu belirlenmiştir Alan yazında GKK ile ÖİO arasındaki ilişkide sosyal karşılaştırmanın aracılık etkisinin incelendiği bir çalışmaya ulaşılamamıştır. Bununla birlikte GKK'nın sosyal karşılaştırmaya yol açtığı, özellikle yukarı yönlü sosyal karşılaştırmaların ise ÖİO'yu negatif yönde etkilediği ifade edilebilir.</p><p>Bu araştırmada ergenlerde GKK ile ÖİO arasındaki ilişkide yalnızlığın tam aracılık etkisinin olduğu belirlenmiştir. GKK'nın rekabetçi yapısının yalnızlığa yol açtığı, yalnızlığın ise ergenlerin olumsuz duyguları daha fazla yaşamlarına yol açıp ÖİO düzeylerini düşmesine yol açtığı ifade edilebilir.</p><p>GKK ergenlerin kendilik değerlerinin düşmesine ve yalnızlık düzeylerini artmasına neden olmaktadır. Bu durum ise ergenlerin öznel iyi oluşlarını negatif yönde etkilemektedir. Bu çalışmanın gerçekleştirildiği tarihlerde okullarda uzaktan eğitim uygulandığı için çoğunlukla internet erişimi olan öğrencilerden veri elde edilebilmiştir, bu da sonuçların genellenebilirliğini azaltmaktadır.</p><p>Öneriler: Sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkusunun ergenlerin öznel iyi oluşları üzerinde olumsuz bir etkisi vardır. GKK ve ÖİO arasındaki ilişkiye sosyal karşılaştırma ve yalnızlık aracılık etmektedir. Bu bulgular, ergenlerde öznel iyi oluşu artırmak adına psiko-eğitim çalışmalarına zemin hazırlayabilir. Bu doğrultuda ergenlerin iletişim ve sosyal becerilerini geliştirmek için mevcut araştırma bulguları ışığında bazı uygulamaların planlanması faydalı olacaktır. Kendilik değerini artırmaya yönelik çalışmalar da ergenlerin öznel iyi oluşlarını pozitif yönde etkileyebilir. Mevcut çalışmaya dahil edilen değişkenler daha sonraki bir betimsel araştırmada incelenebilir. Bu çalışmada ergenlerin öznel iyi oluşları, "Ergen Öznel İyi Oluş Ölçeği"nden aldıkları toplam puanlar üzerinden ölçülmüştür. Ergenlerde öznel iyi oluşun alt boyutları olan aile ile ilişkilerde doyum, olumlu duygular, yaşam doyumu ve önemli kişilerle ilişkilerde doyum, GKK, sosyal karşılaştırma ve yalnızlık arasındaki ilişkiler başka bir araştırmada incelenebilir.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The path analysis regarding model BStandardized path coefficients of Model B given in Figure5show that the independent variable, FoMO negatively predicted the dependent variable, SWB at a statistically significant level (β = -.04, t = -1.23, p &gt;.01), whereas it positively predicted the mediator, loneliness (β = .25, t = 7.82, p &lt;.01). It is also clear that loneliness negatively predicted SWB at a statistically significant level (β = -.46, t = -15.80, p &lt;.01). Starting from this point, it is possible to state that the second and third assumptions suggested by<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> were met. The model fit indices are as S-B 2 (0) = 0.00 (p = 1.00); RMSEA = .00, CFI = 1.00, TLI = 1.00 and SRMR = .00, which means that the model has the fit and well-defined. The model has R2 = .23 for SWB and R2 = .06 for loneliness. Lastly, the researchers found out that while the relation between the independent variable, FoMO and dependent variable, SWB (β = .15, t = 4.59, p &lt;.01) was statistically significant before the mediator, social comparison was included in the model, this relation turned out to be statistically insignificant when social comparison was included in the model (β = -.04, t = -1.23, p&gt;.01). In this context, the researchers concluded that the variable of social comparison had a full mediating effect on the relation between FoMO and SWB.</figDesc><graphic coords="9,111.57,185.11,400.34,94.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Bu amaç doğrultusunda araştırma betimsel araştırma modellerinden ilişkisel tarama modeline göre gerçekleştirilmiştir. Araştırmaya 1000 ergen (505 kadın ve 495 erkek) katılmıştır. Katılımcılar, seçkisiz/olasılıklı örnekleme yöntemlerinden olan tabakalı örnekleme yöntemi kullanılarak belirlenmiştir. Bu çalışmada her tabaka için, o tabakanın evren içindeki dağılım oranına bağlı olarak örnekleme eleman seçilmesini esas alan oranlı tabakalı örnekleme yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Araştırmada ölçme aracı olarak Eksik Kalma Korkusu Ölçeği, Ergen Öznel İyi Oluş Ölçeği, Sosyal Karşılaştırma Ölçeği ve UCLA Yalnızlık Ölçeği-Kısa Formu olmak üzere dört ölçek ve sosyodemografik sorulardan oluşan bir kişisel bilgi formu kullanılmıştır. Ergenlerde sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkusu ile öznel iyi oluş arasındaki ilişkide sosyal karşılaştırma ve yalnızlığın aracı rolünün olup olmadığı yapısal eşitlik modellemesi kullanılarak analiz edilmiştir. Veri analizlerinde Pearson momentler çarpım korelasyon analizi ve yapısal eşitlik modeli tekniklerinden biri olan yol analizi kullanılmıştır. Korelasyon analizi sonuçları, GKK, ÖİO, sosyal karşılaştırma ve yalnızlık arasında anlamlı bir ilişki olduğunu göstermiştir. Araştırma sonuçlarına göre ergenlerin sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkuları ile öznel iyi oluşları arasında negatif yönlü bir ilişki bulunmaktadır. Sonuçlara göre, ergenlerin sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkuları arttıkça öznel iyi oluş düzeyleri azalmaktadır. Ayrıca, araştırmada, ergenlerin gelişmeleri kaçırma korkuları düzeyi arttıkça benlik değerlerinin azaldığı ve yalnızlık düzeylerinin arttığı sonucuna da ulaşılmıştır. Path analizi sonuçları, ergenlerde GKK ve ÖİO arasındaki ilişkide sosyal karşılaştırmanın aracılık rolü olduğunu göstermiştir. Path analizi sonuçları, ergenlerde GKK ve ÖİO arasındaki ilişkide yalnızlığın da aracılık rolü olduğunu göstermiştir. Araştırma sonuçları, alanyazın ve daha önce gerçekleştirilmiş araştırmalar ışığında tartışılmış ve öneriler sunulmuştur.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Dr. Süleyman Çifçi</cell><cell>Prof.Dr. Hatice Kumcağız</cell></row><row><cell>Şehit Ebubeki Ekinci İlkokulu -Türkiye</cell><cell>Ondokuz Mayıs Üniversitesi -Türkiye</cell></row><row><cell>ORCID: 0000-0003-0979-6298</cell><cell>ORCID: 0000-0002-0165-3535</cell></row><row><cell>suleymancifci@gmail.com</cell><cell>haticek@omu.edu.tr</cell></row><row><cell>Özet</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>E-Uluslararası</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Eğitim Araştırmaları</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Dergisi</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Cilt: x, No: x, ss. x-x</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Araştırma Makalesi</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Gönderim: 2022-10-14</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Kabul: 2023-03-17</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Anahtar Kelimeler: Ergenlik, Sosyal ortamlarda gelişmeleri kaçırma korkusu, Öznel</cell></row><row><cell>iyi oluş, Sosyal karşılaştırma, Yalnızlık</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Önerilen Atıf</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Çifçi, S. &amp; Kumcağız, H.
