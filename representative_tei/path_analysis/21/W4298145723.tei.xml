<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>burn enthusiasm or it can also motivate to do the best, be motivated at work and form a work ethic to achieve the work done will be close to the desired goal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tasmara (2012)</ref> revealed that someone who has a high work ethic will try to improve the quality of his work so that his existence will always be maintained. Work ethic is closely related to one's work readiness because people who have a high work ethic will have better work readiness. Work ethic occurs from the perspective of someone who is positive about work, when positive feelings and thoughts arise, employees have high motivation, resulting in high performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buchori, 2012)</ref>. Another factor besides transformational leadership factors and work ethic is work motivation. Work motivation is an impulse that grows within a person, both from within and outside himself to do a job with high enthusiasm using all the abilities and skills he has which aims to get work results so as to achieve satisfaction in accordance with his wishes. Teachers with high work motivation can make it easier for work to be completed on time and within the allotted time. The work was done because of the motivation that drives it will make someone feel happy doing their job. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Danim (2014)</ref> stated that the characteristics of people who work with motivation can be seen from 1) Working according to standards; 2) Happy at work; 3) Feeling valuable; 4) Work hard; and 5) Little supervision. The correlation among these three factors are still under research particularly done in the setting of junior high schools. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the direct and indirect correlations of the principal transformational leadership, work ethic and work motivation on teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RESEARCH METHOD</head><p>This research is a correlational descriptive research. It aims to analyze the direct and indirect correlations of the principal transformational leadership, work ethic and work motivation on teacher performance. The population in this study were all teachers of SMPN (Sekolah Menengah Pertama Negeri) or State Junior High Schools in Banjarmasin Timur as many as 237 people. By using the Proportional Random Sampling technique, as many as 149 people were taken as the sample of this research study. Data were collected through teacher performance assessment instrument and transformational leadership instrument measured through idealistic influence, motivational inspiration, intellectual stimulation and individual considerations. Then, the instrument of work ethic was measured by being honest, sincere, empathetic, intelligent, visionary, synergistic, and responsible. Meanwhile, the instrument of teacher work motivation was measured through success, recognition, work, responsibility, development, policies, quality of supervision, interpersonal correlations, working conditions, and salary. The instrument was ensured to be free from validity and reliability problems. The data collected was analyzed by using path analysis to see direct and indirect correlations, by first testing normality, linearity, and homogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESEARCH FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Based on the findings of the assistance data with SPSS, the direct and indirect correlation coefficients were found as described below:  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> is a summary of the decisions of H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 with a significance value criterion of less than 0.05, then the hypotheses are accepted. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> is a summary of the decisions on hypothesis testing H6 and H7 provided that if the direct correlation coefficient is smaller than the indirect correlation coefficient, then the hypothesis is accepted.

In addition, transformational leaders also care about the problems faced by members of the organization and always provide motivation in order to improve performance so that job satisfaction will be created for members of the organization. The results of this study strengthen the results of previous studies, namely <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kumalasari, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dharmawan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ruslan, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Yanti, 2019)</ref> who stated that the principal transformational leadership had a positive effect on teacher work motivation. This study also strengthens previous research by <ref type="bibr">(Savitri,</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Direct correlation between Work Ethic and Work Motivation of State Junior High School Teachers in Banjarmasin Timur</head><p>The results of the path analysis show that the work ethic has a Beta value of 0.607 with a significance value of 0.000, which means that there is a direct effect of work ethic on the work motivation of the teachers of Junior High Schools in Banjarmasin Timur. Work ethic is shown in the form of behavior and attitude towards a job. Work ethic has a strong effect, where changes in work ethic can increase motivation towards more and lead to the ability of teachers to work as a team work. According to Mayer Hall <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Tasmara, 2012)</ref>, someone who has a high work ethic will try to improve the quality of his work so that his existence will always be maintained. Work ethic is closely related to one's work readiness because people who have a high work ethic will have better work readiness.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. There is a direct correlation between the principal transformational leadership and the teacher performance at the State Junior High Schools in Banjarmasin Timur</head><p>This study showed that the direct effect of the principal transformational leadership on the performance of teachers of Junior High Schools in Banjarmasin Timur. It has a Beta value of 0.527 with a significance value of 0.000. Thus, there is a direct effect of the principal transformational leadership on the performance of Junior High Schools teachers in Banjarmasin Timur. Transformational leadership is leadership associated with strong self-identification, the creation of a shared vision for the future and a correlation between leader and followers based on something more than rewarding obedience. Transformational leadership style is more flexible so that it can increase employee creativity and autonomy therefore, employee performance increases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rivai (2014)</ref> mentions that a person will become a leader if he has advantages over his followers. Basically the advantages that must be possessed by a leader include three things; first, the advantages of the ratio: are the advantages of using the mind, the advantages in knowledge of ways to move the organization, as well as in making quick and precise decisions; second, spiritual advantages, meaning that a leader must be able to show his nobility of character to his subordinates. A leader must have high morale because basically the leader is a role model for his/ her employees. All actions, deeds, attitudes and words should be a role model for his/ her subordinates in this case teachers; third, bodily advantages, namely a leader should have more physical health than his followers so as to enable him to act quickly. However, the problem of being overweight is not the main factor. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dharma (2015)</ref>, transformational leadership is a picture in an educational school environment that brings a person into his work in different types and levels of behavior. Competence determines the process aspects of the performance of a job. Leadership describes the correlation between leaders and those who are led and how a transformational leader directs those who are led will determine the extent to which performance goals are achieved. Sulaxono (2020) states that there is a link between transformational leadership and teacher performance. Wote &amp; Patalulu (2019) stated that transformational leadership style has an effect on performance. The results of this study strengthen previous research, namely <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Monoyasa et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Syafii et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nurhayati &amp; Sudarsyah, 2021)</ref> whose research results state that transformational leadership has an effect on performance. Based on some of the results of the research above, it shows that transformational leadership is able to mobilize all existing resources in schools so that they can be empowered to be used optimally to achieve the goals that have been set. The level of teacher performance depends on how the principal's ability to influence teacher behavior in carrying out their duties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. A direct correlation between work ethic and teacher performance at public junior high schools in Banjarmasin Timur</head><p>The results of the path analysis show that there is a direct effect of work ethic on the performance of teachers at the State Junior High Schools in Banjarmasin Timur. It has a Beta value of 0.598 with a significance value of 0.000, which means that there is a direct effect of work ethic on the performance of the State Junior High School teachers in Banjarmasin Timur. The essence of work must begin with a work ethic. If someone sees work as a noble thing for human existence, then his/ her work ethic will be positive. On the other hand, if you see work as meaningless for human needs, especially if there is not any view and attitude towards work, then the work ethic will naturally become negative. For example, in positive work behavior rooted in strong cooperation, and fundamental beliefs, accompanied by a total commitment to an integral work paradigm, work ethic makes employees able to describe an attitude. It contains meaning as an evaluative aspect that is owned by an individual or group to assess their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bawelle, 2016)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sinamo &amp; Siadari (2013)</ref>, work ethic can be interpreted as a concept about work or a work paradigm that is believed by a person or group of people to be good and right which is manifested through their typical work behavior. Santoso 2012) states that the work ethic describes all the characters of the members of the organization. Work ethic is a very important aspect in determining a person's behavior, including work behavior. Work ethic is the spirit that arises from the teacher's personality which becomes the driving force that causes a member of the organization to be willing and willing to direct his ability to carry out activities for which he is responsible. Teacher work ethic is related to performance as seen from the teacher having performance above the standard desired by the principal, willing to provide assistance to other teachers, always supports all activities in school related to school progress, willing to help, does not complain, and does not exaggerate problems. They are also expected to be kind and respectful to other teachers, help prevent a problem, and make troubleshooting steps. This is in accordance with the opinion of Echols <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Supardi, 2016)</ref> explaining that the developing human work ethic views individuals or groups (organizations) as good and bad through the quality of their performance. The results of this study support previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bakir, 2020)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Direct correlation between Work Motivation and Teacher Performance at a State Junior High School in East</head><p>Banjarmasin District The results of the path analysis showed that there is a direct effect of work motivation on the performance of the State Junior High School teachers in Banjarmasin Timur. It has a Beta value of 0.804 with a significance value of 0.000. Therefore, there is a direct influence of work motivation with the performance of the State Junior High School teachers in Banjarmasin Timur. High work motivation is able to support various changes and have a major impact on teacher performance. The motivation of a teacher is very influential on teacher performance because by having motivation, teachers will carry out the task as good as possible to produce high performance. A teacher who has work motivation will be able to improve his performance as expressed by Elliot <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Suriansyah &amp; Ferdiana, 2019)</ref> who explains that a teacher who has good performance tends to have high achievement motivation and has positive skills in doing assignments. The better the work motivation of teachers will increase or improve teacher performance. The results of this study strengthen previous research, namely <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hasturmadi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wahyudi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnawi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Theodora, 2015)</ref> whose research results prove that work motivation has a positive and significant effect on employee performance. Fauzyah (2020) also stated that teacher motivation has a significant effect on teacher teaching performance. The results of this study are in line with research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdullah et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hairina, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ridwan &amp; Dalle, 2018)</ref> stating that a teacher who has high motivation will be able to carry out his work optimally, and people who work optimally indicate that have a high level of motivation. high performance that affects the results to be achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Indirect correlation between Principal Transformational Leadership Through Work Motivation and Teacher</head><p>Performance at State Junior High Schools in Banjarmasin Timur The results of the analysis showed that the principal transformational leadership through work motivation and teacher performance has a value of 0.369. It means that indirectly the transformational leadership of the principal affects teacher performance through the work motivation of the teachers of the State Junior High School teachers in Banjarmasin Timur. Transformational leadership can change followers' awareness of problems by helping them look at old problems in new ways, and they are able to excite and inspire followers to put in extra effort to achieve group goals, and motivate organizational life. Giving encouragement as a form of work motivation to subordinates is important to improve teacher performance. Similar research study was conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ali (2020)</ref> entitled "The correlation between Principal Transformational Leadership and School Climate on Teacher Performance through Work Motivation of State Elementary School Teachers in Banjarmasin" the results of his/ her research are the indirect effect value was obtained from the path coefficient value y1x1 multiplied by the path coefficient</p><p>The Correlation between Principal Transformational Leadership, Work Ethic, And Work Motivation on Teacher Performance at State Junior High Schools In Banjarmasin Timur value ρy2y1 becomes (0.308 x 0.447) = 0.138. This shows that there is a correlation between transformational leadership variables through the intervening variable, namely work motivation in influencing teacher performance. Teachers who have good performance are characterized by teachers mastering the methods and subject matter being taught, having creativity in developing teaching materials and always trying or wanting to achieve achievements, being on time in starting and ending learning and having good communication and socializing skills with students and teachers. Scoll in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hartiti, 2013)</ref> mentions that one of the factors that influence teacher performance is the principal leadership and work motivation. The principal's attention to the needs of teachers is a manifestation of the principal transformational leadership, which is important to improve the professionalism and performance of teachers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Harris (2019)</ref> states that work motivation can be a catalyst in strengthening the correlation between transformational leadership and performance. Wahyudi (2019) stated that transformational leadership will have a greater influence on teacher performance by intervening teacher work motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Indirect correlation between Work Ethic through Work Motivation and Teacher Performance at State Junior High Schools in Banjarmasin Timur</head><p>The results of the analysis indicate that indirectly work ethic through work motivation with performance has a value of 0.331, which means that work ethic indirectly affects teacher performance through work motivation of teachers in Banjarmasin Timur. A high work ethic will increase motivation and increase one's performance for the better so that it will produce good performance as well. Tasmara (2012) said that "a new work ethic will arise only if someone really loves his job." Someone who loves his/ her job will work diligently, full of enthusiasm, and always happy. The work ethic of the teacher does not just produce performance if the teacher does not have work motivation on the teacher. Teachers who have work motivation will produce good performance as the ability of teachers to participate more in the organization must be supported by work motivation. Without being supported by motivation, it will not result in any job increase. As Buchori (2012) stated, work ethic occurs from the perspective of someone who is positive about work. When positive feelings and thoughts arise, employees will have high motivation and resulting in high performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>It can be concluded that there is a direct and indirect correlation between the principal transformational leadership, work ethic and work motivation on teacher performance. The principal should approach the teachers more personally. It aims to increase the ideal influence of the principal on the teachers who are on his/ her subordinates so that in the future the principal can motivate teachers easily.</p></div>
