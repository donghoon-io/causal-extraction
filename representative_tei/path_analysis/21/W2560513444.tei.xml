<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Repurchase intention towards products or services were considered as an important thing to a company. (Azize <ref type="bibr">Sahin, et.al., 2012)</ref>. The company itself, should gain not only the costumer but also the repurchase intention towards the consumers needed to the products. <ref type="bibr">(Tasya Rambitan, 2015)</ref>. Repurchase intention is important to a company, because the cost a company give to one costumer is cheaper than getting one new consumer (Euphemia FT Yuen, 2010). Another research told that repurchase intention is the main reason for some costumer to get along with the company for the things that company already offer <ref type="bibr">(Bitner et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bolton and Drew, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Boulding et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aron, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Voss et al, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Repurchase intention is one of problem for some company, because the competition between each company leading provider of services and products is growing in global world <ref type="bibr">(Ilias O. Pappas et.al., 2014)</ref>. One of the impact of globalization itself is people's lifestyle and the company used this as a way to developing the company itself <ref type="bibr">(Widjaja, 2010)</ref>. One of developing bussiness in this era is in beauty industry known as clinic skin care. The intense competition between them makes business growing up, with the growth in 2015 expected grow by 20 % (sumber : Majalah SWA).</p><p>Company that provides skin care services growing fast. So, the company should gain or at least maitain the costumer, but the differences between each company is the way company fulfilling the satisfaction of the costumer (Chaniotakis, IE and Lymperopoulos, C, 2009). If the costumer satisfied with the products or the services from the company, it will affect the intensity of costumer's behavior toward it, and it is possible to affect their needed to repurchase (Ali <ref type="bibr">Kazemi, et.al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rajbarian, et.al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dizaji, et.al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kaveh, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Sahin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sigit Haryono, et.al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The researches found the positive influence toward costumer's satisfaction and the needed to repurchase, the costumer's satisfaction basically is costumer's perception to evaluate what costumer's got as if they expected or not. <ref type="bibr">(Akbar, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdul Samad, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>One of factors to keep the costumer's needed to repurchase beside their satisfaction is the brand experience from the product itself (Yang et al., 2012; Choi and Kim 2013). The brand experience and satisfaction toward costumer will simultan affect to the needed to repurchasing some products or services from a company (Temporal, 2011:65).</p><p>Brand experience is built on the assumption that besides costumer's needed, they also had wants and desires. It is very important for the company to have brand experience in marketing practices. Brand experience influences brand costumer to a positive relation with the company. Another study found that brand experience and satisfaction provided by the company has a positive effect on repurchase intention for a brand, this makes an advantages for the company Sahin et al., (2011), Brakus dkk. (2009), Zarantenello dan Schmitt <ref type="bibr">(2000)</ref>. The value of brand experience significantly related to repurchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brakus et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Sahin et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to obtain answers from the problems mentioned above, that is, knowing the effect of brand experience to customer satisfaction, knowing the effect of brand experience to repurchase intention and determine the influence of customer satisfaction on repurchase intention in the Clinic Skin Care in Bandung II. LITERATURE REVIEW Marketing is a process of unified communication which provide information about the products or services in connection to fulfilling people's needed. Marketing begins with the fulfillment people's needs then grow as people's desire. Kotler dan Keller (2016:27).</p><p>Experiental marketing is a newly marketing methods, which introduced to marketing world by a Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands, oleh Bernd H. Schmitt. Schmitt (1999) which told us that the main concept of experiental marketing is marketing with management consist of experiences. This concept which developed by Bernd H. Schmitt was adopted from the experience economy concept given by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore.</p><p>Brand experience is an experience caused by the activity of consuming or using some particular brand. Positive brand experience will give the satisfaction to the consumer. Brakus Schmitt and Zarantonello (2009) told that brand experience defined as a sensation, cognition, and costumer's presumption toward the brand by the influence of the design, identity, marketing communication, and the circle where the brand marketed.</p><p>Brand Experience has recently been defined the marketing literature as the sensations, feelings, cognitions, and behavioral responses evoked by brand-related stimuli that are part of a brand's design and identity, packaging, communications, and environments. Brand Experience has been shown to have a significant effect on consumer perceptions of the brand and purchasing decisions Jason A. Gabisch and Kholekile L. Gwebu (2011).</p><p>Costumer's satisfaction is one aspect that determine the successes of marketing activities. Increasing of costumer will potentially lead to sales growth in long or short term, as well as market share as a result of the repurchase intention. Kotler and Amstrong (2014:37) defined costumer satisfaction as Customer Satisfaction is the extent to which a product's perceiverd performance matches a buyer's expectations. Customer Customer Satisfaction depends on the product's perceived performance falls short of expectation, the customer is dissatisfied. It performance matches expectations, the customer is satisfied. It performance exceeds expectations, the customer is highly satisfied or delighted.</p><p>Consumers make purchase decisions based on various factors such as psychological, cultural, personal, tangible and intangible aspects of products and services and stimuli variables which many establishments do not really understand. This makes establishments experience some difficulties in retaining customers because they do not understand the consumer's needs and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Korir, et al., (2012)</ref>.</p><p>Repurchase intention is the individual's judgement about buying again a designated service from the same company, taking into account his or her current situation and likely circumstances K. Hellier, (2013).</p><p>Repurchase Intentions simply refer to the likelihood of using a brand again in the future. Repurchase Intentions, willingness to pay a price premium, word-of-mouth, and complaining represent the five behavioral intentions. Behavioral intent, as the intention to act in the buying decision process, is considered by some authors as being intermediary between attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, appearing either as a predisposition to buy a brand for the first time or a commitment to repurchase a current brand, Sahin et.al., (2014).</p></div>
