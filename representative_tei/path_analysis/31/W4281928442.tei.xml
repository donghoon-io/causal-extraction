<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To support the Government's program to produce entrepreneurs, FTI UAD implements entrepreneurship education. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of entrepreneurial knowledge obtained from entrepreneurship education, either directly or through the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) component, in the form of attitudes and perceived behavioural control. The study was also to determine the effectiveness of TPB in describing the entrepreneurial intentions of FTI UAD students. The sample used was 205 undergraduate students who had taken entrepreneurship courses. Data was collected using a questionnaire. Data analysis used linear regression and path analysis. The results showed an indirect effect of entrepreneurial knowledge on entrepreneurial intentions through attitudes and perceived behavioural control. However, knowledge does not have a direct impact on entrepreneurial intentions. The study results prove that the TPB model to describe entrepreneurial intentions is quite good, with the magnitude of the coefficient of determination reaching 58.1%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>According to data from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), the Open Unemployment Rate as of February 2019 reached 5.01% of the participation rate of the Indonesian workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Glh/agi, 2019)</ref>. Unemployment among diploma graduates increased by 8.5%, while those among scholars increased by 25% <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pusparisa, 2019)</ref>. The Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education records that around 8.8% of Indonesia's total 7 million unemployed people are scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Seftiawan, 2018)</ref>. The high unemployment of tertiary graduates is since job vacancies in Indonesia do not require much higher education, such as in the trade and agriculture sectors, which absorb almost 50% of the 130 million workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Tejo, 2019)</ref>. The increase was due to a rise in population and workforce but was not accompanied by increased comparable employment. More scholars are oriented towards "looking for work," not as a creator of jobs.</p><p>Efforts that can be made to reduce the unemployment rate include promoting entrepreneurship. In 2011, the Government launched the National Entrepreneurship Movement. According to the Deputy Chairperson of the Lampung Industry Chamber of Commerce in the Domestic Trade Sector, the large number of unemployed graduates with a bachelor's degree makes the entrepreneurial curriculum based on higher education important <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cahaya, 2013)</ref>. Under these conditions, FTI UAD launched a faculty vision: "Becoming an internationally recognized leading faculty in technology-based on Islamic values and producing graduates with entrepreneurial spirit" <ref type="bibr">(UAD, n.d.)</ref>. For this reason, FTI UAD Yogyakarta has implemented entrepreneurship education. Entrepreneurship education applied in the fourth-semester lectures is divided into theory or learning in the classroom and entrepreneurial practice. The view is given in class for debriefing before students try to practice becoming entrepreneurs while practising Entrepreneurship is carried out through establishing small businesses managed by students in groups.</p><p>The entrepreneurship course's learning objectives are to raise lives to realize one of the FTI UAD missions: organizing academic programs in quality technology nationally and internationally and producing graduates with an entrepreneurial spirit <ref type="bibr">(UAD, n.d.)</ref>. With the emergence of this spirit and enthusiasm, students are expected to have an entrepreneurial interest that will encourage them to become entrepreneurs. According to Isrososiawan <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kusmintarti et al., 2017)</ref>, entrepreneurship education is a teaching and learning activity about entrepreneurship, including developing students' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and personal character. Fayolle said that entrepreneurship education includes all activities to foster an entrepreneurial mindset, beliefs, and abilities and cover various aspects such as idea creation, beginning, growth, and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kumar &amp; Singh, 2015)</ref>. Entrepreneurial education can also be interpreted as an effort planned and applicable to increase students' knowledge, intentions, and competencies to develop their potential by manifesting creative, innovative, and courageous behaviours in managing risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Suyitno, 2013)</ref>. Entrepreneurship education, not just knowledge, must be based on strengthening entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Buana et al., 2017)</ref>. Fatoki also recommends business and entrepreneurship education to increase entrepreneurial intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fatoki, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>We know the Theory of Planning Planning (TPB) in studying behaviour theory. The use of TPB in measuring entrepreneurial intentions is carried out in many studies, such as those <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andika1 &amp; Madjid, 2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Widayoko, 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Utami, 2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Papadimitriou, 2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kim-soon et al., 2016)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kautonen et al., 2015)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Usman &amp; Yennita, 2019)</ref>. In the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Ajzen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> discusses how one invokes intention. At the same time, intention influences by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The intention is assumed to encourage motivation that affects thinking, which replaces motivation to support it <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Students will measure where someone thinks positively or negatively about something, while subjective norms are individual perceptions about specific problems caused by others. Perceived behavioural control assesses one's understanding of certain behaviours' ease or difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sabah, 2016)</ref>. Perceived behavioural control as self-efficacy, belief in one's abilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kautonen et al. (2015)</ref> illustrate that TPB is a reasonably reliable behavioural model (stable) in understanding entrepreneurship. The study results refer to attitudes, subjective norms, and Perceived behavioural control resulting in 59% of search variations.</p><p>Other factors that can influence entrepreneurial intentions are factors in the context of entrepreneurship education, where entrepreneurship education is expected to foster the desires and preferences of students to become entrepreneurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Widayoko, 2016)</ref>. Gerba <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Utami, 2017)</ref> encourages entrepreneurship education as a conscious effort by individuals to increase knowledge about entrepreneurship. Thus, in the education process, knowledge becomes one of the things that students obtain. In the Linan model, knowledge about entrepreneurship can influence social norms and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Linan, 2014)</ref>. Research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariffin &amp; Ziyad, 2018)</ref> discusses entrepreneurship education related to entrepreneurial interest through self-efficacy, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adnyana &amp; Purnami, 2016)</ref> and (Utami 2017) compared entrepreneurship education that supports entrepreneurship efforts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Wirandana &amp; Hidayati, 2017)</ref> concluded that entrepreneurship education influences attitudes and perceived behavioural control.</p><p>This study aims to determine the effect of entrepreneurial knowledge on entrepreneurial intentions, either directly or through the attitude and perceived behavioural control variables. Knowledge is assumed to be obtained by students through the educational process by taking Entrepreneurship Courses. The study was also to determine the effectiveness of TPB in describing the entrepreneurial intentions of FTI UAD students. The model in this study adopts several thoughts generated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Linan (2014</ref><ref type="bibr">), Arifin &amp; Ziyad (2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adnyana &amp; Purnami, 2016)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">(Wirandana &amp; Hidayari, 2017)</ref> but is modified. TPB is used in this study because it is seen as a representative behavioural theory describing the emergence of intentions and behaviour. The research was conducted at the Faculty of Industrial Technology to get an idea of whether the knowledge gained from Entrepreneurship courses impacts entrepreneurial intentions, considering that one of the missions to be achieved is to form an entrepreneurial spirit in graduates. In addition, FTI is an exact department, where generally, students only study science and technology. However, creating entrepreneurs makes this research necessary to know how the knowledge taught impacts intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head><p>This study uses multiple linear regression methods to see the effect of independent variables, including knowledge, attitudes, perceived behavioural control (PBC), and subjective norms (SN), on the response or dependent variables in the form of entrepreneurial intentions. Simultaneously, path analysis used path analysis to see the indirect effect of knowledge on intentions through perceived behavioural control and entrepreneurial attitudes. The research hypotheses are: 1. H1: Entrepreneurial knowledge has a positive impact on attitude 2. H2: Entrepreneurial knowledge has a positive effect on perceived behavioural control 3. H3: Attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms simultaneously influence entrepreneurial intentions 4. H4: Entrepreneurial knowledge influences entrepreneurial intention 5. H5: Knowledge, attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms simultaneously and significantly affect entrepreneurial intention 6.

H7: Entrepreneurial knowledge influences intention through perceived behavioural control variables The research model can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> The Conceptual Research Model Data collection was carried out using a questionnaire with a Likert scale of 1-5 (strongly disagreestrongly agree). The objective of this research is FTI UAD Yogyakarta 6th semester students who have taken entrepreneurship education. The individual population is 437 students, so based on the Krecjie table, the significant value used is 0.05, so the sample used is 205. The number of respondents in each study program can be seen in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The indicators of each variable can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The results of the validity and reliability test of the questionnaire are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. No Indicator Variable: knowledge Entrepreneurs are people who can manage a business and dare to take all risks to create business opportunities. Business activities aim to make a profit by providing the needs of goods and services. Four forms of capital must be possessed to start a business, namely self-motivation, skills, relationships, and funds. Someone with lots of money but little motivation, relationships, and skills will find it easy to start and develop a business. In the business world, the ability to think creatively is not necessary. A target market is a group of consumers who target the company's approach to buying the product being sold. The elements of the marketing mix are product, distribution, promotion, and price. In running a business, business ethics is essential to maintain business continuity in the long term. Business ethics includes the relationship between the company and people who invest their money in the company, with consumers, employees, creditors, and competitors. 10 An entrepreneur is a determinant of risk and a risk bearer.</p><p>Variable: attitude Being an entrepreneur is more promising for me. Being an entrepreneur will give me tremendous satisfaction. I hope to become an entrepreneur It is exciting for me to be an entrepreneur. If I have the opportunities and resources, I would be happy to start a business. Among the various options, I prefer to be an entrepreneur. If I became an entrepreneur, I would stop running the company when I incurred a loss.</p><p>Variable: perceived behavioural control If I wanted to, I could quickly become an entrepreneur. I feel that I can manage human resources. I have the mental maturity to start a business. I have a strong belief in starting a business. I can start entrepreneurship. I believe I can be successful in developing new businesses. I am confident that I can do a market analysis to start a new business. I think I can achieve the goals and objectives associated with a new business venture. I feel capable of formulating a series of actions in pursuit of a business opportunity.</p><p>Reni Dwi Astuti, Laelati Fatimah / Adopting Planned Behavior Theory to Investigate the Effect of Entrepreneurship Education on Students' Entrepreneurial Intention 10 I feel able to identify and build a management team to grow the business. 11 I believe in developing business relationships with influential people to help my business.</p><p>Variable: subjective norms My family members support me to pursue a career as an entrepreneur. My friends help that I can have a career as an entrepreneur. My lecturers support me to open my own business. The people I consider essential support me to become entrepreneurial. Successful entrepreneurs gave me the confidence and encouragement to become an entrepreneur.</p><p>Variable: intention I prefer entrepreneurship over working with other people. I chose a career as an entrepreneur. I do business planning to start my own business. I want to increase my social status or self-esteem as an entrepreneur.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings</head><p>The amount of data collected was 205. Data processing was carried out using SPSS 20.0. The average score of respondents' assessment results for each variable is in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The data processing results using linear regression and the coefficient of determination that shows the effect of knowledge on attitudes and perceived behavioural control are shown in Table <ref type="table">5, Table 6,  Table 7,</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 8</ref> Knowledge also has no significant effect on intentions by eliminating subjective norms variables, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">16</ref>. Therefore an analysis of the indirect impact of knowledge is done through attitudes and perceived behavioural control using path analysis as in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.  <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the influence of attitude and perceived behavioural control variables as intervening variables of knowledge on intention can be determined. The indirect effect of knowledge on intention through attitude is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑝 2 𝑝 3 = 0,285.0,663 = 0,189</formula><p>The standard error of the indirect effect coefficient Sp2p3 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑆 𝑝2𝑝3 = √𝑝3 2 + 𝑆 𝑝2 2 + 𝑝2 2 𝑆 𝑝3 2 + 𝑆 𝑝2 2 𝑆 𝑝3 2 = 0,665</formula><p>Mediation effect value, tstat is: Tstat value is smaller than Z0, 05, which is 1.96, so it can be concluded that the knowledge variable significantly influences the intention variable through attitude; in other words, hypothesis 6 is accepted.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑡 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡 = 𝑝2𝑝3 𝑆 𝑝2𝑝3 = 0,</formula><p>The indirect effect of knowledge on intentions through perceived behavioural control:</p><p>𝑝 4 𝑝 5 = 0,265.0,375 = 0,099</p><p>Standard error dari koefisien indirect effect (Sp4p5) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑆 𝑝4𝑝5 = √𝑝5 2 + 𝑆 𝑝4 2 + 𝑝4 2 𝑆 𝑝5 2 + 𝑆 𝑝4 2 𝑆 𝑝5 2 = 0,382</formula><p>Mediation effect tstat value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑡 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡 = 𝑝4𝑝5 𝑆 𝑝4𝑝5 = 0,265.0,375 0,382 = 0,260</formula><p>The value of tstat smaller finger Z0,05 is 1.96, so it can be concluded that the knowledge variable significantly influences the intention variable through perceived behavioural control. Thus hypothesis 7 is accepted. A summary of the analysis results of the indirect effect of knowledge can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">17</ref>. Based on Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the influence of attitude and perceived behavioural control variables as intervening variables of knowledge on intention can be determined. The indirect effect of knowledge on intention through attitude:</p><p>𝑝 4 𝑝 5 = 0,265.0,375 = 0,099</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In general, 6th-semester students' entrepreneurship intentions are high, with an average score of 3.8. Knowledge about entrepreneurship, attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms also show a high score, approaching four, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The study results prove that the TPB model to describe entrepreneurial intentions is quite good, with the magnitude of the coefficient of determination reaching 58.1%. From several previous studies, the coefficient of determination for similar studies only ranged from 30-45%, while education <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kautonen et al., 2015)</ref> alone showed 59%. The coefficient of determination obtained from this study shows that the three TPB components together explain 58.1% of the variance in intention. Each independent variable in the TPB also has a significant partial effect, as shown in Table <ref type="table">10</ref>. The study <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Rajh et al., 2016)</ref> also indicates that TPB's three components significantly influence entrepreneurial intentions. <ref type="bibr">Rajh et al. added</ref> several variables to the survey: locus of control, perceived obstacles, perceived obstacles, and courage to take risks, but all of these additional variables significantly influenced intention. Whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jaya &amp; Seminari, 2016)</ref> concluded that each part affects the entrepreneurial intentions of SMKN students in Bali. Besides, attitudes, subjective norms, and selfefficacy form a variance of entrepreneurial intentions of 73.8%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sabah, 2016)</ref> equates self-efficacy with perceived behavioural control. Research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sabah, 2016)</ref> produces a coefficient of determination of 45.7%. Sabah added that the experience pioneering start-up variable was a variable that influenced attitudes and self-efficacy.</p><p>When the knowledge variable is added to the TPB model, it turns out that knowledge partially does not have a significant direct effect on intention. Although knowledge directly influences intention in the knowledge-intention regression model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref>), the addition of the three TPB variables makes knowledge not significant enough to influence intention directly. But, when testing the indirect effect of knowledge, it is known that knowledge significantly affects good intentions through attitudes and perceived behavioural control. The knowledge here is assumed to result from entrepreneurship education at FTI UAD. The statement items contained in the questionnaire are essential points that become the learning objectives of the Entrepreneurship course. Thus it can be said that entrepreneurship education influences intention through attitudes and perceived behavioural control. It is in line with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Linan, 2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Buana et al., 2017)</ref>, which show that entrepreneurship education influences intention through attitude and self-efficacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kusmintarti et al., 2017</ref>) also said that knowledge influences intentions through attitudes, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Primandaru &amp; Adriyani, 2019)</ref> concluded that self-efficacy becomes an intervening variable of entrepreneurship education towards intention. In the research <ref type="bibr">(Wirandana &amp; Hidayari, 2017)</ref>, entrepreneurship education significantly influences attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms, but only attitudes significantly affect intention among these three TPB components.</p><p>From the magnitude of the regression coefficient, attitude is the variable with the most significant influence on intention, followed by perceived behavioural control and subjective norms, as shown in Tables <ref type="table">10</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">14</ref>. The knowledge students can be obtained from the learning process in the Entrepreneurship course. Knowledge will be secure when there is an imprint learning process, including the practice of entrepreneurship. The interviews with several students illustrate that the exercise is undertaken by students more inclined to like to be entrepreneurial or, in other words, reinforce their attitudes. Besides, the practice carried out makes students more confident to start a business, increasing their perceived behavioural control. Improving the quality of learning in this subject is possible to improve attitudes and perceived behavioural control, impacting increasing entrepreneurial intentions. Some entrepreneurship learning models can be added, such as presenting practitioners, playing videos of entrepreneurs' success stories, or presenting mentors, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fatoki, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on data analysis, it can be concluded that knowledge influences attitudes and perceived behavioural control. These two components of TPB are significant intervening variables influencing knowledge on intention. All TPB components have a substantial effect on entrepreneurial intentions. So, increasing student intentions, attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms can be improved. The attitude and perceived behavioural control can be enhanced by improving the quality of learning, while subjective norms can be given by continuing to motivate students to become entrepreneurs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="3,99.65,536.81,395.30,146.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Based on Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, it can be concluded that hypothesis 1 is accepted, meaning that knowledge has a positive and significant effect on attitude with a regression coefficient of 0.37 and a determination of 13.6%. While Table <ref type="table">7</ref> and Table <ref type="table">8</ref> show that hypothesis 2 is accepted, knowledge has a positive and significant effect on perceived behavioural control with a regression coefficient of 0.26. Still, the coefficient of determination is only 6.8%.</p><p>Next, an analysis of the TPB model is carried out where the output can be seen in Table <ref type="table">9</ref>, Table <ref type="table">10,</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 11</ref>   <ref type="table">10</ref>, it can be concluded that the three independent variables, namely attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms, respectively, have a positive and significant effect on intention. From Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, it is known that the coefficient of determination of the TPB model is 58.1%; in other words, attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms together form an intention variance of 58.1%.</p><p>Then analyzed, the effect of knowledge on intention directly. The output of data processing knowledge on purpose is in Table <ref type="table">12</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 13</ref> Based on Table <ref type="table">12</ref>, we know that knowledge has a positive and significant effect on intention or that hypothesis 4 is accepted. The coefficient of determination of knowledge of intention is 13.6% (Table <ref type="table">13</ref>). However, when the knowledge variable was added to the TPB model, even though the model was significantly based on the F-test, as shown in Table <ref type="table">15</ref>, the knowledge did not substantially influence intentions, as shown in Table <ref type="table">14</ref>. At the same time, all TPB components remained significantly influential. Table <ref type="table">15</ref> shows that hypothesis 5 was accepted. </p></div>			</div>
