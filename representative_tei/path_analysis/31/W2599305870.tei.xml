<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The research reported in this work provides one of the first empirical examinations of politically successful Public/Private Partnership In Education. As such, this research builds a theoretical model of political success and then empirically tests it against data from a national survey. In building and testing this model, this work employs a mixed research program of qualitative and quantitative methodologies. In-depth telephone interviews with select stakeholders from two case study cities build the context of the work and lead to the development and clarification of the relevant research concepts. These qualitative data are supported with quantitative data collected via a mail survey from a national sample of stakeholders participating in Public/Private Partnerships In Education. These survey data are subjected to a Structural Equation Model (SEM) path analysis based on multivariate regression techniques. The findings support many of the hypothesized pathways and demonstrate the importance of goal formation, goal attainment, and leadership to the success of partnerships in education. As one of the first empirical models of partnership success coming from the policy sciences, this work contributes to the literature by combining the elements of theoretical abstraction with empirical rigor.</p><p>This research concludes with implications drawn from the findings and then makes some recommendations for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>come to the forefront of state and local agendas as well. It seems that federal projections made in the early 1980s have come true. Over two decades ago, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (U.S. HUD, 1980) Urban Land Institute projected that public/private partnerships would use public and private resources to their fullest advantage by gaining the involvement of the business community, foundations, other private entities, and federal agencies (p. 20). In addition, this type of leveraging was not projected to be isolated to any one specific activity, nor at any single level of government. As the report stated: Judging from recent events, higher levels of public/private activity can be projected for the coming decade. For example, major business communities at the local level…have begun to…work closely with municipal, state, and federal agencies. Long established downtown business promotion organizations have become sophisticated in the areas of housing, public education, and crime abatement (HUD, 1980, p. 5).</p><p>In the 1990s, the term partnership became almost synonymous with many functions of public education. As the role and scope of business and industry involvement in public education has grown, the diversity level of activities has also grown. Jacqueline Danzberger, writing for the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, states:</p><p>Over the last several years, educational partnerships have proliferated across the country. Some have developed in response to legislation. Others have become vehicles for fundamental educational reform. Still others have delivered services to students and faculty to improve education or student outcomes, whether or not schools are attempting systemic changes. Partners undertaking joint endeavors with schools also vary greatly. Partnership relationships are built among schools and social service agencies, cultural institutions, businesses, industries, and institutions of higher education <ref type="bibr">(Danzberger, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Along with these high levels of partnership activity, administrators, practitioners, and scholars have kept pace by documenting, categorizing, and, most recently, evaluating various forms of Public/Private Partnerships in Education. In fact, for more than twenty years a body of literature has been accumulating on partnerships in education. According to <ref type="bibr">Callahan (1995)</ref> this literature is comprised of articles and studies that: i. Provide guidance on how to establish partnerships ii. Discusses the most common categories and types of partnerships iii. Showcases individual partnerships that are particularly successful, and iv. Address the issue of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of various partnerships (Callahan, p. 1).</p><p>Clearly, partnerships have become the subjects of interest to a large and diverse audience.</p><p>Indeed, the interest level is so high that the federal government has taken a strong lead in This act created The Educational Partnerships Program (EPP) which: …stimulated the creation of educational partnerships to demonstrate their contribution to educational reform. The EPP was administered by the Educational Networks Division, Programs for the Improvement of Practice, Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI). The authorizing legislation required documenting the partnerships that received assistance, assessing their impact on educational institutions, evaluating the extent to which they improved their communities' climate for support of education, and identifying promising activities (http//www.ed.gov/pubs/Partners/case2.html/August 14, 1998).</p><p>In addition to funding partnership activity, the Federal government publishes numerous documents aimed at helping stakeholders formulate and implement Public/Private Partnerships in Education. One such document (<ref type="url" target="http://www.ed.gov/pubs/PromPract/prom2.html">http://www.ed.gov/pubs/PromPract/prom2.html</ref>) is of particular interest to this research. It outlines a set of guidelines for building partnerships and details a common set of activities typical of partnerships in education. This work is representative of much of the literature in Public/Private Partnerships in Education and demonstrates two weaknesses in this growing field. Although these weaknesses are different in their application, at their core is a common reference point that serves as the foundation of this research. This focus is the notion of partnership success.</p><p>Thus, the first weakness in the partnership literature is a lack of theoretical sophistication in building a formal model of success. There are many works that detail the "hows" of partnerships <ref type="bibr">(Danzberger and Gruskin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grobe, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rigden, 1991)</ref>, but they fail to sufficiently tie their enumerations to a solid theoretical foundation. Similarly, researchers <ref type="bibr">(Danzberg and Gruskin, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Otterbourg, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tushnet, 1993)</ref> have recently become concerned with the rigorous evaluation of partnerships, however, the evaluation emphasis has been on educational outcomes and/or the partnership process, rather than on the success of the process. The critical assumption of this research is that this focus on outcomes and process in evaluation is an inherent weakness in being able to fully understand the dynamic of partnerships ---and partnership making.</p><p>This research is designed to fill the gap in the literature left by these two weaknesses by building a model of partnership success. In this effort, the following format will be followed.</p><p>Following this brief introduction, a history of Public/Private Partnerships in Education will be detailed. The goals of this research will then be presented, put into context, and the limitations addressed. To conclude this introductory section, the purpose of the study will be formalized and the research questions enumerated.</p><p>A review of the literature will then be offered to build the context and scope of the field.</p><p>Following the literature review, the methodology employed in data collection will be discussed.</p><p>Next, the findings from the data analysis will be presented for consideration, and finally concluding remarks will be made. To begin, then, a brief history is now presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History Of Public/Private Partnerships (in Education)</head><p>The history of public/private partnerships is by no means restricted to the field of education. Public/private partnerships have existed for three decades in housing, crime prevention, local economic development, and in the provision of social services. However, since the early 1980s heavy resources have been committed to improving and increasing the number of partnerships targeting economic development, social services and education. In addition, education has often been implicitly addressed via targeted opportunities in economic development and the social services. More recently, this implicit linkage has been brought to the forefront of discussions addressing serious urban problems. Indeed, at a recent Ohio Urban University Program (UUP, 1998) conference the argument was made, and supporting data presented, that many of the social barriers to the economic revitalization of (Ohio's) urban regions are directly linked to public education and the lack of a skilled work force.</p><p>Although there are a great number of, and a large variation in, the specific reasons for targeting education, in their basic foundation most reasons can be identified to fit into one of two categories. Hence, to some stakeholders, a skilled work force is a mandatory factor of production in an efficient economy. The education and training of students makes business competitive in a global economy and, after all, paraphrasing the famous quote, "what's good for business and industry is good for the country." Similarly, others view education as a means to insure a healthy democratic society. Through education, children are socialized into political participation and become informed about the issues. Even though, beginning in the 1980s, the emphasis has shifted to favor the former rationale; this work makes no normative claims about the various motivations for participation in Public/Private Partnerships in Education.</p><p>These claims and interests in education are by no means new. Throughout our nation's history, business has often taken an active role in public education. Business has been linked to education since the late 1800s, as rapid industrial change required education to meet the needs of the work force through the creation of new programs and institutions <ref type="bibr">(Grobe, 1993, p. 3)</ref>. This involvement grew as business took a more active role in public education. As Timpane notes "For the first half of this century, industry in America was a strong force behind the movement for universal schooling and for vocational education (Timpane, 1991, p. 1)." School boards around the nation in communities of all sizes were predominantly comprised of local businessmen. In addition, civic clubs hosted events and charity drives to help out their local schools. However, this interest started to wane in the 1960s and had all but disappeared from the public education scene by the 1970s (Timpane, 1991). There were several reasons for why this withdrawal from public education occurred.</p><p>As the costs associated with participation in public school systems increased, business involvement declined through the 1960s and 1970s. As new stakeholders came to the forefront to address issues of equity and due process in public education, power shifted from school boards, traditionally comprised of individuals from business, to teacher organizations, community groups, advocates, and state and federal judges. Business people withdrew from deliberations concerning issues of bussing, desegregation, and school violence; issues which were new and frustrating to business people. As business interests withdrew, their influence over educators, and the public education process, dissipated (Timpane, 1991, p.1). However, as these problems started to impact society in general, and the labor market specifically, business was forced to take another look at public education.</p><p>From 1980 to 1990 "…the number of high school graduates would decline by 20 percent… <ref type="bibr">(Timpane, 1991, p. 3)</ref>." This decline was a symptom of a more serious problem endemic to the economy. Not only was the labor pool shrinking, but the percent of qualified workers, those with basic technical skills, was also decreasing. Business was faced with supply side labor problems at the same time the economy was growing and global competition was increasing. According to Timpane (1991) it was these supply side pressures, more than any other factor, that led to a renewed interest in public schools on the part of business (Timpane, 1991, p. 3).</p><p>Business started coming back into the fold in the early 1980s as education once again took the forefront of the national agenda with heavy hits from reports like "A Nation At Risk" <ref type="bibr">(1983)</ref>. This report, published by the U.S. Department of Education's National Commission on Excellence in Education, showed the critical need for reform in public education. In addition, federal policy was not sufficient to handle the crisis and state and local governments were even less prepared. It was an opportune time for business to step back into the arena.</p><p>Nationally, business was quick and deliberate in once again showing an interest in public education. One report shows that "Between 1983-84 and 1987-88, the number of business/education partnerships rose from 42,200 to 140,800. More than 9 million students ---24 percent of public school students ---were directly involved in education partnerships <ref type="bibr">(Grobe, 1993, p. 4)</ref>." This great call-to-arms however, did not produce uniform activities, nor did it guarantee systemic change, improved performance, continued involvement, or partnership success.</p><p>This discussion now turns to types of partnership activity that exists and begins laying the context for the process of detailing a model of partnership success.</p><p>The business agenda of the 1980s produced three types of education initiatives:</p><p>(1) improving educational quality by raising standards for students, teachers, and schools and focusing on accountability;</p><p>(2) restructuring schools as places of work and teaching as a profession; and most recently (3) focusing on the educational and social service needs of at-risk children through the provision of early childhood programs and greater coordination between educational and social services (Timpane, 1991, p. X).</p><p>There is also a large degree of diversity in how business and education go about implementing those initiatives, and the levels of involvement that exists. According to Timpane, (1991) there are four stages of business involvement. At the most fundamental level there are helping-hand relationships where business provides tangible goods and services, followed by programmatic initiatives in which business attempts to change one building or a specific program. Moving towards more complex involvement, there are compacts and collaborative efforts are where business provides a community wide umbrella for a wide range of schoolbusiness and school-community activities and pressure for district wide reforms. The most involved type of relationship is the policy change relationship where business leaders and organizations are active participants in developing a vast array of new policies, especially at the state level (Timpane, 1991, p. 9).</p><p>Through these initiatives and their various levels of associated involvement, business and industry's educational partnerships have evolved over time to meet the changing needs of not only education, but also society as a whole. In a document prepared for the Educational Partnerships Study Group, Education Resources Group <ref type="bibr">(ERG, 1991)</ref> suggests that alliances may be formed for four basic purposes:</p><p>1. to apply the resources of the private and nonprofit sectors of the community to the needs of the elementary and secondary schools or the institutions of higher education in that community to encourage excellence in education;</p><p>2. to encourage businesses to work with educationally disadvantaged students and with gifted students; 3. to apply the resources of communities for the improvement of elementary and secondary education or higher education; and 4. to enrich the career awareness of secondary or post-secondary school students and provide exposures to the work of the private sector (ERG, 1991, p. 2).</p><p>Furthermore, of the 18 projects ERG (1991) considered when recommending evaluation options, the following characteristics were highlighted in their report:</p><p>• Half the projects will be carried out at the school level, including one that is statewide and one that is regional in scope. • Levels of schooling addressed by the project are mixed. For example, while five are at the secondary school level, four cover k to 12. • The variety of partners is rich: five projects include the private, university, community, and parents sectors, four involve businesses primarily, and the remaining half include one or two of these sectors. • Eight projects target disadvantaged, at-risk students, and four will work with both at-risk and gifted students. Six will serve 'all' students in the school, district, or state. • Half the projects will focus on career awareness/work experience activities. Ten plan some form of staff development. Eleven will include tutoring, mentoring, internships, and/or volunteer work. (These were key program purposes or recommended activities). • About a third are focusing on math/science and/or technology as a theme <ref type="bibr">(ERG, 1991, p. 4)</ref>.</p><p>Given the complexity and diversity of Public/Private Partnerships in Education, and the aforementioned weaknesses in the corresponding literature, the task of this research becomes one of building a model of partnership success that is capable of generalizing across multiple dimensions. To this end, this discussion now turns to detailing an intellectual framework of analysis and describing where this research fits with existing knowledge.</p><p>Hence, this work fits thematically with Otterbourg's (1986) work of over 14 years ago and it accepts the importance of expectations and her reasons for supporting partnerships as axiomatic.</p><p>Otterbourg <ref type="bibr">(1986)</ref> writes about the support that partnerships bring to the educational environment: "Partnerships will not pay for teachers or maintenance of buildings. However, alliances can stimulate and support staff development, enrichment programs, basic skills projects…and many other programmatic efforts…(p. 3)." Another reason to support partnerships is the development of "Political Allies" that "…can prove to be formidable [support in counteracting] negativism and criticism…(p. 4)." It is within the realm of these two critical political arenas that this work is developed. The politics of forming, implementing and sustaining Public/Private Partnerships in Education is more critical today than in 1986.</p><p>In support of stressing the importance of political viability, over outcomes or process, as a research goal, Timpane (1991) has articulated that an important emphasis of business involvement should be to continue its involvement. "It has taken a decade for business communities ---local, state, and national ---to arrive at a stable, comprehensive view of the problems they and education face and the roles they can play in improving the schools <ref type="bibr">(Timpane, 1991, p. 35)</ref>."</p><p>But the level of business and education involvement in a specific partnership, and the degree to which that partnership addresses a variety of social problems are critical factors that must be addressed. Thus, although the number of partnerships across the country have grown over time, and the use of the term partnership is being used much more than it was twenty years ago, the level of understanding of the true relevance and importance of partnerships has not grown accordingly.</p><p>Where the term partnership was once used sparingly, and authors struggled to define it, a task that was never quite achieved, it now seems as though every form of collaboration, sharing of resources and division of power is labeled a "partnership." However, this work gives a very specific meaning to the concept of partnership and relates why true partnerships in education are of vital importance to the educational system, and, indeed, the country. This detailed definition, and its relevance to this research will be addressed in greater detail in the literature review section of this work. At this point, however, the task is to articulate some comments about partnerships in general to demonstrate the importance of this research.</p><p>As an important caveat to this work, it must be clearly stated that there are many forms and degrees of partnering that are ongoing across the country. This research is concerned with all types, degrees, and systemic levels in building a general model of success, but it does reflect an implicit value assumption. Thus, this research is more concerned about partnerships that attempt to make systemic changes in the educational environment, rather than providing mere token resources, i.e. equipment, after school experiences, and teacher externships, to single buildings.</p><p>In addition, the underlying assumption is that, in the current sociopolitical climate, partnerships that take a broad view of their environment are more likely to address systemic problems. Many partnerships only address Vo-Tech or School-To-Work issues while broader social problems plague their community. Problems like teen pregnancy; drug use; child neglect and abuse; adult illiteracy; hunger and housing are all issues that must be addressed by partnerships if true change is ever to occur.</p><p>It is almost impossible for schools to educate children when faced with such problems. However, it is not just the educators who are limited by facing these troubling issues, but it is also the limited ability of the children living in crisis. As one national report argued:</p><p>The deeply troubling circumstances of many children's lives limit their ability to learn…[problems that must be dealt with include]…poverty, neglect, child abuse, racism, drug and alcohol abuse, depression, and teen pregnancy-before any real teaching can take place (National Education Association, 1985, p. 1).</p><p>At this stage of partnership efficacy, the horse must remain in front of the cart. Partnerships must be formed and maintained while bringing about systemic change.</p><p>There are two arguments that must now be delineated. The first is that through defining partnership success in political terms, i.e., viability, the horse stays in front of the cart. Second, that partnerships are needed to ultimately increase the chances of achieving desired educational outcomes. The latter argument will be addressed first.</p><p>In the current political and economic environment, it is almost impossible for a local public school district to singularly marshal enough resources to bring about systemic changes. As Timpane (1991) points out, even when business becomes involved, it is sometimes not enough.</p><p>He states: "Business projects in local schools still vary widely in scope and effect and often barely address, let alone provide, needed improvements in the larger educational system (p. X)."</p><p>Yet it is also true that irrespective of the level of involvement, local schools increase their chances of improving social conditions when they have the additional resources provided by a business partner. To phrase it more succinctly: …the school system alone cannot meet the differing needs of all of its students…. The parents themselves must be active participants; and the school system and other community agencies---the churches and social service organizations---must provide the support that will facilitate such involvement (National Education Association, 1985, p. 13).</p><p>Garnering such support is never easy, nor without political upheaval. Writing about marshalling community support for public schools, Estes <ref type="bibr">(1974)</ref> acknowledges that: "Local control and a democratic, pluralistic society are a precious heritage, but they entail by definition controversy, noise, and change (Estes, 1974, p. 25)." However, there is past experience to drawn upon in managing the inherent political conflict. The federal government publishes a "lessons learned" list based on a series of case studies. These lessons are:</p><p>• Outside funding stimulates action.</p><p>• Each participating organization is challenged to change policies and procedures to accommodate a new way of working with others. • Partnership approaches require adaptation to fit each community, school district, and school. • Organizational mavericks may be a source of creative and meaningful programs, but they need support to strengthen and improve the program. • A shared vision and deep commitment among partners can overcome weaknesses in program design and implementation. • Even with confusion about how the partnership structure relates to the program, the partnership itself can be institutionalized. • Leadership is critical in a complex partnership.</p><p>• Leaders who reflect commitment to particular programs and processes may be more successful than leaders who see themselves as facilitators. • Identifying and solving problems, using adaptive planning, contributes to success. • Skilled and committed staff empowered to carry out partnership plans are an important element in project success. • A complex partnership can be strengthened by breaking it down into components. • University students are a valuable resource for classroom teachers, even if the students are not pre-service teachers. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, the vast number, the diversity, and the sheer complexity of public/private partnerships across the nation lead to several issues concerning evaluations of such partnerships and their respective programs. Among the many goals and programs that an evaluator of Public/Private Partnerships in Education might be concerned with addressing there are: programs targeted for at-risk youth, programs designed to increase access to work experience, providing technical assistance, generating public awareness, programs to increase participation in specific technical fields, programs to increase retention rates, and advisory panels designed to help schools and/or their entire district run more efficiently. The list is as endless as there are partnerships across the nation.</p><p>As ERG (1991) cautions "These variations limit the evaluator's opportunity to study across-the-board outcomes for students, staff, or partners. Research is needed that undertakes comparative studies of the various ways of interrelating: cooperation, coordination, collaboration, and so on. With a further delineation of the components of each process, including an explication of the costs and benefits of each, perhaps we would learn the requirements of each method, the limitations, and the effectiveness of each type under specific circumstances (1986, p. 8).</p><p>Although the comparative goal recommended by Hord is an alternative to the evaluation of specific programs created and/or implemented by particular partnerships, it is clearly a tall order and not very feasible given limited resources, fiscal constraints and the existing body of knowledge. In addition, the outcome evaluation Hord expouses concentrates on a cost/benefit analysis with successful program outcomes being the goal. This type of process evaluation also neglects the important role the political viability plays in partnerships.</p><p>Thus, a third evaluation alternative must be considered. This alternative focuses on the characteristics of successful partnerships by identifying, empirically testing and communicating the important organizational factors that lead to partnership political viability. These characteristics are as important as outcome measures and partnership process in the evaluations of partnerships and their respective programs.</p><p>The assumption is that an "outcome" of a partnership is a program, and whether or not the program is a success may be measured through the outcome of that specific program, not the overall partnership. What programmatic outcomes truly measure are the success of particular programs, not the success of partnerships. For instance, in Flint, Michigan, there were numerous programs offered by the Flint Roundtable partnership. If one of these programs failed to achieve its goal, say reducing teenage pregnancy rates, would that mean the partnership was not a success? The argument made here is that the answer to this question is a decisive "no."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations Of This Research</head><p>This study address the political feasibility of Public/Private Partnerships in Education.</p><p>As stated earlier, the definition of "partnership" in this work embraces the notion of shared power among the various stakeholders. As such, it intentionally ignores the specific mechanics of how different partnerships manifest themselves. The arena of public education in the early 2000s is complex with many sectors, stakeholders, programs and values making claims and contributions. There are so many types of partnerships in education, in fact, that the line between public and private education is itself becoming blurred. This research acknowledges the important role that Charter Schools, (Public) Choice, and other privatization alternatives to public education play in today's society. However, all of these alternatives rely on the building of interest groups and the sharing of resources and power. Thus, inherently all forms of non-traditional public school administration may be viewed as Public/Private Partnerships in Education.</p><p>Furthermore, as articulated early on in this work, the degree to which business is involved with public education varies dramatically across the nation. Although the size and complexity of these partnerships will have an impact on their potential success, the premise of this research is that the goal of political viability is universal. Thus, political viability, or the continued support of a partnership through continued involvement, allows the partnership time to implement processes and to achieve the desired outcomes.</p><p>The same assumption holds true for partnerships that are comprised of differing stakeholders. For this work, the term Public/Private Partnership applies not only to those partnership efforts between public education and business and industry, but also to those that involve parents, churches, governmental agencies, not-for-profit agencies, and social service agencies. An examination of each of these partnership types could easily be full research topics in and of themselves. Future work in the dynamics of various types of partnerships and detailed accounts of stakeholder involvement will eventually lead to the mass body of knowledge proposed by Hord (1986).</p><p>There are numerous research questions that are addressed by this work, but there are others that are not. This research may be considered narrow in its scope and may not be applicable to all partnership activity. However, limited resources are a key factor in any research project and this work is no exception. The research, however, does strive to maintain a high degree of rigor and identifies research topics for future work.</p><p>This work begins the process of developing the interaction-advocacy model of policy formulation and implementation. As an exploratory research project, the limitations, as outlined earlier, are due critical examination. It will only be through continued work in the theoretical and empirical fields of Public/Private Partnerships in Education that this general model of partnership success can be honed to full confirmatory status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose Of Study</head><p>The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the factors that contribute to a politically successful public/private partnership in education. Thus, a general model of success is hypothesized and then tested against data collected via a survey of partners that participate in current Public/Private Partnerships in Education. In addition to the formal tests of significance, data from a series of personal interviews will be used to support the descriptive findings of the survey. As a complete work, this research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by being empirical and quasi-confirmatory. It is labeled as such since it confirms many assumptions made about public/private partnerships (including assumptions that in the past have been considered "obvious" or "common sense") by verifying them with empirical data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions And Formal Hypotheses</head><p>Several research questions are considered in this work. These questions are grouped in the following categories for clarification and ease of presentation. As such, they follow the general model of success that will be explicated in the literature review.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Two: A Review Of The Relevant Literature ============ PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN EDUCATION ============</head><p>One of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in writing a complex thesis is the building of the context for the reader. As stated in chapter one, although this work is about public education, by default it encompasses the complexities of a cadre of social problems, and even the social construction of reality. In essence, a discussion of Public/Private Partnerships in Education is a discussion about the emergence of a new type of social organization.</p><p>One way to clarify new concepts at the cognitive level is to build a metaphor that relates old, familiar concepts to the new emergent one. In this work, an appropriate metaphor for enhancing the understanding of Public/Private Partnerships in Education is that of a community.</p><p>A community of stakeholders with a set of identifiable social relations that includes, among others, patronage and obligation. Such a social structure forms an economic and social unit which may simultaneously provide a basis for political, cultural, and, at times, even religious life. True partnerships involve stakeholders from all walks of life, and stress the interrelatedness of all social realms. Not to get lost in this metaphor requires the reader to understand the importance of the metaphor, while giving equal appreciation to the practice of partnering and partnership formation. For this work, the essential quality of the metaphor is its ability to facilitate discussion about the social system in which Public/Private Partnerships in Education operate, and how the power, inherent in the relations between the public, private, and overall communities, is distributed. Thus, society no longer clearly demarcates between social domains, and Public/Private Partnerships reflect this ambiguity in design and practice.</p><p>In the next two chapters, the most important and relevant partnership component themes are discussed and the literature examined. This discussion serves as the foundation of a theoretical model that is then tested in chapter six of this work. The order of presentation of these themes, in this chapter, are partnership power, leadership, the role of the media, the importance of stability, and why the process of achieving goals is as important as the attainment of the goals. Chapter three picks up the discussion by addressing partnerships as a new form of instrumental organization, including structural issues; the importance of clear goals to success; the roles of ideology and vision in partnering; and a general theory of partnership formation and success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public/Private Partnerships In Context</head><p>Recalling Otterbourg's (1986) comments cited in the introductory chapter about traditional approaches to public education not being able to meet expectations leads to this critical discussion about the importance of Public/Private Partnerships in Education. To begin, however, two observations concerning her comment must be articulated. First, improving the public education system is, and will always be, an on going process. The second observation, and for this work the more important, is that partnerships in education are about expectations. Clearly, outcomes of the educational system are important, but partnerships play a different, more symbolic role in the educational arena. If anything, partnerships in education will be of even greater importance in the new century as social and political realities dictate the sharing of resources, an increase in interdependencies, and the diversification of efforts in providing quality educational services. To insure that the aforementioned practice and experimentation continues at a level sufficient to maintain quality education, partnership viability in a complex environment becomes even more important to understand. Given this goal of viability, some very basic questions must now be addressed.</p><p>In the current atmosphere of a new Federalism, continued devolution, and the acceptability of market driven allocation, the value of public education is being questioned just as the educational system itself is being redefined by a global economy. A basic question that society must answer is why is education important? All manners of answers to this question have been postulated, but most can be categorized in one of two ways. The first type of response given is that education is an important ingredient in maintaining a skilled and qualified work force that is globally competitive. A second response is that in a free society an educated citizenry ensures a continuation of our democratic system of self-governance <ref type="bibr">(Barber, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bloom, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brademas, 1987)</ref>. Although these two types of responses reflect different value systems, they share a basic assumption. To summarize this assumption, "…education [is] the foundation of our hopes for building a nation strong both in economic and material terms and in the quality of our intellectual and cultural life (Brademas, 1987, p. 7)."</p><p>Liberal or conservative, market or polis orientation, all but the most extreme fringe of Americans agree that some form of public education is vital to the continued well being of our nation. Where the diversity of opinion becomes an issue is deciding how to best provide a quality education for our youth. In essence, there are two sides battling over how to achieve this goal. In one camp, there are those that feel public education has failed miserably since the mid-1960s in preparing our youth to be vital members of the work force and informed members of civil society. This camp sees the current system of public education as inefficient and ineffective, both the result of governmental largeness and, ultimately, liberal policy. To them, market forces should be tapped to bring about a greater level of efficiency and accountability in public education. One way to bring about this change is through various forms of partnerships with business and industry. These partnerships may take the form of advisory commissions/ boards, charter schools, educational vouchers, or, in the most extreme case, the privatization of schools.</p><p>The other camp is quick to defend public education, while placing the blame squarely on the shoulders of an American conservative ideology that has resulted in failed school levies and, hence, the inability of public school districts to provide quality facilities and programs. To this camp, effectiveness, not efficiency, is the issue; and to be effective requires a financial commitment from the broader community. This camp, too, looks to the development of partnerships to bring about the desired change. It is important to stress that, irrespective of ideology, both camps look to a multiplex of stakeholders to make change happen.</p><p>As the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) stresses:</p><p>Today, public/private partnerships are actively pursuing local self-reliance, and utilizing local resources with skill and creativity….We have turned away from dependence, above all else, on federal largesse. We have instead recognized once again that the true engine of economic and social progress in our society is not government, but our dynamic private sector and volunteer institutions and, that their natural partner is local, rather than federal government (U.S. HUD, 1980).</p><p>Thus, what both groups realize is that the problems facing public education are not just about the efficient allocation of resources, or the next levy up for renewal. These considerations are definitely important, but they are only a part of the broader context in which public education is struggling.</p><p>There are also the social and political "realities" of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Thus, in the 1970s and 1980s, as "white flight" and urban sprawl left center cities with shrinking tax bases, urban social problems created new needs for urban youth that burdened public schools even more. It became necessary for teachers to be more, and do more, than was previously expected. Teachers became de facto social workers, probation officers, family counselors, and, at times, replacement parents.</p><p>It is ironic that although there were early warnings, e.g., A Nation At Risk (National Commission on Excellence, 1983), public education did not make it to the national agenda, as a media sweetheart, until the mid-to-late 1980s. It was at this point in time that the degree and nature of the problem was discovered to be systemic, and not isolated to the urbanized center cities. The once thriving inner suburbs were loosing population to new and shinny outer suburbs; and starting to pay the social cost. Although no firm theoretical framework yet exists in the study of partnerships, there is literature that addresses the context and history of their development. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Kettl (1993)</ref> argues that conservatives and liberals alike have become enthralled with partnerships based on the belief that market competition is an effective cure for inefficient and ineffective government.</p><p>In addition, Richter (1993) notes that, in theory, public/private partnerships make promises about greater efficiency, reduced costs, and greater services (p. 18).</p><p>Following the line of thought originated by <ref type="bibr">Lowi (1979)</ref>  The definition posited for this work embraces components of these and many other definitions while stressing the inherent social and political aspects of partnerships.</p><p>Intrinsically, this works argues that successful partnerships are adaptive organizations that are unique to their own situation and circumstances. This distinctiveness, however, does not mean there are not shared, or common, qualities of successful partnerships. Borrowing from recent work in the Community Out-Reach Partnership Center (COPC) evaluation field, this work argues that successful partnerships will (1) build the capacity of the stakeholders to change their environment, (2) allow the stakeholders to learn from one another and give them the ability to do things they could not do before, and (3) increase the social, intellectual, and political capital of the partnership (Rubin and Rubin, 1992, p. 16).</p><p>As demonstrated, the term partnership is used to describe any numerous situations involving a relationship between two or more parties working toward a common goal. Within this work, however, the term partnership means much more, even without a definitive definition.</p><p>Based on the personal interviews and the literature on partnerships it becomes obvious that real partnerships are about trust and the sharing of resources and power. Looking back to the metaphor of partnerships as communities, a definition of successful partnerships must include 1) stakeholders from many different economic sectors, 2) all of whom share a common vision of the future and, 3) are committed to continued experimentation, 4) in achieving mutually agreed upon goals. Furthermore, by being committed, the stakeholders agree to 5) look past their own narrow interests by compromising and showing an appreciation of each others strengths, and an understanding and acceptance of each others weaknesses.. • Approach their dealings with education with a sense of 'controlled impatience'.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Partnership</formula><p>• Not believe there is a 'silver bullet' or owner's manual to bring about educational improvement. • Be sensitive to the challenges and limitations schools face.</p><p>• Be convinced that the enthusiasm of teachers and students is the indispensable element in good schools. • Come to understand the difficult and time-consuming nature of school system changes and the need to support and stick with a few good ideas for a long time. • Appreciate the history and current reality of imperfect school-business relationships and their share of the responsibility:</p><p>The sometimes uneven and unreliable character of business involvement and commitment The inveterate short-term perspective on change and results</p><p>The inevitability mixed motives in policy trade-offs between support for adequate education spending and reluctance to embrace new taxes • Show up (which is 90 percent of success in life, as Woody Allen says) knowing that recurrent meetings and rituals are just as important as dramatic announcements and exciting political victories.</p><p>The overarching emphasis to be gleaned from Timpane (1991) is that during this stage of the game, continued involvement ---continued partnering ---is the important objective. It took two decades for business to come back into the educational arena, and it will probably take that long for significant changes to show up in measurable outcomes. This research is about the political reality of Public/Private Partnerships in Education. Currently, what makes a partnership successful is the continued participation on the part of business and industry in public education.</p><p>As complex organizations, partnerships are dynamic in adapting to their ever-changing environments and stable in their dedication and commitment to their vision and goals. To measure such a dynamic organization "requires clever balance between hard numbers and narrative accounts that can put a story behind that string of numbers (Rubin and Rubin, 1992, p.</p><p>12)." The researcher must acknowledge the varying organizational practices and the scope and diversity of partnerships while cognitively and thematically categorizing commonalties. No small task.</p><p>However difficult, this research style is required for this investigation. <ref type="bibr">Trachman (1994)</ref> summarizes the current feelings about the evaluation of Public/Private Partnerships in Education.</p><p>The research literature…is now huge…with informative 'how-to' books illustrating specific practices and policies that support success….While this focus is critical at the beginning, the development of relevant outcome measures is key to continuation and replication. Clearly, improving and expanding these interactions through rigorous evaluation procedures is the next step (Trachman, 1994, p. 2).</p><p>However well intentioned Trachtman may be, there are two significant points of contention to be found in the above testimony. First, best practices are not only important to partnering during formulation, but throughout the entire lifecycle of a partnership.</p><p>Experimentation and learning are continuous objectives. This, of course, assumes that a partnership will survive the early stages of its lifecycle. If so, best practices are invaluable tools to communicate to other partnerships striving to increase their chances of survival.</p><p>Second, the statement assumes that outcomes and, more importantly, outcome measures are isophomorphic and applicable across partnerships. The logic implies that successful partnerships, as identified by outcomes, can be continued and replicated. But the sad truth is that an output measure tells an evaluator nothing about how to continue the actions that led to the outcome, let alone how to replicate those actions across different venues and cultures.</p><p>Thus, this work attempts to identify common themes across partnerships that address continued political viability. This discussion now turns to the first of several of these important themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Partnerships and Power</head><p>One component of political models, irrespective of their subject matter, that often proves problematic is power. This work is not exempt from this difficulty. Hence, power is a component of this model of partnership success that is not explicitly measured, yet is implicitly important as it gives rise to many structural manifestations. Thus, critical to this discussion of social organization is the inherent power and politics of collective behavior.</p><p>More specifically, this thesis is grounded in the notion of power; how it is manifest; how it is distributed, if at all; and where it comes from. At the very foundation of this work is the assumption that collective behavior requires power, and that it produces power. How this power is fashioned and put to use manifests in the formal model of partnership success hypothesized herewithin. It is through power that partnerships come together and how they stay viable.</p><p>This research assumes that the concept of power is oblique, at best, and that power itself is diffuse and nebulous unless focused by some tangible and instrumental means. Czarniawska (1996) relates that "..'power' stands for range of association: actors associate with other actors…and the more numerous and important their associations are, the greater is the power of the whole network thus created (p. 7)."</p><p>In terms of Public/Private Partnerships in Education, the implicit overarching goal is power. If the educational system lacks power then it will never achieve other goals that are outcome based. Goals like students being prepared for work, increased academic achievement, and increased retention and graduation rates all rely on the ability of the system to harness and utilize resources. Alone this task is overwhelming, but by building a power and political base the task becomes less formidable, although still difficult.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr">Foucault (1980)</ref>  What makes power such an appealing topic is that although power is often talked about in the negative, the undeniable fact remains that power is also capable of producing positives. In modern society, the state has developed procedures and techniques "…which allowed the effects of power to circulate in a manner at once continuous, uninterrupted, adapted and 'individualized' throughout the entire social body <ref type="bibr">(Foucault, 1980, p. 119)</ref>." For Public/Private Partnerships in Education, the existence of these techniques mean that stakeholders not only can use power to create partnerships, but partnerships can also produce power. The process of creating and harnessing power and the relevance to subsequent relations are undeniably important topics, but ones that are too complex for this work. Power is acknowledged in this work, but dissecting power to the point of reductionism is avoided. Thus, in partnerships, the understanding must be of what generates the power, and how the power can be used. What is not important is any discussion of domination on the part of one stakeholder or another. Although these statements may be read as contradictory, they are not. It is a matter of level and of degree, in an applied sense. One cannot blindly deny power, for that would negate the notion of the creation and utilization of partnership power. But, neither can one myopically dissect power, worrying about the true power base. The argument herewithin is that although power can be created by partnerships, it remains diffuse and oblique -in its application.</p><p>What makes the generation of power so important to Public/Private Partnerships in Education is that power is a tool that can be used in overcoming the limitations of ambiguity in society, and the complex problems that education began facing in the 1980s. Here again is the dual nature of power. On the one hand, it is a way to overcome these problems, but power also flows out of the very process of handling these problems. Power is one of the few resources that is not limited, and may be self perpetuating.</p><p>Taking a lead from the literature on community organizing and revitalization, several actions can be proposed that will aid partnerships in gaining power. First, partnerships can try to take control of the public agenda. By becoming politically viable and including stakeholders from all sectors of the community while facilitating shared meaning, partnerships can work to help the broader community decide which issues should be defined as formal public problems and placed on the systemic agenda (Pressman and <ref type="bibr">Wildavsky, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Starling, 1988)</ref>. Second, partnerships, as publics, can work toward increasing the level of "consciousness" about issues and problems <ref type="bibr">(Lipsky, 1980)</ref>. Thus, the partnership can communicate that their goals are really the goals of the broader community; not just narrow problems addressed out of self-interest.</p><p>Partnerships can also use legal action to advance their position and/or goals. Although court action can be costly and time consuming, it can bring about desired change and also help to bring attention to the partnership. In a similar fashion, stakeholders can stage protests and demonstrations to create awareness about their cause. Last, and the guiding principle of this work, is the fact that in the public arena the main source of power is the cultivation of people.</p><p>People have skills, expertise, resources, and the potential to influence government through voting (Rubin and Rubin, 1992, p. 7).</p><p>For power to be harnessed, and for the organization to grow and thrive, this model of success argues that leadership and leadership advocacy are necessary. Hence a brief review of the leadership literature is called for.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leadership/Advocacy</head><p>As partnership leaders strive to advance the vision of their organization they must acknowledge that there is an inherent reciprocal relationship between the structure of a partnership and its leadership. Just as strong bodies channel energy into strength to accomplish physical tasks, strong leaders/advocates channel power into their partnerships. In both cases, the avenue of power, i.e., the body or the leader, also can become further energized by the completion of the task.</p><p>If power is shared equally in a partnership it may be viewed as having a lateral or flat organizational structure. Current literature on the interdependencies of organizational membership in high-technology industries shows that equality of power is an important characteristic of these organizations <ref type="bibr">(Cleveland, 1985)</ref>. If partnerships are similar and have high levels of interdependencies, there are several basic roles that leaders fulfill. Summarizing the vast amount of knowledge about leadership, available in works like the Handbook of Leadership <ref type="bibr">(Bass, 1981)</ref>, this work posits that there are four important roles for partnership leaders. First, leadership must see that the goals are clear and that there is a strategy in place to achieve those goals. Second, leadership must help the stakeholders, and the entire partnership, build its capacity to implement a goal achieving strategy. The third role for leadership in a lateral organization is to create teams of stakeholders or employees to implement the day-to-day project tasks. The final role of leadership is to 'manage' the entire process while ensuring accountability.</p><p>Public/private partnerships bring stakeholders from varied backgrounds to the same table in an effort to realize the accomplishment of goals that, individually, could not be achieved.</p><p>These goals may be process oriented, or outcome based (Otterbourg, 1990). Along with their respective backgrounds, stakeholders may also bring individual agendas that drive their personal and/or professional participation in the partnership. Because of these factors "Each additional person has many potential effects: he or she may add relevant perceptions and insights, may be perceived as a source of support, may increase the feelings of risk of…principles if not trusted or if he or she has power over [other participants] (Walton, 1987, p. 103)."</p><p>Where such situations exist, it is of vital importance for the advocate to act as moderator/mediator. A strong leader is much like an objective third party that negotiates and manages conflict. Borrowing from the conflict literature, the argument made here is that the three greatest assets an advocate can have are power, knowledge, and neutrality (Walton, 1987, 1. Goals for the school district that a sizeable majority can support….and the education of the children should be the overriding concern.</p><p>2. An open procedure for setting goals. It requires a school board that is not afraid of controversy, and the participation of teachers, students, and the business community.</p></div>

Standard operating procedures that are known to be fair and known to be followed (Estes, 1974, p 29-30).</p><p>To summarize, "One of the major tasks of the institutional leader is to weld the members of the organization into a 'committed polity,' with a high sense of identity, purpose, and commitment (Perrow, 1986, p. 167)."</p><p>Along with leadership and leadership advocacy, another theorized component of successful partnering is the strong support of the media and the broader community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Media/Popular Support As Molotch (1979) writes</head><p>A social movement must create a societal context in which it can survive, prosper, and ultimately, triumph. One important resource in providing for this fertile context is the mass media and, in particular, the print and broadcast news (p. 153).</p><p>In the late 1970s, a trend in mass media started when business and industry began strongest advocates for the policies and programs of their partnership. What actions they take and how they promote their partnership varies tremendously, but this work argues that the most successful ones have the support of their publics and the media.</p><p>The first way in which the media create a positive context for partnerships is through informing the public about the critical issues that the partnership addresses. "Most issues have potential indicators of their objective severity or risk as a social problem. Often the indicator is a single variable (Dearing, 1996, p. 28)" but at other times there may be multiple economic and social indicators that influence public perceptions -and their actions. High teenage pregnancy rates, high drop out rates from school, declining achievement scores, and the stable, if not increasing, levels of teen drug addiction all send clear messages the public at large. Of course how this type of data is packaged is extremely important. The general public does not always react to the objective components, and it sometimes takes 'imagery' to gain the public's attention.</p><p>In addition to drawing attention to issues, Dearing (1996) argues that "The mass media often have a direct influence on the policy agenda-setting process, in addition to their indirect influence through the public agenda-setting process (p. 74)." This work on partnerships posits that by setting the public agenda the media helps in creating environments that are friendly to Public/Private Partnerships in Education. In addition to the hard work of partnership leaders and stakeholders in building support, the media play an important role in this effort.</p><p>The term 'media' is defined as television and newspaper, since these two formats are the most influential in agenda setting and in building popular support through continued exposure.</p><p>In addition, it must be stated that television and newspaper are equally important, and that a partnership that secures the support of only one format may not be as successful. Comstock relates that …in conjunction with other mass media [television] probably has some influence on the public's agenda of who and what is important, although the evidence …is somewhat stronger for newspapers… <ref type="bibr">(Comstock, 1979, p. 193</ref>).</p><p>However, it is also clear that two mediums play different, but similar roles in society. 'Their influence is at work at different times, operating in different styles, and with different technologies (Eyal, 1986, p. 171)," but both newspapers and television play important roles in agenda setting. It is also true that exposure to one type of media can increase the exposure to another type. According to Witt "…hearing a news story on television or radio actually increases the likelihood that a person will read about that event in a newspaper (Witt, 1983, p.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>312)."</head><p>The popular 'model' of today's media is one in which they appear to respond to the public's right to know by reporting events while acting freely from any outside influence <ref type="bibr">(Altschull, 1984, p. 114)</ref>. However, as Altschull (1984) argues, this 'model' is more mythical than not, and there is an ideology driving the media. This ideology is economic based, market oriented, and privileges the distribution of goods in its content. He writes, "In modern mass society, the news media more than any other institution facilitate the distribution of goods <ref type="bibr">(Altschull, 1984, p. 123)</ref>."</p><p>Although his comment may be contested, it does seem fairly clear that current society is market oriented. This orientation has even grown so persuasive that public stakeholders in educational partnerships often refer to their students as their 'product.' Irrespective of philosophical, moral, and meta-ethical debates on this subject, the action is a pragmatic one that aligns schools and school stakeholders on the side of the student. The reality of public education in the early part of this century is that students need to be better prepared for the workforce.</p><p>Thus, it is not only plausible, but highly probable that Public/Private Partnerships in Education will find very supportive, and powerful, allies in the media. However, the media also are 'entertainment' oriented and often avoid 'preaching' by focusing on individual issues rather than on broader themes. Altschull (1995) describes the situation by quoting Herbert Gans "...'the news supports the social order of public, business and professional, upper-middle-class, middleaged, and white male sectors of society'.... <ref type="bibr">[and]</ref> journalists in the United States emphasize people over groups and 'enduring social values' (Altschull, 1995, p. 129)." Nice reports about successful partnership programs that lead to increased profitability for local businesses, or a series on local kids who 'overcame diversity' by going through a partnership's program are the types of stories the media dream about. As already discussed, however, helping build a good public image is only one way in which the media can support partnerships.</p><p>As Dye and Zeigler (1989) state: "The most important power of the mass media is agenda setting….The media creates some issues and obscures others (p. 117)." It is through this power that Public/Private Partnerships in Education can work to promote their issues, their goals, and, ultimately, their public agenda. Gandy (1982) goes even further by suggesting a media model of "information subsidies" that reduce levels of uncertainty in decision making. The implication for partnerships is that "[information] is valued for its ability to...influence individual and collective behaviors through the selective reduction of uncertainty <ref type="bibr">(Gandy, 1982, p. 197)</ref>." This level of reduced uncertainty can mean not only greater participation on the part of all stakeholders in a partnership, but greater levels of political viability and, hence, success.</p><p>There are several ways in which the media may be enticed to support the activities of partnerships. First, as Estes (1974), argues, an advocate "…should establish an 'official' or regular relationship with groups that have power, visibility, and organization (p. 30)." By utilizing such a relationship, the partnership acts to become visible to the media. Second, a broad base of stakeholders will attract the attention of the media. Very rarely do divergent groups come together for common causes. When they do, the media should be informed. Third, by promoting their programs and interventions attention may be brought to their cause and their partnership. Open houses and staged media events raise the awareness level of the entire community, including the media.</p><p>Once the media begin to report on the actions of the partnership, the level of general public interest should increase. Astute partnerships will monopolize on this increasing level by taking action to solidify their position. This solidification may be accomplished in three ways.</p><p>First, when the level of popularity hits a critical mass, opponents and detractors to the partnerships may be asked to participate in the partnership by becoming stakeholders. This has the dual effect of increasing the power base of the partnership and brining in fresh ideas.</p><p>Second, the partnership can "showcase" their current accomplishments. By hosting "open houses" or tours of facilities, the abstract partnership becomes more concrete to the broader community. Last, partnerships can work at refining, or even redefining, their goals by encouraging the newly discovered public to participate in the partnership. Thus, although it is best to have varied stakeholders in the beginning, often partnerships will not have the necessary high level of exposure to attract a broad base. As the public's interest level increases, the partnership should resist the temptation to keep "our partnership" isolated from those who have become interested.</p><p>Once a partnership moves from the informal to the formal stage of organization, the roles and characteristics of the stakeholders often change <ref type="bibr">(Mintzberg, 1979)</ref>. For that matter, there may be a complete changeover in stakeholders as the organization redefines itself. It is at this point that some partnerships fail without some sort of counter weight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability/Implementation</head><p>When a partnership begins to stabilize, it, in a sense, begins the process of institutionalization. As partnerships grow and expand, their levels of complexity naturally grow also. This growth often translates into a more rigid structure as informal interactions are replaced by formalized relationships. This formalization of structure and procedures has a dual effect on the partnership. First, and as intended, it creates a sense of stability that is necessary for the effective implementation of the agreed upon strategy. However, it may also bring with it the unintended consequence of a stifling organizational rigidity. Successful partnerships embrace the former while avoiding the latter. How they accomplish this feat is directly related to the structuring variables of vision, goals, and means, and the process variable of leadership.</p><p>Summarizing <ref type="bibr">Mintzberg (1979)</ref>, the evolution from informal to formal organization occurs when more frequent and higher-priority coordination is needed. Formal teams or workgroups are created to manage frequently occurring tasks and to reduce the number and severity of the uncertainties associated with greater complexity. Effective leaders balance the need for greater structure, in handling uncertainty, with the desire for creativity and informality in task completion. It takes a skillful hand to bring balance on such a delicate fulcrum.</p><p>In his discussion of organizational decision-making, Downs (1994) identifies several</p><p>threats to a growing organization as it transitions from the informal to the formal. First, and as important as obvious, there are multiple decision-makers (p. 178). This one simple change can cause more damage to an organization than any other. Although, by definition, partnerships are collective behavior, they often start small with one person serving as the catalyst to the majority of action. As the partnership grows, more people become involved and the various stakeholders voice different, and sometimes conflicting, visions, goals, and action plans, resulting in an ever increasingly complicated process.</p><p>Hand-in-hand with multiple decision-makers is the influx of worldviews that come into a partnership. Often times, two people can see the exact same event and have completely different interpretations. Magnify this disjointed nexus by a large number of stakeholders and you can see the potential for heated discussion. An added dimension to throw in is the makeup of most stakeholders involved in partnerships. Coming from various economic sectors and different educational and cultural backgrounds amplifies the noise even more. A strong personality with good mediation skills often eases the pressure that comes from committee decision making and mixed interpretations. A skilled mediator shows the decision making body the strengths of multiple interpretations, rather than focusing on the conflict, divergence, perceived weaknesses and other distractions.</p><p>Multiple communication channels and the associated errors are two other threats borrowed from Downs (1994, p. 178). Although these type of threats are exceedingly difficult to manage, a stabilizing agent can reduce any extraneous and/or unnecessary communications by keeping stakeholders informed of 'real' issues and limiting the amount of rumors and hearsay that clog communication lines.</p><p>Looking at the literature on policy-making, Stone (1988) posits that a changing agenda requires a change in membership. This postulate is assumed to be just as true for partnerships.</p><p>Thus, as the partnership moves from informal to formal and grows in scope, the actions that the partnership takes will also begin to change. At this point it may become impossible for the initial makeup of stakeholders to contend with the changing internal and external environments. A stabilization agent can recognize this phenomena and bring calm to the partnership by facilitating a change in stakeholders. As Stone (1988) relates "the qualities and interests of people who make decisions shape the kinds of decisions they make (p. 291)." This change in decisionmakers is an on-going process and requires that a stabilization agent always be present in the partnership, if it is to survive (the changes).</p><p>Of course, the stabilization agent is not always going to be the same either. As an organization flows through its life cycle all forms of stakeholders and partnership components will ebb and flow. What gives the partnership an advantage in success and survival is the level to which it can adapt to all of the internal and external uncertainties. The discussion now turns to learning organizations and their ability to adapt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Means To Goals</head><p>Following in the line of thought detailed by <ref type="bibr">Senge (1990)</ref>, this work argues that organizations that are "learning" organizations, as opposed to "knowing" organizations are more flexible in their decision making processes, and, therefore, more likely to succeed while facing uncertainty and diverse environments.</p><p>One facet of a learning organization is the ability to be flexible and fluid in selecting strategies to achieve partnership goals. Partnerships that prefer to minimize risk by using tried and true means miss the opportunity to bring about desired change. The successful organization will experiment as it searches for the most effective way to achieve its goals. But, it is not just the experimentation that is important, it is the generation of knowledge ---the learning from mistakes ---that marks a successful organization. As Nonaka <ref type="bibr">(1991)</ref>  The most effective citizen groups are board-based…whose interests are not restricted to educational issues. Such groups appeal to a wider variety of people and have more opportunities for support (p. 84).</p><p>Such support enhances the power focusing ability of partnerships and even generates additional power. By building a community built on shared reality, "They can also share political clout through alliances on issues of common concern <ref type="bibr">(NSPRA, 1977, p. 85</ref>)."</p><p>This model of success makes a very explicit assumption about the type of organization that results in the continued existence of the partnership. The key organizational characteristic of success is the ability of the organization to learn. In addition, if successful partnerships are best viewed as learning organizations, then the means used to achieve goals must also be part of the learning process, a function not typically associated with rigid bureaucracy. The type of organizational structure best suited to facilitate this process is a structure that not only is flexible in how it approaches implementation, but takes the initiative to create knowledge as it works towards its goals. Chapter three will continue this discussion of organization instrumentality in greater detail as the formal model of partnership success is outlined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This chapter has laid the foundation for the formal model of partnership success that follows. Several critical assumptions and partnership components were outlined and discussed.</p><p>The chapter started by looking at the amorphous concept of power and how it applies to Public/Private Partnerships in Education. As an extension of power, the discussion turned to leadership and leadership advocacy and how both of these partnership components can work to increase a partnership's power base.</p><p>Next, the role and importance of the media in gaining popular support for partnerships was addressed. An acknowledgement of the dynamic nature of partnering and how stability can be induced into the process followed that section. This chapter then concluded with a brief argument in support of partnerships as an instrumentality to achieve goals.</p><p>In chapter three this discussion of partnerships as organizations is continued by examining the organizational structures and their relationship with ideology and vision. The chapter sets the stage for chapters five and six in which the univariate and multivariate data analyses are presented for consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Three: Partnership Formation ============ PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN EDUCATION ============</head><p>Continuing the review started in the previous chapter, this discussion examines the theoretical foundation of successful partnerships in education, with the presentation in this chapter divided into two sections. Although the abstract concepts of partnerships, success, and power detailed in chapter one are of the utmost importance to this research, relevant too is the more concrete concept of partnerships as organizations. In the first half, the key chapter concepts are presented and defined while building the context for a formal model of partnership success. In order of presentation, these concepts are public/private partnership as organization, the importance of clear goals to partnership success, and, finally, the role of ideology and the process of visioning in structuring partnerships.</p><p>The second section of this chapter addresses the corollary processes by which goals, means, and vision are brought to fruition through the organizational process. This section and the chapter will culminate with a general model of partnership success and its description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Partnerships As Organization</head><p>Chapter two included a discussion of power and how it is inherent in all forms of social organization. That discussion also included the importance of focusing power to accomplish goals. And, one obvious social mechanism that exists to focus power is that of human organization with a fundamental assumption of this work being that partnerships, like any collective behavior, are best understood as organizations. The puzzle, of course, then becomes detailing what type of organization they are and how they are best understood. The first section of this chapter addresses these questions by continuing the identification of components across successful partnerships, turning attention from process to structure.</p><p>To accomplish this task, it is necessary to look to the literature from organizational theory. It is also important to stress that none of the organizational components of this model exist in isolation. Hence, all components are theoretically interrelated and work as an emergent system.</p><p>A traditional, and often loathed, approach for achieving shared societal goals has been to develop a bureaucracy. This type of organization has as its defining characteristic a rigid hierarchical structure that has been well noted over the years, most notably by Weber <ref type="bibr">(1946)</ref>.</p><p>The role and relevance of bureaucracy in the policy process has also been well document <ref type="bibr">(Kingdon, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nakamura and Smallwood, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Starling, 1988)</ref>. As policy and programs have been formulated through one process, the implementation has been carried out through another -most often the process of bureaucratization.</p><p>In the pursuit of their common goals, partnerships too rely on an organizational  Starting in the early part of the last century with the rise of scientific management, the study of human organization and organizational theory began to take on a greater aura of functional legitimacy. Nonetheless, those early theories, and even the most recent theories, i. e., those that focus on organizations as culture <ref type="bibr">(Martin, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schein, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Siehl, 1985)</ref> tend to examine intra-organization relationships, with respect to identifying causal mechanisms, that prove useful in improving the efficiency of the organization. Even "systems" theory <ref type="bibr">(Thompson, 1967)</ref>, which concentrates on the impact of environmental forces on organizations, only addresses the adaptive capabilities of modern organization. The issues of using organizations as a technology, and the consequences of such a use are not addressed in an explicit fashion. Also, when discussions of modern organization do turn from intraperspective dialogues to broader issues, the emphasis is placed on the impacts that organizations have on individuals (Denhardt, 1981) or on culture (Morgan, 1986). Again, although these issues are of great concern to organizational and administration theorists, the missing element is the fashion in which organizations are conceptualized in their design and application. The implications of such a design and application paradigm of organizational technology are not explicitly portrayed in the literature.</p><p>Irrespective of this lack of attention, many theorists and practitioners implicitly treat organizations as technologies. The metaphor of organization as technology is a powerful one. It captures the raw essence of collective instrumentality to achieve goals. However, it is important to acknowledge that to fully understand a phenomenon it is necessary to go beyond the building of a meta-text and to move into the realm of applied practice. That is, the effort here is to go beyond metaphor building to describe the relationship between partnership structure and its value base. Thus, the goal is to suggest a postulate or two about how the two components interact in the practice of Public/Private Partnerships in Education.</p><p>Martin (1992), as a postmodern organizational theorist, argues that contemporary organizations exist in complex and dynamic environments and that they face high levels of ambiguity. This ambiguity results in organizations that lack clear centers and "interactions among members are often fleeting and superficial (p. 131)." Further, one approach used to understand the impact of ambiguity on organizations is to rely on differentiation theory and the study of subgroups within the organization. Martin (1992) makes a strong case against such theory by arguing that focusing on the dichotomies in organizations means the researcher "…oversimplifies and misrepresents the attributes and viewpoints of members…(p. 135)." This is the case with Public/Private Partnerships in Education. To dichotomize stakeholders into two or more groups has a very negative effect. Hence, it minimizes the important similarities that stakeholders from the two sectors bring to the table, and second, it increases the negative energy that can manifest from focusing on differences rather than similarities. Clearly, stakeholders from different sectors have different perspectives and may interpret their worlds differently, to a degree, but they have much in common, also.</p><p>In the current era of fiscal devolution, private and public stakeholders bring many more commonalties to the partnership table than they do differences. Many stakeholders from both sectors attended the same universities, have children in the same school district, socialize in the same circles, and attend religious services together. To focus on differences and create animosity between groups not only minimizes the shared reality of their participation in the partnership, but also lays the foundation for the destruction of partnership power. On the other hand, by stressing the commonalties, rather than differences, otherwise negative energy is turned into focused power.</p><p>What stakeholders must do, if the partnership is to be successful, is to learn from one another and about one another. They must build on their strengths, and compensate for one another's weaknesses. A successful partnership is not a "knowing" organization, it is a learning organization (Senge, 1990; Georgivesky, 1997).</p><p>Part of organizational learning also involves the stakeholders developing the ability to group process a clear mission and agreement on partnership goals. Without this critical ability the partnership may never get on solid enough ground to have a shot at survival. The importance of a clear mission is now discussed in detail. Goals, on the other hand, are more specific statements about how that vision will be realized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Importance Of Clear Mission/Goals</head><p>Irrespective of this difference, it is of utmost importance for partnerships to clarify both mission and goals early on in their lifecycle.</p><p>The complex and definition defying nature of partnering has led at least one observer to state:</p><p>The concept of urban partnerships has come to imply a sustained collaborative effort of two or more institutions -one public, the other private -in which each of the participants shares in the planning of projects and programs designed to meet a collective need and contributes resources. Since partnership definitions are neither conceptually neat nor empirically rigorous, one is left with certain basic characteristics that run throughout most successful ventures. These include equality among participants, shared risk, and perceived mutual benefits (Haider, 1986, p. 139).</p><p>In order to share the risk and benefit from collective action it is imperative for partnerships to have clear and mutual goals. Clear mission and goal statements serve three functions in contributing to partnership viability. First, they serve as a communication conduit to the broader community. As will be discussed later, a mission statement transmits the values and ideology of a partnership into the community. Second, a clear set of goals helps the stakeholders to focus and build internal buy-in. Last, and a value often overlooked, clear goals force an institution to move beyond rhetoric and into the realm of application and functionality. This is not at odds with the first two function, although it may appear this way, at first. The role of ideology and internal partnership culture cannot be undervalued. There are fundamentally two steps in developing clear goals that are of concern to this work. For ease of consideration we will call the first step defining the problem and the second step stating the goals. Within each of these broad categories are sub-steps. The first step in developing clear goals is to identify the specific need(s) to be satisfied and indicate the respective magnitude. To accomplish this task the causes of, or major contributions to, the problem must be isolated. Next, the partnership must identify how specific groups are affected.</p><p>In the second step, clear goals must be stated. In this process, the major goals are identified and how these goals relate to the problem is documented. Alternative ways to achieve these goals are then developed and evaluated. This evaluation of the alternatives is based on their relative costs and benefits (it is necessary to broadly define both costs and benefits in order to effectively evaluate) to not only the partnership, but also the broader community. Finally, the impacts of each alternative (both intended and unintended) must be considered prior to selection and implementation.. Ideology can also be used to create a partnership culture among its own stakeholders.</p><p>Although there may be a consensus among stakeholders that a problem exists, there may also be numerous perspectives of what the problem is and how best to address it. Downs (1994) refers to this difference in perspective as informational isolation and attributes its existence to "specialization." An ideology facilitates the shared meaning that all stakeholders must have in order to see the overall picture.</p><p>As partnerships move through their lifecycles and address different types of problems, their memberships often change with stakeholders entering and leaving. An ideology can help a partnership recruit and attract new stakeholders who may contribute to goal consensus.</p><p>Partnerships also face making many decisions on a daily basis. Often these decisions require choosing between two very similar choices. When all other criteria have been used to evaluate the options, ideology can be used to make an otherwise impossible decision. Thus, choices that are consistent with the ideology of the organization are choices that sometimes best serve the organization.</p><p>Overall, the development of an organization ideology is an effective means for a Public/Private Partnership in Education to communicate both within and outside its organizational boundaries. Through this increased communication capacity, partnerships are better able to function as a cohesive collective and to achieve their shared organizational goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role Of Vision</head><p>The previous sections deal with the importance of goals to a partnership and the ability of partnerships to achieve those goals through an organizational technology. for partnerships to remain open to their internal and external environments. Each of these important aspects of partnership vision will now be addressed.</p><p>Thus, the partnership stakeholders must develop and embrace a vision of what they hope to achieve through their collective actions. This vision is often embedded in the mission statement of the partnership and it serves the ideology of the organization best when it is explicit.</p><p>There are two complementary aspects of a vision. One aspect is to provide a far-reaching vision of a desired future state. The other is shorter term, and builds a picture of current state of the organization. Where vision parts from pure ideology -in a sense a long-term vision -is in the (short-term) implementation of the vision and the application of mechanisms to bring about the desired condition or changes in the status quo. To be useful, a vision must be practical and describe a situation that is at least plausible, if not reasonable. Although a vision is a lens to the future, it is not a true vision unless it can translate itself into reality. There are 'dreams' and there are visions. According to Nanus, a great leader is a synthesizer who maps the domain of the organization, generates alternative visions, chooses the right vision, packages the vision, and then facilitates the implementation of the vision. Without a strong tie to pragmatic application, vision becomes diluted and the viability of the partnership is weakened.</p><p>Conversely, the viability of the partnership also depends on the extent to which the vision, and the subsequent mission and goals, are implemented in terms of alternative actions. A comprehensive vision will not only address the depth of social problems by understanding the systemic nature of such problems, but it will also deny the platitude of symbolic "cures" by searching for the correct fit of solutions and problems. As Kingdon (1984) has so aptly pointed out, often issues only become problems when solutions exist. Partnerships that exercise a high degree of creativity in their definition of issues will be more likely to take advantage of existing solutions.</p><p>The successful partnerships will also seek out inventive solutions, where necessary, to the problems they are addressing. Rather than always relying on the tried and true, successful partnerships will experiment with new solutions and exhibit a creative component in their adaptability. As Winter (1990) states …adaptability is not an all-or-nothing proposition, …the pace of adaptation relative to environment change is key, and…differing degrees of adaptability can characterize different activities or characteristics of an organization (Winter, 1990, p. 291).</p><p>Thus, there should be sufficient flexibility in achieving a vision. A clear vision and a well thought-out and articulated mission statement serve as important mechanisms in creating equilibrium between partnerships and their environment.</p><p>Although many organizations embrace visioning and mission statements, not everyone is convinced of their usefulness. However, if formulated correctly, they can have a simple and direct impact. Falsey (1989) writes For many, it is easy to read a mission statement and be unimpressed. It's easy to say that a mission statement is nothing more than common sense.</p><p>It is true that a substantial number of ideas in mission statements are just that. It is equally true, however, that common sense often can be easily overlooked (Falsey, 1989, p. 33).</p><p>Thus, it is important for partnerships to maintain a realistic level of expectation and work to ensure that "the partnership's scope (local, regional, state and national) and service areas (rural, suburban and urban) are manageable and controllable (Otterbourg, 1990, p. 5)." Perhaps the greatest asset any partnership can have in mediating this tension between flexible visioning and realistic expectations is strong leadership.</p><p>Thus far, this work has centered on the components of partnerships and the instrumentality of partnership organization in achieving shared goals. The discussion now turns to the formation of a model of partnership success that draws upon these aforementioned themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Theory Of Partnership Success</head><p>In the general model that follows, concepts and ideas are presented that form a foundation for successful partnerships in education. Drawing from the previous chapters and sections on organizational theory, bureaucracy, leadership, and media support, the argument is presented that partnerships that exist in simple environments have the best chance for survival.</p><p>In addition, for those that exist in complex environments, it is argued that partnerships will have a greater chance at being successful if the stakeholders are unified in the goals that they develop.</p><p>Those partnerships that create and nourish a partnership power through the transformation of personal energy into partnership energy are also theorized to be more successful.</p><p>In their work, Burrell and Morgan (1994) describe four theoretical paradigms based on two dimensions. The paradigms are Functional, Interpretive, Humanist, and Structuralist and the two dimensions are change---stability, and subjective---objective. These dimensions give rise to the various structures that are inherent to all organization. It is reasonable to posit that partnerships, as a form of organization, will have similar identifiable structures. These dimensions and the variability in structure are hypothesized to exist across all partnerships.</p><p>In addition to the Burrell and Morgan (1994) typology, this work relies heavily on the theories of Senge (1990) in understanding organizations, their structures, and their processes. As the argument is stated:</p><p>Structure produces behavior, and changing underlying structures can produce different patterns of behavior. In this sense, structural explanations are inherently generative. Moreover, since structure in human systems includes the 'operating policies' of the decision makers in the system, redesigning our own decision making redesigns the system structure (Senge, 1990, p. 53).</p><p>Thus, in line with this argument, this work makes the critical assumption that partnerships have a structure that 'produce behaviors,' but adds to the theory by assuming that this a non-recursive relationship and that behaviors will influence the structure as well. As with all organizations, partnerships are in continuous flux and, thus, always in the process of (re)definition. As Bridges et al. (1997) claim:</p><p>Change is not a purely rational process and in order to change practice, the values, attitudes, and beliefs which individuals form as members of professional cultures must be taken into account and addressed (14. <ref type="bibr">1.3)</ref>.</p><p>What originates from this blending of organizational theories is a model of partnerships as the emergent product of a dialectical process involving structure, values, and environment.</p><p>Based on this model, it is further posited that all organizations, i.e., partnerships, have six principle components that interact in three dimensions of partnership space. This model strives to capture the importance of organizational structure, the critical role of policy advocates, and the interaction of structure and process in the emergence of educational partnerships.</p><p>The following section gives a rough outline of the general model by giving a brief description of each dimension. This discussion begins by describing the theorized model of partnership structure and by presenting a graphical display of the theorized relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ORGANIZATINAL STRUCTURE</head><p>Although particular participants and types of interactions will vary across partnerships, all interactions are theorized to occur within a general organizational structure comprised of three dimensions or continua. These dimensions are vague---precise, rigidity---flexibility, and narrow---broad, and constitute three dimensional partnership space.</p><p>Within the context of power, organization, ideology, and vision, this model posits that the success of partnerships can be attributed to six conceptual themes. Three of these themes arise from process and mediation, and three emerge from the earliest stages of formation and development and manifest in the form of human capital. These themes influence partnering within the partnership space and are: (1) The ability of a partnership to specify clear and concise goals, (2) The ability of the partnership to adapt to its environment (both internal and external) in working towards meeting its stated goals and objectives, (3) the ability of the partnership to envision its role in a broader system, (4) the presence of a partnership catalyst that brings the partnership together, (5) the presence of broad based community support for the partnership, and</p><p>(6) the influx of a stabilization agent that unifies, or "gels" the partnership. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>-1 shows the theorized relationship between a partnership and key components of partnership success, all located within three-dimensional partnership space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3-1</head><p>As is the case with many social models, this particular effort acknowledges that there are many additional unidentified variables that affect partnerships and their degrees of success. The effort here is not to document all possible factors that exist in partnership space, but, rather, document the most relevant and those that apply across venue and context.</p><p>The above graphic shows the relationship between a partnership advocate, an agent of stabilization, and support from the media and a partnerships public, all interacting in a organizational structure comprised of three dimensions.</p><p>The first dimension, vague---precise, deals with the type of goals set forth by a partnership. It is hypothesized that partnerships that form clear and precise goals will have greater success, in achieving their goals and maintaining a stable organization, than those partnerships that do not. As a structural component, this goals dimension interacts with the other dimensions, as well as the other partnership factors. The above graphic shows the partnership advocate in close proximity to this dimension because there is a theorized strong relationship between goals and leadership, with an advocate as a potential source of this leadership.</p><p>However, it must be restated, at this point, that this model assumes that all partnership components interact with the structure and that none exist in isolation.</p><p>The second dimension, rigidity---flexibility refers to the ability of the partners to adapt to the emerging nature of the partnership, including its internal and external environments. The belief is that partnerships that can not adapt to change are doomed to failure and the eventual demise of the partnership. As Haider states [All organizations] pass through phases of growth and decline. They are vulnerable to powerful trends and changes in the external environment that, in turn, affect their viability and governance (Haider, 1986, p. 137).</p><p>Thus, partnerships face many threats from outside the organization and need to be flexible in adapting to these challenges. This is particularly true in newer organizations that have little support and a diffuse power base. Standard operating procedures and mechanistic reaction to such environmental threats can severely damage a partnership.</p><p>As organizations grow, there is a tendency for them to become more rigid in their interaction with outside elements. This work suggests that even for older partnerships, the more successful, even thriving, ones will exhibit a higher degree of flexibility.</p><p>The external environment is not the only concern to organizations, however. The With this notion of uncertainty in place, this work argues that partnerships must face their uncertainties with high levels of flexibility as they adapt to their ever changing conditions.</p><p>These conditions may be large or small, internal or external, but, which ever is the case, the partnership must not act or react in a rigid fashion.</p><p>The last dimension, narrow---broad, refers to the focus or scope of the partnership.</p><p>Although this dimension seems at odds with the first, it is not. Partners must delineate clear goals, but, at the same time, they must have a broad vision with respect to how they hope to achieve those goals. Myopia in a partnership will result in mediocre outcomes and disillusioned partners. Gifford argues Like other organizations, a partnership may approach the political process with a systematic political philosophy or with ad hoc responses to individual political situations. Or the partnership may find itself, as is frequently the case, on a point somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum, combining a loose ideology with considerable pragmatism (Gifford, 1986. p. 77).</p><p>With potentially high levels of uncertainty, partnerships must keep boundaries fluid and be open to alternative methods to achieve goals. A good balance of ideology and pragmatic experimentation results in partnerships coming up with solutions to unique problems that not only achieve goals, but reinforces partnership power through consensus building. As discussed earlier, organizational ideology is a powerful force and this resource should be tapped while building a partnership vision, and accompanying action plan.</p><p>Given this theorized structure, it is now important to detail the formulation and implementation process that is carried out therein. Goodman and Holp (1994b), in their work on ethics legislation, have outlined a model of the policy process that will be used in this dissertation. Applied to the topic at hand, this model hypothesizes that successful partnerships will be formed when three criteria are met.</p><p>First, in the planning or partnership agenda setting stage, there will be a strong partnership advocate. In public/private partnerships, this advocate may be an educator, or group of educators, a school board, a parent, a business interest, interest group, or an outside activist such as The Council For Aid To Education. This advocate provides the initial impetus that brings the participants together.</p><p>Second, popular support for the partnership must be gained during the formulation process. This is most likely brought about through reports generated in the written and electronic media. This stage is critical to a successful partnership because it prevents entropy from setting in. The influx of energy not only encourages the partners to continue on in their efforts, but acts as a catalyst in attracting new potential partners.</p><p>The last component of a successful public/private partnership is a stabilization agent(s) in the implementation stage. Again, the particular agent(s) will vary from case to case, but will exist. This agent(s) serves several important functions. First, the agent(s) ensures that there is effective communication between the participants. The agent(s) works to clarify the goals and objectives of the partnerships and to promote consensus and agreement. Second, the agent(s)</p><p>facilitates an effective measure of success. That is, along with clear goals and objectives, the partners must feel that the partnership is meeting some type of objective standard, although this objective is not necessarily defined by outcomes. The agent(s) helps to form, gain consensus on, and implement this standard. Hence, it is important to note that implementing this methodology is not an exercise in grounded theory <ref type="bibr">(Glaser, 1967)</ref>. That is, the model explicated earlier in this work is the driving theoretical force in the data collection. A series of specific research questions about partnerships were developed and then posited to the partnership stakeholders. Their reactions and comments to these propositions were recorded as field notes and then analyzed for content. This style of simultaneous data collection and analysis allows the shaping and focusing of the study as it proceeds (Glesne, 1999, p. 130).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Once the analyses of these qualitative data were complete, the findings were then used to construct a series of process and activity codes (Bogdan, 1998, p. 174) to assist in the structuring of the quantitative mail survey (Appendix B). This self-administered pencil and paper survey was distributed to a sample of partnership stakeholders from across the country. These data then served as the cornerstone of the statistical analysis presented herein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS</head><p>This section describes the research protocol followed in collecting the qualitative data via telephone and face-to-face interviews of stakeholders from Flint, Michigan and Cincinnati, Ohio.</p><p>The following format is followed in presenting this methodology. First, a brief description of each case study city is presented. Next, the research design is discussed, and then this section ends with a description of the data collection methodology, including instrument design and telephone and in-person interview protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant Selection</head><p>These two case studies provide support to the qualitative component of this dissertation by providing the context of the work and by shaping the design of the mail instrument. The case study cities selected are Flint, Michigan, and Cincinnati, Ohio. These cities were chosen based on the following four criteria. One <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(1)</ref>, in order to generate an effective knowledge base about partnerships, information about the partnering stages, i.e., formulation, and implementation, must be collected. These two cases represent different stages in this process. Two (2), the term "partnership" has different meanings in different contexts. These cities represent a dichotomy of stakeholder involvement and provide a contextual understanding of partnering activities based on the degree of participation. Three (3), the partnerships must at least attempt to address systemic problems. Although numerous educational partnerships are concerned with very narrow issues, such as math or science, partnerships with a broader mission will inherently, by definition, represent broader educational issues.</p><p>The educational partnership in Flint reflects a diversity of public/private partners and is fairly advanced in terms of its development. Formed in 1990, the Teaming For Excellence partnership brought together 21 Genessee County school districts, business organizations, social service agencies, and four institutions of higher learning in the effort to create new approaches to elementary and secondary schooling. The objectives and goals of the partnership were broad based and focused on the involvement of all partners as an important resource. The stated goals and objectives of the partnership were:</p><p>* To establish the Flint Roundtable, comprised of CEOs, to marshall the community's resources. * To implement a comprehensive school improvement strategy. * To increase the community's ability to respond to the changing needs of students and the local economy. * To coordinate support services for youth and their parents, and to improve the transition between education and the work place (Flint Round Table ).</p><p>As a broad based attempt at systemic change, the Flint Teaming For Excellence partnership provided valuable insight in the public/private partnership process.</p><p>While Flint had an existing broad based partnerships, Cincinnati had yet to form a legitimized partnership at the time these interviews were conducted. Although recent events had occurred within the school district, Cincinnati had not yet matured to a level appropriate for the fruition of an on-going partnership development.</p><p>In September of 1991, the Buenger Commission released its study of the Cincinnati public schools calling for revised fiscal policy-making and administrative restructuring <ref type="bibr">(Buenger, 1991)</ref>. The commission, comprised of Cincinnati business executives, had high expectations of reforming the Cincinnati school district. In the years that have followed, however, it has become clear that the recommendations made in the commission's report have largely went unfulfilled. It is reasonable to expect that had the business community legitimized their relationship with the school board, rather than merely forming recommendations, the level of improvement would have been greater. The institutionalization of the relationship would be one way to bring about legitimization to this Public/Private Partnership in Education.</p><p>It is important to note that during these interviews, the school board members appeared more amiable to legitimized partnerships. Indeed, in 1994, members of the school board opened negotiations with the Edison group, a for profit organization that contracts with school boards to manage specific schools. Although this effort did not materialize into a contract, it appears that school board members were willing to experiment in their attempts to improve Cincinnati schools.</p><p>As a pre-institutionalized partnership case study, interviews with school board members and business leaders were conducted to identify what factors encourage public/private partnership and to facilitate the measuring of these factors via a mail survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrument Development</head><p>The survey instrument was developed over a three-month period of time in the winter of 1995-96. The final instrument was a product of a lengthy process of development and refinement. Along with the literature review, consultation with committee members and other advisors resulted in an instrument designed to provide structure to the interview while allowing flexibility in the range of responses.</p><p>The instrument was entirely open-ended and contained twenty questions. The questions concerned the partnering process, how the stakeholders became involved in their partnership, obstacles that the partnership faced, and perceptions of partnership strength and weaknesses.</p><p>The instrument changed slightly after interviews with the first two Flint, Michigan stakeholders. During these interviews, it became apparent that two follow-up questions to the question "How would you define the relationship between the public and private sector?" were not only redundant, but could be taken as leading questions. In order to preserve objectivity and eliminate even a chance of perceived bias, these questions were removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>These data were collected over a six-week period in January and February of 1996.</p><p>Using an instrument containing twenty questions, the majority of interviews were conducted by telephone. Given the busy schedules of all the participants, some interviews were completed by placing telephone calls to the stakeholder's home. In all, there were twenty-one-attempted interviews with Cincinnati stakeholders and nineteen completes. Due to the close geographical proximity of the city of Cincinnati, this researcher traveled there to conduct two of the interviews and even met one participant at the University of Dayton Alumni Hall to complete an interview.</p><p>There were twenty-one-completed interviews with Flint stakeholders, and all of these were completed by telephone.</p><p>Flint was selected for inclusion because of its outstanding reputation in the educational partnership literature. This reputation was primarily due to the high level of participation and commitment of the Flint Roundtable, a business panel comprised of numerous business activists.</p><p>The process of identifying and contacting Flint stakeholders started with the Roundtable.</p><p>After several telephone calls to the Roundtable, a high ranking official agreed to participate in the interview process and provided the names and telephone numbers of other major stakeholders. A snowball approach was implemented as each subsequent participant was asked to name other likely stakeholders for inclusion. Interestingly, most of the stakeholders named potential participants from numerous sectors of the economy. That is, in contrast to the expectation, business stakeholders were as likely to recommend stakeholders from education or government as they were to suggest another business participant. In addition, the final list of twenty-one participant stakeholders is very close to the list of names that were continually mentioned by all stakeholders. Thus, the Flint stakeholders were a fairly close knit group and seemed to have overcome (in)significant differences in order to achieve their shared goal.</p><p>In contrast, the Cincinnati stakeholders mentioned many names and the list of participants had to be limited. There were many individuals recommended for inclusion based on their unique perspective, but who were not as active in the partnering process. As with Flint, the process of selection followed a snowball methodology and started with the Cincinnati Downtown Partnership organization.</p><p>Again, as in Flint, several telephone calls to this organization were rewarded by the agreement of a high ranking official to participate in the interview process. Several other business stakeholders were recommended because of their involvement in the "Buenger Report (1991)," a document intended to improve the quality of the Cincinnati Public School System (CPS).</p><p>These business stakeholders were quick to participate and provided the names and telephone numbers of other community members who also participated in the Buenger Report process. Although there were high levels of participation among the stakeholders from the various economic sectors, Cincinnati differed from Flint in the level of agreement and singularity of vision that existed. With the Cincinnati stakeholders, not only was there a diversity of views between groups, i.e., educators, business, or not-for-profit, but also within the groups.</p><p>Consensus was not a defining characteristic of the partnership.</p><p>were sent to a sample of partnership stakeholders. The sampling frame from which these partners were selected is discussed in greater detail in the following section.</p><p>Once the data were collected, they were subjected to statistical analysis in a hybrid exploratory/confirmatory process attempting to flesh out the rudimentary hypotheses formed during the literature review. For the statistical test component, path analyses were employed.</p><p>In a structural equation path analysis, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression paths are used to test the strength of (1) individual linear paths of influence by independent variables on dependent variables, and (2) a general linear model of causation. If the model outlined is correctly specified, path analyses allow general statements to be made about the causal mechanisms at work, in this case the components that contribute to successful educational public/private partnerships.</p><p>For this work, a combination of structural (organizational) and policy (process) variables are used to predict the success of partnerships, i.e., the dependent variable. Based on the two components, i.e., structure and process, of the general theory outlined in the previous chapters, the following model is constructed. The dependent variable is the success, or failure, of a partnership, as defined by a scale constructed from survey questions. The construction of this variable was based on the results of the initial telephone and face-to-face interviews.</p><p>The decision to let the partners self-define success is founded in the lack of theoretical work in the area of educational partnerships. Although there has been empirical work done in the study of partnerships in various disciplines like Local Economic Development (LED), this literature does not yield any substantive measure of success that is applicable to educational partnerships. Thus, the partners themselves are viewed as the experts in their field of educational partnerships. It was this expertise that was tapped in developing a valid measure of success.</p><p>Several general statements must be made about this measure. First, as with most complex concepts, this dependent variable is multidimensional in nature and, thus, difficult to operationalize with one, singular measure. The expectation, from the very beginning, was that the question of what constitutes a successful partnership would elicit a wide range of responses during qualitative data collection. This expectation was confirmed and, thus, the reliance on a scale measure that is more robust than any single measure of partnership success.</p><p>Second, the political dimensions of success are assumed to be the ultimate theoretical concepts and are used in the construction of the scale measure. These singular measures include the likelihood of participation in a different partnership, the likelihood of continued participation in the current partnership, the level of stakeholder satisfaction with partnership success, and a stakeholder rating of partnership success -all of which are acknowledged self-reports.</p><p>It must also be noted that although there was strong agreement on the part of stakeholders concerning goal attainment as one measure of success, this measure was included in the model as an intervening variable, not as part of the dependent scale measure. For many stakeholders, if the goals of the partnership have been obtained, then the partnership can be viewed as a success.</p><p>However, many partnerships achieve their goals and still fail politically. It is this observation that drives the decision for this measure to be included as an endogenous independent variable.</p><p>In short, this model theorizes that success of partnerships, as measured by our multiple political dimensions, is influenced by the actualization of goal obtainment.</p><p>Appendix F contains a table of survey questions by the concept that they measure</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling Procedure</head><p>The sampling frame from which the respondents were drawn was purchased from the National Association of Partnerships in Education (NAPE). This organization is a not-for-profit agency that aids schools in building and fostering educational partnerships by providing resources and expertise in the field.</p><p>As stated at their official web page, the association develops leaders with the skills and knowledge to build community consensus around local systemic education reform. Their reform efforts focus on four strategic directions.</p><p>• Building collaborative leadership for education reform;</p><p>• Strengthening state and local leadership;</p><p>• Focusing leadership for change; and</p><p>• Measuring and sharing the progress of partnerships in contributing to the success of students (NAPE).</p><p>The data set was purchased from NAPE in June of 1996, and included all current members of the association, as of that date. NAPE classifies all members as belonging to one of seven categories, business sector; Chamber of Commerce; education, i.e., public and private primary and secondary schools; higher education; governmental members; non-profit sector; and those classified as something 'other' than any of the above categories. For this last category, the database was so ambiguous as to their relevancy to Public/Private Partnerships in Education that these cases were excluded from the sample.</p><p>In total, the sampling frame contained 1,816 records and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">4</ref>-1 shows a breakdown of membership by count and percent.  The survey instrument contained a question asking respondents to self classify themselves as belonging to one of six categories. Over four out of ten (41.95%) respondents classified themselves as school administrators, eighty (24.32%) as businesspersons, and eightynine (27.05%) responded they were something other than the options given. The remaining twenty-two cases reported their positions as either school board (0.61%), civic leader (1.52%), or teacher (4.56%). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">4</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-3 displays this information.</head><p>There is a discrepancy between the assigned classification counts and the self reported classifications. For example, eighty respondents reported being from business, while the number of responses from this same category was tracked at ninety-two. This imprecision is most likely due to the ambiguity of roles in partnering and the way in which NAPE administers its database. Due to limited resources and the desire for an adequate sample size, questionnaires were mailed to the entire population. If resources were more abundant, a random selection of stakeholders would have been selected and multiple mailings implemented. Given the realities, however, only one mailing was carried out and the 340 responses to the survey are deeply appreciated. These cases give great insight into the workings of partnerships and provide an adequate sample size for this investigation. Given the aforementioned budgetary limits of this research, and the single mailing to potential respondents, the total response rate for this survey was a respectable 18.7%. Certainly, if reminder post-cards, or a second copy of the survey had been sent out, this figure could easily have been doubled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrument Design</head><p>Instrument design was based on the literature and the findings from the telephone and face-to-face qualitative interviews. In addition, advise was sought from committee members and their recommendations played a critical role in improving the instrument. The questions are designed to measure six independent variables and the dependent variable scale measure.. In all, there are forty-six closed-ended questions on the instrument, and two open-ended.</p><p>These open-ended questions ask the respondent to expand upon a concept measured in a previous </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Of Data</head><p>Once all surveys were collected, they were pre-coded and the responses entered into the Statistical Program for the Social Sciences (SPSS) over a two-week period in September and October of 1997. When the data entry was finished, random cases were selected for a quality control check. Any discrepancies were corrected and another error check was performed.</p><p>Analyses of these data were also conducted using SPSS. All univariate and multivariate statistics were generated using SPSS procedure commands. Most tables were also produced via the SPSS program, although some tables were built and printed using Microsoft Excel. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT IS A PARTNERSHIP?</head><p>The first question asked in a telephone interviews was "How would you define the concept 'public/private partnership' in general, and as it applies to your specific situation?" As one might expect, the responses gleaned by this question are quite varied and reflect not only the position of the respondent, in relation to his/her particular partnership, but also his/her personal values and belief system.</p><p>As such, some of the responses are very vague while others are so specific that they are almost meaningless when taken out of context. Thus, this work strives to build an interpretable frame of reference from which these data can be examined (Appendix C contains the coded responses).</p><p>While analyzing the data collected during the telephone interviews, it became evident that all of the responses could be interpreted and coded to fit into five categories, albeit more loosely in some cases than in others. For these data, some of the definitions given are those that describe "partnerships" in terms of resources being shared, or where an organization or group of organizations from one economic sector donates or transfers resources to agencies or schools from a different economic sector. Another type of definition focuses on partnerships as being a process or series of processes, while a third defines a partnership as a means to an end. The last identifiable category includes those definitions that relate the complexity and ambiguity of the partnership concept. This category demonstrates that some partnerships are so narrowly defined and context specific that global characterizations are inadequate forms of descriptions. A fifth category encompasses all other definitions that do not fit into the prior four previous categories. dictate," and yet another adds, "Equality determines the difference between a partnership and a relationship."</p><p>This sharing of resources is sometimes just a part of a bigger, overall process.</p><p>Thirteen stakeholders defined a partnership as a process. Sometimes this process is mutually beneficial, other times it is not. One example of this type of definition came from a stakeholder in the Cincinnati partnership; "It is a 'true' partnership. There is mutual trust and shared beliefs." A stakeholder from Flint had a similar definition, "Basically, mutual development of programs. An exchange of services." For these stakeholders, the defining characteristic of a partnership is the process of coming together and working toward goals. However, this process is not always an easy one. As a Cincinnati stakeholders laments, "It's like dancing with a blind date, fraught with dangerous territory and pitfalls...."</p><p>For yet other stakeholders, process and sharing resources are not important in defining the concept of partnership. For these stakeholders, there is a formal structure or even a legal foundation that provides the stakeholders with a means to achieve an end.</p><p>Whereas to the process-oriented stakeholders the means (a process) is at least as important as the outcome, to these teleological thinkers the means is only as important as the end it produces. With simplicity in mind, a stakeholder comments, "An association with a public entity and a private entity." The stakeholder from Flint that states "Defined for us by legislation..." also gives an example of the utility definition of partnership.</p><p>There are also four stakeholders who believe that defining the partnership concept is not possible or, perhaps, desirable. The general comments from this group are centered on the comprehensiveness and context specificity of Public/Private Partnerships. As a Flint stakeholder comments, "You don't define it because it's seamless." Or "No single definition...no two are alike," as a Cincinnati stakeholder claims. This type of definition is consistent with the discussions in chapters one and two on the ambiguity of partnerships and the lack of theoretical models that explain partnership success.</p><p>There are four additional definitions that do not fit well into any of the four categories developed above. Appendix C contains the coded transcribed comments for the benefit of the reader.</p><p>Contrary to the view that partnerships are only context specific, this work is built upon the presupposition that, in building a model of partnership success, there are identifiable shared characteristics that successful partnerships exhibit. As stated above, only four of the stakeholders participating in the telephone interviews hold this belief and represent only the smallest of a minority opinion. Thus, the topic at hand for this work now becomes starting to identify these aforementioned shared characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PARTNERSHIP MISSION AND GOAL FORMATION</head><p>As chapters two and three discuss, the literature from policy implementation When asked if "Clearly Stated Goals" are an important component of their partnership, almost ninety percent (88.7%) respond in the affirmative (Table <ref type="table">Q1A</ref>). This pattern is consistent with the data collected via phone interviews with the partners in Flint and Cincinnati, as well as the literature on community partnerships <ref type="bibr">(Rubin, et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Partners were also asked if "Clearly defined goals have become more or less important over time." Well over half (58.7%) of the partners respond that, indeed, clearly defined goals did become more important over time. Conversely, less than ten percent (9.4%) report clearly defined goals as becoming less important over time (Table <ref type="table">Q1B</ref>). Q1B Over time, has the importance of clearly defined goals become or less important to the continued development of the Over two-thirds (70.3%) of the partners report that their particular partnership was formed around "One or two goals that were important to the partnership," while the minority (29.7%) report that their partnership had "Numerous goals that were equally important (Table <ref type="table">Q1C</ref>)." This minimal level of saturation is quite common among Public/Private Partnerships in Education. Additional support of the predominance of smaller, focused partnerships came out in the phone interviews as well as in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head><p>Concerning the internal discussions of partnership goals by stakeholders, just over half (56.3%) of the partners respond that "Goals were discussed in detail." Another third (36.4%) report "Goals were discussed somewhat," and the remainder (7.2%) report that "Goals were discussed very little or not at all (Table <ref type="table">Q2</ref>)." Respondents to the survey indicate that "When considering actions to achieve the partnership's goals" a vast majority (86.6%) either considered many alternatives (34.5%) or some alternatives (52.1%). Only 12.2% of the respondents report that their partnerships considered very few alternatives and even fewer (1.2%) did not consider any alternatives (Q9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head><p>Tables Q3A, Q3B1, Q3B2, and Q3C display the responses to four questions about mission statements. Such statements, as either formal documents or informal agreements, provide focus and cohesiveness to any organization. This focus is especially important for complex partnerships in education that draw stakeholders from a diverse set of backgrounds. In these highly dynamic environments, a guiding force can give the stakeholders something to rally behind and minimizes the amount of attention given to the differences that exists between stakeholders. The respondents were also asked to rate the language in the initial mission statement in terms of precision. Almost thirty percent (28.7%) report that their mission statement was very precise, while an additional 47.3% report the mission statement to be somewhat precise. In all, these initial explorations of the data support the general theoretical claims about the importance of goals to the successful partnership. Attention is now turned to how partnerships approach the business of achieving their goals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PLANNING AND THE VISION PROCESS</head><p>As noted in the literature review, current work on partnership formation and success does not adequately address how partnerships achieve their goals. Do they rely on "tried and true" means, or are they more experimental and try "creative means?"</p><p>This survey of partners finds that a majority (62.5%) of partners report that their partnership uses a combination of "tried and true means and creative solutions." An almost equal percentage of respondents report using "mostly tried and true means (18.5%)" and "mostly creative solution (19.1%)" in developing ways to bring about goal attainment. Q5 Some organizations rely on an abstract "vision" as the best way to achieve their goals. Other organizations utilize a "concrete" plan to guide them in attaining their goals. What about your partnership?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head><p>Of the 319 responding partners, 17.6% report that their respective partnership relied solely on a "concrete plan to guide them in attaining their goals." Only 5.6% report relying strictly on an "abstract vision" and the majority (76.8%) used some combination of the two. For over fifty percent (51.4%) this combination was "more plan, some vision" while about one quarter (25.4%) report that their partnership used "more vision, some plan (Q5)."</p><p>Most organizations face some degree of internal change as they move through their respective life cycles <ref type="bibr">(Mintzberg, 1979)</ref>. When asked how their partnerships react to internal change, about ten percent (10.3%) report that their partnership follows "a clear-cut proactive strategy." A similar percentage (12.2%) report "reacting to internal change," while almost four-fifths (77.5%) report a combination of reaction and pro-action in addressing internal change. Almost one-third (27.5%) report being "mostly reactive, but some strategic planning" and about half (50.0) report the opposite; "mostly strategic planning, but some reacting (Q6)." In a similar vein, partners were asked if the goals of their partnerships "Were identified and designed to react to current problems, or to achieve a practical vision for the future." Well over half (54.8%) respond that their partnership's goals were designed to meet both challenges. The remaining responses were almost evenly split with 23.7%</p></div>

When these partners were asked about their experiences, a little over sixty percent (61.9%) report that, "When developing the means to achieve its goals, the partnership stresses Education, strive to achieve their goals, they are unmitigatedly faced with uncertainty from the inside and outside. These forces not only bring about structural change in organizations/partnerships, but they can also have an impact on the dynamics of internal relationships, thereby dually impacting the success of organizations/partnerships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head><p>Given that change is a natural occurrence, the partners were asked to answer "To what extent has the partnership changed over time (Q12A)?" The majority of partners respond that their partnership had "changed some (54.7%)," while almost equal percentages of partners respond that their partnerships had "changed a lot (23.0%)," and "not changed much (22.3%)."</p><p>There is a good bit of variation in the responses to the question "Some organizations exist in a complex external environment while other organizations do not.</p><p>Would you say your partnership exists in a very complex environment (Q13)?" The majority (68.6%) of respondents report "very complex (29.8%)" or "somewhat complex uncertainty and the vast majority (57.9%) report facing "some uncertainty."</p><p>These stakeholders were also asked about the extent to which their partnerships are faced with external uncertainty (Q16). Interestingly, the distribution of responses across categories is almost identical to the previous question about internal uncertainty.</p><p>About one-tenth (11.5%) of the partners report "high levels" of internal uncertainty, while almost one-third (29.9%) report "very little" uncertainty. The remaining majority (58.6%) reports "some uncertainty."</p><p>Facing uncertainty and dealing with that uncertainty are two very different things.</p><p>When these stakeholders were asked to report, "How has the partnership coped with the level of uncertainty it faces (Q17)?" the distribution of responses was somewhat skewed to the positive. Thus, only (2.5%)" or "has not adapted at all (0.9%)." The majority (54.6%) of stakeholders report that their partnership had "very little trouble," while the remaining 42.0% report only "some trouble" in adapting to the uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A major component of the external environment facing Public/Private</head><p>Partnerships in Education is the broader communities of citizens. These partners were asked, "How important is the overall community's perception of the partnership for continued success (Q23)?" A clear majority (68.2%) responds that such perceptions are "very important." An additional 27.9% reports community perceptions to be "somewhat important" and the remaining 3.9% indicate that they are "not important at all."</p><p>Since stakeholders report that community perceptions are important, how well do these same stakeholders think their partnerships fare in the community? A majority (66.3%) relate that they "Would say the overall perception of the community toward the "somewhat positive" perception and only 0.9% report a "somewhat negative" perception (Q24).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QUESTIONS ABOUT PARTNERSHIP STAKEHOLDERS</head><p>In this section, the distributions of answers to various questions about stakeholder involvement in the partnership process are presented. These questions range from the importance of certain types of stakeholders to what types of stakeholders are involved in the partnership. As theoretical components, these questions are formed around the concepts of partnership advocacy, the media, popular support, and a stabilizing agent.</p><p>It is reasonable to expect that partnerships will have a range of involvement in terms of the number of influential people. These data indicate, however, that it is typically a few people that are involved at a critical level. When asked the question, "Were a few instrumental or many people equally instrumental in bringing the partnership together?" eighty percent (80.2%) of the stakeholders respond that there were only "A few instrumental people." Only 4.0% report that there were "Many equally instrumental people," and the remaining 15.8% indicate that there were "Many people, some of whom were more instrumental (Q25)." </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q25 A few people instrumental or many people equally instrumental?</head><p>There has been an increasing amount of literature devoted to the importance of strong leadership in successful organizations. When asked, "How important was leadership as a defining characteristic (Q26)?" of their partnerships, an overwhelming majority (87.5%) report that leadership was, indeed, "very important." Approximately eleven percent (11.2%) respond leadership was "somewhat important" and the remaining 1.2% report that it was "not very important."</p><p>The model of success detailed in this research posits that "streams of action" can come together when a catalyst is present. When asked "Can an individual or small group be identified as an important catalyst (Q27A)?" over ninety-seven percent (97.9%) respond in the affirmative. The remaining 2.1% report no such catalyst. As noted earlier, this lack of variance proves problematic in performing greater analysis, as well as in avoiding a serious theoretical mistake. Thus, without the possibility of falsification, there is a temptation to accept the findings as axiomatic. Q27A Can an individual or small group be identified as important catalyst?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head><p>The presence of a catalyst and the importance of that catalyst are separate but interdependent phenomena. When asked, "How important were individual catalysts in bringing the partnership together (Q27B)?" 93.3% respond "very important." Only 6.7% report "somewhat important," and there were no reports to the negative.</p><p>Based on the telephone interviews with partnership stakeholders, one critical player identified in the partnership success process is the media. These survey data show moderate support for this hypothesis with over half (55.9%) of these stakeholders responding that "The media played a role in forming support or opposition to the partnership (Q28A For the stakeholders that respond that the media played a role in forming support or opposition to the partnership, almost all (98.4%) indicate that, "The media helped form support to the partnership," as opposed to forming opposition (1.6%) to the partnership (Q28B).</p><p>When the partners who indicate an important role for the media were asked, "How important was the media in forming support or opposition to the partnership (Q28C)?" over ninety percent (93.5%) report a "very important (43.5%)" role or a "somewhat important (50.0%)" role. The remaining 6.5% report that the media was "not important."</p><p>Just as the media can be important to forming support or opposition to a Public/Private Partnership, so too can other types of individuals. When asked, in a generic format, about other individuals, over two-thirds (67.0%) respond in the affirmative that "There were other individuals that played a role in forming support or opposition to the partnership (Q29A)." The remaining one-third report in the negative. Often, in the life cycle of an organization, many different stakeholders come to the forefront and then move to the background. When asked about their partnerships, a majority (78.2%) of stakeholders respond, "some different individuals came to the forefront." About thirteen percent (13.5%) indicate, "no different individuals came to the forefront," and only 8.3% report, "completely different individuals came to the forefront (Q30)."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head><p>As a partnership matures from the planning stage to the implementation stage, this model of success theorizes that a stabilizing agent will emerge to bring balance and continuity to the partnership. Over ninety percent (90.3%) respond that such an agent existed in their partnerships. Less than ten percent (9.7%) report no such agent (Q31A).</p><p>For the majority (91.3%) of partnership respondents, the aforementioned agent was "very important" in stabilizing the partnership (Q31B). Less than ten percent (8.7%) report the agent to be "somewhat important (8.4%)" or "not very important (0.3%)." Q31A An individual whose actions have had a stabilizing effect on the Table <ref type="table">Q33</ref> shows the distribution of responding stakeholders by the their type of position. The modal category for this research is "school administrator" containing 41.9% of the respondents. An additional 24.3% report coming from business, 4.6% are teachers, 1.5% are civic leaders, 0.6% are school board members, and 27.1% report coming from other positions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q31B</formula><p>These survey data lend moderate support to the theorized relationships concerning partnership stakeholders. Thus, there is reason to believe that a few instrumental people are important to the formation of partnerships, that one defining characteristic of these people is leadership, and that outside support, most notably from the media, is also important.</p><p>These findings also show that change and complexity are part of the daily stresses that partnerships face. These partnerships share the characteristic of having successfully managed their environmental complexity. It is important to note, particularly with the next chapter in mind, that this shared ability to manage complexity means that this survey has not included failed partnerships -or, in other terms, those partnerships that do not deal well with complex environments. The next section discusses the findings from the mail questionnaire responses addressing success of partnerships.</p></div>

In the next series of tables the responses to questions about partnership success are detailed. These  Stakeholders" which is a political as well as a practical definition of success. This definition relates the importance of attracting stakeholders to the partnership, as well as keeping them involved.</p><p>The next set of definitions are those that identify "Undefined Various Outcomes" as measures of success. These partners agree that outcomes are important, but not on what those outcomes should be, or on how to measure them. "Sustainability and/or</p><p>Growth" definitions of success, the next category, focus on the ability of partnerships to continue their efforts, while "Consensus on Goals and Programs" reflect partnership emphasis on working toward shared goals. The next most cited definition of success, "Measurable Results" gives priority to measurable outcomes. These are much harder definitions of outcomes than the previously mentioned outcome category and include quantifiable measures like achievement scores and graduation rates.</p><p>The last substantive category, "In-Process and/or Continuous Improvement" defines partnership success as striving to achieve excellence and all that comes with that effort. There were 26 "Other" definitions that do not fit neatly into any of these categories. Some examples of each type of definition are now provided.</p><p>Fifty-two of the respondents state the general feeling that "More Involvement and/or Interest and/or Recognition by Stakeholders" is a definition of partnership success.</p><p>Although popular, each of these concepts, i.e., Involvement, Interest, and Recognition, can be viewed as an individual indicator of success, they are combined for this analysis.</p><p>Many respondents talked of these concepts in a seamless fashion, and it seems unnatural to break them out for analysis. program's success" are all strong indicators of the partnership's success. Clearly, to these stakeholders, there is more to success than the achievement of goals.</p><p>A third set of stakeholders mentioned "Undefined Various Outcomes" as the measure of success 37 times. For this group, there must be an observable benefit from having the partnership, but they differ on what those outcomes are. For example, one stakeholder gives the following general comment, "We have accomplished many things, both educationally and financially, for the students." Clearly, there are measurable outcomes behind this statement, yet this aspect is not fully communicated in the open-end response. Another example from this category comes in this form: "Teachers would express excitement about the projects that were created... <ref type="bibr">[and]</ref>...kids improve their reading and writing skills enjoying using the new learning tools." Again, the comment has the clear intent of outcomes as its premise.</p><p>Not so clear, perhaps, is this comment: "We are beginning to see benefits in our students, our schools, our businesses, and our communities." The types of benefits this stakeholder is addressing are not known, but it appears as though this partnership is having a broad impact. As the literature review suggests, "Consensus on Goals and Programs" is an important part of the partnership process. So important, in fact, that 23 of the stakeholders say it is a definition of success. For instance, one stakeholder claims "Both the business and school partnerships have agreed on the goal and have worked to maintain our goals." Interestingly, this stakeholder brings a new dimension to this discussion. Thus, not only is the consensus process important initially, but also in maintaining goals--an insight not lost to this research.</p><p>Specific types of "Measurable Results" are given as a success indicator by 16 of the stakeholders. An example of a partnership measuring several outcomes is found in this response: "Impact (positive) on student outcomes (attendance, P.E. achievement, public perception (support)." Another is "Partnerships have been developed with schools' improvement plan as a benchmark; student attendance, attitude, and academic success...." In some instances, the partnerships are still in the process of working on measures. One response indicative of this process is "We are still evolving and trying to establish measurable goals." This response can just as easily fit into the next category of responses where the key importance is the on-going process.</p><p>Thus, 13 of the responses indicate that "In-Process and/or Continuous Improvement" of a partnership is an indication of success. Along with comments like the one above, stakeholders also relate, "All [involved] are continuing to improve each year.</p><p>In the field of education one can never be 'very successful' [because] there is always room for improvement." Without a doubt, these data support the notion that "partnering" is, indeed, a process and that this process must be nurtured throughout its entire life cycle if it is to remain healthy and vital.</p><p>Finally, 26 responses are given that fit no category mentioned thus far. These responses are lumped into the all-inclusive "Other" definitions category. Some examples that go here are very vague, like: "Some of our schools have had success -others none," while others seem far reaching and impressive: "Very good working support units for all parties" and "[The] partnership has brought about systemic change."</p><p>Certainly, these data could be coded in many different ways, but the categories for this research are useful in understanding the process of partnerships and the respective notion of partnership success. However, it does become clear that these data have at least one other interpretation.</p><p>Thus, in addition to the findings detailed above, these data show that, overwhelmingly, these stakeholders prefer "process" types of definitions to "outcomes" types of definitions of success. In the open-ended responses (Appendix D) 149 of the definitions are founded in the notion of process, while only 27 are outcome oriented. An additional 27 responses do not fit neatly into any category (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">5</ref>-2).</p><p>For example, one stakeholder relates that success to his/her partnership is Along with understanding how partnership stakeholders define success, it is also important to know how stakeholders think about gauging or measuring that success.</p><p>In order to gain greater insight about "successful" partnerships, the question "How do you gauge, or measure, the success of a partnership" was asked of the subjects of the telephone interviews.  when the responses are coded into the same categories used in the analysis of the openended survey question.</p><p>As the table shows, six of these stakeholders look to the achievement of the partnership mission and/or goals as a measure of success. More involvement by stakeholders is mentioned by four participants, as are various types of undefined outcomes. Sustainability of the partnership and consensus on goals and programs are both mentioned by three of the stakeholders. Interestingly, the most often mentioned gauge of partnership success is the production of measurable results. Seven of the stakeholders mentioned this characteristic. Continuous improvement is given as a response by five of these stakeholders and four stakeholders mentioned some other way of gauging success.</p><p>If these responses are coded into the same categories used in the earlier analysis, sixteen of these success measurement definitions are process oriented, fourteen are outcome oriented, and six are achievement-based.</p><p>The responses to the telephone interviews are used in developing the closedended questions included on the Survey of Partners. The following tables present the findings from the survey concerning partnership success. Along with the definitions gleaned through the telephone interviews, these participating stakeholders are also responding to other measures of success, as well as rating the success of their own partnership.</p><p>One strong indicator of a stakeholder's perception of success is his/her likelihood of participation in a different partnership. When asked this question, an overwhelming majority (81.2%) report that they would be "very likely" to participate in another Public/Private Partnership in Education. An additional 15.8% report being "somewhat likely" and only 3.0% report being "not likely" to participate (Q18).</p><p>A similar distribution of responses is found in the answers to another strong indicator of partnership success. In responding to the question "How likely are you to continue to participate in your current partnership in education?" 87.8% of the stakeholders report that they are "very likely" to continue to participate. Another 10.0% report being "somewhat likely" and 1.8% report being "not likely." Only 0.3% of respondents report being "not at all likely" to continue to participate in their partnership (Q19). As noted earlier in this chapter, tangential to direct questions about perceptions of partnership success is the existence of "measurable" partnership goals. Thus, a partnership may have healthy relationships and appear successful, but lack objective evidence of goal achievement. At some point in the life cycle of a partnership in education, tangible data will be required to show success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency</head><p>With this forethought in mind, these partners respond to the question, "How measurable are the partnership's goals?" Almost forty percent (38.2%) of the respondents indicate that their partnership's goals are "very measurable." Over half (54.2%) report "somewhat measurable" goals, and the remaining 7.6% report "not very measurable" goals (Q20).</p><p>On the same topic of goals, almost half (46.3%) of the partners respond that their partnership was "very successful" in achieving its goals (Q21 Q21 How successful has your partnership been in achieving its goals? indicate that their partnership was "somewhat successful," while only 4.3% report being only "a little successful (4.0%)" or "not at all successful (0.3%)."</p><p>A core question directed to these stakeholders was "How satisfied are you, personally, with the success of your partnership?" A clear majority (58.7%) report being "very satisfied," while an additional 38.3% indicate they were "somewhat satisfied" with the success. Only 3.0% of the partners report being "not at all satisfied."</p><p>Finally, these partnership stakeholders were asked to rate the success of their partnership. Interestingly, over ninety-eight percent (97.8%) report their partnership as being either "very successful (57.6%)" or "somewhat successful (40.2%)." Only 1.5% indicate that their partnerships are "not very successful" and 0.6% report being "not at all successful (32A)."</p><p>This univariate finding has a dramatic impact on our causal model developed in the next chapter. Thus, the lack of variation in these data indicates a wide uniformity in the high success levels of the partnerships under investigation. One plausible explanation of this phenomenon is the sampling-frame from which the data were collected. As members in the National Association of Partners in Education, these stakeholders are very experienced, knowledgeable, and have good insights into the partnership process.</p><p>As such, these univariate findings may be viewed as an exercise in looking at "best practices" from the best in the field. First, where the term "partnership" is concerned, these data fit nicely with the existing literature that suggests there is no one single best definition of Public/Private Partnership in Education. Indeed, the notion of partnership is so dynamic and complex that any single definition will somehow fail to capture the full magnitude of the concept. Rather, there are many definitions, with each providing a unique perspective of the partnering process. This work has classified these definitions into three categories. There are definitions that are process oriented, definitions that suggest partnerships are an applied means to achieve an end, and definitions that are very context, or partnership, specific.</p><p>Just as important, this chapter detailed the manner in which stakeholders define partnership success. In Chapter Six, a multivariate statistical model is tested against these data with partnership success as the dependent variable. The success scale to be used is built, in part, from the definitions gleaned from stakeholder definitions of success.</p><p>The univariate findings presented in this chapter suggest that stakeholders involved in Public/Private Partnerships in Education think about success in ways that can be categorized into eight usable definitions. Large portions of the stakeholders define success as having achieved their partnership goals. Another popular definition is an increase in the interest or involvement in the partnership by stakeholders. Sustainability or growth of the partnership is yet another definition, as is reaching a consensus on the goals and programs of the partnership. In-Process type of definitions, measurable results, and various outcome definitions round out the responses.</p><p>This chapter also examined the findings from the Survey of Partners by presenting the data in sections consistent with the theoretical components of partnership success. In the first two sections, the univariate findings from questions about partnership goals and visions were displayed. Although all findings were pertinent, it was especially relevant to note that these partnership stakeholders are very applied in their attitudes and focus more on the concrete and practical than on the abstract and conceptual.</p><p>The theoretical ability of an organization to adapt to its environment was the third component discussed in this chapter. The findings indicate that these partnerships face moderate degrees of change and complexity, but seem adept at dealing with these organizational stresses.</p><p>The last section of this chapter combined several elements in its discussion.</p><p>Although no strict demarcation exists in the chapter section, the findings are presented in terms of the components of partnership advocate, the role of the media, and the presence of a stabilizing agent in the partnership. These data lend support to the theory built in the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Six: Multivariate Statistical Model =========== PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN EDUCATION ===========</head><p>In this chapter a model of partnership success is tested using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and path analyses. In the first section of this chapter, the hypothesized relationships between the partnership success score and its predictor variables are detailed. The exogenous and endogenous variables are identified and their suggested influences on the dependent variable outlined. Through the use of multivariate regression analysis, the Standardized Beta Weights are calculated and presented for examination.</p><p>In the second section of the chapter, a reconstructed model of partnership success is presented by examining the statistically significant regression equations. Each statistically significant exogenous and endogenous predictor variable from the full model is examined in detail with its direct and indirect influences described. The end product of this section is a reduced model of partnership success. This final model is not to be judged on its predictive capability, but, rather, used as a guide in leading the discussion on important Public/Private Partnership characteristics.</p><p>The third section of the chapter uses the reduced model to compare the theoretical model of partnership success with the empirical data while making some general statements about the success components.</p><p>As a precursory note to this chapter, the author acknowledges that there are many assumptions of OLS that must be realized if the regression coefficients are to be unbiased. Unfortunately, given the many limitations of this work, it is impossible to have a high level of faith that all of these assumptions have been achieved in these data. In addition, correct model specification in partnership analysis mirrors the broader problem manifest in theory development in the social sciences. Thus, this work acknowledges the difficult tasks of measuring multiple dimensions of complicated concepts in a parsimonious fashion. The reduced or trimmed model (Kenny, 1998) analysis employed herein is best seen as a method used to reduce a complex world to a level where meaningful discussion can begin. It is a best attempt at blending theory and data driven analysis without sacrificing theoretical rigor or exploratory flexibility. While judging this methodology the reader must make his or her own decisions concerning the amount of robustness to be found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Analysis</head><p>Path analysis is a multivariate regression technique that allows the researcher to decompose correlations into direct and indirect effects. The purpose of path analysis is to provide estimates of the magnitude and significance of hypothesized causal relationships between variables. Path analysis is used for both exploratory and confirmatory analyses, depending upon the goals of the researcher. In either case, the investigator uses a series of structural equations to test his/her model against the data <ref type="bibr">(Conner, 2000)</ref>. The relative sizes of the path coefficients in the output path diagram may tell us which of them is better supported by the data (Lea, 1999).</p><p>The assumptions for this OLS procedure are similar to those for regression analysis, and, indeed, path analysis is a special case of regression analysis. Thus, a path coefficient is equal to the correlation when the dependent variable is a function of a single independent variable. The path coefficients in a complex casual model are simply the beta weights from a series of multiple regressions, rather than the correlation from just one single regression <ref type="bibr">(Brannick, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>To proceed with this analysis, it is best to assume that all of the relationships are linear and additive; that the error terms are uncorrelated with the variables and each other; that the causality flows in only one direction; that the variables are measured on an interval scale; and that the variables are measured without error.</p><p>The presentation of a path analysis uses a graphical display of the coefficients that measure the relative size and direction of the various effects between variables. This graphical display eases interpretation, as does the use of the standardized beta weight.</p><p>Rather than reporting unstandardized beta coefficients that result in the comparison of unequal units, the standardized betas allow the direct comparison of effects.</p><p>To begin this path analysis, brief descriptions of the variables are now given. The dependent variable to be used in the first two sections of this chapter is a partnership success score calculated from four questions on the survey. For ease and simplicity of presentation, the dependent variable will be referred to as "Success Score" and the predictor variables by their survey question number. Appendix F shows the question number from the survey, the concept the variable measures, and the question wording.</p><p>A more global measure of partnership success was desired so a Success Score was calculated by computing a cumulative score for each respondent across questions Q18 ("How likely are you to participate in another partnership?"), Q19 ("How likely are you to continue to participate in your current partnership?"), Q22 ("How satisfied are you with the success of your partnership?"), and Q32A ("How would you rate the success of your partnership?").</p><p>Because of some missing data, each calculated score was weighted by the total number of responses across the four questions. Thus, if a respondent stakeholder only These data offer mixed support of the three hypothesized indirect causal paths.</p><p>The first path of influence is through the use of creative solutions in working toward goal attainment, with a hypothesized relationship between active debate about means (Q8) and the use of creative solutions (Q4). This part of the path is not supported. Nor is the path that hypothesizes that the reliance on new and creative solutions (Q4) will positively influence partnership success (DV).</p><p>The second indirect path of influence is partially supported by these data. Thus, these data indicate that partnerships that actively debate the means of goal attainment (Q8) are likely to consider more alternatives in achieving their goals (Q9). The influence of considering more alternatives to achieve partnership goals (Q9) on partnership success (DV) is not supported, however.</p><p>The final indirect path of influence, through functionality or imagination in task completion (Q10), is not supported by these data. The theory predicts that partnerships that actively debate means (Q8) will be more likely to use imagination and process in achieving their goal(s) (Q10). These partnerships are then hypothesized to be more successful (DV) than partnerships that rely on functionality in task completion.</p><p>The three variables measuring the effect of a partnership catalyst on partnership success are all hypothesized to have one direct and four indirect influences. These three variables will be addressed simultaneously in this discussion. The first catalyst variable measures the extent to which there were a few instrumental people in bringing the partnership together, rather than many (Q25). It is hypothesized that one, or perhaps a few, dominate visionaries are a greater asset to a partnership than many less influential people. In addition, it is hypothesized that these influential people will be marked by strong leadership abilities as a defining characteristic (Q26), and that these individuals are also distinguished by their role as catalyst in the partnering process (Q27A).</p><p>When looking at the paths of direct influences that these variables have on partnership success, these data do not support the hypothesized relationships. The findings are slightly mixed where the indirect paths are concerned, with the data supporting some of the theorized relationships.</p><p>Thus, it is hypothesized that the catalyst variables (Q25, Q26, Q27A) will all influence the development of one single, or dominate, goal, rather than many equally important goals. These data show a relationship between the number of instrumental people involved at the beginning of the partnership (Q25) and the number of goals that are important to the partnership. These data suggest that the greater the number of individuals involved, the more goals there will be that are important to the partnership (Q1C). Although perhaps an obvious finding, it is one that can dramatically impact a partnership.</p><p>Leadership as a defining characteristic (Q26) and a clearly identifiable catalyst (Q27A) do not have a statistically significant influence on the number of goals that are important to the partnership (Q1C). Nor is there a statistical relationship between the number of goals (Q1C) and the level of partnership success (DV). It is hypothesized that partnerships with one, or only a few, dominant goals will be more successful than those with a multitude of goals. Again, these data do not support this hypothesis.</p><p>The model also delineates a relationship between the three catalyst variables (Q25, Q26, and Q27A) and the importance of clear goals exhibited by the partnership (Q2, Q3A). The first of these relationships, that between the number of instrumental people (Q25) and the level of detail given to goal discussion, is supported by these data with partnerships having more people involved also having more discussion about goals.</p><p>This finding has a substantive, as well as a statistical, significance and will be detailed in greater length in the discussion section of this chapter.</p><p>The level of leadership as a defining characteristic (Q26) is not supported by these data as having an influence on the amount of discussion given to goals (Q2). An identifiable catalyst (Q27A), however, is supported. This relationship is statistically significant and indicates that when an identifiable catalyst is present, the goals of the partnership are more likely to be discussed in detail (Q2).</p><p>Of the three catalyst variables, only an identifiable catalyst (Q27A) is a good predictor of a partnership having an overall mission statement (Q3A). These data indicate that those partnerships with an identifiable catalyst are also those with mission statements. The number of instrumental people (Q25) and leadership as defining characteristic (Q26) are not good predictors of this variable.</p><p>The level of discussion concerning goals at the beginning of the partnership (Q2)</p><p>is not a good predictor of partnership success (DV). Although the existence of a goal or mission statement (Q3A) is statistically significant, these data show the relationship is in the opposite direction of the one hypothesized. Thus, these data indicate that partnerships without an overall goal or mission statement (Q3A) are more likely to succeed (DV)</p><p>These data, however, do support the hypothesis that partnerships that discuss goals in greater detail (Q2) and partnerships that have an overall mission or goal statement (Q3A) are more likely to have goal(s) that are more measurable (Q20). In addition, the hypothesis that partnerships that have more measurable goals (Q20) are more likely to succeed (DV) is, in turn, supported by these data.</p><p>The data also support the hypothesis that partnerships with more measurable goals (Q20) are also more likely to be fruitful in achieving their goals (Q21). These same partnerships, i.e., those achieving their goals, then, are likely to be more successful (DV)</p><p>in their overall partnership endeavor.</p><p>This model also hypothesizes that partnerships that rely more on visioning than relying on a concrete plan in achieving their goals (Q5) have a greater chance to succeed.</p><p>These data are of no assistance in confirming this hypothesis. A similar situation exists where these data produce findings that are not statistically significant when testing the hypothesis that partnerships that follow a strategy in achieving their goals are more successful than those that react to internal change (Q6).</p><p>Separate, but related, to the existence of a guiding goal or mission statement is the type of statement that a partnership uses. Written statements are more formal, and, thus, more institutionalized than less formal verbal agreements. This model posits that a more formal statement (Q3C) will result in greater partnership success. These data do not support this hypothesis.</p><p>Three other hypotheses concerning goal development are also not supported by these data. First, it is hypothesized that partnerships that design goals to achieve a practical vision for the future are more likely to succeed (DV) than partnerships that design goals in reaction to internal changes (Q7). Second, partnerships that have clear goals are posited to be more successful than those partnerships that do not (Q1A).</p><p>Finally, partnerships that have some flexibility in the day to day practice of goal achievement are hypothesized to have a greater chance of succeeding than those partnerships that try to rely on specific policies for every situation (Q11).</p><p>The next variables are those that measure the level of uncertainty a partnership faces, and how partnerships deal with that uncertainty. The set also includes variables that measure the amount of support that exists in the community for the partnership.</p><p>One of the most fundamental aspects of any partnership is the environment in which it exists. This model theorizes that, all things considered, partnerships that exist in simple environments will have a greater chance at succeeding. These data support several hypotheses built around this theory but fail to support others.</p><p>As the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">5</ref>-1 shows, one hypothesis posits that partnerships that exist in simple external environments (Q13) are more likely to face lower levels of internal uncertainty (Q15) than those partnerships existing in complex environments. This hypothesis is supported by these data.</p><p>The next two hypotheses are extensions of the previous ones. Thus, partnerships with low levels of internal uncertainty (Q15) are hypothesized to cope better with the uncertainty they face by adapting (Q17), and, those that adapt to uncertainty (Q17) are more likely to succeed (DV). The data support both of these claims.</p><p>In a set of corollary hypotheses, partnerships that exist in a simple external environment (Q13) are hypothesized to face lower levels of external uncertainty (Q16), and, thus, will have little trouble coping with uncertainty through adaptation (Q17).</p><p>Again, these data support this set of hypotheses.</p><p>Internal (Q15) and external (Q16) uncertainties are also hypothesized to influence the internal relationships of a partnership (Q14). These data support the hypotheses that lower levels of internal uncertainty (Q15) and external uncertainty (Q16) will result in greater stability in the internal relationships of the partnership (Q14). This higher level of relationship stability (Q14), however, is not supported by these data as increasing a partnership's likelihood of success (DV).</p><p>Several variables are hypothesized to influence community perception, and, thus, partnership success. Media support (Q28A) is hypothesized to have a positive impact on community perception (Q24) with the media being willing and able to inform community members about the partnership's efforts. This hypothesis is supported by these data.</p><p>Community support (Q29A) is also hypothesized to influence community perception. Thus, it is hypothesized that community individuals, or small groups of individuals such as clergy or teachers, will have a positive impact on community perception through their activities and dissemination. This hypothesis is not supported by these data.</p><p>A few instrumental people (Q25) can often be vocal and help influence community perception (Q24) through their actions, a hypothesis that is not supported by these data. However, strong leadership (Q26) and a partnership catalyst (Q27A) both have a positive influence on community perception, as confirmed by these data.</p><p>The influence of positive community perception (Q24) on partnership success is supported by these data with those partnerships reporting good perceptions also reporting greater levels of partnership success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reconstruction Of The Model</head><p>As Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>-2 shows the reconstructed paths of influences with the recalculated standardized beta weights and their levels of statistical significance. The reader will notice that as the model is simplified in this reconstruction process, the influence of a partnership having a goal or mission statement looses its level of statistical significance.</p><p>This change is noted in the figure by a lack of bold typeface in the reported statistic.</p><p>In addition, the reader will notice the two paths located at the bottom of the figure. These paths show that although the variables have no influence on partnership success (DV), per se, they do have a span of influence. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that partnerships that have a more active debate about means to achieve their goal(s) (Q8) are also more likely to consider more alternatives in working toward those goals (Q9). They also support the claim that partnerships that have one or two instrumental people bringing the partnership together (Q25) will also have one or two dominant goals (Q1C). Substantive comments about these, and the rest of the statistical model findings, are reserved for the discussion section of this chapter.  Moving from left to right and starting at the top of Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>-2, the graphic shows that when there are only a few key people in a leadership capacity brining the partnership together (Q25) there is less discussion of the goals of the partnership (Q2) than when there are many influential people (.133/.016). The data support a similar finding with respect to the presence of a catalyst in the partnership. Thus, when there is a catalyst (Q27A) present, these data indicate that there is a greater propensity for partnerships to discuss their goals (Q2) (.151/.016).</p><p>Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that partnerships that have an active stakeholder (catalyst) advocating their work (Q27A) are more likely to have an overall goal or mission statement (Q3A). Both the level of goal discussion and the existence of a mission statement are hypothesized to influence the degree to which a partnership's goals are measurable. These data support both of these hypotheses.</p><p>Partnerships that discuss their goal(s) in greater detail (Q2) are likely to have more measurable goal(s) (Q20) (.287/.000) as are partnerships with mission statements (Q3A) (.129/.020) . The direct path of influence of an overall mission or goal statement (Q3A)</p><p>on partnership ceases to be statistically significant in the reconstructed model.</p><p>The model continues, from left to right, with the path that demonstrates the hypothesis that partnerships with more measurable goals (Q20) are more likely to achieve their goal(s) (Q21). These data strongly support this hypothesis (.387/.000). These data also support the hypothesis that partnerships that are successful in achieving their goal(s) (Q21) are also more likely to be politically successful (.455/.000).</p><p>The type of external environment in which a partnership exists has several paths of influence on its political success. As Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>-2 demonstrates, partnerships that exist in a simpler external environment (Q13) are less likely to face both internal uncertainty (Q15) (.309/.000) and external uncertainty (Q16) (.270/.000).</p><p>Internal and external uncertainty, in turn, have their own paths of influence on other variables. The amount of internal uncertainty a partnership faces (Q15) has an influence on its ability to cope with that uncertainty (Q17). Partnerships exhibiting lower levels of uncertainty cope better than those with higher levels (-.245/.000). It also influences the internal relations among the partnership stakeholders. Thus, partnerships with lower levels of internal uncertainty (Q15) are more likely to have stable internal relations among stakeholders (Q14) (.204/.001).</p><p>The same influences are true for external uncertainty, with partnerships having low levels of external uncertainty (Q16) better able to cope with the uncertainty they face (Q17) (-.166/.005). These partnerships are also more likely to have greater stability in their internal relations among partnership stakeholders (Q14) (.207/.001).</p><p>These data also support the hypothesis that partnerships that cope with uncertainty (Q17) are also more successful (.136/.004). In addition, partnerships that cope with uncertainty (Q17) are also more likely to have greater stability in the internal relations among stakeholders. It must be pointed out that although stable internal relations are no doubt important to partnerships, these data do not support the hypothesis that there is any direct influence on partnership success. In this reconstructed model, the reader will note this path is not statistically significant at the .05 level and therefore excluded from Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>-2.</p><p>Turning to the last set of theoretical paths, the model addresses some of the factors from the environment. The media's importance in the success of public/private partnerships in education is supported by these data. Thus, the media has an indirect influence of partnership success through several paths.</p><p>Again referencing Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>-2 and moving from left to right, the media is seen to influence community perception, with partnerships having the support of the media (Q28A) more likely to have a positive community image (Q24) (.141/.012). Partnerships that have a champion(s) that exhibits leadership as a defining characteristic (Q26) are more likely to have a positive community image (Q24) (.110/.049), as are those that have an identifiable catalyst (Q27A) (.111/.049).</p><p>These data support the hypothesis that community perception is important to the political success of public/private partnerships in education. Thus, partnerships with more positive images are more likely to be those partnerships that are successful (.214/.000) in their partnering endeavors.</p><p>This discussion now turns to looking at the general findings supported by these data and the implications of these findings for partnerships. This chapter concludes by addressing topics for future research in public/private partnerships in education.</p><p>Tables 6-1 through 6-5 displays the findings from the above analysis by the partnership dimension (page 2-17) measured. As The existence of a mission or goal statement (Q34) also influences the degree to which goals are measurable (Q20). Although the influence is not as strong (.129), these data support the theory that partnerships that are focused enough to have such a statement are also going to have measurable goals.</p><p>The data also support the theory that partnerships with more measurable goals (Q20) are also going to achieve those goals (Q21). This finding is moderate in statistical strength (.387) and is one of the two strong relationships to come from these data. The other strong relationship is the one between achieving partnership goals (Q21) and partnership success (DV/.455). This finding is not only supported by these data, but confirms to the theory of partnership success posited by this work. Conversely, partnerships struggling to achieve their goals are going to face a much tougher road to success.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">6</ref>-2 summarizes the findings from the data concerning the ability of partnerships to adapt to their external and internal environments. As the theory on page 2-18 details, this dimension can be thought of as rigidity ---flexibility. These data do an adequate job of supporting this theory.</p><p>Hence, these data clearly demonstrate that the complexity of the external environment in which a partnership exists can have multiple effects on that partnership.</p><p>First, the complexity of the external environment influences the level of internal uncertainty that a partnership faces. Among the detriments of having to face high levels of internal uncertainty is strain, and drain, on people and resources. Most partnerships cannot spare the resources to deal with such uncertainty, and would rather focus their scarce resources on achieving their goals.</p><p>The external environment (Q13) also influences the level of external uncertainty (Q16) a partnership faces, although the effect is not as strong (.270) as it is on internal uncertainty (Q15/.309). As with internal uncertainty, this observation indicates that partnerships existing in complex environments are going to see a strain on resources as they struggle to achieve their goals and cope with external uncertainty. Partnerships that face lower levels of internal and external uncertainty do a better job of dealing with uncertainty (Q17). There is some difference in the influence that internal and external uncertainty have on this ability with internal uncertainty (Q15/-.245) having a greater impact than external uncertainty (Q16/-.166).</p><p>The levels of both internal and external uncertainty influence the stability of internal partnership relations. The effects of these two variables are very similar on stability (Q14), with external uncertainty (Q16) exerting a slightly greater influence than internal uncertainty (Q15/.207, .204, respectively).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">6</ref>-3 show the significant findings from the third theoretical dimension, the ability of the partnership to approach achieving their goals with a degree of broad vision.</p><p>Having a mission or vision statement (Q3A) has a small influence on partnerships having measurable goals (Q20/.129). It seems reasonable to expect partnerships that place time, effort, and commitment to the development of a mission statement to also devote resources to designing goals that are measurable.</p><p>Likewise, the data show that partnerships that actively debate the means to achieve their goals (Q8) are also more likely to consider more alternatives (Q9/.414).</p><p>Although this finding has no direct statistical influence on partnership success, it certainly can have a substantive impact on the practice of partnering. Hence, for those partnerships that are subject to political scrutiny, the process of alternative development The number of instrumental people involved at the beginning of a partnership (Q25) has multiple influences on the partnership dynamic. With more people involved, there is more discussion about the goals of the partnership (Q2/-.133). Although this relationship is not a strong one, the data do support the notion that involving more stakeholders up front is one way to avoid groupthink.</p><p>Conversely, the data also show that the more people that are involved (Q25) the more goals (Q1C) there will be that are important to the partnership (.116). Thus, partnerships can be faced with a dilemma. Although increasing the number of stakeholders is good in terms of discussing the details of the goals, it also increases the number of goals that become important to the partnership. The theory posited in this model predicts that increasing the number of goals will hurt a partnership's chance for political success. These data do not support this path of the model, however. Leadership has an indirect influence on partnership success via community perception, according to these data. Hence, partnerships that have an advocate that exhibited leadership as a defining characteristics are more likely to have more positive images in their broader communities.</p><p>An individual, or a small group of individuals, also have a statistical influence on partnership success. Those partnerships that can identify such a catalyst are more likely to discuss partnership goals, have a mission or goal statement, and to have a positive community image. Of the these three direct influences, the strongest is on having a goal or mission statement. Clearly, the role of catalyst is an important one that is multidimensional.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">6</ref>-5 shows the two paths from the popular support dimension that are statistically significant.</p><p>Thus, those partnerships that glean strong positive image in the community are more likely to be successful in their efforts. In addition, those partnerships that gain the support of the media are those more likely to garner the support of the community.</p><p>Although neither of these paths are strong, these data do support the claim that these relationships are important components of the partnering process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Seven: Implications and Conclusions ========== PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN EDUCATION =========</head><p>Over the last twenty years or so the business community has taken a renewed interest in public education. Prior to the release of A Nation At Risk in 1984 (National Commission for Excellence), the private sector had all but completely withdrawn from the education scene that they once dominated in the early part of the last century <ref type="bibr">(Timpane, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Their reluctance to participate in an political process beyond their span of control was overwhelmed by their dire need for a quality workforce -and, indeed, an increasing incidence of broader social problems that were, and still are, directly and indirectly related to the quality of public education.</p><p>One way in which the private sector contributes to the improvement of public education is through partnering activities with school buildings, districts, and broader systems to develop programs, create opportunities, and to lend their expertise to those challenged with the effective and efficient administration of public education.</p><p>The literature on Public/Private Partnerships in Education is becoming quite extensive with many works being produced in the field of education. In addition, many not-for-profit and governmental institutes, agencies, and think-tanks have come onto the scene in the last five-to-ten years conducting studies and evaluations and facilitating more effective partnering activities.</p><p>Most of these evaluations and studies belong in the category of "best practices" and provide existing and potential stakeholders with "how to" lists of actions. However, these works fail to offer empirical support for their best practice claims. The data are non-existent or anecdotal, at best. Another weakness in the body of literature is the lack of solid theory development on what constitutes a successful partnership. This research attempts to make a first cut at addressing these two weaknesses in the literature. To accomplish this task, a critical assumption is made. That is, the view of partnering as a political process is accepted as axiomatic. Not a single work in the literature -as discovered by this author -defines partnering in this way, nor does any work define partnership success as political success. To discover the applicability of these assumptions a model of partnership success is constructed and tested. Although the analytic path analysis supports several of the hypothesized paths, it is important to the overall intent of this research to move beyond the mere statistical significance and to recall the substantive relevance of the overall findings. This dual emphasis on statistical and substantive significance reasserts the importance of the theoretical model developed in the first three chapters. Seeing the big picture or adopting a global perspective of the partnering process requires returning to the descriptive findings detailed in chapter three Hence, the path model's strength is in identifying the statistically significant relationships that may be generalized to the broader partnership population. It is not adequate, however, for communicating the importance of several key model elements of the partnership process. Recalling the findings from the stakeholder interviews reinforces the notion of partnering as a process. Thus, with the qualitative data in mind, it takes very little effort to see the validity in arguing that the partnership process is the embryonic sack that nourishes the identified theoretical components. In a vein similar to that argued by Kingdon (1984), the six elements or "streams" must come together during a window of opportunity. An opportunity created by the partnering process.</p><p>Where this theory of partnership success diverges from Kingdon's (1984) work, however, is in the rejection of an orthogonal relationship between elements and in the acceptance of the non-predictive emergent nature of Public/Private Partnerships in Education. Thus, the identified elements are not completely independent of the other elements, and, indeed, share many non-recursive pathways. This research began by asking: "How well do the data fit the model of Partnership Success?" In terms of the analytic path model, overall these data do not fit as well as expected. Thus, only a few of the hypothesized paths are statistically significant at the 0.05 level, and, when comparing the bi-variate correlations to the total effects of the direct and indirect paths, these data do not support the model to a strong degree. With these limitations in mind, however, it is important to stress that several parts of the model are supported by these data and that this is the first empirical work testing many claims held as 'common sense' by partnership practitioners and scholars alike. Given a theoretical structure too complex to test with one statistical model and a data set with a limited number of variables, what conclusions can be drawn at the metaanalytic level? Again, the univariate findings become important. Thus, although the global model suffers from a modest deficit of explanatory power, there are numerous findings that are of statistical and/or substantive significance. In addition, these findings prove useful in better understanding what success of a Public/Private Partnership in Education means, and the contributing factors to that success. In the following paragraphs, the findings from the three data analyses are weighed against the research questions to determine the value of this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Success Of Partnerships</head><p>The second set of research questions concerns "Partnership Success:" how partners define it, how successful their partnerships are, and how likely stakeholders are to continue to participate in their partnerships or in future partnerships. These data indicate that stakeholders are very committed to their partnerships and will continue to participate.</p><p>In an unexpected finding, these data show that the partnerships represented in this work are mature partnerships and that there is a lack of variability in some of the critical measures. One reason for this lack of variability in the key variables is the high degree of maturity exhibited by the partnerships sampled for this research. Thus, the average age of partnerships responding to the mail survey is approximately five years (mean=5 years/median=5.5 years). This high degree of maturity indicates that these partnerships are, indeed, successful according to the political definition posited by this work.</p><p>Thus, although the analytic path model has mixed results in predicting a global model of success, it is important to note that the univariate findings suggest that continued participation and participation in future partnerships are important to the stakeholders responding to the mail survey. In addition to the near consensus of continued participation, the univariate findings also show that these respondents rate their partnerships as successful and are satisfied with their levels of success.</p><p>Given the maturity level and the continued success of these partnerships, this work's descriptive findings may be interpreted and used as an empirically based "best practices" for partnering.</p><p>In addition to these univariate findings, when analyzing the phone interview data and open-ended question from the mail survey, there is a high degree of consensus on what partners mean by success. Stakeholders relate that their partnerships must be more focused on outcomes and achieving the goals established by the partnership. This emphasis on achieving measurable goals is not only good news for those who evaluate partnerships, but for all stakeholders, funders, and participants concerned with partnerships in education.</p><p>As detailed in the early chapters of this work, greater emphasis on accountability and performance are becoming key tenants for those individuals and institutions that fund and support Public/Private Partnerships in Education. These data show that partnerships are receiving the message and are focusing on tying programs to measurable outcomes.</p><p>This changing emphasis has two consequences for partnerships. Thus, program design and evaluation will be more productive endeavors with built-in feed back mechanisms relating outcomes to interventions.</p><p>Second, along with greater efficacy in programs due to strengthened logic models, partnerships will also benefit from greater political success. Thus, these data indicate that stakeholders like to participate in successful partnerships -those that have achieved measurable goals. The lesson for less mature partnerships is that by emphasizing outcomes and goal achievement, partnerships increase their political viability as well as facilitate more powerful evaluations. Perhaps this last benefit is an obvious finding to an outside perspective, but it is also one often loss on key stakeholders involved in partnering processes.</p><p>The model tested herein posits that success is a function of six partnering elements. The following paragraphs describe the important findings concerning the importance of goals, the interaction with the environment, the role of visioning as a means to an end, the role of leadership, and the importance of support and a stabilizing agent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals And How To Achieve Them</head><p>These data show that there is a high level of congruency between the literature and the participating stakeholders on the important role of goals on partnership success.</p><p>Thus, an overwhelming percentage of these stakeholders report that having clear goals is an on-going benefit to their partnership. In addition, deliberation over goals and how to achieve those goals is a common trait of the partnerships represented by the participants.</p><p>The reconstructed pathways in the statistical model only partially support the hypothesis that clear goals have an affect on partnership success. Although there is no influence of clear goals on success, other "goal" variables have direct and indirect effects. Clear goals lead to more measurable goals, which, in turn, influence if the goals are achieved. This last path is very important to partnerships since the ability to achieve goals has a very strong influence on partnership success.</p><p>Hence, it is important for partnerships give forethought to the types of goals set by the partnership and to think about how those goals can be operationalized for an effective evaluation. This last comment relates to how partnerships know that their goals have been achieved. An unmeasured variable missing from this work is how partnerships know when they have achieved their goals.</p><p>This achievement of goals is most likely easier to identify when the goals are clear cut and simplistic. However, not all goals will fit into such a category and it then becomes important to understand how partnerships will know goal achievement has</p><p>occurred. One answer is to encourage all partnerships to engage in continuous evaluation either conducted in-house or by an out side evaluator.</p><p>The general point, however, is that partnerships must start early in defining what it is they want to achieve and define how they are going to get there. Although this type of deliberation has costs and can frustrate the "action" oriented type of partner, in the long run the benefits are clear to the partnership.</p><p>In terms of the focus of the partnership, the univariate data provided mixed support for the theory. A vast majority of the respondents relate their use both tried and true methods and the development of new solutions. The theoretical foundation suggests that creative solutions are a trait associated with greater levels of success. There are two possible interpretations of this disconnect. On one hand, the theory may need revision, or, on the other hand, perhaps the partnerships represented by the stakeholder sample could benefit from such a creative process. Given the dichotomy of the two possibilities, it seems this situation is best addressed by future investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Partnership Environments</head><p>The day-to-day realities of administering a partnership manifest in the measures of partnership adaptability and flexibility. A clear majority of stakeholders report dealing with internal and external uncertainty, but at the same time their partnerships are reported to be coping well. This finding is consistent with the initial premise that partnerships that adapt well to their environments are those that will be more successful.</p><p>These data present a fair amount of variation in the type and degree of uncertainty that partnerships face on a day-to-day basis. These participants report facing various levels of complexity, levels of internal and external uncertainty, and abilities in coping with that uncertainty.</p><p>Only one path from this set of variables has a direct influence on partnership success, and this influence is weak. The ability of a partnership to cope with uncertainty has a direct influence, although other variables have indirect influences. It must be noted, however, that these data indicate that other dynamics are at work in partnership space.</p><p>Thus, although they have very little influence on partnership success, the reconstructed model shows that the variables of environment, internal uncertainty, and external uncertainty do affect the ability of a partnership to cope with uncertainty, as well as influencing its internal relations.</p><p>The lack of support by these data for the theorized relationships is an unsuspected finding of this research, and requires a few comments. First, one possible reason for this lack of empirical support, assuming the underlying theory is sound, is that this model of success is miss-specified. Clearly, it is difficult to model highly complex relationship like those found in partnership space. A second explanation is that there may be a high degree of measurement error. This error is also a distinct possibility given the complexity of the concepts under consideration. Multiple measures of a single concept may produce more robust results. Third, the possibility also exists that the theory is incorrect and these relationships have no influence on partnership success.</p><p>At this point, it is impossible to know which of the alternatives is most plausible.</p><p>In the future, competing models incorporating different measures may be built and tested</p><p>to answer this question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Visioning</head><p>It is clear from these data that the current climate in the partnerships represented by this sample is one that stresses the importance of mission/vision statements. A vast majority of the participants report having such documents and rate them as precise statements rather than vague ones. Thus, these data indicate that such statements not only serve as a rallying point for the partnership, but bring a level of focus to the partnership, as well.</p><p>In addition, the path analysis supports the hypothesis that having a mission or vision statement has an influence on measurable goals, and thus, an indirect effect on partnership success. These data also support the theory that the level of debate over the means to achieve the vision influences the number of alternatives considered. As with the paths noted above, although this last path of influence has no direct or indirect effect on partnership success, as measured, it has relevance to the study of partnering.</p><p>The process of debating means and of considering alternatives has an unmeasured role in partnering efforts. Often in the world of stakeholders, getting people to the table is a major struggle in and of itself. To attract new stakeholders and build partnership power it becomes necessary to open the floor to new ideas. These ideas are not always good, and sometimes the effort proves frustrating, but the process is as important as the immediate outcome. These data hint at this importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leadership and Advocacy</head><p>The univariate data overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that a partnership advocate is a critical element is developing a successful partnership. These stakeholders reported in great majorities that there are only a few instrumental people involved early in the partnering process. In addition, leadership is a defining characteristic of these individuals and they act as an important catalyst to get the partnership up and running.</p><p>Human assets are as important to partnering as one suspects. These data support the common sense hypothesis that leadership is a defining characteristic of those individuals reported to be instrumental in the development of partnerships.</p><p>The literature is rich with advice and methods to develop strong leadership skills, so there is no reason to belabor the point. From this work, however, it is not clear that leadership is directly associated with successful partnering. The importance of a charismatic leader to an organization is unquestioned, but very few leaders have this trait, and even fewer partners have such a leader.</p><p>What these data support is the notion that effective leaders make differences to the success of their partnerships in small ways. From acting as a catalyst in forming the partnership, to working in and with the community to build strong ties, and in facilitating the development of goals and means, it is effective leaders who make partnerships happen.</p><p>As a partnership leaves its infancy and starts to coalesce into a routinized operation, the theory of success holds that a stabilization agent will come to the forefront of the partnership to provide a new style of leadership. These data support this claim with eight-in-ten stakeholders identifying at least some change in key personnel. In addition nine-in-ten relate that one single individual can be identified as a having a stabilizing effect on the partnership. Finally, nine-in-ten report that the one identified individual or group is important to the success of the partnership.</p><p>It is theorized that once the partnership is in motion, the media play an important role in building popular support and that this popular support is extremely important to the political success of the partnership. Theses descriptive data fully support this contention. A majority of stakeholders report the media playing an important role in forming support for the partnership. In addition, there is almost unanimity in the belief that the community's perception of the partnership is important to its success.</p><p>Attention is now turned to the future and the presentation of some topics for greater in-depth research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential Future Investigation</head><p>The findings from this investigation raise as many questions as they answer.</p><p>Although these data present some compelling insights into the political success of Public/Private Partnerships in Education the door has only been set ajar, and much opportunity exists for future work. These opportunities fit into two themes, each addressed briefly in the following paragraphs.</p><p>First, the fact that there is no single definition of partnering opens a wide range of possibilities. Care should be taken, however, in any endeavor that might investigate the possibility of developing a standardized definition. Efforts should balance the benefits of having such a standard against the costs of restricting inclusion of the great diversity that exists in the partnering world.</p><p>Second, the opportunity exists to narrow the scope of this work into its component pieces for a more detailed look. Each of the six dimensions addressed in this work could easily support individual research. An overarching task, then, is to look at greater model specificity and how the individual components work.</p><p>For instance, there is an opportunity to work with existing and potential partnerships in developing their goals in a fashion which facilitates achieving those goals.</p><p>What are common goals across partnerships and can these goals be standardized? A standard goal will assist evaluators in developing a set of measures that will inform the partnership that their goal has been achieved. They also allow partnerships to spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time to "cherry pick" the goals that best suit their mission.</p><p>Another opportunity exists to study internal and external uncertainties and how partnerships adapt to their environments. As a hybrid organization, the many questions asked of other organizational forms now find new relevance in the education arena.</p><p>Greater measurement of how goals and vision interact is another opportunity, as is the related topic of the difference between synergy and entropy and the role of leadership in a partnership. A specific model incorporating these variables would prove very useful in understanding why some partnerships are more successful than others are.</p><p>Future work should also entail looking at an enhanced model of success using each of the success measures as dependent variables. Although the scale measure used in this work is a more robust measure of success, these data suggest that each component should be analyzed separately to see if the independent variables have different spheres of influence on the autonomous measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding Remarks</head><p>As a first attempt to build and test an empirical model of Public/Private Partnerships In Education, this research has produced some interesting results. Although not all of the findings are what the model predicts, the overall results prove very useful in bringing about a greater understanding of the partnership process.</p><p>In addition, these data support most of the theorized relationships and the reconstructed model shows that numerous paths to success are statistically significant. In attempting to model success, this work has also opened the door to future research in a policy area that has not been exposed to typical levels of analytic rigor by those in the policy sciences.</p><p>Researching complex policy topics requires high levels of abstraction and precise measurement -two goals that are often difficult to achieve. Yet, if the study of successful Public/ Private Partnerships In Education is to move beyond the anecdotal and best practices stage, it is important to meet these goals.</p></div>

Therefore, since bureaucratic organization is only one model of collective instrumentality, special consideration is now given to an alternative model of organization.What proves inadequate in most discussions about collective instrumental behavior is that the initial set of social relations that give rise to the organization are never, themselves, explicitly discussed. Although they are treated as a technology implicitly by design and in application, these basic relations are very rarely discussed in an open fashion. This lack of attention given to social organization as a technology proves perplexing given the volumes of literature written in the areas of administration and organizational theory. Clearly, however, the importance of human organization, within the context of modernity, has been recognized in the literature.</figDesc></figure>

With Public/Private Partnerships, stakeholders are being ask to often times work outside their normal range of operations. They perform new tasks, and are ask to cooperate with other stakeholders who may or may not have the capacity to achieve the shared goal. The internal environment can bring many deficiencies of the partnership to the forefront of the agenda and result in misdirected energy.It is important to point out at this time that the real threats to partnerships are not necessarily specific internal or external challenges, although they too are certainly distinct possibilities. However, the more general classification is that of environmental uncertainty. Not knowing the consequences of actions can ham-string a partnership just as easily as it does any other type of organization. As kettle notes in his discussion of not-for-profit agencies What [theorists] do not realize or acknowledge is that uncertainty -not lack of competition -is the fundamental problem for government and business alike (Kettle, 1993, p. 201).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>There have been very few academic works written that address that topic of educational partnerships, let alone works that develop a theory of formulation and implementation. This lack of a sound theoretical base dictates that a general model of educational partnerships be developed prior to any empirical undertaking. Considering this situation, the skeleton of such a model is outlined above. Although there are numerous models of policy formulation and implementation (Brown and Wildavsky, 1983; Majone and Wildavsky, 1979), the policy model used for this dissertation is grounded in the policy as evolution school of thought(Kingdon, 1984; Pressman   and Wildavsky, 1984).As argued by Leppert and Holp (1992), all policies emerge as policy participants interact within an organizational structure. This work goes beyond other theories of policy evolution(Kingdon, 1984; March and Olsen, 1989) by adding participant interaction with organization structure as an important factor in the policy process. In addition, a typology of organizational structure, based on the work of Burrell and Morgan (1994), is graphically displayed to serve as the theoretical underpinning of this model. Chapters five and six look at the findings from a Survey of Partners to see how well these data support this theoretical model.Chapter five presents the univariate findings while chapter six develops and tests a multivariate statistical model of partnership success. This work concludes with a final chapter that summarizes the contribution of this dissertation and suggests potential partnership topics for both theoretical and empirical work.Chapter Four: Research Protocol ============ PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN EDUCATION ============RESEARCH DESIGNThis dissertation utilizes a two-stage data collection methodology incorporating both qualitative and quantitative efforts in order to more accurately describe and measure variation within Public/Private Partnerships in Education. As a triangulation approach (Singleton, 1993), this methodology borrows heavily from empowerment evaluation(Fetterman, 1996)  in that the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods are employed in building the research program around the notion of emergent themes(Fetterman, 1996)  and that the findings will have 'real world' applicability.In the first stage, telephone and face-to-face interviews with a select sample of existing partners in education were conducted. The data gathering process in this stage was a blended, or structured, qualitative methodology (Spradley, 1979) designed to aid the researcher in building the context of the research topic. The overarching goal was to learn more about partnerships in the attempt to facilitate future data collection with the critical assumption of a priori researcher knowledge remaining intact.</figDesc></figure>

This chapter begins with a discussion of how survey respondents and phone interview subjects define the concept of "Public/Private Partnership." This discussion is then followed with the presentation of the survey's univariate findings, incorporating supporting data from the open-ended responses and followed by additional data from the telephone interviews. As a presentation of a cohesive collection of quantitative and qualitative data, this chapter gives an integrated picture of stakeholder views by combining responses to targeted closed-ended questions with the broad strokes and rich insight of open-ended interviews.</figDesc></figure>

Adopting the concept of goals and goal formation as a critical factor in the success of Public/Private Partnerships in Education, the stakeholders responding to this survey were asked several questions about the role and the importance of goals to their respective partnerships. The questions asked, and the responses gleaned, about the role of goals in the partnering process constitute the first portion of this chapter dedicated to the components of the theoretical constructs outlined in the previous two chapters.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>questions are formed around the phone interview data and examine what partnership stakeholders think about the success of their partnerships; how they define it, how they measure it, and if they think their current efforts are, indeed, successful. These data about partnership success are important not only for their descriptive value, but because they are also used in the next chapter as the dependent variables in a multivariate analysis of partnership success. Along with the summary of the closed-ended questions, responses to the openended question, "Please briefly describe what you mean by success," asked on the survey of stakeholders, are blended in.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_11"><head>DISCUSSION</head><label></label><figDesc>This chapter concludes by taking a general overview of the data presented. Responses from the Survey of Partners, both open-ended and closed-ended, and the findings from the 38 in-depth telephone interviews with stakeholders from Flint and Cincinnati have been detailed above. Taken together, these data support several of the hypothesized components of success in Public/Private Partnerships in Education.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 6-1 demonstrates, not all of the hypothesized relationships in the full model are statistically significant at the .05 level (those coefficients that are in standard print are significant at the .05 level). In order to create a more manageable representation of partnership functionality this discussion now turns to the development of a reconstructed model of partnership success. As the reader will see in Figure 6-1, under each path of influence two figures are reported. The first is the standardized beta weight and the second is the two-tailed significance. Based on a methodology used by Kenny (1998) to reconstruct the statistical model, all paths from the full model that are not statistically significant at the .05 level are removed. The regression equations are then recalculated, and the new coefficients reported. This re-estimated model is designated the reduced, or trimmed model (Kenny, 1998). Of the twenty-six variables entered into the initial model, only four of the exogenous variables and eight of the endogenous variables prove to have any statistical significance in explaining the dependent success scale. There are also two paths of influence of interest that have neither an indirect or direct influence on partnership success in the reconstructed model, but prove useful in understanding partnerships, and are statistically significant at the .05 level.</figDesc></figure>

To answer this question requires returning to the formal research questions. We begin with our global or general research question, and proceed through each of the more specific research questions as enumerated at the end of chapter one.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The discussion now focuses on detailing the argument that it is through defining partnership success in political terms, i.e., viability, that the horse stays in front of the cart. This task is accomplished by looking at the role of partnerships and the importance of evaluation. Assessing process ( for example, how many volunteers participated for how much time, how the program was organized, and how particular resources were distributed) can be made relativelyThe last reason for privileging partnership process over outcomes has to do with the predominance of masculine metaphors in the social sciences. Czarniawska(1996)  argues that the ecological metaphors popular in the social sciences tend to overlook softer, or more feminine, metaphors. This oversight is very real in the realm of program evaluation where outcomes and outputs are favored over softer issues such as the development of culture. In a recent evaluation of School-To-Work (STW) in Ohio's Region 4, The Center for Urban and Public Affairs (CUPA, 1998) includes a set of measures intended to determine the importance of developing a</figDesc><table><row><cell>challenged to use the 'tool' of partnership to support school improvement (Otterbourg, 1986, p.</cell></row><row><cell>1)."</cell></row><row><cell>"With the expanding role of partnerships and the emergence of the business sector as a easy and straightforward through accurate record keeping and observation (Otterbourg, 1990, p.</cell></row><row><cell>viable partner in achieving common goals (U.S. HUD, 1980)" the emphasis must be placed on 4)."

(http://www.ed.gov/pubs/Partners/case2.html August 14, 1998)." Indeed, stakeholders are learning from past experiences and the level of involvement and the number of partnerships continue to grow despite all of the associated turmoil. In fact, "Over the past five years, formal partnership programs have sprung up all over the United States, Indeed, evaluation of Public/Private Partnerships in Education has become an important component of the partnership process. As funding opportunities became more competitive in the early 1990s, it was necessary for partnership stakeholders to begin showing empirically how the dollars were impacting the educational process and the levels of achievement. Furthermore, as partnerships across the nation became more concerned with evaluation, a body of literature emerged to help them. More extensive research on a range of partnership programs -programs that were developed by education, business, government, and not-forprofit organizations -is currently in process through such organizations as the National Association of Partners in Education (NAPE), the U.S. Department of Education's (USDOE) Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), the National Alliance of Business (NAB), Council for Aid to Education (CFAE), and the Conference Board (Otterbourg, 1990, p. 6). Otterbourg (1990) also identifies two potential paths for the evaluation of Public/Private Partnerships in Education. Assessing program process and assessing program outcome. This research follows the former, while acknowledging the importance of the latter. However, where this research differs is in the definition of process assessment. Otterbourg (1990) states: "success of partnerships through their outcomes. Although much work has been done in this area, this research takes a different approach to evaluating Public/Private Partnerships in Education. The reasons for this divergence deserve to be addressed, albeit briefly. The first set of reasons are driven by values and logic. Thus, although the value of outcome based measures are accepted as a necessary component of any program or project, the premise of this research is that in order to provide any outcomes, whatsoever, a partnership must first exist and function. In addition, the "real world" of politics is full of examples of organizations, bureaus, and/or their programs that exist for no apparent reason---other than the political clout necessary to exist. The second set of reasons are grounded in the ontology and epistemology of partnerships. Hence, what evaluators can know about outcomes, and how they can come to know it is very tentative at this stage in the Public/Private Partnerships in Education lifecycle. Given the diversity and complexity of Public/Private Partnerships in Education across the nation, a general model of outcome based measures is not feasible at this point in time, and most likely will not be in the foreseeable future. Clearly, outcome based measures can be developed and implemented on a case by case basis, but the development of a general model is still a goal for future research. STW culture in relation to STW initiatives, including partnership development. Although this report is limited in its scope, the findings indicate that those school buildings that have a stronger STW culture also have stronger relationships with the business. The implication for this research is that strong partnerships may have a direct impact on outcomes, but these relationships must not only exist, but thrive, first.</p></note></figure>

A clear example of the limitations evaluators face is the work recently conducted by Mathematica Inc (1998). Their effort is in conducting the first national evaluation of School-To-Work initiatives and they are struggling to find an efficacious methodology to achieve the outcome based measures first desired 20 years ago. It is certainly important to evaluate program outcomes in order to learn what programs work and which do not.

In a "Partnerships in Education Journal" article</p>Otterbourg (1990)    </p>relates: "Leaders recognize that the assessment of both program process and outcome is needed (p. 4)." But even this acknowledgement of the dual importance of process and outcome neglects the importance of the political aspect of partnerships, as does most of the literature arguing for process evaluation.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_10"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>A critical supposition of this research is that clear partnership mission statements and definition of goals are extremely important to the political viability of partnerships. Although, for the practical purposes of this work, the two concepts of mission and goals are treated as one, there is a formal distinction between a mission statement and a goal statement. Mission</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p>statements are about communicating the shared vision, or ideology, of the partnership. They identify the scope and scale of an institution and help to articulate the community values by which an institution determines programs that are viable</p>(Peterson, et al., 1997, p. 171)</p>.</p></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_11"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Partnerships exist in very complex environments, ones that stakeholders have very little control over. If local, state, or federal programs have their own goals that cause cross-purposes the level of conflict can erode partnership viability. What can partnerships do to develop clear and concise goals? Developing partnership goals is much like the larger process of developing policies, programs and interventions. As such, the same basic logic model of policy formulation may be applied to partnership goal development. This model is: Identify the problem to be addressed,</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p><p>However, broad communities and funders (governmental or private) started looking at partnerships differently beginning in the early 1990s and are now expecting efficient and effective organizational design. As Peterson, et al. (1997) argue: "…by re-conceptualizing the process of mission clarification, from one of influencing external publics to one of guiding institutional strategic choices, the vital contribution of mission definition…[to]…planning can be better understood (p. 172)." Clearly, all three functions of clear mission and goal statements are important to the viability of partnerships.</p>The literature on policy formulation is full of examples of the need for clear and concise goals. Without such clarity, policy is too ambiguous and left vulnerable to interpretation by those assigned to implement it. Indeed, the most important facet of goal formulation is the linking of actions to goals and objectives. This logic model must be clear and well thought out if partnerships are to move beyond the symbolic into the realm of action.</p>Another aspect of clear goals is the importance of consistency. Starling (1988) relates four types of consistency policy makers should be concerned with. They are equally relevant to partnerships. First, goals should be consistent with objectives. Second, goals should be consistent with one another and not work at cross-purposes. Third, there should be some external consistency to ensure that the goals are not conflicting with programs or policies set by other agencies or governments.</p>form some alternatives designed to address the problem, through consensus select from the alternatives in order to narrow down what the specific goals are, implement the goals, and assess the goals selected to see if they are really addressing the problem.</p></note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Throughout the goal setting process, several techniques may be used in helping to define the needs and desires of the stakeholders and the broader community. By applying these techniques, broad support for the goals may be obtained; increasing the political viability of the goals and, thus, of the overall partnership. The inclusion of the broader community helps to create the important shared ideology. As detailed by Smith and Hester (1982) there are eight broad categories of goal setting techniques. A truncated list of these techniques is presented here for consideration (Smith and Hester, 1982, p. 44). The first stage is goal identification. In this stage, stakeholders examine the problem to be addressed and the needs of the community with respect to values and expectations. The second stage is goal clarification where the feelings and emotions about what is being done are externalized. During this stage the goals are openly described in order for all stakeholders to fully understand the assumptions and implicit meaning of the goals. It is far better to air philosophical or cultural differences early on, rather then after goal adoption. According to this work, ideologies can be used to influence outsiders to support the organization. For partnerships, this "buy-in" by local leadership and the general public is of utmost importance. Without strong support a Public/Private Partnership in Education will not be able to achieve the critical mass it needs to operate in an effective fashion(Downs, 1994).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Downs (1994) also identifies several characteristics of bureaucratic ideology that are</cell></row><row><cell>relevant.</cell></row><row><cell>Skill Supplemented Techniques Advocacy Community Goal Setting Mediated Action Techniques Arbitration Ombudsman Open Process Techniques Community Forums Focused Process Techniques Task Force Study Groups Representative Process Techniques Citizen's Advisory Committee Citizen Representatives Educational Process Techniques Game Simulation Workshops Value Analysis Survey Techniques Questionnaires (phone, mail, interviews) Delphi Public Information Techniques Open Information Meetings Public Hearings In Community Goal Setting (Smith and Hester, 1982) the authors suggest a five-stage process in responsive planning, for this work (p. 25), three of these stages are adopted as tools for the Hester, 1982, p. 27)." are externalized and become open for debate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Interviews in both cities were limited to forty-five minutes and stakeholders were told that an effort would be made to keep them to one half-hour. This effort was always made in good faith, but did not always materialize. Stakeholders seemed very eager to voice their views on their respective partnerships and often offered to send additional material or to accept future follow up telephone calls.</p><p>As the stakeholders answered the initial question or two, a decision was made on which of the twenty questions would be asked. Often, in their opening remarks, several of the questions were answered up front. In these cases, questions further down the list were asked. At other times, the participant had a personal agenda and did not answer any of the questions in a straightforward fashion. When this happened, detailed notes were reviewed and answers to the questions were extrapolated. The stakeholder participant was always notified when thirty minutes had passed and also when it appeared that time constraints would limit the number of partnership issues that could be covered Appendix A contains a copy of the instrument used for the qualitative component and Appendix C contains a list of participant names by city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QUANTITATIVE SURVEY</head><p>Although the qualitative data collected via telephone and face-to-face interviews provide a rich source of partnering context, the lion's share of this dissertation is based on the mail out survey of stakeholders in Public/Private Partnerships in Education. The following paragraphs describe the methodology employed in collecting these data.</p><p>In the second stage of the multiple-methodology, a cross sectional research design was used so that testing of the causal hypotheses of partnership success could be performed. Drawn from the theoretical model and modified based on the qualitative interviews, these questions In this chapter, the univariate data from the Survey of Partners are presented along with the qualitative findings from the telephone interviews (coded responses from the telephone interviews can be found in Appendix C). For this descriptive presentation, each question from the survey has been transformed into a table that displays the count and percentage of partner respondents for each of the survey questions. The differences between the various types of partners have been discussed in detail by <ref type="bibr">Callahan (1995)</ref> and will be addressed in the text only if theoretical and/or statistical justification exists.</p><p>All percentages displayed within each cell are calculated from the total number of partners responding to each specific question on the survey.</p><p>Each table is labeled in a manner equivalent to the question number on the survey instrument (Appendix B). In addition, the findings are grouped together in six conceptual Overall, these univariate findings demonstrate that the six theoretical themes that are proposed in earlier chapters are supported by these data. In addition, the high level of conformity, i.e., a lack of variability, suggest that these proposed elements are, indeed, very important to partnerships. In the next chapter, a multivariate statistical model of partnership success designed to test the theory against these data is built and utilized.</p><p>answered three of the four questions, his/her score was weighted by dividing the coefficient by three. The result is an average score rather than an absolute score. This process was implemented instead of replacing the missing data with a mean score or a derived composition score.</p><p>In terms of the calculated score, the belief is that this global measure of partnership success is more robust than any one single measure. In addition, the use of the scale maximizes the variability within the measure, a quality that is otherwise questionable in these data.</p><p>The first findings to present are those of the initial model of partnership success.</p><p>There are 26 predictor variables in this model, with 13 exogenous and 13 endogenous variables. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>-1 shows the hypothesized relationships in graphic form and serves as the key element for this discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A: INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</head><p>I am trying to understand how public/private partnerships are formed and the process that is involved. In this initial stage of my research I'm using a "blank slate" approach. That is, I'm not trying to "prove" or "test" any given hypothesis. I'm just attempting to qualitatively document the partnership process.</p><p>With this in mind, I have some very broad questions to ask you about how the partnership came together, what issues were relevant and how problems, if any, were resolved. Again, these questions are designed to "get the ball rolling". If you feel other information would better facilitate my understanding of your partnership, please tell me about it.</p><p>To ensure that I accurately document the partnership process, do you mind if I tape record this interview? You may feel free to stop me at any point, and I'll turn the machine off.</p></div>
