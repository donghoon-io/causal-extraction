Based on survey conducted by Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia (APJII), internet user in Indonesia in 2017 increased from the previous year to 143 million users out of 262 million population or around 54.68 percent.</p><p>Interaction with brands on the internet is inevitable, such as following brands social media account, making online purchases, and providing reviews on the brand's website <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Diansyah and Nurmalasari, 2017)</ref>. Giving comments or reviews is a form of electronic word of mouth (eWOM). eWOM is considered to be an influential factor in attitude. Attitude is formed by the brand exposure as result of various marketing stimuli or experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agusto and Torres, 2018)</ref>. A positive attitude tends to lead a purchases intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jung and Seock, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The growth of internet also impact on the emergence of start-up business including Shopee. Shopee is an online based marketplace that provides a variety of products including fashion, devices, makeup, daily necessities, home supplies, and shopping vouchers. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> show that Shopee is on the third position not able to get the 'Top' rating in fashion e-commerce category because of its indeks less than 15 percent. Tokopedia.com 0,9 -Study on the influence of eWOM toward brand attitude was explored by <ref type="bibr">Kudeshia dan Kumar (2017)</ref> who found that positive eWOM on Facebook had a significantly positive effect on smartphone consumer attitude in Egypt. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lee and Youn (2015)</ref> examined the effect of eWOM platform that did not significantly influence consumer attitudes of the Maple Grove Towers Apartment. The dynamic pattern of consumer purchasing behavior makes consumer attitudes not only affected by eWOM. More specific research on the mediating variable of the influence of eWOM on brand attitudes needs to be done. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Elseidi and El-Baz (2016)</ref> states that brand image is influenced by eWOM especially those who come from trusted sources and also positively influences their brand attitude. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Suyoga and Santika (2018)</ref> stated that online review is one of the simplest media to obtain information and also the easiest method for businesses to build their brand image. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Method</head><p>This study was taken place in Denpasar; an urban area where most of internet users are lived compared to other area in Bali. The subject of this study is Shopee consumer and the object is their attitude towards Shopee. The population involved all consumer of Shopee in Denpasar. Sample was determined by using a non-probability  <ref type="bibr">Vol.11, No.18, 2019</ref> 91 sampling method, namely purposive sampling as they are at least 17 years old, have shopped online at Shopee fashion e-commerce and had read at least 2 consumer reviews on Shopee in the last three months. <ref type="bibr">Sekaran and Bougie (2016:264)</ref> state that the sample is better taken 5-10 times larger than the number of indicators. As this study has 10 indicators so the sample amounted to 100 respondents. Data was conducted through questionnaire with 5 points-Likert scale and analyzed with Path Analysis and Sobel-test. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Result and Data Analysis</head><p>The distribution of respondents presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> show the characteristics of respondents viewed by age, gender and occupation category. Majority of respondents were female consumers with a percentage of 87 percent, around 74 percent most of the respondents are at age 17-24 years and most respondents working as private employees at a percentage of 44 percent.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows that the whole instrument has correlation coefficient &gt; 0.30. This means that all instruments item are valid. Reliability tests are done to measure the consistency of the questionnaire as a measuring instrument. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the cronbach's alpha value of all instruments &gt; 0.60 which means each instrument on this study are reliable.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> and<ref type="table">7</ref> show that the value of Asymp. Sig. (2-tailed) is 0.058 and 0.091 more than 0.05 so the regression equations 1 and 2 were considered as normal distribution. 0,991 Heterocedasticity testing is done to determine whether there is an inequality of variance from residuals between observations. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref> and<ref type="table">9</ref> show eWOM significance, brand image and brand attitude are 0.152, 0.838 and 0.668 greater than 0.05, so the regression equations 1 and 2 are free from heterocedasticity. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= 2 X + 3 M + e2 = 0,338 X + 0,471 M + e2</formula><p>The influence between variables is interpreted based on Sig. t value. If it less than equal to 0.05 then H1 is supported and if it more than 0.05 then H0 is supported. Validation of the final path diagram illustrates the beta coefficient value of the each variables influence.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref> presented that a total effect of eWOM to brand attitude by mediation of brand image is 0,693 more than when it on its direct effect which is only 0,341. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">13</ref> show that Z value is more than 1.96 and the significance value is less 0.05. Brand image is able to mediate the influence of eWOM on brand attitude.</p><p>Tabel 13. Sobel Test Result Nilai Z value 4,30 Significancy 0,000</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The influence of eWOM on brand attitude of Shopee fashion e-commerce</head><p>The results show that the beta coefficient value is 0.338 with a significance level of 0.001 &lt; 0.05, then H1 is accepted. It is mean that eWOM has a positive and significant effect on Shopee brand attitude. The better eWOM the better the consumer attitude towards Shopee will be. This is in accordance with the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Elseidi and El-Baz (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lin and Xu (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kudeshia and Kumar (2017)</ref> who stated that eWOM had a positive and significant effect on the brand attitude. eWOM consists of four indicators, namely relevance, quality description, service reliability and trustworthiness. 'Relevance' is considered as the most important indicator in determining their attitude towards Shopee. When eWOM is capable of providing information that is in accordance with consumer needs, the consumer attitude towards Shopee is also getting better which is indicated by a positive impression to the brand.  <ref type="bibr">Vol.11, No.18, 2019</ref> 95 quality, shipping speed and seller response. Adding other categories to be reviewed such as packaging neatness and post-purchase service would add more complete information for the next user. Second, consumer review features are able to meet consumer expectations regarding good product reviews criteria. Companies should be able to encourage consumers to provide reviews through the provision of point rewards. Finally, the points of statement about brand attitudes with the highest value which shows the good impression of consumers who have been formed and need to be increased in order to encourage their purchase intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The study concludes that eWOM influence brand image positive and significantly, eWOM and brand image has a significant positive effect on brand attitude and brand image also plays a significant role as a partial mediator of eWOM influence on brand attitude of Shopee fashion e-commerce in Denpasar 6. Suggestions Shopee should add more information in order to increase consumer awareness about the authenticity of consumer review since there are some consumer who still doubt it seen from the lowest value in the respondents' answer distribution. Actually, consumer reviews can only be filled by consumers who already bought and confirmed that the product is accepted, so the possibility of making fake reviews tends to decrease, but this has not been realized by all consumers, so that information is needed.</p><p>Furthermore, the categorization of trusted sellers or Shopee called 'star sellers' also needs to be continually improved regarding the statement about the lowest value brand image to increase security in shopping process. In addition, Shopee has also made efforts to secure transactions such as the existence of a third party bank account to maintain the funds before product are received by consumer and a two-factor authentication system that connects them to the expedition service information system to facilitate tracking of orders.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
