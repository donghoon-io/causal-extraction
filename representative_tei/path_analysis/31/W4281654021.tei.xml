<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Electronic media use (EMU) becomes one of the most common activities in adolescents. The present study investigated the deleterious influence of excessive EMU and EMU before bedtime on social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (SEBD) in adolescents. The role of sleep and circadian problems in mediating the association of EMU with SEBD was examined.</p><p>Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted with 3,455 adolescents (55.7% female, mean age = 14.8 ± 1.57 years, 36.6% monthly family income &lt; HK$15,000) between December 2011 and March 2012 in Hong Kong. The associations of EMU with sleep and circadian problems and SEBD were analyzed using multiple binary logistic regression and path analysis. Sleep problems were measured by the Insomnia Severity Index and the reduced Horne and Östberg Morningness and Eveningness Questionnaire. Circadian problems were calculated based on established formulas. SEBD was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Participants' mental health status was assessed by the General Health Questionnaire.</p><p>Results: A longer duration of EMU, excessive EMU (daily duration ≥ 2 h), and bedtime EMU (an hour before bedtime) were associated with the risk of sleep and circadian problems, poor mental health, and SEBD (p &lt; 0.05). Insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation were found to mediate the associations of EMU (including bedtime EMU of computers, electronic game consoles, phones, and televisions, together with excessive EMU of computers for leisure purposes and phones) with mental health and SEBD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The findings suggest the need for setting up guidelines and advocacy for education for appropriate EMU and intervention for the associated sleep and circadian problems to ameliorate EMU-related mental and behavioral health problems in adolescents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Increasing evidence shows that electronic media use (EMU) is associated with adolescents' development and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Adolescence is a critical transitional stage in physical, behavioral, and psychosocial development. Brain regions involved in extensive developmental transformation during adolescence are particularly impacted by EMU <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Meta-analyses reported the association of excessive EMU with depressive symptoms and psychological distress in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>. Excessive EMU (such as computer use, talking on the phone, and television viewing) may affect the holistic personal development of adolescents as it would replace other physical, social, and family activities. International public health guidelines have recommended that children should have no more than 2 h of EMU daily. When investigating the EMU behavior in adolescents, it is found that only one-third of adolescents worldwide have been able to adhere to the 2 h guideline suggestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. Ostensibly, adolescents with excessive EMU are vulnerable to social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (SEBD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>.</p><p>However, it is not simply excessive EMU that matters but also the timing of the use. In particular, EMU at night, especially before bedtime, could be even more problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>. Exposure to light emitted from screen media (such as electronic game consoles, computers, and televisions) could suppress endogenous melatonin secretion with a consequent delay of circadian rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>. On the other hand, pubertal development also naturally shifts chronotype toward more eveningness (i.e., preferring later bedtime and wake time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>, which could perpetuate EMU at night. The two processes constitute a vicious cycle of EMU and reinforce sleep and circadian problems in adolescents. EMU before bedtime would increase the risk of insomnia <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, social jetlag (defined as the sleep time difference across weekdays and weekends) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, and sleep deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. A number of studies suggest that adolescents with sleep and circadian problems were found to have a higher risk of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), social and behavioral problems, and poor mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the inter-relationship among EMU (especially on nighttime use), sleep and circadian problems, and SEBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, different forms of electronic media might have differential effects on adolescents' sleep and mental health. While computer use, electronic gaming, and phone use all tend to be associated with sleep and circadian problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>, television viewing was suggested to have a lower risk of psychological distress when compared to the use of other electronic devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. It has been postulated that television viewing might provide educational benefits and family gathering opportunities that may facilitate adolescents' psychosocial development <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Although computer usage is beneficial for the acquisition of knowledge and new ideas (via the Internet), exposure to age-inappropriate content may affect emotion and other internalizing problems in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Furthermore, the accompanying arousal during electronic gaming may exacerbate hyperactive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</p><p>The current study aimed to investigate the effects of excessive and bedtime EMU on sleep and circadian problems and SEBD. It was hypothesized that for different forms of electronic media, excessive and bedtime usage might have differential effects on the outcomes. The role of sleep and circadian problems in mediating the associations of excessive and bedtime EMU with SEBD were examined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>This study was part of a large-scale, school-based sleep education program for adolescents in Hong Kong (Trial registry: ChiCTR-TRC-12002798) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Invitation letters were sent to all secondary schools in Hong Kong. Fifteen schools agreed to participate in the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Principals were contacted individually to further explain the details of the study. A set of paper-andpencil self-administered questionnaires was delivered during school time. Participants provided written parental consent and individual assent, and they completed the questionnaires. The current study was based on the baseline cross-sectional data collected between December 2011 and March 2012, prior to the education program. The participants were students from grades 7 to 11 and aged 12 to 18 years. Those who reported a diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder(s) and/or having regular medication(s) in the past month were excluded. Ethical approval was obtained from the Joint CUHK-NTEC clinical research ethics committee (reference no: CRE-2011.249-T).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The measures were classified into four domains: (a) demographic characteristics including age, gender, monthly family income (&lt; HK$15,000 vs. ≥ HK$15,000; HK$7.8 = US$1), (b) SEBD, (c) sleep and circadian measures, and (d) excessive and bedtime EMU. Monthly family income &lt; HK$15,000; HK$7.8 = US$1 was the lower income quartile in 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Difficulties</head><p>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to measure the emotional and behavioral well-being of the adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. SDQ had five subscales to evaluate peer relationship problems, hyperactivity/inattention, emotional problems, conduct problems, and prosocial behavior. Each subscale contains 5 items with three-point Likert format (0 = not true to 2 = certainly true). The recommended cut-offs for identifying social and behavioral problems were adopted (<ref type="url" target="http://www.sdqinfo.org/py/sdqinfo/c0.py">http://www.sdqinfo.org/py/sdqinfo/c0.py</ref>). The Cronbach's alpha and the test-retest reliability of SDQ were 0.80 and 0.85, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</p><p>The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure the overall mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. In this study, GHQ-12 adopted a bimodal scoring method (0-0-1-1). The total score ranged from 0 to 12. A score ≥ 4 suggested poor mental health in Chinese adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. The Cronbach's alpha and the item-total correlation of GHQ-12 were 0.87 and 0.70, respectively.</p><p>The Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) was used to measure the level of sleepiness in different situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. PDSS comprises 8 items with five-point Likert format (0 = never to 4 = always). The total score ranged from 0 to 32. A score &gt; 19 indicated EDS in Chinese adolescents (sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 83%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. The Cronbach's alpha and the test-retest reliability of PDSS were 0.81 and 0.78, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sleep and Circadian Measures</head><p>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to measure insomnia symptoms in the past 2 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. ISI includes 7 items with a five-point Likert format (0 = not at all to 4 = very much). The total score ranges from 0 to 28. A score ≥ 9 indicated clinically significant insomnia in Chinese adolescents (sensitivity = 87%, specificity = 75%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. The Cronbach's alpha and the test-retest reliability of ISI were 0.83 and 0.79, respectively.</p><p>The reduced Horne and Östberg Morningness and Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) was used to measure chronotype preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. rMEQ consists of 5 items where the first 4 items were scored from 1 to 5 while the last item was scored from 0 to 6. The total score ranged from 4 to 26. Three classified types of chronotype were eveningness (score &lt; 12), intermediate-type (score <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and morningness (score &gt; 17). The Cronbach's alpha and the test-retest reliability of rMEQ were 0.70 and 0.77, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</p><p>Other measures included sleep deprivation and social jetlag <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. The participants were asked "on weekdays/weekends, what is your bedtime/rise time usually?" Sleep duration was calculated as the difference between bedtime and rise time. Average sleep duration [(sleep duration during weekday × 5 + sleep duration during weekend × 2)/7] was calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. According to a study relevant to this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, sleep deprivation was defined as having an average sleep duration of at least one standard deviation shorter than the mean sleep duration for that particular age. The difference between the bedtime on workdays and free days in participants ≥2 h was classified as social jetlag sleep-corrected <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electronic Media Use</head><p>The daily duration of EMU was assessed by asking participants how much time (hours and minutes) that they spent on (a) computer use for leisure purposes, (b) computer use for study purposes, (c) talking on the phone, and (d) television viewing. Daily duration ≥2 h was classified as excessive EMU <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. The duration of EMU was the total number of hours spent on the electronic devices (a-d). Bedtime EMU was assessed using a yes/no checklist format: "What do you usually do an hour before bedtime at night?" Four items were included to assess whether participants would (I) spend time using computers, (II) play electronic games, (III) talk on the phone, and (IV) watch television an hour before bedtime <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>All statistical analyses were performed using statistical software R for Windows (R version 4.0.3). Descriptive statistics were presented as means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>Multiple binary logistic regression was used to investigate: (1) the associations of the participants' demographic characteristics (predictors) with SEBD, sleep and circadian problems (including insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation), and excessive and bedtime EMU (outcomes); (2) the effects of the duration of EMU (predictor) on sleep and circadian problems and SEBD (outcomes); (3) the effects of excessive and bedtime EMU of the studied electronic devices (predictor) on sleep and circadian problems (outcomes); (4) the effects of excessive and bedtime EMU of the studied electronic devices along with sleep and circadian problems (predictors) on SEBD (outcomes). The regression models were adjusted for age, gender, and monthly family income. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as a measure of the strength of association.</p><p>Path analysis was conducted to investigate the association among EMU, sleep issues, and SEBD. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts an example of a path model of the association among EMU, sleep and circadian problems, and SEBD. The indirect effects of EMU on SEBD through insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation were calculated by the product of the coefficients approach. Age, gender, and monthly family income were included to adjust the path models. The models were estimated using diagonal weighted least squares because of the categorical data involved. Moreover, 5,000 bootstrap samples were used to infer significance of indirect effects. A path model was regarded as having a good fit to data if the comparative fit index (CFI) ≥ 0.95, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤ 0.05, and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) ≤ 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Characteristics</head><p>A total of 8,236 students were eligible to participate in the study, and 63.4% (n = 5,219) returned the questionnaires. Among the respondents, 3,754 adolescents (71.9%) had valid data on demographic characteristics, social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes, sleep and circadian measures, as well as EMU information. Twenty-six and 273 adolescents who had a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder(s) and had been on regular medication(s) in the past month were excluded, respectively. The sample finally included 3,455 adolescents (55.7% female, mean age = 14.8 ± 1.57 years, 36.6% monthly family income &lt; HK$15,000).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the associations between the studied variables and demographics. In the sample, 17.3-29.9% of the participants had SEBD. More males had conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior problems, while more females had emotional symptoms, poor mental health, and EDS. Younger participants were more likely to have prosocial behavioral problems, but less likely to have poor mental health and EDS. Monthly family income &lt; HK$15,000 was associated with peer relationship problems and prosocial behavior problems. Sleep and circadian problems were reported in 15.1-35.5% of the overall sample. More females had insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation. Older participants were more likely to have insomnia, eveningness, and social jetlag. Monthly family income &lt; HK$15,000 was associated with insomnia and social jetlag in the adolescent subjects.</p><p>The duration of EMU was 4.9 ± 3.02 h. Excessive EMU was reported in 6.8-43.9% of the overall sample, while 20.2-69.1% of the participants had bedtime EMU. More males had excessive EMU of computer for leisure and bedtime EMU for electronic game playing, while more females had excessive EMU of computer for study.

All the models had satisfactory goodnessof-fit indices. Overall, insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation mediated the effect of excessive and bedtime EMU on SEBD. In particular, insomnia mediated the associations of excessive EMU of computers for leisure and phones, along with bedtime EMU of computers, phones, and televisions on all kinds of SEBD. For emotional difficulties, sleep deprivation mediated the associations of excessive EMU of computers for leisure and phones, along with bedtime EMU of phones and televisions on poor mental health and emotional symptoms. For behavioral difficulties, social jetlag mediated the associations of excessive and bedtime EMU of phones on conduct problems. Eveningness mediated the associations of excessive EMU of computers for leisure and phones on externalizing difficulties (including both hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems). Eveningness also mediated the associations of excessive EMU of computers for leisure and phones, along with bedtime EMU of computers, electronic game consoles, phones, and televisions on EDS. While most EMU was associated with increased sleep and circadian problems and SEBD, it is interesting to note that bedtime EMU of television viewing improved insomnia, eveningness, and sleep deprivation with lesser SEBD problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The present study investigated the relationships among EMU, sleep and circadian problems, and SEBD in adolescents. In line with previous research (9, 10), the study highlights that bedtime EMU of computers, electronic game consoles, and  phones contributed to the risk of sleep and circadian problems. This could be explained by nocturnal exposure to screen light, especially blue light, which further increases arousal and suppresses melatonin levels with a consequent delay of circadian rhythm, leading to insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. The findings also reveal that excessive EMU of computers for leisure and phones emerged as risk factors for sleep and circadian problems. It is suspected that interactive and stimulating EMU may increase the level of circulating catecholamines and hence delay sleep onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, EMU was related to adolescents' SEBD. EMU throughout the day and at night concurrently contributes to the risk of poor mental health in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Different forms of electronic media could have different effects on adolescents' SEBD. Bedtime EMU of electronic game consoles, for example, was associated significantly with peer relationship problems and prosocial behavior problems, and marginally with hyperactivity/inattention in the study, which echoes the suggestion that the heightened arousal during electronic gaming exacerbates hyperactive behaviors and related psychosocial problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. The arousal can be triggered by exposure to online game violence and cyberbullying with the aggressive affective state <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. Excessive and bedtime EMU of phones were also risk factors for poor mental health, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and EDS. Adolescents with excessive EMU of phones may rely on phone calls, text messages, and social media networks for communication, which potentially reduces face-to-face interaction with family and peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. On the other hand, passive bedtime EMU of televisions was found, interestingly, to be a protective factor for peer relationships. This may be construed as having the benefits of educational/cultural television programs and family time during television viewing for better psychosocial development <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Passive EMU involves only information consumption so adolescents can still interact with others during television viewing. As reported by previous studies, EMU of television viewing was linked to depressive symptoms and psychological distress, probably reflecting a sedentary lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>, which was not found in the current study. On the contrary, bedtime EMU of televisions reduced emotional symptoms. Further investigation is required to corroborate the influence of different types of EMU including television viewing on adolescents' mental health and psychosocial development.</p><p>In this study, the data was collected in 2011 and did not cover time spent on smartphones and tablets, which are commonly used by adolescents nowadays. While caution should be taken when interpreting adolescents' EMU pattern, the findings are consistent with recent studies that sleep and circadian problems are linked to developmental problems in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> and the use of various electronic devices contributed to SEBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. The data is useful to further investigate the inter-relationship among EMU, sleep and circadian problems, and SEBD that few large-scale studies have examined. The hypothesis that EMU was indirectly related to SEBD through sleep and circadian problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> is supported by the findings that insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation mediated the effect of excessive and bedtime EMU on SEBD. In particular, insomnia independently  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</p><p>In turn, the fears and arousal will further predispose adolescents to be more vulnerable to negative experiences. Insomnia and sleep deprivation also jointly mediated the relationships between EMU and emotional difficulties, including poor mental health and emotional symptoms. Previous research identified the adverse effect of sleep deprivation on adolescents' emotional processes such as sleep-dependent emotional regulation, emotional reactivity, and emotional memory processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. In addition, eveningness mediated the relationship between EMU and EDS, affecting adolescents' daily functioning. It is suggested that evening-type adolescents tend to be less adaptive to their daily routines and academic performance compared to their morning-oriented counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. There were several limitations to this study. First, the study was a cross-sectional study that could not infer any causal relationship among EMU, sleep and circadian problems, and SEBD. A prospective longitudinal study should be conducted to confirm that adolescents' SEBD is affected directly by EMU and indirectly through sleep and circadian problems over time. Second, the response rate was only modest, albeit a large-scale sample was collected. The sample was collected from 15 different local schools to reduce selection bias. Future research can adopt random sampling to collect a more representative sample. Third, the self-construct questionnaires can be modified to improve the validity. For example, the calculation of social jetlag and sleep deprivation was based on rise time and bedtime, which could underestimate the problems. The daily EMU variable did not take into consideration usage on weekdays vs. weekends/holidays, which could be quite different. Bedtime EMU was assessed using a yes/no checklist format, while the time spent was not measured, which limited the investigation of the quantity of bedtime EMU. Finally, the data on EMU, sleep and circadian problems, and SEBD were based on retrospective self-report measures and were therefore subjected to recall bias. It is believed that studies using more objective measures are warranted. Nevertheless, there was scarce evidence to suggest a more reliable measure of EMU other than self-report <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Future research is needed to develop novel technical tools, for example, smart glasses measuring realtime EMU exposure more accurately at eye level <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. Apart from the duration and types, the content of EMU is also worth investigating.</p><p>The study provides important research and clinical implications. Existing guidelines are mainly used for preventing excessive EMU in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. In Hong Kong, the government proposes a limit of recreational screen time to be no more than 2 h a day for children under the age of 12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. However, there is no such restriction for adolescents. The study demonstrates that excessive EMU can affect adolescents pervasively. The findings advocate the need for a public health guideline to set a healthy daily electronic media usage limit and EMU restraint before bedtime for adolescents. Given that the mediating effect of sleep and circadian problems on the associations of EMU with SEBD, there should be additional and appropriate intervention and prevention strategies to tackle sleep and circadian problems. Apart from advice and education in restricting EMU, the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, bright light therapy, sleep education, and in some clinical cases, judicious use of medications such as melatonin may be required for intervening insomnia, eveningness, social jetlag, and sleep deprivation to ameliorate EMU-related mental and behavioral health problems.</p></div>
