<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Maladaptive experiences during childhood have been consistently linked with borderline personality disorder (BPD) including : abuse and neglect <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guzder et al. 1999 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zanarini et al. 2006)</ref>, parent hostility and resentment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hooley &amp; Hoffman, 1999 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnson et al. 2006</ref>) and exposure to domestic violence and parent conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Herman et al. 1989 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Weaver &amp; Clum, 1993)</ref>. Most studies have been retrospective, however, with concomitant methodological issues, such as the tendency of patients with BPD to misinterpret or misreport past experiences with family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bailey &amp; Shriver, 1999)</ref>. Furthermore, domestic conflict and child maltreatment usually occur in family environments characterized by multiple risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fergusson et al. 2006</ref>) difficult to disentangle with retrospective designs.</p><p>A series of prospective, longitudinal studies has revealed an association between abuse, neglect, parenting and BPD features <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Johnson et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Johnson et al. , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Johnson et al. , 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Johnson et al. , 2006))</ref>. Associations were focused on scales of personality disorder symptoms assessed in early adulthood, however, rather than on a collection of symptoms comparable in composition with a DSM-IV BPD diagnosis. Subsequently, large prospective longitudinal studies are now necessary to identify younger individuals with comparable symptom constellations (including subsyndromal levels of manifestation) to those identified in adult BPD. Such studies are challenging due to low base rates of BPD and protracted duration before formal diagnosis, typically during early adulthood, is made. However, BPD is unlikely to suddenly appear in early adulthood ; rather, it may be considered within a developmental trajectory as the end point following the appearance of BPD symptoms during childhood or adolescence.</p><p>The importance of early identification of such symptoms, as manifest in a childhood phenotype, has been highlighted, both for the facilitation of intervention programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chanen et al. 2008</ref>) and delineation of aetiological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Geiger &amp; Crick, 2001)</ref>. Furthermore, BPD assessments for children have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Crick et al. 2005 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rogosch &amp; Cicchetti, 2005)</ref>, and it appears that BPD-related features may be identified as early as 6 years of age, and remain relatively stable over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Stepp et al. 2010</ref>). Nevertheless, it has not been ascertained whether factors associated with BPD in adulthood are also associated with BPD symptoms during late childhood.</p><p>In the current study we investigated whether exposure to family adversity and maladaptive parent behaviour, during preschool and school periods, was predictive of BPD probable and definite symptoms (five or more) in late childhood. Additionally, the developmental pathways through which this association manifests were explored by considering the mediating effects of potential markers : Axis I DSM-IV diagnoses and intelligence quotient (IQ) at age 7-8 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a birth cohort study, set in the UK, examining the determinants of development, health and disease during childhood and beyond <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Golding et al. 2001)</ref>. A total of 14 541 women were enrolled, provided they were resident in Avon while pregnant, and had an expected delivery date between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, 13 971 children, alive at 12 months, formed the original cohort. From the first trimester of pregnancy parents completed postal questionnaires about themselves and the study child's health and development. Children were invited to attend annual assessment clinics, including face-to face interviews, and psychological and physical tests from 7 years onwards.</p><p>During the planning stage of the study, children from the Avon area were compared with 13 135 children from across the UK, participating in the Child Health and Education Study, on a number of demographic variables. Results suggested that the Avon population was fairly similar to that of the whole of Great Britain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Golding et al. 2001)</ref>. There were 11 510 children living in the study area and eligible for invitation to the 11-year annual assessment clinic ; 6423 attended and started the interview session, incorporating the BPD questions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), though 373 of these children were excluded because they did not answer at least eight of the nine BPD questions. This study is, therefore, based on 6050 children (age range 10.4-13.6 years, mean age 11.7 years).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical approval</head><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics committee and the local research ethics committees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BPD features interview</head><p>Borderline features were assessed using a face-to-face semi-structured interview : the UK Childhood Interview for DSM-IV Borderline Personality Disorder (UK-CI-BPD ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zanarini et al. 2004)</ref>, based on the borderline module of the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Zanarini et al. 1996)</ref>, which is a widely used semi-structured interview for all DSM-IV Axis II disorders. The inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the DSM-III, DSM-III-R and DSM-IV versions of this measure have all proven to be good to excellent <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zanarini et al. 2000 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zanarini &amp; Frankenberg, 2001)</ref>. The UK-CI-BPD was adapted from the CI-BPD (US version), with small changes in wording making it appropriate for a UK sample, e.g. ' being angry ' was changed to ' being cross '. The convergent validity of the CI-BPD was investigated using 171 adolescents (boys and girls) 13-17 years of age ; 111 met criteria for BPD and 60 were normal comparison subjects. A Spearman's r of 0.89 was obtained when comparing a dimensional score for BPD on the CI-BPD and the total score on the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines.</p><p>The UK-CI-BPD differs from the adult interview in three ways : (1) the language is simpler ; (2) two forms of impulsivity are omitted (reckless driving and promiscuity) due to lack of developmental appropriateness ; and (3) the childhood interview is more structured than the adult version, with the answer to each question, and not just the rating for each of the nine criteria, entered into the dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zanarini et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The inter-rater reliability (k) of the UK-CI-BPD, assessed from taped interviews of 30 children, ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 (median value 0.88), and 86 % of the k values were within the excellent range of &gt;0.75 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zanarini et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The UK-CI-BPD is the first semi-structured interview designed to assess DSM-IV BPD in latency-aged children. Similar to DSM-IV criteria, the interview consists of nine sections : intense inappropriate anger ; affective instability ; emptiness ; identity disturbance ; paranoid ideation ; abandonment ; suicidal or selfmutilating behaviours ; impulsivity and intense unstable relationships. Once a trained assessor had explored each section, a judgment was made as to whether each symptom was definitely present, probably present or absent. A symptom was classed as definitely present if it occurred daily or approximately 25 % of the time, and probably present if it had occurred repeatedly, but did not meet the criterion for definitely present.</p><p>Two outcome variables were constructed for use in the logistic regression analyses : BPD symptoms probably present (symptoms present less than daily or 25 % of the time) and BPD symptoms definitely present, both of which were based on the presence of five or more symptoms. Diagnosis of BPD according to the DSM-IV is based on the presence of five or more definite features ; thus the probable BPD outcome represents a dimensional adjunct to the traditional categorical approach, i.e. children with five or more (categorical) subsyndromal symptoms (dimensional) are identified <ref type="bibr">(Kraemer, 2007)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociodemographic and birth variables</head><p>The mother-reported sociodemographic information during the antenatal period included marital status (married versus single) ; home ownership (home owner versus rented) ; parent social class (based on the highest of the mother's or partner's occupational social class : dichotomized into non-manual versus manual) ; and maternal education, dichotomized into below O level versus O level or above (O levels being the standard school-leaving qualifications at age 16 years in the UK until recently). The ethnic origin of the child (white versus black or minority ethnic) and birth weight were obtained from birth records. Birth weight was dichotomized into f2499 g (low birth weight) and o2500 g.</p><p>Exposure variables : family adversity, suboptimal parenting and parent conflict</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family adversity</head><p>Multiple family risk factors were indicated using the Family Adversity Index (FAI ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bowen et al. 2005)</ref>, which consists of 18 items taken from questionnaires administered throughout pregnancy (8, 12, 18 and 32 weeks gestation) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for more details). The FAI consists of items pertaining to young maternal age at first pregnancy (&lt;17 years) or birth of study child (&lt;20 years) ; housing (e.g. inadequacy : overcrowding or periods of homelessness) ; financial difficulties ; problematic partner relationship ; maternal affective disorder (depression, anxiety, suicidality) ; substance abuse (drugs or alcohol) ; or involvement in crime (i.e. in trouble with police or convictions). For the current analysis the item reflecting partner cruelty (emotional or physical) was removed from the FAI to prevent confounding with the domestic violence predictor variables. The remaining adversity items were summed and trichotomized into : none (no adversity) ; mild (one or two adversities) and severe (more than two adversities).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suboptimal parenting index</head><p>Selection of the suboptimal parenting predictors was based on a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Waylen et al. 2008)</ref>, which factor analysed questions pertaining to maternal attitudes, behaviours and feelings within the ALSPAC cohort. Three factors were evidenced, reflecting suboptimal parenting (hostility, resentment and hitting/ shouting), which were found to be predictive of a variety of health outcomes during mid-childhood. These factors have been prospectively linked to personality disorders (and BPD features) within the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Johnson et al. 2006)</ref>, and thus were combined to create a suboptimal parenting index.</p><p>Scales assessing parent behaviour, as reported by the mother, were dichotomized, indicating whether the maladaptive behaviour was present or absent. Where available, variables were constructed for the preschool (birth to up to 5 years) and school (5-8 years) periods. The suboptimal parenting index was constructed by summing seven items across the preschool and school periods to create an index of increasing exposure to suboptimal parenting on a scale of 0-7. Items were : hitting (preschool, school) ; shouting (preschool, school) ; hostility (preschool, school) ; and resentment (preschool).</p><p>Maternal hitting and shouting were indicated by the following two items : ' When you are at home with your child how often do you slap him ? ' and ' When you are at home with your child how often do you shout at him ? ' <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Waylen et al. 2008)</ref>. For the preschool period (24 and 42 months), hitting was coded as present if it occurred daily or every week at either time point, and shouting if it occurred daily at either time point. For the school period (77 months), hitting was recorded as present if reported often or sometimes, and shouting if reported often. We used less stringent criteria for the school period to reflect the observed reduction in hitting and shouting, as the child grows older <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hyman, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Hostility and resentment were constructed from a number of items loading on two distinct factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Waylen et al. 2008)</ref>. Preschool hostility items included : ' mum feels that whining makes her want to hit child ' (21 months) ; ' mum often irritated by child ' (47 months) ; ' mum has battle of wills with child ' (47 months) ; and ' child gets on mum's nerves ' (47 months). Preschool hostility was classed as present if reported in three or all items. Preschool resentment items included : ' mum dislikes mess from child ' (47 months) ; ' mum feels unbearable when child cries ' (21 months) ; ' mum feels child's desires cause anger ' (21 months) ; and ' mum feels has no time alone ' (33 months).</p><p>Preschool resentment was classed as present if reported for two or more items. For the school period, only hostility items were available : ' mum often irritated by child ' (85 months) ; ' mum has battle of wills with child ' (85 months) ; ' child gets on mum's nerves ' (85 months). School hostility was considered present if answered positively for all three items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conflicting partnership index</head><p>Domestic violence and conflicting partnership measures were chosen according to reported prospective associations with negative child outcomes, generally <ref type="bibr">(Kitzman et al. 2003)</ref>, and BPD, specifically, in retrospective studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Herman et al. 1989 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Weaver &amp; Clum, 1993)</ref>. The parent conflict index was constructed across the preschool and school periods from five items, on a scale of 0-5, reflecting increasing exposure to conflict between primary caregivers. Items were : conflicting partnership (preschool, school) ; partner broken or thrown things (preschool) ; physically hurt by partner (preschool) ; and emotional domestic violence (preschool).</p><p>Physical and emotional domestic violence variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bowen et al. 2005)</ref> were available for the preschool period only. Two physical domestic violence variables were constructed : physically hurt by partner and partner broken or thrown things. The variable ' physically hurt by partner ' was constructed from the two items ' physically hurt by partner ' (8, 21, 33 and 47 months) and ' slapped or hit by partner ' (21 and 33 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Initial analyses were carried out with SPSS version 17 statistical software (SPSS, Inc., USA). Selective dropout was determined by comparing those who completed the borderline interview with those lost to follow-up (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to test for gender differences in parenting variables and BPD probable and definite symptoms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Crude associations between family adversity, maladaptive parenting and BPD probable and definite symptoms were computed. Associations were then adjusted for age and gender, then, additionally, DSM-IV diagnoses and IQ. ORs with 95 % CIs are reported for the preschool and school periods, respectively (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Path analysis was carried out, using Mplus version 6 (<ref type="url" target="http://www.statmodel.com/">http://www.statmodel.com/</ref>), to elucidate the direct and indirect relationships between exposure to family adversity, suboptimal parenting and parent conflict, manifestation of DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses, IQ and the BPD outcome. A categorical ordinal BPD outcome was utilized in the path analysis, reflecting increasing severity of BPD [less than five symptoms (92.7 %) ; five or more probable symptoms (6.4 %) ; five or more definite symptoms (0.9 %)]. Mplus version 6 software is suitable for the analysis of categorical outcomes, producing estimates in the form of probit coefficients. Probit coefficients indicate the strength of relationship between predictor variables and probability of group membership. They represent the difference that a one-unit change in the predictor variable makes in the cumulative normal probability of the outcome variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lee et al. 2007)</ref>. For ordinal outcomes one coefficient per predictor is produced. This may be interpreted in the same way as a continuous dependent variable, as an ordinal dependent variable is comparable with a continuous latent response variable, which exceeds thresholds to give various outcome categories <ref type="bibr">(Muthe ´n, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">(Muthe ´n, -2004))</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differences between participants with and without the completed borderline interview</head><p>The frequencies of sociodemographic factors, psychiatric diagnoses and IQ are shown for ALSPAC participants with and without borderline interviews in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Those lost to follow-up were more often boys, ethnic minority children, of low birth weight, born to single mothers of lower education level, from rented properties and with parents in manual jobs. They were more likely to have been born into family adversity, and have had psychiatric diagnoses at 7-8 years.</p><p>Children who dropped out had a lower IQ at 8 years.</p><p>Thus, participants remaining in the analysis were less severely disadvantaged than those who dropped out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency of BPD and maladaptive parenting variables</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reports the frequencies of BPD probably and definitely present and parenting variables (total and by gender). Of the ALSPAC cohort, 6.4 % had five or more probable, and 0.9 % had five or more definite, symptoms at 11 years. These findings are largely concordant with a previous community study, which reported that 7.8 % of 9-to 19-year-olds had moderate BPD, and 3 % had severe BPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bernstein et al. 1993)</ref>,</p><p>with the lower values in the present study possibly attributable to the younger age of the cohort. Hitting and shouting were common during the preschool period, becoming rarer during the school period (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Significantly more boys than girls were hit during both periods and shouted at during the preschool period. Hostility and resentment did not differ according to the gender of the study child. Domestic violence was reported for the preschool period only, with emotional domestic violence more common than being physically hurt by a partner and a partner having broken or thrown things. There were no gender differences for living in a household with domestic violence. Conflicting partnerships during both periods did not differ according to the gender of the child.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations between maladaptive parenting and BPD symptoms</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the associations between family adversity, maladaptive parenting and BPD probable symptoms. The Table shows the crude associations, the associations after controlling for age and gender, and the associations after controlling for age, gender, DSM-IV diagnoses and IQ. Family adversity (one or two items ; more than two items), hitting (preschool), hostility (school), partner breaking or throwing things, emotional domestic violence and conflicting partnership (preschool and school) were all significantly associated with BPD probable symptoms. After controlling for confounders, conflicting partnership (preschool and school) was no longer predictive of BPD probable symptoms. Suboptimal parenting and parent conflict led to higher odds of BPD probable symptoms after adjusting for confounders.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the associations between family adversity, maladaptive parenting and BPD definite symptoms. Hitting (preschool), resentment, hostility (preschool and school), emotional domestic violence, physically hurt by partner and conflicting partnership (school) were predictive of BPD definite symptoms. After controlling for confounders, hostility (school), emotional domestic violence, physically hurt by partner and conflicting partnership (school) remained significantly predictive of BPD definite symptoms. Suboptimal parenting and parent conflict remained predictive of BPD definite symptoms after controlling for confounders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive associations between family adversity, parenting variables, potential mediators and BPD probable and definite symptoms</head><p>The predictive associations between family adversity, parenting variables, mediators and BPD probable and definite symptoms are shown in Supplementary Table <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1(A,</ref><ref type="figure">B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>). These associations were tested according to time ordering ; therefore, family adversity was considered a predictor, while Axis I DSM-IV diagnoses (DAWBA), IQ and BPD were considered outcomes of family adversity and parenting variables. Univariate analysis indicated that family adversity was predictive of suboptimal parenting, parent conflict, DSM-IV diagnosis, IQ and BPD symptoms probable and definite (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1A</ref>). Suboptimal parenting and parent conflict were predictive of DSM-IV diagnoses, IQ and BPD probable and definite symptoms (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1B</ref>). DSM-IV diagnoses were predictive of BPD probable symptoms and IQ was predictive of BPD definite symptoms (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1C</ref>). These findings are consistent with a pathway model in which family adversity is a precursor for suboptimal parenting and parent conflict, leading to DSM-IV diagnoses and lower IQ (child markers) culminating in BPD symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis</head><p>The path model incorporated the family adversity, suboptimal parenting and parent conflict indices as predictors. IQ and DSM-IV diagnoses were entered as potential mediators, while gender was entered as a control. Model fit indices indicated good fit (x 2 =11.58, p=0.00, root mean square error of appro-ximation=0.02, comparative fit index=0.99). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the unstandardized and standardized (in parentheses) estimates of the direct path coefficients between the various predictor and mediating variables. Non-significant paths (p&gt;0.05, one-tailed) are not shown.</p><p>The direct relationships between family adversity (one or two adversities ; more than two adversities), suboptimal parenting, parent conflict, DSM-IV diagnoses, IQ and BPD outcome at 11 years were significant. Direct and indirect path coefficients to the BPD outcome are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. The association between suboptimal parenting and BPD outcome was partially mediated by DSM-IV diagnoses and IQ at 7-8 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In line with previous research, we found that suboptimal parenting and parent conflict were more likely within families experiencing adversities, ranging from poverty and overcrowding to mental health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fergusson et al. 2006)</ref>. Family adversity was assessed in pregnancy, thereby excluding reverse-causality effects of parenting, or a challenging child, on family adversity. Family adversity had a direct impact on BPD symptoms at 11 years of age, and indirect effects via suboptimal parenting, parent conflict, poorer cognitive functioning and DSM-IV diagnoses of the child. Furthermore, there was a dose-response effect with an increase in family adversity and maladaptive parenting severity leading to increased odds of BPD symptoms. This indicates that children exposed to higher levels of family adversity and maladaptive parenting were at heightened risk of developing BPD symptoms. The direct impact of family adversity in pregnancy may be due to continued adversity throughout  childhood, such as social deprivation, leading to increased BPD symptoms. Alternatively, adversity in early pregnancy may lead to increased stress for the fetus, and early programming alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Entringer et al. 2009)</ref>, increasing the risk of BPD symptoms. Despite controlling for other adversities, we found that suboptimal parenting and parent conflict had significant direct associations with BPD symptoms, adding to the current research literature by providing prospective evidence for a link between maladaptive parenting and subsequent BPD symptoms in late childhood. Furthermore, there were significant indirect associations between suboptimal parenting and BPD outcome via DSM-IV diagnosis and IQ.</p><p>There is ample evidence that lower IQ is often indicative of a deleterious home environment, lacking in resources and academic encouragement <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brody &amp; Flor, 1998 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Van IJzendoorn et al. 2005)</ref>. Therefore, maladaptive parenting is likely to contribute to poorer cognitive ability and increased BPD symptoms, as shown here. Considering the complexity of personality pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tyrer et al. 2007)</ref>, these outcomes may have various aetiological pathways. A family environment characterized by conflict, aggression and anger directed at the child may make an impact upon the child in various ways including an alteration of internal schemata of behaviour and relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Westen et al. 2006)</ref>, an exacerbation of stress responses (e.g. hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocorticol axis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gunnar, 1998)</ref> or an interaction with genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Belsky &amp; Beaver, 2011)</ref>. All of these may compromise cognitive and emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Posner et al. 2003)</ref>. Indeed, individuals with BPD tend to display a disturbance in cognitive control processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Posner et al. 2003 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rogosch &amp; Cicchetti, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>An association between IQ and increased psychotic symptoms during adolescence has been observed, curvilinear in nature, with both low and high (to a lesser extent) IQ increasing risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Horwood et al. 2008)</ref>. The present results suggest a more straightforward linear relationship between IQ and BPD symptoms (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>), with high IQ possibly acting as a protective factor across the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Batty et al. 2005)</ref> ; due to an increased ability to mobilize resources and respond appropriately in difficult situations.</p><p>Axis I (DSM-IV) diagnoses at 7-8 years were directly associated with BPD outcome at 11 years within .58, p=0.00, root mean square error of approximation=0.02, comparative fit index=0.99).

This is consistent with the ' complication model ', which posits a predictive association between Axis I disorders and subsequent personality pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Philipsen et al. 2008)</ref>. Our findings indicate that diagnoses of anxiety, depression, ADHD or externalizing disorders (conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder) were direct precursors of subsequent BPD symptoms. Both suboptimal parenting and parent conflict, to a lesser extent, were predictive of a DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis at 7-8 years. The association between suboptimal parenting and BPD via DSM diagnoses was only partial, however, and the association between parent conflict and BPD was not mediated by DSM-IV diagnoses. Thus, only a proportion of children reporting BPD at 11 years was identified by the DSM-IV diagnoses at 7-8 years.</p><p>This suggests that the DAWBA diagnoses may not capture all cases of emotional dysregulation, or the combination of internalizing and externalizing manifestations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Crawford et al. 2001)</ref>, thought to presage the development of BPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Crowell et al. 2009)</ref>. While disorders such as conduct disorder and ADHD may have identified individuals more outwardly evincing the emotional dysregulation implicated in the development of BPD, other manifestations of emotional dysregulation may not have been observed by parents or teachers. Of note, male gender was significantly predictive of DSM-IV but not BPD diagnoses, suggesting that certain female typical manifestations of emotional dysregulation (e.g. self-harm and eating disorders) may not have been identified within the DSM-IV diagnoses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>Study strengths include the large sample size and the assessment of family adversity before the birth of the child, precluding any reverse causality. The UK-CI-BPD was adapted from a well-validated instrument, piloted, administered by trained psychologists and showed high inter-rater reliability. The findings support the presence of a late childhood phenotype for BPD, and buttress current literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cohen et al. 2005 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chanen et al. 2007</ref>) by demonstrating that borderline personality symptoms, recognized in late childhood, are associated with similar risk factors to BPD diagnosed in adulthood. However, before firm conclusions can be drawn, it needs to be ascertained whether these BPD symptoms demonstrate predictive validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Crick et al. 2005)</ref> and are related to BPD clinically diagnosed in adulthood.</p><p>There was substantial and selective attrition in this study. Those with more family adversity were more likely to have been lost from follow-up. Thus, the study is likely to underestimate the prevalence of BPD symptoms in late childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bernstein et al. 1993)</ref>. Despite selective drop-out, we found strong and hypothesized associations between family adversity,  c The FAI1 category denotes one or two items. d A probit coefficient of 0.13 indicates that for each unit increase in FAI there is an increase of 0.13 standard deviations in the predicted Z score of the cumulative normal distribution of BPD symptoms. e The FAI2 category denotes more than two items.</p><p>suboptimal parenting and parent conflict and BPD symptoms among the remaining, less severely disadvantaged individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wolke et al. (2009)</ref> demonstrated in simulations that even when drop-out is correlated with predictor/confounder variables, the relationships between predictors and outcome were not markedly attenuated. However, it cannot be precluded that selective drop-out had some influence on the predictive relationships reported. Maternal hitting, shouting, hostility and resentment were based on self-report, potentially leading to an under-reporting of these factors. However, under-reporting would probably represent ' non-differential misclassification ', i.e. under-reporting in both groups, therefore exerting a downward bias on our estimates of the long-term effects of suboptimal parenting, suggesting our robust estimates are conservative (underestimate effects) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Copeland et al. 1977)</ref>. The reported rates of suboptimal parenting are still fairly high, however, suggesting a reasonable level of selfdisclosure, possibly due to the anonymous, postal method of data collection. While self-report measures are regarded as less robust than observational measures, they have the benefit of capturing attitudes and behaviours across longer time spans.</p><p>Due to the very low prevalence of reported sexual abuse in this sample (0.05 %), it was excluded as a predictor, potentially omitting an important experiential factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Zanarini et al. 2006)</ref>. Existing research, however, suggests that sexual abuse is not linked to the whole spectrum of BPD, and certain forms of BPD may be associated with maladaptive parenting other than sexual abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Salzman et al. 1993)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and future directions</head><p>Our results suggest that cognitive mechanisms play a direct and weak meditational role in the development of BPD symptoms. Assessing cognition via IQ supports that general cognitive ability relates to psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Batty et al. 2005)</ref>. However, given the proposed centrality of emotional dysregulation within the BPD construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(LeGris &amp; van Reekum, 2006)</ref>, it would be prudent for future developmental studies to tap into the domain of emotional dysregulation more directly in order to clarify the pathways via which BPD symptoms develop. Though DSM-IV diagnoses at 7-8 years identified a proportion of children reporting BPD symptoms at 11 years, results suggest that there may be other precursors to BPD in midchildhood.</p><p>In addition, the present results concur with previous studies that exposure to family adversity, suboptimal parenting and parent conflict may have numerous negative outcomes for children, including lower cognitive ability and Axis I disorders. Further, we expand the current literature by providing prospective evidence of a link between maladaptive parenting and subsequent BPD symptoms at age 11 years, suggesting that interventions focused on improving parenting may produce wide-ranging positive effects.</p><p>We tentatively speculate that suboptimal parenting may be a marker for maternal irritable temperament <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Siever &amp; Davies, 1991)</ref>, potentially exposing the child to the double jeopardy of an inherited irritable temperament <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Stringaris et al. 2010</ref>) and suboptimal parenting, which may manifest in subsequent BPD symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Crowell et al. 2009)</ref>, including affective instability and intense inappropriate anger. Therefore, it would be desirable for future studies to ascertain whether there are prospective links between emotional/irritable temperament and later BPD symptoms. Assessing BPD symptoms in late childhood appears to be a promising avenue for understanding the development of BPD.</p></div>
