<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Nowadays, researchers have a keen interest to analyze the hypothesized relationship among set of variables. Path analysis is an extension of multiple regression, generally used to examine the importance of causal correlations among multiple variables. It was first introduced by Write <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Basically, path analysis involves two components; path diagram and path coefficient which represents visual and mathematical parts of the analysis, respectively.</p><p>Primarily, path diagram analyzes causal relationship that occur in multiple regression when dependent variable is affected by independent variables directly and indirectly in both way (see <ref type="bibr">Stage et al. [33]</ref>). Smith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> pointed out the ability of path analysis in a natural ecological system. Güneri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> investigated the distribution of indirect effect in path analysis. There are several applications of path analysis in field of sociology Ducan <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, psychology Werts and Linn <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, epidemiology Karlin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and engineering Huang and Hsueh <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The classical regression models are used to study the dependence between one dependent and one or more than one independent variables. It only measures the direct effect of independent variables on the dependent variable. In classical approach, path analysis is performed under the assumptions of classical regression (ordinary least squares (OLS)).</p><p>Classical regression has certain limitations like the distribution of endogenous variable should be normal, relationship between endogenous and exogenous variables should be linear, and there should be no high multicollinearity occur among exogenous variables, but sometimes these assumptions are violated by the nature of data and strength of significant effect of one variable to another variable is not captured by the model. For more details, one may refer to Wiedermann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Recently, copula-based regression models have been competent to handle the problem of non-normality and multicollinearity in classical regression Kime and Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Kolev and Paiva <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and Krupskii et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Therefore, the copula-based regression models and its applications have been done by researchers in various field of statistics. Sungur <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> introduced the mathematical framework of copula-based regression model by considering uniform marginals. Crane and Hook <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> derived the simple conditional expectation formulae in terms of copulas to carry out some regression analysis.</p><p>Vellaisamy and Pathak <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> introduced the concept of copula-based regression models for general random variables. In recent literature, the copula-based regression models have been also studied with an inferential aspect, see Ali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Bouezmarni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Dette et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Noh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Parsa and Klugman <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> briefly discussed the advantages of copula models over ordinary least squares and generalized linear models. In literature, elliptical family of copulas, which are derived through multivariate elliptical distributions, consists of Gaussian and Student's t copula, are played vital role in dependence modeling. Using elliptical copulas, Frahm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> studied the dependence structure induced via elliptical distributions. Regression model based on elliptical family of copulas is an useful probability model for the correlated data. Ghahroodi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a regression model using Gaussian copula to analyze the association among mixed outcomes.</p><p>Pitt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> introduced a regression function using Gaussian copula and presented a general Bayesian approach to handle multivariate dependence. Acar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> studied elliptical family of copulas for model based predictions. He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed a robust feature screening procedure for elliptical copulas regression model. Furthermore, Sheikhi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> investigated a heteroscedasticity diagnostic in regression analysis when response and explanatory variables are connected through elliptical copulas.</p><p>Despite of availability of explored literature on copula-based regression models and path analysis, we observed that no one has performed the path analysis in the context of copulabased regression approach. Considering manifest (directly observed) variables, the primary aim of this article is to study the path analysis models when the endogenous (dependent) variable and exogenous (independent) variables are linked through the elliptical copulas and to investigate the efficacy of path models when direct and indirect effects are estimated using classical ordinary least squares and copula-based regression approaches in different scenarios. In this context, Braeken et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have investigated the role of copulas in path analysis for categorical data. Douma and Shipley <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have explored testing path models that include dependent errors, nonlinear functional relationships and using non-normal, hierarchically structured data. Choi and Seo <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have proposed copula-based redundancy analysis to improve the performance of regression-based Extended Redundancy Analysis.</p><p>Hult et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have studied the effect of Gaussian Copula in Latent variables path analysis.</p><p>For more details, see Bauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Eckert and Hohberger <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Park and Gupta <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, based on a well organized empirical study and real application, we found that path analysis performed through copula-based regression approach gives more robust results. The rest of work is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic setup of regression based on copulas and path coefficients along with some important examples. Section 3 summarizes the performance of considered approaches through well organized numerical scheme. To demonstrate the performance of path analysis through copula, two real data sets are also analyzed in Section 4. Finally, conclusion and some future remarks are discussed.</p></div>

The correlation coefficient between these two variables is equal to the sum of the direct effect of an effective variable and indirect effects of the other variables (see Güneri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>). Therefore, the next result presents these correlations in terms of direct and indirect effects.</p><p>Proposition 2.1.

Here, path analysis includes only one structure of regression equation based on the model pattern that has been already discussed in Section 2. Since we use the 5-fold cross validation technique, so in each fold i.e., k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 train set contains only 80% observations and remaining 20% observations are contained in test set. To compare the performance of both approaches, we consider the statistical indices; mean of mean squared error (MSE), standard deviation (SD) of mean squared error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of regression structure equation of path model in this 5-fold cross-validation technique. The mathematical form of these indices are as follows (see Sheikhi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>);</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">M SE = n 1 ( Ŷi -Y i ) 2 n</formula><p>, AIC = nLL + 2k, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">BIC = nLL + k log(n),</formula><p>where n is the sample size of data, LL denotes the log-likelihood for the model, and k represents the number of parameters in the model.</p><p>In a particular situation when the path model consists of only two exogenous variable, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> presents the summary of model evaluation indices for the train set and test set corresponding to each low, medium, and high level correlation for 100, 200, 300, and 400 sample sizes. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, it can be observed that in case of train set; mean of MSE, SD of MSE, AIC, and BIC all are highly close in both approaches. But when we observe the performance of all indices for test set, analysis through the copula-based regression approach gives significant differences in results, which show the superiority of the Gaussian copula-based regression technique over the classical regression.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> presents the path and correlation coefficients estimated through both techniques corresponding to low, medium, and high level correlation. The main observation of this table is that in the case of each sample size, the path coefficients calculated through classical and copula techniques are approximately equal to each other, and correlation coefficients are precisely similar in both approaches. Another observation is that increasing the sample size slightly affects the path coefficients. We also observe the analysis of both techniques in terms of direct, indirect, and total effects. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> presents the summary of direct, indirect, and total effect for regression structure P 1 X 1 +P 2 X 2 to Y of path model. Path coefficients in classical approach (in case of a large sample, n=400) for train set reveals that there is a direct influence of X 1 on Y (i.e., P 1 ) and X 2 on Y (i.e., P 2 ) is 0.340 and -0.559, respectively. In other words, when the influence of one exogenous variable is kept constant, one-unit change in other exogenous variable in model will cause the relevant endogenous variable to change as much as the path coefficient value of the related variables. The results of analysis show that indirect influence of X 1 on Y via X 2 (i.e., ρ x 1 x 2 P 2 ) and X 2 on Y via X 1 (i.e., ρ x 1 x 2 P 1 ) are calculated as 0.103 × -0.559 = -0.058 and 0.103 × 0.340 = 0.035, respectively, where 0.103 is the estimated value of correlation coefficient (ρ x 1 x 2 ) between exogenous variables X 1 and X 2 . The total effect of X 1 to Y is 0.340+(-0.058) = 0.282 and X 2 to Y is (-0.599)+0.035 = -0.523, which are the approximately equal to the correlation coefficients between X 1 to Y i.e., 0.3 and X 2 to Y i.e., -0.5, respectively. Similarly, results of analysis obtained through Gaussian copula approach reveals the total effect of X 1 on Y is 0.282 and X 2 on Y is -0.523. Same way, when we interpretate the results for test set, the total effect of each exogenous variable X 1 , X 2 on endogenous variable Y are approximately equal to their correlation coefficient between X 1 on Y , and X 2 on Y , respectively (see proposition (2.1)). Moreover, in case of large sample size, t-copula converges to the Gaussian copula (see Kole et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) and regression function associated with Student's t-copula can be treated as a linear regression. For large samples, result of analysis performed through t-copula is similar to the Gaussian copula. Therefore, these results are not reported in this manuscript.</p><p>Similarly, we use the same algorithm to perform analysis when the path model consists of three exogenous and one endogenous variable. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>, and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, we can observe the similar pattern of results as we obtained in the case of two exogenous and one endogenous path model. </p></div>

It contains 200 observations with three advertising medias facebook, newspaper, and youtube on sales. In present study, we consider sales as a endogenous variable and facebook and newspaper as a exogenous variables, denoted it by Y , X 1 , and X 2 , respectively. In general, the expending money on advertising through facebook has better sales than newspapers but there are also some indirect effect on sales by advertising through newspapers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>The present study explored the path analysis models when the endogenous (dependent) variable and exogenous (independent) variables are jointly associated with the elliptical copulas and investigated the efficacy of path models when direct and indirect effects are estimated using classical ordinary least squares and copula-based regression approaches in different scenarios. First, we developed the basic structure of the regression models in terms of copulas and explored some typical examples for the Gaussian and t-copulas. Based on the well-organized numerical scheme, we estimate the path coefficients using classical and copula approaches and also study the direct and indirect effects of exogenous variables in path models. This study suggest that the copula-based path analysis performs better over the classical approach in terms of mean of MSE, standard deviation of MSE, AIC, and BIC. In the copula approach, we observed that the total effect of each exogenous variable on the endogenous variable is approximately equal to their correlation coefficient. Apart from the present study, we intend to explore the distribution of the indirect effects using copula approach in near future.</p></div>
