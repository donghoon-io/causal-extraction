<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The environment for grid investment has become increasingly complex in the context of the dual carbon target and new power system transformation. Accurate prediction of the grid's investment capacity is a prerequisite for grid companies to make investment decisions. Therefore, in order to make an accurate investment capacity assessment of the grid in the complex context, a set of simple and comprehensive index system and a scientific prediction model are needed to forecast the grid investment capacity, so that the grid can make a reasonable investment strategy in the new situation. At present, some literature has made preliminary exploration on the influencing factors of investment capacity from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Qualitatively, literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> analyzed the investment capacity of enterprises from two perspectives of investment efficiency and investment scale of grid enterprises, and summarized the main influencing factors. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> investigates the influence of management power on corporate investment, and the results show that power intensity is significantly and positively related to the level of corporate investment. Quantitatively, the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> used the TOPSIS method to analyze the excellent level of investment capacity of grid companies in each year. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, on the other hand, investigates the dynamic feedback relationship between the amount of grid investment and investment efficiency based on system dynamics. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> verified the influence mechanism between grid investment and macro-environmental factors based on co-integration theory and vector error correction model. In order to accurately grasp the investment capacity of grid enterprises, some studies forecast the grid investment capacity. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a multi-region grid investment capacity measurement method based on assetliability ratio, which provides a basis for the investment plan of grid enterprises. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> constructs an investment capacity measurement model adapted to the power system reform through comprehensive plan balance optimization, and reasonably allocates the investment of each project. Compared with the above traditional forecasting model, the intelligent forecasting algorithm can avoid the errors caused by subjectivity. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> constructed a provincial grid investment scale prediction model based on MLR and REF neural network, and the model prediction error is small. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, on the other hand, used an improved support vector machine model to forecast and analyze the investment capacity of a power grid company. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> performs a variational modal decomposition and forecasts it using multiple support vector machine models. A small part of the literature predicts the grid investment capacity based on two and more models. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a LSTNET-ship2 network model for grid investment capacity prediction by applying a combination of convolutional networks, CRU networks, and autoregressive models. The literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed a combined forecasting model combining gray forecasting model, BP neural network and multiple regression model, thus combining the advantages of various methods to forecast the grid investment scale and further improving the forecasting accuracy. From the above literature analysis, it can be obtained that there may be serious coupling relationship among the factors of grid investment capacity. Therefore, when selecting the influencing factors, the original information is retained as much as possible, so that the simplified influencing factors truly reflect the level of grid investment capacity. And a suitable intelligent prediction model is selected to improve the accuracy of grid investment capacity prediction. Therefore, this paper firstly selects the factors affecting the grid investment capacity from the internal and external environment, and analyzes the mutual influence relationship and the degree of influence between each index and the investment capacity. Finally, the maximum investment capacity of the grid is predicted based on the BP neural network prediction model. The prediction results show that the proposed prediction method can predict the grid investment capacity more accurately.</p></div>

The total effect of the factors on the investment capacity should be the sum of the direct diameter coefficient and the indirect diameter coefficient, and only consider the direct diameter coefficient is not comprehensive. Therefore, in order to make the results more reasonable and reliable, the investment ability modeling should be composed of internal financial indicators and external factor correction coefficient.</p></div>
