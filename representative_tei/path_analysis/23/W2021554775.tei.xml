<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Motivation has been given the credit of bringing success to the employee performance.</p><p>However, not many empirical discussions could be found within the higher education industry, especially among lecturers. Indeed, Malaysia believes that education is one of the critical elements in the development of the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arokiasamy, Ismail, Ahmad &amp; Othman, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Education among individuals is a means to career term and social mobility, whereas from the government's perspective, it is a crucial step in the country's economic development <ref type="bibr">(Benjamin, Marathamuthu, Muthaiayh &amp; Raman, 2011)</ref>. The crucial workforce in the universities themselves, are lecturers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arokiasamy et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Over the past decades, intrinsic motivation has been widely studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Some research defined this nexus between human and tasks exist because of satisfaction and fulfilment a person's experience after completing a desire task <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. This satisfaction and fulfilment were proven to be the driving forces of intrinsic motivation that input inside all individuals. Meanwhile, another type of motivation that share opposite value of intrinsic motivation was named as extrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation was defined as individual willingness to complete a task because of some separable outcomes or rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Even though, most researchers agree that intrinsic motivation plays a prominent role among individuals, some of the job tasks and social demands that are not willing to be accomplished by individual have decreased the freedom to be intrinsically motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref>, many educational activities implemented in the education industry are not designed to be interesting. As a result, the challenge faced by the industry is about how to motivate lecturers to be self-regulated with such activities, in the absence of external pressure and able to carry out the activities on their own. Furthermore, when OCB was first introduced in early 1930s by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnard (1938)</ref>, researchers started to develop a proper dimension to identify the OCB. The first two dimensions were introduced by Smith, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Organ and Near (1983)</ref>, which only consisted of altruism and generalized compliance. This two dimension were used to enhance the company effectiveness and efficiency in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Smith et al., 1983)</ref>. However, all dimensions introduced by the previous researchers were not accepted widely until the new dimension which introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Organ (1988)</ref> was found. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Organ (1988)</ref>, OCB dimension should consist of altruism, courtesy, sportsmanship, civic virtue and conscientiousness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Theoretical Background</head><p>The present model was developed according to the theoretical and empirical studies from the psychology and human management literature, particularly on the work of the following researchers: <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Organ (1988)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ishak, Suhaida and Yuzainee (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Megginson and Whitaker (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Meyer, Allen and Smith (1993)</ref>.</p><p>The key theoretical linkage in this study is the lecturer's OCB is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, which in return it affects their performance. To explain the existence of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation-OCB relationship, the Social Exchange Theory (SET) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blau (1964)</ref> is used as a basis. Social exchange theory (SET) explained that all human behaviour involves benefit maximization and cost minimization. Based on SET posit that one-time exchange can relatively turn to long-term relationship of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Molm, 1997)</ref>. Therefore, the contribution of knowledge of employee can be affected by the cost and benefit. For example, the cost of helping the institutions or colleagues are time, effort and loss of knowledge power; however, the benefits gained include enjoyment in helping others, organization rewards and knowledge self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kankanhalli, Tan &amp; Kwok-Kee, 2005)</ref>. Therefore, it involves both intrinsic and extrinsic benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deci and Ryan, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Vallerand, 1997)</ref>. For example, lecturers who enjoy helping institutions or colleagues perform OCB because they are intrinsically motivated. However, lecturers who are willing to perform extra in exchange of rewards, they are extrinsically motivated.</p><p>To explain the existence of OCB-employee performance relationship, the norm of reciprocity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gouldner, 1960)</ref> and SET were used as a basis. This theory establishes the obligation to return a favour and therefore, sustains relationships. It states that people should help those who have helped them and people should not injure those who have helped them <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gouldner, 1960)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rook (1987)</ref>, the universal norm of reciprocity is the strongest of the social norms relevant to helping behaviour. By reciprocating good deeds, the individual will increase the chances of receiving benefits in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gouldner, 1960)</ref>. In the educational settings, employees of higher educational institutions sometimes may perform extra-role behaviors, which add value to the institutions.</p><p>Gender roles create expectations of the behaviors necessary to fulfill the role of 'female' and 'male'. In other words, people are expected to behave in ways consistent with their socially prescribed gender roles. Past studies (e.g: <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Deluga, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Morrison, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Van Dyne &amp; Ang, 1998)</ref> have generally reported differences between males and females in terms of their OCB enactment. The five dimensions of OCB encompass behavioral expectations that appear consistent with masculine and feminine stereotypes and role expectations. In this light, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kidder and Parks (2001)</ref> categorized OCB into two groups. Altruism, courtesy and conscientiousness are considered feminine OCBs, whereas sportsmanship and civic-virtue are perceived as masculine OCBs.</p><p>Meanwhile, human capital theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Becker, 1964)</ref> suggested that long-tenured workers are better performers because they have accumulated more job-related knowledge over the course of their careers. Individuals can accumulate human capital through both formal education and work experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Meyer, Griffith &amp; Daugherty, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Singer &amp; Bruhns, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Strober, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Economists suggest that experience and education are signals to organizations about employees' knowledge and skill levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sicherman &amp; Galor, 1990)</ref>. The labour market rewards individuals from acquiring more human capital with access to better jobs, higher earnings, and greater incentives to remain <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Strober, 1990)</ref>. In turn, employees with longer tenure have greater incentives to perform well into the future.</p><p>Generally, the justification for the choice of these models and theories lies in their explicit theoretical relevance in gaining a complete perspective of lecturer motivation that might influence their OCB, and subsequently affect their performance. The initial emphasis of this study was on the comparison of the two motivation dimensions, namely intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. These dimensions were deemed to be significant with lecturer's OCB.</p><p>Besides, this study also looked at OCB and its relationship with employee performance.</p><p>However, the OCB-employee performance relationships were expected to be contingent upon one factor. One of the particular interest in this study was the demographic factors variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Motivation and Employee Performance</head><p>In studies on motivation for teaching, it is common to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic reasons for choosing the profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Roness, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eyal &amp; Roth, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Moran Kilpatrick, Abbott, Dallat &amp; Mcclune, 2001)</ref>. Intrinsically motivated lecturers are focused on the activity that is significantly related to their inherent satisfaction or joy <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, rewards and benefits are the driven forces for the lecturers who are extrinsically motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brookhart and Freeman (1992)</ref> reviewed American research that has sought to determine the characteristics of incoming academic candidates and they find that the reasons for choosing teaching were connected to intrinsic sources of motivation.</p><p>Studies in Australia indicate that personal fulfilment, the desire to work with young children and to make a difference in their life and the opportunity to experience a meaningful engagement with the subject of their choice are intrinsic motivational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Manuel &amp; Brindley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Manuel &amp; Hughes, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Meantime, extrinsic motivation was found to be significant to employee performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Stringer, Didham &amp; Theivananthampillai, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Manolopoulos, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Decoene &amp; Bruggeman, 2006)</ref>. The public sector is more likely to engage in extrinsic motivation rather than intrinsic motivation and this extrinsic motivation was related to better organizational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Manolopoulos, 2008)</ref>. Tough, overemphasizing on the use of extrinsic motivation could lead to negative effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kelsey, 2010)</ref>. Extrinsically motivated adaptor may exert minimal effort to perform a task and may stop an activity when reinforcement discontinues and decrease the performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cheng &amp; Yeh, 2009)</ref>. In addition, it is hard to determine which motivational factors influence the intensity and quality of the production of intangible firm-specific pool resources, especially tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Osterloh Frost &amp; Frey, 2002)</ref>. Therefore, it could be a serious limitation since not only the introduction of the distinction but also the interplay between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation and also with other factors. In order to keep the educators in the profession, it is important to build up a better understanding of what teachers actually say about their motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Roness, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, it is important to identify which type of motivation the lectures are likely to engage with in order to improve their performance.</p><p>Therefore, this research hypothesizes that:</p><p>• H1: Intrinsic motivation is better in terms of explaining the variances of employee performance among lecturers in Malaysia.</p><p>• H2: Extrinsic motivation is better in terms of explaining the variances of employee performance among lecturers in Malaysia.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediator</head><p>OCB comprises extra-role behaviours that are not within role but nevertheless of great importance for efficient processes in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Organ, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Podsakoff, Ahearne &amp; Mackenzie, 1997)</ref>. Building upon work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ehrhart, Bliese &amp; Thomas, 2006)</ref> that supports OCB as a means of positively influencing organizational performance; it is argued that the OCB of the implementation team should result in a successful outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Niehoff (2005)</ref> suggested that OCB exerts positive influence on organizational performance because it provides socioemotional support to other employees, and facilitates the work of others. Therefore, employees may contribute to organizational effectiveness by building socio-emotional support in the organization and facilitating more efficient work behaviour.</p><p>Helping behaviour stimulates performance because new colleagues are easily integrated into the group. Therefore, the group can establish best practices, ease in coordination, and thus variations of performance become less probable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boerner, Eisenbeiss &amp; Griesser, 2007)</ref>. Given high levels of sportsmanship, the group does not need to spend much energy and time on group maintenance functions. Hence, sportsmanship may raise the attractiveness of group membership for high performers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boerner et al., 2007)</ref>. With increasing of followers' conscientiousness, leaders may tend to empower their followers and thus, raise their performance motivation. Accordingly, in a comprehensive literature review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Paine and Bachrach (2000)</ref> found OCB to predict followers' performance.</p><p>OCB is vital for productivity but organizations fail to forecast the entire spectrum of subordinate behaviours needed for achieving goals through stated job descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Organ 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deluga, 1994)</ref>. A researcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Organ, 1990)</ref> suggested that OCBs play an important role in the development of social capital in organizations. Their conceptual framework identified that OCBs include altruism, sportsmanship, civic virtue, courtesy and conscientiousness, which contribute to the creation of structural, relational and cognitive aspects of social capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bolino, Turnley &amp; Bloodgood, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>As suggested, salient identification enhances the frequency of cooperation and cooperative behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Islam, Anwar, Khan, Rasli, Ungku Ahmad &amp; Ahmed, 2012)</ref>. When individuals are identified by their organizations, they are more willing to engage in cooperative, altruistic and spontaneous unrewarded citizenship behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Islam et al., 2012)</ref>. Briefly, OCB may mediate the relationship between motivation and employee performance among lecturers in Malaysian higher education.</p><p>• H3a: The effect of OCB is perfectly mediating the relationship between intrinsic motivation and employee performance among lecturers in Malaysia higher education.</p><p>• H3b: The effect of OCB is perfectly mediating the relationship between extrinsic motivation and employee performance among lecturers in Malaysia higher education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">OCB and Employee Performance: Gender and Organization Tenure as Moderator</head><p>The notion of 'role' is of central importance in understanding the moderating effect of gender on the relationship between OCB and employee performance. Gender roles create expectations of the behaviours necessary to fulfil the role of 'female' and 'male'. In other words, people are expected to behave in ways that are consistent with their socially prescribed gender roles.</p><p>Several past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Deluga, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Morrison, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Van Dyne &amp; Ang, 1998)</ref> have generally reported differences between males and females in terms of their OCB enactment. The five dimensions of OCB encompass behavioural expectations that appear consistent with masculine and feminine stereotypes and role expectations. In this light, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kidder and Parks (2001)</ref> categorized OCB into two groups. Altruism, courtesy and conscientiousness are considered feminine OCBs, whereas sportsmanship and civic-virtue are perceived as masculine OCBs.</p><p>With regard to altruism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kidder and Parks (2001)</ref> further argue that while it would be inaccurate to suggest that males do not help others, females are expected to be more nurturing and caring <ref type="bibr">(Eagly &amp; Crowly, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Erdle, Sansom, Cole &amp; Heapy, 1992)</ref> and indeed past research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">George, Carroll, Kersnick &amp; Calderon, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Morrison, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Van Dyne &amp; Ang, 1998)</ref> has found that females are perceived to be more altruistic and helpful than males.</p><p>Additionally, asking for help violates masculine gender role norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Good, Dell &amp; Mintz, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, courtesy fits feminine stereotypes, where females are seen as more aware of other's feelings and needs. Again, conscientious behaviours that include doing the job well with meticulous attention to detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Organ, 1988)</ref> appear to be consistent with feminine stereotypes and role-expectations. On the contrary, sportsmanship and civic virtue have expected more from males than females.</p><p>Given the above, if people are expected to perform the OCBs related to their gender roles, this would suggest that females would get more credit, in terms of rewards or academic success than males for performing masculine OCBs, for instance, civic virtue and sportsmanship.</p><p>Implicitly, the behaviours of the females go beyond expectations, and thus are likely to be rewarded. This would also be true for males performing feminine OCBs such as altruism, courtesy and conscientiousness. Therefore, this research hypothesizes that:</p><p>• H4a: The effects of gender moderate the relationship between OCB and employee performance among lecturers in Malaysia higher education.</p><p>In addition, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ng and Feldman (2010)</ref>, much less theoretical and empirical work has been conducted on how long organizational tenure affects performance. This gap in the literature is due to the widespread assumption that workers with more years of service are generally better performers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(McEnrue, 1988)</ref>. The researchers have long argued that employees with more years of service know how to perform their jobs better <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wagner, Ferris, Fandt &amp; Wayne, 1987)</ref>, whereas poor-performing employees are likely to be weeded out before they accumulate many years of service <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schneider, Goldstein &amp; Smith, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Cohen (1997) postulated that since employees accumulate relevant work experience as tenure increases, both their autonomy and their performance also grow. Sturman ( <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) also argued that the explicit and tacit organizational knowledge gained through organizational tenure have unique positive effects on job performance. Moreover, given that increases in organizational tenure are also accompanied by increases in chronological age, the types of performance that long-tenured employees enjoy and excel at might be different from those of young new hires.</p><p>For instance, research on aging and development suggests that older individuals adapt to aging by giving higher priority to socially oriented tasks that are emotionally satisfying to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carstensen, Issacowitz &amp; Charles, 1999)</ref> and that they will invest their resources more in those goals that match their motivations and interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beier &amp; Ackerman, 2001)</ref>. As such, longer tenured employees may dedicate more resources to social-oriented tasks (helping others, making constructive suggestions) than other technically oriented job tasks. Therefore, this research hypothesizes that:</p><p>• H4b: The effects of organizational tenure moderate the relationship between OCB and employee performance among lecturers in Malaysia higher education.</p><p>As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the current study proposes that OCB mediates the relationship between motivation and employee performance as well as gender and organization tenure moderate the OCB-employee performance relationship. Meantime, investigation on the motivation effects on employee performance also shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Participant</head><p>With 6,000 questionnaires sent out through electronic mail to the five major research universities in Malaysia, 368 lecturers participated. The participants were aged between 36 -45 years old (frequency = 156, 42.4%). In addition, the gender of participants were found to be almost equal (Male: frequency = 181, 49.2%; Female: frequency = 187, 50.8%) and most of the participants are Malay participants (frequency = 266, 72.3%). Out of the 368 participants, most of them obtain a Postgraduate Degree (frequency = 251, 68.2%). In addition, it is not surprising that out of 368 participants, 302 of them were married (frequency = 302, 82.1%) and the mean age of the participants was between 36 -45 years old and most of the participants are Malaysian (frequency = 346, 94%). As expected, it is also not a surprise that most of the participants have a long working experience in academic industry (frequency = 290, 78.8%) because based on the mean score, most of them select more than 6 years of working experience in academic industry and most of them are senior lecturers (frequency =152, 41.3%). Furthermore, most of the participants spend more than 6 years working in the same organization (frequency = 246, 66.8%). Lastly, participants who return the questionnaires are slightly more from science area (frequency = 205, 55.7%) and the remaining are those from social science area (frequency = 163, 44.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Measurement</head><p>This study adopts split-half reliability and inter-item because it examines the degree of how unified the items are in the instruments and the consistency of respondents' answer for all items <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Herzog, 1996)</ref>. Alpha Cronbach's coefficient alpha and spearman brown coefficient were used because they provide a measure of the degree to which the full scale, derived from a set of items, is free from error <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cozby, 2005)</ref>. The questionnaire is considered highly reliable when the coefficient value (α) is above 0.70 as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hair, Anderson, Tatham and Black (1998)</ref>. In conclusion, the items in this study were considered reliable when the alpha Cronbach and coefficient value was above 0.70.</p><p>Multiple regression analysis is used for predicting the unknown value of a variable from the known value of two or more variables-also called the predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>. The strength of the relationship stipulated by the regression equation can be determined by using the appropriate measures of association. In multiple regressions, the strength of association is measured by the square of the multiple correlation coefficients, R 2 , which is called the coefficient of multiple determinations. It measures the strength of the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables. In this study, the larger the R 2 is, the more significantly the brand equity is associated with customer loyalty.</p><p>The moderating effect of gender and organizational tenure was analyzed using moderated multiple regression (MMR) analysis. To determine the presence of moderating effect, the OLS model was then compared with the MMR model which was represented by Equation <ref type="formula">2</ref>. Below are the definitions of the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Equation (1) Y = i1 + b1X + c1Z + e1 Equation (2) Y = i2 + b2X + c2Z+ d2(X*Z) + e2</formula><p>Where: Y = dependent variable; X = independent variable; Z = moderator X*Z = the multiplier of independent variable and moderator i = constant value for independent variable b, c, d = coefficients for independent variable and moderator e = regression residual R 2 value is observed to determine the significant effect of moderator to the studied relationship. If changes in R 2 (∆R 2 ) are statistical for the equations, then a significant moderation effect is present <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>. Dummy variable was created for gender and organizational tenure in this study, which was introduced into a regression equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hair, Anderson, Tatham &amp; Black, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and 3 represents the multiple regression analysis between intrinsic motivation and employee performance as well as extrinsic motivation and employee performance. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows that the intrinsic motivation dimensions were positively and significantly associated with employee performance. As seen from the coefficient of determination, adjusted R 2 , intrinsic motivation dimensions accounted for 34.1% of the variance in employee performance and, all four dimension dimensions (meaningfulness: β = .469, p &lt; .01; choice: β = .485, p &lt; .01; competence: β = 0.566, p &lt;.01; progress: β = 0.532, p &lt;.01).</p><p>The value of adjusted R 2 in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> implies that the extrinsic motivation dimensions explained 9.2% of the total variance in employee performance and extrinsic motivation dimensions were positively associated with employee performance.

In addition, extrinsic motivation also found to significantly affect the OCB (β = 0.459, p&lt; 0.05). In the third equation, the finding showed that OCB significantly affects employee performance (β = 0.748, p&lt; 0.05). However, extrinsic motivation showed no significant effect with employee performance (β = -0.036, p&lt; 0.05).

This R² means that 53.5% of the variance in job performance is explained by OCB and gender groups. Model 2 shows the results after the product term (OCB*gender) was included in the equation. As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>, the addition of the product term resulted in an R 2 change of .004 and F change = 3.357, p &gt; 0.05]. The results do not support for the presence of a moderating effect. The results summarized that the relationship between OCB and employee performance was not moderated by gender. The sig.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this study was to explore the variance between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation in relationship to employee performance. In addition, this study also investigates the mediating effect of OCB and the moderating effect on gender and organization tenure. Specifically, substantial evidence based on previous empirical work support the relationship between motivation and employee performance; however, limited amount of evidence point to a link comparing the variances of motivation in explaining the employee performance. In addition, smaller amount of evidence based on more recent studies has begun to investigate the mediating effect of OCB; however, these streams of work have largely concentrate to industry other than higher learning, specifically lecturers. Moreover, past studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Deluga, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Morrison, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Van Dyne &amp; Ang, 1998)</ref> have generally reported differences between males and females in terms of their OCB enactment and organization tenure also reported have unique positive effects on job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sturman, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, gender difference and organizational tenure may affect the OCB-employee performance relationship. As such, an examination of the suitable types of motivation is used in determining the employee performance, interplay of OCB, gender and organization tenure represented an important need in the human resource management literature, and thus, a key contribution of the present study.</p><p>In general, our findings only support two of our predictions: Intrinsic motivation explain higher variance in explaining the lecturer's performance, OCB mediate the relationship between extrinsic motivation and employee performance. On the contrary to our predictions, extrinsic motivation explaining lower variances compare to employee performance, OCB does not mediate the relationship between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation, gender and organizational tenure does not moderate the OCB-employee performance relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Theoretical and practical implication</head><p>The findings on Pearson correlation analysis have confirmed that there is a significant relationship between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation on employee performance.</p><p>Then, further analysis is conducted using multiple regression analysis, which has also highlighted that intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation significantly improve the employee performance. Both findings, therefore, propose that intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation are imperative in developing and promoting higher performance among lecturers.</p><p>Both motivations are also responsible for encouraging employee to positively respond to his/her performance. In other words, both motivations have become a predominant issue to influence employee performance.</p><p>The current findings thus enhance the understanding of significance of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation on employee performance by suggesting the OCB as the mediating factor.</p><p>As highlighted in aforementioned earlier, little is known about the mediating effect of OCB on the relationship between motivation and employee performance. This study has discovered that OCB does not perfectly mediate the relationship between intrinsic motivation and employee performance. However, it does decrease the relationship between intrinsic motivation and employee performance. Meanwhile, the findings showed that OCB is perfectly mediated the relationship between extrinsic motivation and employee performance. The evidence denotes that it is important to practice the value of OCB among lecturers who are extrinsically motivated to increase their performance.</p><p>On top of that, the findings of this study will enrich employee performance literature, particularly on ways in which the relationship between OCB and employee performance does not moderate by gender and organizational tenure. It is believed that the employee performance has not been controlled by gender and organizational tenure among lecturers. It is also believed that the masculine and feminine stereotype effect does not imply in higher learning, especially among lecturers. Studies from other industries have demonstrated that organizational tenure and gender are the most common moderators. However, it is interesting to find out that both moderators do not have any impact on lecturers. It can be concluded that the nature of job and industry holds strong significance in causing the result that varies among different industries.</p><p>Based on the findings and conclusion of this study, several important practical contributions pertaining to the effect of employee performance were identified.</p><p>• First, the Ministry of Higher Education should employ the potential lecturers who understand the value of being a lecturer. Special attention should be provided to those lecturers who have a positive behaviour towards their job and tend to enjoy the job as a lecturer. This is because the teachers must be interested in what they teach and in the children when they are teaching. If they are not interested in the work at all, they can never motivate the class to learn.</p><p>• Second, the organization should not employ too much of regulations to monitor the lecturers' activities or promote the lecturers ego attainment whenever they accomplished something. Based on the findings, it can be stated that more regulations, punishments, and ego attainment tend to decrease the lecturers' performance.</p><p>Therefore, the organizations should give more freedom to the lecturers and help them to attain certain skill or knowledge that the lecturers can treat as their own.</p><p>• Third, the organization should focus more to promote the lecturer's prosocial behaviour.</p><p>Based on the finding, it is demonstrated that the lecturers who are extrinsically motivated are monitored by their sense of helping behaviour whenever they perform a task. Therefore, the organizations should encourage the lecturers to participate or carry out some activities in a group. This could increase the interaction with other lecturers which could promote their helping behaviour indirectly.</p><p>• Four, the lecturer's sense of helping behaviour towards better performance was not monitored either with gender or organizational tenure. Therefore, choosing the suitable lecturers for promotion should not account the duration they work with the organizations or be gender specific because it does not show greater performance for those who work longer or different in gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Limitations and recommendations for future study</head><p>As with most research, the results of this study should be interpreted with consideration of several limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not guarantee accurate results. Individual who is born in difference period of time may share different experience and behaviour. Therefore, we are not able to claim an accurate causal relationship based on this results. Future research would be recommended by using a longitudinal design to test the present findings.</p><p>Second, the study relied on employee self-reports of employee performance. Due to the reason that lecturers was believe to be a professional group members, organizations do not monitor closely on each lecturer individually. Therefore, we could not obtain departmental or managerial reports on the lecturer's performance and behaviour. As a result, we could not deny the fact that there would be biasness in answering the questionnaires. Based on this reason, we suggest that future research should impose controllable determinants over employee performance and OCB.</p><p>Finally, the findings of the study were not entirely representative to other industry. This study was only applicable to the higher learning industry because the employee performance measurement employed was set to investigate the lecturer's performance rather than other job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>Overall, we believe that this study give strengths and contribution to HRM literature and practice outweigh its limitations. First, we identified the suitable motivation that should use to explain the effect of employee performance among lecturers -an insight about the role of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation on employee performance in HRM research, specifically in higher learning education. Second, we shed light in identifying the mediating effect of OCB in extrinsic motivation and employee performance -a set of relationship that previous work in this area had left vague and unspecified. Third, we suggested variety of future direction in future research, including longitudinal design to investigate the present study, control the variables that involve investigating the participant self-behaviour or performance. Finally, we are hopeful that future HRM inquiry will acknowledge and attempts to inform the gaps between motivation, OCB, employee performance, gender and organizational tenure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
