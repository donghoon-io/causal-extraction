<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The coronavirus pandemic resulted in national lockdown orders, followed by employment changes to reduce labor costs. We assess how health varied for hospitality workers due to the lockdown (i.e., comparing health a month before to a month after), employment change (i.e., comparing those with loss versus no change), and employee response (i.e., more job threat versus more personal recovery). Comparing pre-and post-lockdown surveys of 137 U.S. and U.K. hospitality employees, psychological health (i.e., negative and positive affect) worsened but physical health (i.e., symptoms and sleep) improved. We proposed those facing work loss (66% had reduced hours, furloughs, or layoffs) had more job threat but also more personal recovery (i.e., relaxation, mastery, exercise), resulting in opposing pathways to health. Results from a path analysis showed that work loss indirectly linked to higher psychological distress due to job threat, but to lower distress and fewer physical symptoms due to more relaxation. Regardless of work loss, mastery (e.g., hobbies) was related to immediate changes in positive affect and sleep, while exercise did not have short-term health benefits. Further, recovery benefits from work loss were short-lived; only job threat carried the effect to psychological distress two months later. We offer quotes from the hospitality workers to contextualize the blessing and curse of work loss during the lockdown for these particularly vulnerable employees.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>"It's been a blessing and a curse. On one hand I have time for self-improvement I never had before (online courses, drawing/painting etc.) and I can see that having a lasting benefit beyond the pandemic. But I have no idea if I will still have a job or how the economy is going to react once this is over" <ref type="bibr">[Furloughed restaurant worker]</ref>.</p><p>In early 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the novel COVID-19 pandemic, which was followed by national lockdown orders for the public, causing massive disruption to society as we know it. The COVID-19 lockdown is a salient environmental event not just due to the virus itself, but through secondary organizational changes to abide by health regulations and curtail labor costs; changes that evoke employee stress and require adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Morgeson et al., 2015)</ref>. From March to April 2020, the number of U.S. employees with work reductions (i.e., fullto part-time) doubled, and job loss (i.e., temporary or layoff) increased five times in that month <ref type="bibr">(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020)</ref>. These events are particularly salient for the hospitality and leisure industry which faced the highest levels of labor reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allas et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, in the U.K. 80% reported being temporarily laid off (i.e., furloughed) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Osborne, 2020)</ref> and in the U.S. 47% reported no longer being employed <ref type="bibr">(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020)</ref>. We respond to the call for more evidence on employee health after COVID-19 lockdowns <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rudolph et al., 2020)</ref> and specifically the health of vulnerable populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bapuji et al., 2020)</ref>, by assessing how hospitality workers' health changes as a function of the primary lockdown event, a secondary work event (i.e., employment reductions), and their own adaptation to these changes.</p><p>Though most scholars hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic impaired health and wellbeing, there is mixed and contradictory evidence. Some indicators of health worsened immediately after the lockdown but not others <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sibley et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wanberg et al., in press</ref>) and in fact some found improvements to psychological and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Sullivan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>. One unexamined factor that could create such contradictory evidence is involuntary work reductions, which have countervailing pathways that may determine if health worsens or improves immediately post-lockdown. On the one hand, work reductions, "signal impending scarcity of resources (e.g., jobs)" <ref type="bibr">(Shoss et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr">in press,</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 8)</ref>, particularly threatening to the low-wage hospitality worker who tends to have both job and financial insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Shoss, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref>. As such, greater health costs might be found after the lockdown for employees in hospitality who had reduced hours, were furloughed, or laid off. Continuing to work during this time was also highly stressful <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gamio, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mull, 2020)</ref>, however, such that employment reductions offer a work respite that could have immediate health benefits if it gives more time to cope with the stressful environmental events than regular work hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015)</ref>. No known study has simultaneously compared both pathways from employment changes to employee health.</p><p>The purpose in the current study was to determine the extent employment changes (work reductions or loss) and employee adaptation to the change (job threat, personal recovery) explained changes in psychological and physical health in the few months following the environmental event (the COVID-19 lockdown). We aim to explain contradictory health trends by integrating conservation of resources (COR) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hobfoll, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hobfoll et al., 2018)</ref> with stress-recovery literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sonnentag et al., 2017)</ref>. We propose that employment changes result in a loss of a valued condition creating threat to future resources, which harms health <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Shoss, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref> but also a gain in the valued resource of time for adaptive coping behaviors that benefit health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015)</ref>. Our study responds to calls to assess how recovery experiences can help short-term adaptation to stressful situations and the pandemic specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anicich et al., 2020)</ref>, and is novel by simultaneously comparing recovery and threat as mechanisms explaining how work loss during a major environmental event influences health.</p><p>Our inquiry makes a unique empirical contribution to understanding employees' coping with COVID-19 in terms of who we focus on, what we learn about health and how we are able to test it. First, we offer insights into employees who have particularly precarious jobs during lockdown orders: those in the hospitality and leisure industry who depend on customers leaving their homes and cannot shift to remote work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(ADP, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Bick et al., 2020)</ref>. Though several employee health publications have emerged regarding the pandemic (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wanberg et al., in press</ref>) none have specifically focused on employment changes during the societal lockdown for the most vulnerable employees. Second, our study contributes to what we know about work reductions and health by simultaneously testing two mechanisms that are typically studied separately: (1) threat and uncertainty about job-related resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref> and</p><p>(2) a respite from job-related stress and time for recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aguiar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barnes et al., 2016)</ref>. By comparing them in the same study, we can learn whether and why work reductions predict employee health comprehensively, allowing for both improvement and detriments to health. Third, we conduct our study measuring both psychological and physical health immediately before and after the events <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>, avoiding a long lag that could permit extraneous factors to explain changes <ref type="bibr">(Wanberg et al., in press</ref>). As such, we isolate salient environmental and work events, with participants acting as their own controls, permitting stronger causal inferences about health changes. Finally, our results offer practical implications about the efficacy of three types of coping responses to the pandemic events. We test three activities recommended by national health organizations as ways of coping in the short-term with the lockdown orders (Centers for Disease <ref type="bibr">Control and Prevention, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Health Service, 2020)</ref>: quiet relaxation, hobbies or learning activities, and exercise. These activities align with recovery models to cope with work stress, but have not previously been tested in response as a way to cope with a pandemic, and to offset health costs from job insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anicich et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sonnentag, 2018)</ref>. We compare effectiveness of recovery activities as a short-term response to acute environmental stressors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pandemic-Related Events and Employee Health Changes</head><p>Based on an event-oriented view of organizational phenomena, events that are salient and require adaptation are those that feel novel or uncertain, disruptive to how work is usually done, and critical by interfering with daily interactions and habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Morgeson et al., 2015)</ref>. In line with this model of events, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown is the primary salient event, which also resulted in salient secondary events in organizations: employment changes. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, these events trickledown to employee health, by evoking threat appraisals and/or coping behavior, which together can be adaptive or maladaptive to health (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>To develop predictions about how these sets of events contribute to health, we draw on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, which "...emphasizes the objectively stressful nature of events" <ref type="bibr">(Hobfoll et al., 2018, p. 104)</ref>, rather than perceptions as the starting point <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ganster &amp; Rosen, 2013)</ref>. When objective events threaten or remove valued resources, such as conditions (e.g., employment status, health) or energies (e.g., time, money), events heighten individual stress arousal and require energy to cope and adapt to changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Halbesleben et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hobfoll, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hobfoll et al., 2018)</ref>. To be an effective adaptation to change, responses must outweigh health costs of stress hormones and expended energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ganster &amp; Rosen, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Event: Coronavirus Lockdown and Health</head><p>Consistent with the COR idea of an objectively stressful shared event, surveys in March 2020 showed that the coronavirus outbreak was consistently rated as a major realistic threat to valued conditions (i.e., health, finances) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kachanoff et al., 2020)</ref>. Though such environmental events may be objectively threatening to resources, they may not affect health in the same ways across people. For example, a national sample of employees surveyed before and after a shared economic threat (the U.S. 2008 Recession) had significantly worsened physical health but not psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Frone, 2018)</ref>. Despite the coronavirus objectively threatening physical health, psychological health (higher negative and lower positive affect) seems more affected than physical health indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sibley et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wanberg et al., in press)</ref>. Even with psychological health, a national pre-COVID and post-COVID survey found mixed results: reduced positive affect but surprisingly also reduced negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>. Thus, we broadly assess health given the possibility of different conclusions.</p><p>We focus on two indicators of health that represent the initial adaptation to stressful events <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ganster &amp; Rosen, 2013)</ref>: psychological health (i.e., negative affect or distress and positive affect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brosschot et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Quinn et al., 2012)</ref> and physical health (i.e., somatic symptoms and insomnia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bono et al., 2013)</ref>. These health indicators tend to be positively and reciprocally related <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armon et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Charles &amp; Almeida, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref>, though as shown by the mixed evidence above, that is not always the case. We consider secondary events after the COVID lockdown that may help explain these differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Event: Employment Change and Employee Health</head><p>We propose a secondary event from the COVID lockdown helps to explain health: employment change. The national lockdown in the U.S. and U.K. was intended to reduce the spread of the virus, but also had economic ramifications for hospitality industries that depend on customers leaving their homes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allas et al., 2020)</ref>. During economic downturns, organizations make decisions to cut labor costs, which can occur by reducing hours (partial work loss), placing workers on temporary leave or furlough, or laying off workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kreidler, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">ADP, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Though scholars study these changes as unique job changes with differences in strength of health implications in the long-term <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Price et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Selenko et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shoss et al., in press)</ref>, in the short-term these are similar in that they are all loss of work that is likely to feel novel, disruptive, and critical while occurring during a pandemic. As per the event-oriented view and COR, such events require responses from employees that can be maladaptive or adaptive. We propose work loss has two pathways to health: resource threat worsens health and recovery activities improve health (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job-related Resource Threat Pathway</head><p>All three employment changes (work hour reduction, furloughs, and layoffs) represent an objective loss in employment, a valued condition itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hobfoll, 1989</ref>) and time at work, linked to a variety of tangible and psychological benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jahoda, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vander Elst, et al., 2016)</ref>. Specifically, work loss is typically linked to a loss in financial resources, but during the early stages of the lockdown many employees receive paid leaves, supplemental income and government assistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kelly, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Keown &amp; Mitchell, 2020)</ref>. Whether work loss is immediately accompanied by objective financial loss or not, we expect it evokes worries and uncertainty about future job-related resources (i.e., future employment, financial security) more than continuing to work during the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fryer, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jahoda, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shoss et al., in press)</ref>.</p><p>In fact, the threat of future resource losses can be just as aversive as objective loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Otto &amp; Dalbert, 2013)</ref>. We expect that employees with objective work loss at the early stage of the pandemic perceive greater threat to job and financial security <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Shoss, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shoss et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref> compared to those working the same as before.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: After the environmental event, employees with work loss feel greater threat (i.e., to future job and financial security) than those with no work loss.</p><p>A basic tenet of COR is that the threat of losing valued resources creates stress arousal, which has implications for psychological and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ganster &amp; Rosen, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. One of the identified psychological benefits of work is structured time, and work loss removes that structure and leaves time for rumination and worry <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jahoda, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Selenko &amp; Batinic, 2013)</ref>. More specifically, uncertainty about future employment and financial instability after work loss are linked to worse psychological health and physical health, with longitudinal studies showing chronic long-term health costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Creed &amp; Macintyre, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De Witte et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Jiang &amp; Lavaysse, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shoss et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sverke et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies also confirm indirect effects of employment loss and job insecurity on psychological and physical wellbeing via job-related financial benefits as well as other psychological benefits of employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hoare &amp; Machin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Selenko &amp; Batinic, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Selenko et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref>. During the global pandemic, there is an economic downturn that creates fear and uncertainty about job and financial security in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Davidson, 2020)</ref>; we uniquely ask whether employment changes that reduce work time heighten perceptions of job-related threat with immediate costs to psychological and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ganster &amp; Rosen, 2013)</ref>. In COVID-specific studies, post-pandemic threat appraisals predicted psychological health changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>, and threat to financial security predicted worse positive affect (i.e., life satisfaction) though not negative affect (i.e., depression) compared to levels measured a year ago <ref type="bibr">(Wanberg et al., in press)</ref>. We expand on this work by assessing the effects of employment changes and perceived threat to job resources on immediate changes in both psychological and physical health. Thus: Hypothesis 2: Job-related resource threat is negatively related to psychological (2a) and physical (2b) health after the lockdown.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Employment change (work loss vs no loss) has an indirect negative effect on psychological (3a) and physical (3b) health via job-related resource threat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal Resource Recovery Pathway</head><p>As stated above, work loss creates threats with health costs, but generally these costs are expected from chronic loss and accumulating stress over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McKee-Ryan et al., 2005)</ref>. For example, the idea that work loss removes the benefit of structured time is a concern in the longrun <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jahoda, 1982)</ref>. In the short-term, work loss results in a gain in personal time, an "energy" resource that can be invested in other valued outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. The gain in personal time after work loss gives an employee a respite, allowing for adaptive coping with stress. Respites are typically studied as breaks, weekends or vacations, which have immediate benefits to health <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Davidson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Etzion et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Westman &amp; Eden, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>The work loss (and personal time gain) is beneficial when employees spend that time on leisure and recovery experiences. In other research on employment changes during economic downturns, less time at work increased personal leisure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aguiar et al., 2013)</ref> and specifically time spent on personally beneficial behaviors like relaxation and hobbies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>According to COR, when people feel "richer" in resources, they feel more able to invest in future resources, such as investing time in voluntary activities that help them grow or feel healthier <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fritz &amp; Sonnentag, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hobfoll et al., 2018)</ref>. Consistent with specific advice by national health organizations during the lockdown, we focus on three activities used for recovery from work stress: relaxation (i.e., meditate, nap), mastery (i.e., hobby, garden), and exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Frone &amp; Brown, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hahn et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2015)</ref>. We expect that after the postlockdown employment changes, employment change determines extent of recovery experiences: Hypothesis 4: After the environmental event, employees with work loss have more recovery experiences (relaxation, mastery, exercise) than those with no work loss.</p><p>COR notes that some stress responses are maladaptive to health (e.g., drinking, aggression), but adaptive coping results in a net gain to health <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. All three recovery experiences seem to cope with stress adaptively <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sonnentag et al., 2017)</ref>. Relaxation experiences enhance psychological health by distracting from stressors and physical health by reducing arousal while conserving energy for future use <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fritz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hahn et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sonnentag et al., 2017)</ref>. Mastery experiences are investments in learning and growth, which enhance psychological health through autonomy and self-efficacy, and physical health by distracting from stressors and improving sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hahn et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sonnentag et al., 2008)</ref>. Finally, exercise improves psychological health through mood repair and selfimage, and physical health by gaining bodily strength and immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Calderwood et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sonnentag et al., 2017)</ref>. Notably, this body of evidence is based on planned or chosen breaks to reduce work stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sonnentag et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Trougakos et al., 2014)</ref>, making it less clear health gains emerge when coping with the unexpected and uncontrollable events of the pandemic. We ask whether all three recovery experiences enhance health after a major situational stressor.</p><p>Finally, we expect that employment changes indirectly benefit health through increased recovery behaviors. Unemployed people who spend more time on leisure activities have better psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Haworth &amp; Ducker, 1991)</ref>, and in one study after COVID-19 lockdown, people engaging in exercise and mastery experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lades et al., 2020)</ref> and using other forms of active coping (Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020) reported better psychological health. However, these studies did not assess employment changes as a predictor of recovery and take the threat pathway into account. We take work loss and threat into account, proposing that: Hypothesis 5: Recovery (i.e., relaxation, mastery, exercise) after the lockdown is positively related to psychological (a) and physical (b) health.</p><p>Hypothesis 6: Employment change (work loss versus no loss) has an indirect positive effect on psychological (6a) and physical (6b) health via recovery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>Participants were recruited for a study on work stress and health [Institutional Review Board approval #00012461; masked for review] through Prolific Academic, an online participant pool that identifies and confirms study eligibility with a pre-screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Eligibility criteria were (1) employed in hospitality and leisure industry (i.e., hotel, restaurants),</p><p>(2) working more than 15 hours a week in the United States (U.S.) or United Kingdom (U.K.), and (3) over 18 years of age.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, data collection originally started in early February 2020, about a month prior to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the virus a pandemic (March 11 th ), followed by national lockdown orders that halted customers visiting stores in the U.S. and U.K. Given our original study was on service interactions, we were forced to close data collection for our original project with 178 eligible participants (March 19 th ). We reformulated the project [with IRB approval] to assess health changes before and after the lockdown, retaining the 176 participants who completed the survey prior to their own nation's lockdown orders (U.S. = March 15 th ; U.K. = March 23 rd ) to ensure survey responses represented pre-lockdown health.</p><p>Respondents received a link to the post-event survey one month after the lockdown orders (April 10 th ), then closed prior to the easing of lockdown restrictions (April 24 th ). After reminders, we had 137 respondents with complete pre-and post-event data (78% of baseline respondents). This final sample was 64.7% female, 34.6 years old on average (SD = 11.44) and employed in the US (29%) and UK (71%). 1 We combined data from both countries due to similarities in hospitality industry employment changes, leadership offering limited federal guidelines for responding to the pandemic, and governmental financial support for lower-income and unemployed workers and small businesses at the time of our second survey ("British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic," 2020; "CARES act," 2020; "COVID-19 pandemic in the United States," 2020). The majority of the sample was White (92%; 5.1% Black, 2.2% Hispanic/Latinx, 1.5% Asian, 0.7% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 0.7% Native American/Alaskan Native). On both surveys, participants selected annual household income category (1-7). On the pre-event survey, 18% reported incomes below $20,000, 35% at $20-40,000 (2), 25% at $40-60,000 (3), 10% at $60-80,000 (4), and 12% above $80,000, and the median income category was 2. At the pre-survey, all participants were employed in hospitality and leisure, with job titles such as bartender, chef, desk clerk, event coordinator, manager, and waiter. At the post-survey, only about a third (34.3%) reported working the same as before, consistent with the high levels of change in this industry in both nations (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020; Osborne, 2020), and the majority (79%) of those working had in-person interactions at least some of the time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employment Change: Work Loss</head><p>At the baseline survey, all of the 137 respondents were working in hotels, restaurants or other hospitality settings. In the post-event survey, they selected their current employment status as "employed and working the same hours" (n = 45), "employed at reduced hours" (n = 18), 1 As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, UK respondents differed from US respondents by having higher pre-lockdown insomnia and post-lockdown exercise.

Five put "other", and we were able to use open-ended comments to categorize them as work loss or not. We created an Employment Change variable, with 34.3% working the same as before (n = 47, coded 0) and 65.7% with work loss (n = 90, coded 1) during the pandemic. The two groups differed as expected in work hours and personal time. Based on post-survey responses, participants in the "Work Loss" group reported significantly fewer work hours on average (M = 1.89, SD = 3.06) than the "No Loss" group (M = 6.90, SD = 2.90) , t [132] = 9.11, p &lt; .001, 95% CI of difference = 3.92, 6.10) and significantly more hours for personal use or leisure per day (M = 9.22, SD = 6.82) than the no loss group (M = 4.50, SD = 2.99; t [132] = -4.46, p &lt; .001, 95% CIdifference = [-6.81, -2.62]). 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job-Related Threat</head><p>To measure the perceived threat of COVID-19 in the post-event survey, respondents were asked, "given your current situation, rate the extent that [job security]/[financial security] feel uncertain or threatened" (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely). 3 The inter-item correlation (r = .73) is more appropriate than an alpha coefficient and exceeded recommendations for two-item measures (r = .25) <ref type="bibr">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recovery Experiences</head><p>In the post-event survey, respondents indicated frequency (1 = very rarely, 5 = very often) of relaxation (2 items: "took time for leisure" and "did relaxing things"; α = .77;</p><p>2 Additional tests ensured we are not obscuring health differences by grouping these forms of work loss together. Employment change had the same direct effects on threat, recovery and health if omitting the category of reduced hours (n = 18) or laid off (n = 9), except the effect on exercise was no longer significant. We also compared leave with/without pay and working remote/in-person; none showed significant differences on our outcomes. 3 In the broader literature, job insecurity is positively related to financial resources, but they are studied as separate constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Vander Elst, et al., 2016)</ref>. We expected that during the early stage of the pandemic these were highly yoked given the uncertainty and volatility of both the labor market and stock market. Results are the same whether we are using the single item of threat to job security or to financial security, and they are highly correlated; thus we aggregated the two items to represent future job-related threat more broadly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007)</ref> and mastery (2 items: "did things that challenged me" and "did things that broadened my horizons"; α = .75). Participants also reported the number of days (0-7) they did exercise for 30 or more minutes per week, on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employee Health Changes</head><p>In the baseline survey, respondents rated their general health, while in the post-event survey participants rated their health "in the past month" to ensure it reflected health after the lockdown orders. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for means by survey. For psychological health, respondents rated how intensely (1 = Very slightly or not at all to 5 = Extremely) they felt 10 items that indicate negative affect or distress, such as scared, guilty, and jittery (αBaseline = .91; αPost-Event = .91), and 10 positive items that indicate positive affect, such as enthusiastic, proud, and interested (αBaseline = .93; αPost-Event = .87) <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Watson, 1988)</ref>. For physical health, respondents reported their frequency (1 = Not at all, 5 = Every day) of 10 somatic symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Spector &amp; Jex, 1998)</ref> including "upset stomach" and "headache" (αBaseline = .81; αPost-Event = .79) and a three-item measure of insomnia <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jenkins et al., 1988)</ref> to rate the frequency (1 = very rarely, 5 = very often) of waking up tired, difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep (αBaseline = .81; αPost-Event = .83). We omitted sleep and fatigue items from the symptoms measure to avoid overlap with insomnia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariate: Income Loss</head><p>Work loss may be accompanied by financial loss, and both can contribute to job-related resource threat and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Vander Elst et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wanberg et al., in press</ref>). To account for financial loss, we created a dichotomous variable indicating household income loss (income decreased from baseline to post-event, n = 40, coded 1) or no loss (income stayed the same or increased from baseline to post-event, n = 97; coded 0).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative Response</head><p>In the post-event survey, respondents were asked "Please share how COVID-19 has affected you at this time, in your own words" with an open-ended text box.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis and Results</head><p>We tested our hypotheses using a path analysis model in the lavaan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> in R version 4.0.2. Bootstrapped confidence intervals, including those for indirect effects, were calculated using the adjusted bootstrap percentile method with 10,000 resamples in lavaan.</p><p>In the path model, we included baseline health for each outcome (negative affect, positive affect, insomnia, physical symptoms) as a predictor of post-survey health to remove stable person-level differences or biases, and household income loss (or no loss) as a covariate of all responses to assess whether work loss predicts employee responses and psychological and physical health beyond household income loss. Consistent with other COVID-19 studies controlling for baseline health <ref type="bibr">(Wanberg et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>, demographics are not predictive of psychological and physical health changes and the model is the same with them included or omitted. We present the more parsimonious model results, with only baseline health and income loss as covariates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on our seven-factor measurement model (excluding the single-item measures and covariates), using an item-parceling approach given the large number of items for some measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Little et al., 2013)</ref>. We reduced the negative affect, positive affect, and physical symptom items into three parcels for each construct using the item-to-construct approach, consistent with best practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Little et al., 2002)</ref>. This model related to the income category, nor to income loss. This may be due to our broad income categories, but also other sources of funding offered (i.e., stimulus funding or unemployment benefits) during early stages of the pandemic.</p><p>showed excellent fit to the data (c 2 (115) = 137.17, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05) and was a significantly better fit than a six-factor model with recovery behaviors as a single factor </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lockdown Change and Health: Quantitative and Qualitative Data</head><p>Prior to hypothesis testing, we tested mean changes in our four health outcomes before and after the lockdown (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Results supported that psychological health worsened: negative affect increased (t (136) = -2.80, p = .01) while positive affect decreased (t (136) = 9.04, p &lt; .001). In contrast, physical health improved, with lower levels of somatic symptoms (t (136) = 6.34, p &lt; .001) and insomnia (t (136) = 2.75, p &lt; .01) after lockdown. Given these results for physical health, we explored whether changes varied by demographics (e.g., income, nationality, gender); however, physical health improved for all groups. Finally, employment change did not predict psychological or physical health: there were similar changes over time for the work loss and no change groups. This lack of direct effect on psychological and physical health is consistent with opposing pathways occurring simultaneously. Finally, we also reviewed the open-ended comments about how the pandemic had affected respondents. As illustrated by our opening quote referring to "a blessing and a curse", those with Work Loss referred to both resource threat and recovery time: "As much as I miss my family by not being able to see or visit them I have been able to spend more time with my children doing things we would normally not do. I have caught up with alot [sic] of things that also needed doing in the house." (Catering Assistant) "I am more worried about being able to make my house payment. I am more worried when I have to do any type of grocery shopping. Everything takes twice as long because of extra steps to sanitize etc." (Cashier/server) "If I'm honest, my life has improved. I am worried for the economy both globally and on a local level and frightened for the health of friends, family and community. However, I have been furloughed from a fairly stressful job on 80% of my income. I am more than happy to Stay at home and work on projects" (Assistant Manager)</p><p>Respondents still working the same made many statements about the health threats and less about job threats, but they also mentioned time at home during the lockdown:</p><p>"I believe I had symptoms of covid 19 [sic], starting almost 5 weeks ago. I isolated and currently still have chest issues although I think my symptoms have been what they term as mild. Mild however was still horrible. I feel nervous too. Nervous about the effects of this pandemic on those I love and care about" (Manager) "It has had little effect on my directly. For the most part, everything has been going business as usual, with the only significant difference not being able to go certain places." (Cook) "Spending more time at home with my wife and 10-month old, so that's nice. I work in the restaurant industry so we haven't closed down and my job isn't at risk, so I don't have to worry about finances, which is also a great relief. Mostly concerned with keeping myself and family safe and healthy." (Facilities &amp; technology at a restaurant) Thus, there were some themes aligning with job threat and recovery by employment change (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for more qualitative comments). We turn to assessing hypotheses with quantitative data.</p><p>Please see Table <ref type="table">3</ref> for summary of the hypotheses and results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employment Change and Health: Threat Pathway</head><p>The hypothesized path model showed an adequate fit to the data (CFI = .92, RMSEA = .096, SRMR = .09), especially given the relatively low sample size combined with the complex model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kenny et al., 2015)</ref> 5 . Hypothesis 1 proposed that employment change as work loss resulted in more job-related resource threat than no loss. Beyond household income loss, work loss was associated with more job-related threat (estimate = 1.13, SE = .31, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [.51, 1.73]), supporting Hypothesis 1. 6 Hypothesis 2 proposed that job-related threat predicts worsened psychological (2a) and physical (2b) health. Controlling for baseline psychological and 5 Further, we found that the fit indices improved if we simplified the two pathways to threat and relaxation (omitting mastery and exercise; CFI = .97, RMSEA = .067, SRMR = .069). This model had similar coefficients and conclusions as the a priori predicted model reported here. 6 An alternative argument is that this difference existed before the pandemic, such that those who had more job and financial insecurity had greater chance of being reduced or let go afterward. However, lower household income did not predict work loss, and income decreased similarly by income loss group, failing to support this argument.</p><p>physical health and income loss, job-related threat positively related to post-event negative affect (estimate = .17, SE = .03, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.11, .23]</ref>) but not positive affect, partially supporting Hypothesis 2a; further, threat was unrelated to post-event symptoms and insomnia (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), not supporting Hypothesis 2b.</p><p>Finally, Hypothesis 3 proposed the indirect effect of employment change on psychological and physical health through job threat. In partial support of the threat pathway for psychological health (3a), there was a significant and positive indirect effect of employment change on negative affect through job threat (estimate = .20, p = .004, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.08, .35]</ref>), but not on positive affect. As shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, the indirect effects of work loss on somatic symptoms and insomnia via job threat were not significant, not supporting the threat pathway for physical health (3b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employment Change and Health: Recovery Pathway</head><p>Hypothesis 4 proposed that employment change increases recovery experiences compared to those still working the same during the pandemic. Specifically, work loss increased relaxation (estimate = .47, SE = .16, p = .003, 95% CI [.17, .77]) and exercise (estimate = .88, SE = .37, p = .02, 95% CI [.13, 1.57]) compared to no loss, with no difference for mastery (see Table <ref type="table">4</ref>), partially supporting Hypothesis 4. Hypothesis 5 posited that recovery was beneficial for psychological (5a) and physical (5b) health, and we control for baseline affect levels and income loss to test these predictions. We find partial support for Hypothesis 5a: relaxation was negatively related to negative affect (estimate = -.24, p &lt; .001, SE = .07, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.37, -.11]</ref>) but not positive affect; while mastery was positively related to positive affect (estimate = .22, p = .001, SE = .07, p = .001, 95% CI[.09, .36]) but not negative affect. We also find partial support for Hypothesis 5b with the same two recovery experiences: relaxation was negatively related to somatic symptoms (estimate = -.11, p = .01, SE = .04, p = .01, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.19, -.03]</ref>) but not to insomnia, while mastery was related to insomnia (estimate = -.22, p = .01, SE = .09, p = .01, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.40, -.05]</ref>) but not to symptoms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up Analysis: Testing Model with Longer-Term Health Outcomes</head><p>Above we report findings that employment change had countervailing effects on psychological distress and somatic symptoms via threat and relaxation. Our reasoning and evidence focus on short-term effects of the pandemic, when the lockdown was a highly novel, disruptive, and critical event <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Morgeson et al., 2015)</ref>. However, one question is whether the immediate work loss has the same threat and recovery pathways on longer-term psychological distress and physical symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McKee et al., 2005</ref>). To answer this question, we conducted a follow-up survey in June, approximately three months from the lockdown and two months from the prior survey (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We were able to collect this additional wave of psychological and physical health data from 118 of the 137 (86%) participants; attrition did not vary by employment group and the final sample had similar demographics to the main study.</p><p>A mixed-model ANOVA with employment change condition showed that psychological health improved from post-event (MNA = 2.17, SDNA = .83; MPA =2.38, SDPA = .72) to follow-up survey (MNA = 1.97, SDNA = .71; MPA = 2.67, SDPA = .71); while physical health did not change from post-event (MSymptoms = 1.63, SDSymptoms = .52; MInsomnia = 2.99, SDInsomnia = 1.10) to followup (MSymptoms = 1.62, SDSymptoms = .53; MInsomnia = 2.94, SDInsomnia = 1.06). Similar to post-event survey, neither the level of follow-up psychological or physical health nor the change was directly predicted by work loss group (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> for details).</p><p>A CFA of the measurement model, which replaced the post-event psychological and physical health data with the follow-up psychological and physical health data, fit the data well (c 2 (116) = 138.34, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05). The hypothesized path model had similar fit to the data as the main study (CFI = .92, RMSEA = .09, SRMR = .09). As before, work loss is still related to job-related threat (estimate = 1.10, SE = .34, p = .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.39, 1.74]</ref>), relaxation (estimate = .52, SE = .18, p = .003, 95% CI [.17, .86]), and exercise (estimate = .80, SE = .40, p = .04, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.02, 1.57]</ref>). The similar findings with these same variables from the short-term model lends confidence that the smaller subsample is not fundamentally different.</p><p>The original model showed significant indirect effects of work loss on short-term changes to negative affect via threat and relaxation, and on short term changes to somatic symptoms via relaxation. The focus of this follow-up health data was to determine if the conclusions about the threat and recovery pathways changed when predicting longer-term health. We again controlled for baseline levels of health and post-pandemic household income loss in the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Threat pathway: Work loss to longer-term distress.</head><p>Regarding the previously supported threat pathway from work loss to negative affect, job-related threat was still significantly related to negative affect measured two months later (estimate = .08, SE = .03, p = .004, 95% CI [.03,</p><p>.13]). Further, the significant indirect effect of employment change on negative affect via job resource threat remained in this longer-term model (indirect effect estimate = .09, SE = .04, p = .04, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.02, .19]</ref>). Thus, the threat pathway was supported for longer-term changes in negative affect. No new significant effects of threat on longer-term health outcomes emerged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recovery pathway: Work loss to longer-term distress and symptoms. Previously we</head><p>found a recovery pathway of work loss on short-term negative affect and symptoms via relaxation. In the new model, relaxation immediately after lockdown still significantly predicted negative affect measured two months later (estimate = -.15, SE = .07, p = .04, 95% CI [-.28, -.01]); however, the indirect effect of work loss on negative affect via relaxation was no longer significant (estimate = -.08, SE = .05, p = .12, 95% CI [-.21, -.01]). Further, relaxation no longer predicted somatic symptoms in this longer-term model (estimate = -.05, SE = .05, p = .39, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.16, .06]</ref>). Thus, the recovery pathways for work loss were no longer supported for the longer-term effect changes. Further, other previously significant direct effects of recovery on health became non-significant with the longer-term health measures: mastery on positive affect (estimate = .11, SE = .07, p = .15, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.04, .24]</ref>) and insomnia (estimate = .06, SE = .10, p = .55, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.13, .25]</ref>). No new significant direct or indirect effects emerged in the follow-up health model, other than exercise having a trending effect on somatic symptoms (estimate = -.03, SE = .02, p = .09). See summary of these effects in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The 2020 novel coronavirus pandemic is clearly a health threat, but recent evidence has shown that its indirect influence on health is more complicated than it may seem <ref type="bibr">(Wanberg et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>. We focus on changes in psychological and physical health from before to immediately after the lockdown for hospitality workers, who are particularly vulnerable to job-related threats during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bick et al., 2020)</ref>. Similar to mixed evidence found in other studies, psychological health worsens in the short-term, but physical health actually improves. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we argue these health effects are influenced by the secondary event of employment changes after the lockdown, and employee perceived threat and adaptation to the change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Consistent with event systems theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Morgeson et al., 2015)</ref>, global pandemic and national lockdown events have trickledown effects on employment for employees, who have to adapt to these changes for better or worse. During the economic threat of the lockdown, the majority of our respondents saw temporary work loss which is common as a short-term response during economic downturns <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes et al., 2016)</ref>. COR theory is highly relevant for explaining how objective changes to employment can have benefits or costs to health, depending on how one perceives and responds to those changes. In fact, though work gives many resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hobfoll, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jahoda, 1982)</ref>, work loss did not directly explain changes in psychological and physical health, when measured at the same time or two months later. Work loss is usually framed as a chronic threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Shoss, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sverke et al., 2002)</ref>, with the research focusing on cumulative costs to health depending on duration of unemployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McKee et al., 2005)</ref>, and most studies assessing costs across years (e.g., De <ref type="bibr">Witte et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sverke et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, our study offers novel data about the short-term effect of work loss on health, which we find is only indirect through competing threat and recovery pathways.</p><p>In terms of the threat pathway, those with work loss had greater perceived job and financial threat than those who kept working during the pandemic, and threat linked work loss to psychological distress post-lockdown and even several months later. At the same time, work loss increases leisure time (compared to continuing to work), and such time gains tend to be invested in personally rewarding behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fritz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sonnentag et al., 2017)</ref>. Specifically, we found that those with work loss had increased recovery experiences of relaxation and exercise. Beyond the effect of threat, relaxation accounted for the indirect benefit of work loss on both psychological distress and somatic symptoms immediately post-lockdown only, not beyond that time frame. Results of this model offers novel evidence that work loss elicits both threat and recovery pathways in the short-run, helping to explain the mixed findings in other COVID-19 research that has found both costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sibley et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wanberg et al., in press</ref>) and null effects or gains to health <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Sullivan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Given prior evidence on unemployment and insecurity, it may seem surprising that job threat had no direct association with immediate physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(McKee et al., 2005)</ref>. One possibility is that sustained threat is the mechanism that contributes to bodily symptoms <ref type="bibr">(Charles &amp; Almeida, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ganster &amp; Rosen, 2013)</ref>, and in fact a review of longitudinal studies noted that costs of job insecurity on physical health appears to be cumulative over time <ref type="bibr">(e.g., De Witte et al., 2016)</ref>. Another possibility that offers nuance to COR theory is that it is actual resource loss, rather than the threat, that explains short-term physical health. In our study, actual household income loss (from pre-to post-event) directly predicted higher insomnia in the shortterm (with a trending but nonsignificant effect at the follow-up). This is consistent with other work showing job insecurity had indirect effects on physical health through financial losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Vander Elst et al., 2016)</ref>. We posit that for these lower income workers, income loss may result in problem-solving or budgetary planning activities taking the place of sleep.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that recovery from pandemic stress was similarly related to short-term psychological and physical health when compared to recovery from work stress evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bennett et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Demsky et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Steed et al., 2019)</ref>. Relaxation during lockdown had a direct relationship with distress and symptoms measured at the same time and with distress later in time, similar to meta-analytic evidence. Mastery (i.e., hobbies, growth) during lockdown was linked to immediate positive mood and insomnia, consistent with prior evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ong et al., 2017)</ref>, but did not predict health measured later, after the novelty of the lockdown had faded. After controlling for baseline health and other recovery activities, exercise did not predict immediate psychological or physical health changes though we see suggestive evidence that exercise is starting to improve physical health consistent with prior evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Calderwood et al., 2016)</ref>. Overall, we see short-term recovery benefits with pandemic-induced uncertainty and (likely involuntary) work breaks, thus contributing new understanding to recovery and detachment models of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fritz &amp; Sonnentag, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Public health announcements during lockdown encouraged people to engage in stressreducing and personally gratifying activities during lockdown (e.g., National Health Service, 2020). We sought to compare the likelihood and efficacy of three activities that align with the recovery literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sonnentag et al., 2017)</ref>: relaxation, mastery, and exercise. Hospitality workers who were employed the same post-lockdown had less leisure time than those with work loss, and were less able to engage in relaxation and exercise. However, regardless of employment change, hospitality workers with more relaxation experiences had lower negative affect immediately and several months later, while those with more mastery experiences felt and slept better immediately, but not later in time. Our study provides backing that relaxation and mastery help buffer the potential psychological and physical ramifications related to COVID-19 lockdown in the short-term. Specifically, this study sheds light on the benefit of relaxation (e.g., television shows, daily naps, leisurely walks) as a way to offset the negative psychological and physical health effects of job threat during the pandemic. This adds to the list of empirically backed strategies identified by previous research, such as active coping, emotional support, and religion <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zacher &amp; Rudolph, 2020)</ref>. Finally, exercise did not show immediate changes in health, but may have longer-term health benefits beyond the time frame of our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Calderwood et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Recommendations</head><p>A strength of our study is assessing changes in employment and psychological and physical health before and after the pandemic's lockdown orders. However, this approach limited the sample size (to those who responded to both surveys) and the health variables we could compare (only those in the initial study). The sample size reduces our ability to detect differences based on type of work loss (paid vs. unpaid leave, job loss vs temporary leave), which we might expect based on prior evidence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Selenko et al., 2011)</ref>. Instead, in all analyses we included a covariate to represent household income loss (or not) from pre-to post-pandemic. However, we note that this measure had wide income categories that might not be fine-grained enough or may be obtained too soon to see how financial losses matter to this lower-income sample. Despite these measurement concerns, we see that 29% had a loss to household income from pre-to postpandemic, and they had significantly greater threat and insomnia that those who do not see a loss, extending the evidence on financial resources and pandemic stress <ref type="bibr">(Wanberg, et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Given that the COVID-19 virus first emerged in late 2019, it is possible that the participants' psychological and physical health were affected prior to our first survey, thus reducing the differences that could be found in the second. We addressed this concern by focusing on the lockdown as our primary stressor event and restricting our sample to employees who responded to the survey prior to the lockdown order in their nation. Further, our postlockdown perceived threat and recovery experiences are measured at the same time as health in our main study. We addressed the concern of shared method variance explaining relationships by controlling for prior levels of psychological and physical health, so that our analyses account for the person-level tendencies for psychological and physical health. The concurrent data collection of threat, recovery and health might also result in concerns about causal direction, but results are generally similar when using health measures gathered several months later as a follow-up. We acknowledge that while about 60% remained in the same employment category (work loss or not) at the follow-up survey, about a third gained work while a handful had new work loss.</p><p>These changes are meaningful to the employees experiencing them, but we lacked the subsample sizes to effectively model how further employment changes affected follow-up psychological and physical health outcomes. Future researchers should explore the dynamic shorter-and longer-term effects of employment changes.</p><p>Finally, our sample is comprised of employees who work in the hospitality industry, which is part of the service-providing sector. We specifically focused on this industry given the unique elements that made these employees at risk and deserving of focused attention during the pandemic. The hospitality industry had one of the largest and most sustained unemployment rates in the U.S. and the U.K. during the time of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Partington, 2021)</ref>. Due to industrylevel economic uncertainty, job-related threat -regardless of whether one actually had work loss or not -was particularly salient compared to other industries that maintained steady employment levels across the pandemic (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Paul &amp; Moser, 2009)</ref>. Relatedly, this industry tends to be lowincome (in our sample 79% of the sample had household incomes of less than $60,000/year), and lower economic status is linked to less healthy behaviors and coping strategies <ref type="bibr">(Matthews &amp; Gallo, 2009)</ref>. Thus, the low-income sample may mean that recovery is less able to have longterm health benefits and job-related threat is more salient and consuming compared to higher income employees. Finally, as a service-providing industry those who continued working during the pandemic are likely to have faced stressors not faced by other types of industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gamio, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mull, 2020)</ref>. Thus, the stress and uncertainty whether facing work loss or continuing to work may have reduced the direct effect of employment condition on health, whereas other samples we may see a larger effect for work loss. We note, however, that the mixed findings for health mirror other studies using national samples that cut across employment contexts.</p><p>Overall, our main findings show that work loss has both costs and benefits on short-term psychological distress through threat and recovery. It is interesting to note that the COVID-19 lockdown event was costly to psychological health but that was rebounding within a few months, and physical health actually improved. These health indicators represent primary or initial stage stress responses, but the allostatic load of chronic pandemic stress likely needs more time to emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ganster &amp; Rosen, 2013)</ref>. Organizational scholars should continue examining how this pandemic affects worker health in the long-term, taking into account employment changes and personal adaptation to them.</p><p>Zacher, H., &amp; Rudolph, C. W. (2020). Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. American Psychologist, online first.  My work continues as usual, although we've changed procedures a lot to help protect both the employees and customers. Things do seem rather more tense at work than usual though as those changes in procedure are a constant reminder of the situation. Outside of work, I spend more time talking to family than I did before. Perhaps the most distressing thing is how long this is likely to continue. Even if the level of restrictions changes, we'll still be dealing with this until a vaccine is widely available, and that won't be soon.   ; greater values on Y-axis represent higher average levels of that indicator, X-axis represents the three surveys (in February, April, and June 2020). Means are plotted using only participants with complete data for all three waves (n = 118); these did not significantly vary by employment status, so subgroups are not shown for parsimony. The pre-to post-event changes were significant for both psychological and physical health (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>); changes from post-event to follow-up were significant for psychological but not physical health.</p></div>

I work in a school kitchen and at this time I am not needed to go to work possibly until after lock down ends. The weather has been lovely most of lockdown and we have been spending a lot of time in the garden enjoying the sunshine. It's a bit like being on holiday for us but we're not allowed out or to go anywhere fun. worried for the future of our business and our family's financial security but overall I am in a good mental state. I am enjoying the extra time with my immediate family, staying in touch with other family and friends and my mental health is benefitting from the extra time to do activities I don't normally have the time for.COVID-19 has created a lot of added stress in my life. My work hours are greatly reduced which is causing a great deal of financial strain. I'm hopeful about the relief checks that we're supposed to get, but this is only a band-aid solution. I also worry that I might be at high risk because I have an auto-immune disorder and hypertension, and I worry about my mother because she's in her 60s which puts her at high risk. Although I try to stay up to date about COVID-19, I've also been trying to set time aside to keep my mind off of it and immerse myself in television, video games, and drinking Just feeling constantly stressed, constantly worried about interacting with customers at work. My mom works at the hospital so worried about her, my dad has an extremely poor immune system so worried about him. Most of my friends work in some form of hospitality so we are all keeping apart Health threat Manager I believe I had symptoms of covid 19, starting almost 5 weeks ago. I isolated and currently still have chest issues although I think my symptoms have been what they term as mild. Mild however was still horrible. I feel nervous too. Nervous about the effects of this pandemic on those I love and care about.
