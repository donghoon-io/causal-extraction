<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The present study aimed to advance insight in the role of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in the recovery process, by focusing on the strenuousness of LTPA. It was proposed that-compared with less strenuous LTPA-more strenuous LTPA would show stronger positive relationships with recovery through higher levels of mental disengagement from stressors resulting from more strenuous LTPA. This hypothesis was examined in two studies, in which participants' positive and negative affective states were included as indicators of recovery. Study 1 was a 10-day daily diary study (3 measurements daily) among 74 employees. Each day, participants reported the time they had spent on mild, moderate, and strenuous LTPA. Multilevel path analysis showed that only strenuous LTPA was related to beneficial changes in the two indicators of recovery before bedtime and in the next morning through its positive relationship with psychological detachment from work. Study 2 was an experiment with two between-participants conditions, in which-after a stress-inducing task-44 participants engaged in either (a) a 20-min moderate intensity cycling task, or (b) a 20-min high intensity cycling task. Results showed that high intensity exercise was indirectly related to higher recovery as indicated by a lower level of participants' negative affective state, through lower levels of rumination about the stress-inducing task in this condition. The results of these two studies indicate that to fully savor LTPA's beneficial effects through mental disengagement from stressors, it is best conducted with a high level of strenuousness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the past years, many studies have tried to disentangle the associations between various types of off-job activities and recovery from work-related load effects. The relevance of this endeavor is clear, because sufficient recovery is vital for the protection of employee health and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Meijman &amp; Mulder, 1998)</ref>. Recovery refers to the process by which the psychological and physiological systems that were activated because of job demands or other stressors return to their predemand levels <ref type="bibr">(Sonnentag &amp; Geurts, 2009)</ref>. On a psychological level, this is reflected in beneficial changes in employees' affective states (see <ref type="bibr">Sonnentag &amp; Geurts, 2009</ref> for an overview). In the long run, insufficient recovery causes employees' psychophysiological systems to malfunction, which may result in chronic and manifest physical and mental health problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Devereux, Rydstedt, &amp; Cropley, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Feldt et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sonnentag &amp; Geurts, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>For many types of off-job activities (e.g., social activities, low-effort activities) that have been examined in relation to recov-ery, previous studies yielded inconclusive results (van Hooff, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Geurts, Beckers, &amp; Kompier, 2011)</ref>. One type of activity has quite consistently been shown to be beneficial in this respect, though, and that is leisure time physical activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakker, Demerouti, Oerlemans, &amp; Sonnentag, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feuerhahn, Sonnentag, &amp; Woll, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rook &amp; Zijlstra, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sonnentag, 2001)</ref>. Physical activity encompasses ". . . all bodily movements that cause increases in physical exertion beyond that which occurs during normal activities or daily living" <ref type="bibr">(Lox, Ginis, &amp; Petruzzello, 2011, p. 4)</ref>. Leisure time physical activity (LTPA) entails physical activity that is undertaken in the individual's discretionary time. LTPA also includes exercise training, which is defined as "a form of leisure physical activity <ref type="bibr">[. . .]</ref> that is undertaken in order to achieve a particular objective (e.g., improved appearance, improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced stress, fun)" <ref type="bibr">(Lox et al., 2011, p. 4)</ref>.</p><p>One of the mechanisms by which LTPA is presumed to exert its beneficial effects on mental well-being is by providing mental disengagement from worrisome thoughts and stressors (i.e., "distraction hypothesis"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yeung, 1996)</ref>. This process may also play a role in explaining the beneficial association between LTPA and recovery from work. That is, LTPA may facilitate that employees release themselves from work-related thoughts and stressors, because it is generally conducted in a setting that differs from the work environment, and because it directs the focus of attention to the body, which limits the possibility to engage in negative work-related thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feuerhahn et al., 2014)</ref>. Disengaging from work-related thoughts and stressors is important for recovery from work, because mental involvement with work during off-job time may hamper the recovery process by causing prolonged psychophysiological activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brosschot, Gerin, &amp; Thayer, 2006)</ref>. Two constructs that have regularly been examined in research focusing on work-related thoughts during off-job time are rumination (referring to repetitive, intrusive, and negative cognitions about past stressors; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Radstaak, Geurts, Brosschot, Cillessen, &amp; Kompier, 2011)</ref> and psychological detachment (defined as "refraining from job-related activities and mentally disengaging from work during time off the job"; <ref type="bibr">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015, p. 72)</ref>. These constructs entail related albeit different experiences, in that high levels of rumination also imply a lack of psychological detachment, whereas the opposite is not necessarily the case. Previous research has indeed shown that both low rumination <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glynn, Christenfeld, &amp; Gerin, 2002)</ref>, and high psychological detachment from work facilitate the recovery process as indicated by-for example-positive changes in affective outcomes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015</ref> for an overview).</p><p>The extent to which the beneficial role of LTPA in the recovery process can be explained by its potential to facilitate mental disengagement from work has been the focus a number of empirical studies, although with mixed results. For example, two daily diary studies showed that psychological detachment mediated the relationship between the time spent on LTPA during the evening after work and positive affect experienced in the evening <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feuerhahn et al., 2014)</ref> and vigour reported in the next morning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(ten Brummelhuis &amp; Bakker, 2012)</ref>. However, a study on the relationships between lunchtime park walks and recovery indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sianoja, Syrek, de Bloom, Korpela, &amp; Kinnunen, 2018)</ref> failed to demonstrate the presumed mediating role of psychological detachment in this association. Also a study on LTPA during vacation did not find detachment to mediate the LTPA-recovery association <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pereira, Iseli, &amp; Elfering, 2017)</ref>. The reasons for the absence of the proposed mediation effects differed between these latter two studies, though. Whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pereira et al. (2017)</ref> did find support for the LTPA-detachment association, but not for the relationship between detachment and recovery, the opposite was the case in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sianoja et al. (2018)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies on the LTPA-recovery association generally focused exclusively on indicators of the duration of LTPA and examined, for example, the time spent on physical activities (such as "sports, dancing, cycling, or going for a hike/stroll"; ten <ref type="bibr">Brummelhuis &amp; Bakker, 2012, p. 448</ref>), a summed total of time spent on (one or more) exercise activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feuerhahn et al., 2014)</ref>, or the percentage of vacation days in which participants engaged in sports or exercise activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pereira et al., 2017)</ref>. Until now, therefore, it has been implicitly assumed that all types of LTPA have similar effects on recovery, and that it is just the duration of engagement in these activities that matters. It is nonetheless conceivable that the beneficial effects of LTPA on recovery depend on other characteristics as well, and that failure to take such features into account may explain the mixed results from previous studies that examined the mediating role of mental disengagement from stressors in the association between LTPA and recovery. In the current study, therefore, we aim to further disentangle the LTPArecovery association, by not only addressing the time spent on LTPA, but by also focusing on its level of strenuousness. We pose that the recovering potential of LTPA depends on its level of strenuousness, and we argue that this is because of different levels of strenuousness being differentially related to mental disengagement from stressors. Doing so, we extend previous research on the LTPA-recovery association, which has so far hardly addressed this characteristic of LTPA. To our knowledge, only <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feuerhahn et al. (2014)</ref> briefly mention that they also examined intensity as indicator of LTPA exposure, and that they found very similar results for this measure and for exercise duration.</p><p>Addressing the strenuousness of LTPA makes sense from a theoretical point of view, because it has been hypothesized and found that with increasing strenuousness of LTPA attention becomes more focused on internal bodily sensations instead of on external stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hutchinson &amp; Tenenbaum, 2007)</ref>. It can, therefore, be expected that less strenuous LTPA would leave room for work-related thoughts and emotions (that are external stimuli), but highly strenuous LTPA would not, because all attentional resources are devoted to the body (hence, to internal stimuli). Consequently, the level of strenuousness of LTPA can be expected to be positively associated with mental disengagement from workrelated stressors (as indicated by higher psychological detachment or lower rumination). Based on this postulation, and on the already established positive association between psychological detachment and low rumination and employees' recovery state, we pose that the time spent on more strenuous LTPA shows a stronger positive relationship with recovery compared with the time spent on LTPA of a lower intensity, and that this association is mediated by higher levels of mental disengagement from stressors. Thus, we hypothesize:</p><p>Hypothesis 1a: Compared with the time spent on LTPA with a lower level of strenuousness, the time spent on highly strenuous LTPA will show a stronger positive relationship with mental disengagement from stressors.</p><p>Hypothesis 1b: Mental disengagement from stressors will be positively related to recovery.</p><p>Hypothesis 1c: Time spent on highly strenuous LTPA will show stronger relationships with recovery than time spent on LTPA with a lower level of strenuousness, and this relationship will be mediated by mental disengagement from stressors.</p><p>We conducted two studies to test these hypotheses: Study 1 was a 10-day daily diary study among employees, in which we focused on psychological detachment as an indicator of mental disengagement from stressors, and Study 2 was a lab-experiment, in which rumination was included as an indicator of (a lack of) mental disengagement.</p><p>As one of the core manifestations of recovery is mood repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Geurts, Beckers, &amp; Tucker, 2014)</ref>, in line with previous research on recovery, both studies focused on two indicators of affect as indicators of employees' recovery state. Specifically, based on the circumplex model of affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Russell, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Warr, 1990</ref>) that describes affective states according to their position on two axes, namely high versus low arousal and pleasure versus displeasure, we focused on negative activation and positive activation. Negative activation entails high arousal and displeasure and positive activation encompasses high arousal and pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Russell, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Warr, 1990)</ref>. examined our hypotheses using a 10-day daily diary design that covered two consecutive work weeks. Each day, participants reported on the time spent on LTPA during after work hours, and recovery indicators were assessed at the end of the evening and in the morning, before the start of the next working day.</p><p>To obtain insight in the LTPA-recovery association, it is valuable to not only focus on employees' recovery state at the end of the evening, but to also examine their recovery state in the morning before they start their next working day. Namely, if employees start their working day in a recovered state, it is likely that they are able to fulfil their work demands without having to expend compensatory effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Meijman &amp; Mulder, 1998)</ref>, which limits the burden placed on their psychophysiological systems, and hence reduces their need to recover after work. Therefore, the present study also examined the association between LTPA and employees' recovery state after waking up the next morning. As it is conceivable that LTPA conducted in the evening will first affect employees' recovery state during the evening, we expect it to relate indirectly, rather than directly, to employees' recovery state in the morning, through employees' recovery state in the evening.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants and procedure. Participation in this study required the completion of a general questionnaire and of three daily questionnaires for the period of two workweeks. This period was chosen because it has been shown to provide a reliable picture of people's daily lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wheeler &amp; Reis, 1991)</ref>. Moreover, given our focus on within-person associations between LTPA and employees' recovery status in-between work periods, collecting data during a two-week period increases the possibility of sampling sufficient days on which employees actually engaged in LTPA.</p><p>The general questionnaire contained questions about employees' demographics, whereas the daily questionnaires focused on the core variables under study. Daily questionnaires were filled in each weekday of the study period after waking up in the morning (t1), at the end of the workday (or at 5 p.m. if participants did not work that day; t2), and before going to bed in the evening (t3). Potential participants for the study were approached through the social network of a research assistant involved in this study. They had to work during office hours for at least 24 h per week, and to typically engage in (any type of) physical exercise after work at least twice a week to be eligible for participation. All participants were offered a brief report regarding the main study outcomes as compensation for their efforts. After agreeing to take part, participants received an e-mail with information about the study procedure and a link to the Web-based general questionnaire. The next week, they started the completion of the daily questionnaires. Each day, about 2 h before the requested time of completion of the questionnaire, participants received an e-mail containing a link to a Web-based questionnaire.</p><p>Of the 84 employees who indicated their willingness to participate, 74 (88%) completed the general questionnaire. After deleting daily questionnaires that were not completed on the intended day, our sample consisted of 606 morning questionnaires, 556 end-of-workday questionnaires, and 516 evening questionnaires. Of the participants (58.1% female) in this study, 70.3% lived together with a partner and 35.1% had at least one child living at home. Their mean age was 36.95 years (SD ϭ 13.07), they were generally highly educated (70.2% obtained at least a bachelor's degree) and they worked on average 41.64 h per week (SD ϭ 13.49). Participants were employed in a variety of sectors, among others, in health care (24.3%), education (14.9%), government (14.9%), and IT (10.8%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures.</head><p>Daily LTPA. To measure daily LTPA (at t3), we used an adapted version of the widely used and validated Godin-Shephard leisure time physical activity questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Godin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Godin &amp; Shephard, 1985)</ref>. In its original form, this questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the frequency with which they engage in each of three types of exercise-that vary in levels of associated strenuousness-for more than 15 min during a typical 7-day period (a week). For each type of exercise, some examples are provided, and participants can decide to classify their activities in one of the three categories based on the strenuousness they experienced during engagement in the activity. Specifically, participants are asked to indicate the time they spend on: (a) "strenuous exercise (heart beats rapidly, e.g., running, jogging, hockey, football, and soccer)," (b) "moderate exercise (not exhausting, e.g., fast walking, baseball, tennis, and volleyball)," and (c) "mild exercise (minimal effort, e.g., yoga, bowling, and easy walking)." In the original questionnaire, a total LTPA score is computed by first multiplying the weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate and mild exercise by nine, five, and three (i.e., referring to the MET's associated with each category) respectively, and by then summing these products <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Godin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Godin &amp; Shephard, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>In the current study, instead of asking respondents to indicate the frequency with which they engage in each type of activity during a week, we asked them to report the time (in minutes) they spent on each type of activity during the past evening after work (or after 5 p.m. if they did not work that day). Also, instead of multiplying and summing participants' responses into a composite score, we used the three time indicators (i.e., time spent on strenuous, on moderate and on mild exercise) as separate variables in our study.</p><p>Psychological detachment. This was measured at t3 with four items of the detachment scale of the Recovery Experiences Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Geurts, De Bloom, Kompier, &amp; Sonnentag, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2007)</ref>.

Specifically, we included work-related activities (i.e., "work-related activities [e.g., preparing for the next working day, finishing unfinished tasks]"), low-effort activities (i.e., "low-effort activities [e.g., reading a book, taking a bath, watching TV, fun-shopping, and listening to music"], social activities [i.e., "social activities (e.g., visiting friends, talking on the phone]") and household and care activities. This last category was obtained by summing the time spent on household (i.e., "domestic activities [e.g., grocery shopping, cooking, washing dishes, and cleaning]") and care (i.e., "caregiving activities [e.g., bathing children, putting children to bed, care for parents/in-laws, and/or others' children]) activities <ref type="bibr">(cf. van Hooff et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, as recovery entails beneficial changes in employees' affective state, we controlled for negative activation and positive activation as reported at t2. Data analysis. We tested our hypotheses by means of multilevel path analysis (ML estimation) using the Mplus 7 statistical software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2012)</ref>. Because of this study's focus on within-person processes, we centered the independent variables (i.e., strenuous, moderate, and mild LTPA, as well as the control variables) around the respective person-means (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Binnewies, Sonnentag, &amp; Mojza, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Van Hooff &amp; Geurts, 2015)</ref>. Psychological detachment and the recovery indicators at t3 and next day's t1 were not centered, because these were outcome measures (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Binnewies et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Van Hooff &amp; Geurts, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>A series of nested multilevel models was estimated to test our hypotheses. To examine if the strength of the association between time spent on LTPA and psychological detachment varied according to the level of strenuousness of LTPA, we chose to compare the fit of a model in which the strength of these associations was assumed to be equal to the fit of a model in which this assumption was not made. Therefore, in Model 1, we included paths from the three types of LTPA (mild, moderate, and strenuous) to psychological detachment, and imposed equality constraints on these paths; thus, assuming that the strength of these associations was equal for each of the three types of LTPA. Model 1 further included paths from psychological detachment to the two recovery indicators (negative activation and positive activation) at t3. Correlations between these recovery indicators at t3 were modeled as well. Furthermore, Model 1 included paths from each of the recovery indicators at t3 to the same recovery indicator at next day's t1. To control for participants' recovery state at t2, each recovery indicator at t2 was modeled to be related to its counterpart at t3. Finally, to control for the time spent on other off-job activities, the paths between these activities (i.e., work-related, low-effort, social and household, and care activities) and psychological detachment were included. Model 2 was identical to Model 1, except that we removed the equality constraints on the associations between LTPA and psychological detachment, to examine if the strength of the association between time spent on LTPA and psychological detachment indeed differed according to the strenuousness of LTPA. In Model 3, to examine if the three types of LTPA are also directly related to employees' recovery state, we added paths between the three types of LTPA and the recovery indicators at t3. Because psychological detachment and the recovery indicators at t3 and next day's t1 are not centered around their person-means, these contain variance on both the within-person and between-person level. As these variables may be interrelated on the between-person level as well, in Model 4 we additionally included the between-person associations between psychological detachment and each of the two recovery indicators at t3, and between each recovery indicator at t3 and its respective counterpart at next day's t1. The fit of the models was evaluated by means of the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the comparative fit index (CFI). Values of below .08 (RMSEA) and above .90 (CFI) indicate an acceptable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Byrne, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>

This table shows that Model 1 does not provide an acceptable fit to the data (CFI Ͻ .90, and RMSEA Ͻ .08). The "constrained" relationships between LTPA and detachment are significant (multilevel estimate ϭ 0.17, p Ͻ .01), though, as are the associations between detachment and the recovery indicators at t3 (multilevel estimates Ϫ0.07, p Ͻ .05 for negative activation and 0.10, p Ͻ .01 for positive activation) and the relationships between the recovery indicators at t3 and next day's t1 (multilevel estimates 0.22 for positive activation, 0.27 for negative activation; ps Ͻ.01). Removing the equality constraints on the associations between the three types of LTPA and psychological detachment resulted in a better fitting model (Model 2), although the fit of this model is still not satisfactory in an absolute sense (CFI Ͻ .90, and RMSEA Ͻ .08). Adding the direct associations between the three types of LTPA and the recovery indicators at t3 in Model 3 did not result in a better fitting model and, therefore, these paths were omitted from Model 4, which additionally included the between-level associations between psychological detachment and the recovery indicators at t3, and between the recovery indicators at t3 and next-day's t1. This final model did not only show a better fit than Model 2, but also fitted well in an absolute sense (CFI Ͼ .90 and RMSEA Ͻ .08).

These findings support Hypothesis 1a, which proposed that compared with the time spent on LTPA with a lower level of strenuousness, the time spent on highly strenuous LTPA would show a stronger positive relationship with mental disengagement from stressors. Regarding the other off-job activities-that were included as control variables-only the time spent on work-related activities was significantly and negatively related to psychological detachment. Furthermore, on the withinperson level (but not on the between-person level), psychological detachment is negatively related to negative activation t3 and positively related to positive activation at this point in time. This supports Hypothesis 1b, which posed that mental disengagement from stressors would be positively related to recovery. Also the control variables negative activation and positive activation at t2 were significantly related to their respective t3 measures. For both recovery indicators, there were positive within-person relationships between the t3 measure and the next day's t1 measure. These associations were also found on the between-level.</p><p>As the model showed that the positive association between LTPA and psychological detachment was strongest for strenuous LTPA (and not significant for the other two types of LTPA), that psychological detachment was positively related to both recovery indicators at t3, and that the recovery indicators at t3 were positively related to the recovery indicators at next day's t1, Hypothesis 1c might be supported as well. After all, this hypothesis posed that time spent on highly strenuous LTPA would be more positively related to recovery than time spent on LTPA with a lower level of strenuousness, and that this association would be mediated by higher levels of mental disengagement from stressors associated with highly strenuous LTPA. To examine the significance of the proposed mediation effects, we used Bayesian estimation in Mplus 7 (using the Mplus 7 default priors). Results of these analyses are depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. From this table, it follows that detachment indeed mediated the association between time spent on strenuous LTPA and both recovery indicators (i.e., negative activation and positive activation) at t3. Moreover, our results indicate that the beneficial associations between the time spent on strenuous LTPA and recovery persisted until the next morning (t1), as indicated by the significant indirect effects from LTPA to each of the next day's recovery indicators through detachment and the recovery indicators at t3. Based on these results, we can indeed conclude that Hypothesis 1c is supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to investigate if time spent on more strenuous LTPA would show stronger positive relationships with employee recovery than time spent on less strenuous LTPA, because of the higher levels of psychological detachment associated with more strenuous LTPA. Results supported our hypothesis by showing that strenuous LTPA was related to beneficial changes in recovery indicators (negative activation and positive activation) in the evening, and that these positive associations were maintained until the next morning. Psychological detachment from work acted as a mediator in these associations. Time spent on moderate and mild LTPA was not related to recovery from work, as these activities showed no significant relationships with psychological detachment. These findings seem to suggest that recovery from work through psychological detachment is best achieved by engagement in strenuous LTPA, rather than in LTPA of a moderate or mild level.</p><p>However, although the associations examined in this study were theoretically founded, the design of the study does not allow for causal inferences. One prerequisite for causality is that the cause precedes the consequence in time. This assumption was only partly fulfilled in the present study, as presumed cause, presumed mediators, and presumed consequences were partly measured at the same point in time (at t3). Furthermore, because of nonexperimental nature of our study the possibility that (some of) the associations found were in fact because of unmeasured third variables could not be excluded. Therefore, we conducted a second study to test our hypothesis in an experimental design that does allow claims about causality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>The aim of this second study was to establish the causality of Study 1's findings by testing our hypothesis by means of an experimental design in which participants engaged in LTPA after completing a stressful task. We operationalized LTPA as cycling on a cycle-ergometer, because this does not require any specific technical skills or previous experience. As cycling is generally considered to be an activity of at least a "moderate" intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainsworth et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pate et al., 1995)</ref>, we decided to focus exclusively on moderate and strenuous LTPA in this experiment. To further validate Study 1's findings, we used slightly different measures to assess positive and negative activation as indicators of recovery. Furthermore, we focused on (lack of) rumination about the stressful task as indicator of mental disengagement from stressors.</p></div>

As a compensation for their efforts, participants could receive two course credits or participate in a lottery to win one out of three sport watches. To be eligible for participation in the study, potential participants had to be (a) between 18 and 55 years of age and (b) exercising vigorously at least 1 h a weak. Our final sample consisted of 44 participants, who exercised between one and six times per week (M ϭ 3.11, SD ϭ 1.54) with a cumulative 1 to 16 h of exercise (M ϭ 4.89, SD ϭ 3.43). Participants were between 18 and 27 years old (M ϭ 22.52, SD ϭ 2.36).</p><p>Procedure. A schematic representation of the experimental procedure is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory environment. After the participant had provided his/her informed consent (s)he reported his or her recovery state (t1 ; see measures below). Next, the participant performed a stress task-a presentation task (see stress task below)-and was made to belief that a second presentation needed to be performed after the exercise task. The participant then again reported his or her recovery state (t2). After completing this questionnaire, the participant was instructed to take place on the cycle ergometer, which was placed in the same room. During a 3-min warm up the experimenter explained the exercise task to the participant. Then, the participant performed a 20-min cycling exercise at a moderate or high level of strenuousness. For each participant, individual levels of moderate or high strenuousness were determined in a pretest that preceded the actual experiment (see levels of strenuousness below). After the cool-down, the participant was asked to fill out another questionnaire to determine his or her recovery state (t3) and rumination (see Measures). At this stage of the experiment, the participant was told that (s)he did not have to present again, and (s)he completed another recovery questionnaire (t4). Each participant was dismissed with the instruction to fill out a last questionnaire that would follow by e-mail in an hour (recovery t5). Debriefing followed directly after this questionnaire.</p><p>Levels of strenuousness. To determine individual moderate and high levels of strenuousness, each participant completed a pretest, which took place between 2 to 20 days (M ϭ 8) before the actual experiment. Research shows that when people self-select their exercise intensity (as indicated by Watts) they generally choose a level of strenuousness just below the ventilatory threshold (VT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ekkekakis, Parfitt, &amp; Petruzzello, 2011)</ref>. As this level of intensity is considered "moderate" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ekkekakis, Hall, &amp; Petruzzello, 2005)</ref>, we considered the intensity that participants individually defined as their preferred intensity in the pretest as "moderate intensity." To determine this intensity, during the pretest, participants were instructed to cycle to their own liking for 20 min on a cycle ergometer, while they were given control over the buttons that determine the resistance. This 20-min period was chosen, because previous research that monitored cadence (rows per minute; rpm) and resistance (Watt) of participants during a cycle ergometer task found that these measures stabilize within 20 min, when participants are allowed to alter cadence and resistance to their own liking throughout the exercise (Vazou- <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ekkekakis &amp; Ekkekakis, 2009)</ref>. Therefore, the intensity (in Watt) after 20 min of cycling was considered to be the participant's individual moderate level of strenuousness. After these 20 min, to determine each participant's maximum intensity-that was used subsequently in the highly strenuous condition-a procedure similar to Jung, Bourne, and Little (2014) was used, and resistance was increased by 10 W every 30 s, until the resistance could no longer be mastered (indicated by a reduction in their cadence of at least 5 rpm for 10 s, as was found to be a reliable indicator during pilot This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>sessions). Altogether, the pretest took about 30 min to complete. There was quite a large variety in preferred and maximal intensities with the preferred intensity ranging from 50 to 195 W (M ϭ 103.00, SD ϭ 35.30), maximum intensity ranging from 120 to 380 W (M ϭ 257.95, SD ϭ 52.81) and the self-chosen cadence ranging from 60 to 120 rpm (M ϭ 80.80, SD ϭ 10.16).</p><p>In the actual experiment, strenuousness of LTPA was manipulated through a 20-min cycle ergometer exercise at individualized levels of either high or moderate intensity. In the "moderate intensity condition" participants cycled for 20 min on the preferred intensity that was determined in the pretest. In the "high intensity condition," exercise consisted of an interval training, in which 1-min bouts of individual maximal and 75% of individual moderate levels of intensity were alternated. This procedure was similar to the one used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jung et al. (2014)</ref>, except that we used individually defined levels of moderate intensity. In both conditions, participants were instructed to cycle at a cadence that was measured during the pretest. Also, both conditions were preceded with a 3-min warm up at 50 W and completed by a 1-min cool-down, also at 50 W, with a total exercise time of 24 min.</p><p>Stress task. To induce stress, a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used. This is a standardized approach for inducing stress in experimental settings that has been applied extensively, both in healthy and clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kudielka, Hellhammer, &amp; Kirschbaum, 2007)</ref>. Different to the original version of the TSST, which includes a live audience, presentations were performed toward a camera. Also, preparation and presentation times (originally 10 and 5 min) were reduced to 5 and 3 min, respectively. Participants were told that they were given 5 min to prepare a 3-min pitch in which they explained why they were the ideal candidate for their preferred future occupation. They were further told that they would perform a practice pitch toward a camera in which the camera would be switched off, but would perform an official pitch after the cycling exercise in which the pitch would be recorded and evaluated by students of Industrial and Organizational (I/O-) Psychology. Although all participants needed to do the first, the second pitch would never take place. Participants were made to believe it would take place to prevent that merely knowing that the stressful task had ended would result in recovery.</p><p>Measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recovery indicators.</head><p>We used items from the validated positive and negative activation scale (PANAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988)</ref> as indicators of participants' recovery state. Positive activation was measured by means of six items (i.e., "active," "interested," "excited," "strong," "inspired," and "alert") and five items were included to measure negative activation (i.e., "distressed," "upset," "irritable," "jittery," and "afraid"). For each item, participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they currently felt that way on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (absolutely) at five different times during the experiment (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). Both positive activation and negative activation showed good reliability scores (average Cronbach's ␣ ϭ .72 for positive activation and average Cronbach's ␣ ϭ .80 for negative activation).</p><p>Rumination. Rumination experienced during engagement in LTPA was assessed after the exercise task using an adapted version of the rumination questionnaire used in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Radstaak, Geurts, Brosschot, &amp; Kompier, 2014)</ref>. In this study, a four-item questionnaire was used that asked participants about ruminative thoughts. We adjusted the wording of these items to reflect the specific stress task during our experiment. Furthermore, as worry (negative outcome expectancy) is also predictive of reduced stress recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Geurts &amp; Sonnentag, 2006)</ref>, we extended the questionnaire with an additional four items, that were similar to the original four, except that these asked about worry for the upcoming presentation task. Eventually, three items "Since I finished the presentation task I ruminated about [the task] [my performance on this task] [the impression I left during this presentation]" and "Since I finished the presentation task I worried about [the upcoming presentation] [my performance on the upcoming presentation] [the impression I will leave at the upcoming presentation]" were rated on 10-point Likert scales (1 ϭ strongly disagree, 10 ϭ strongly agree). Another two items "How much time did you spend <ref type="bibr">[ruminating]</ref> [worrying] about the <ref type="bibr">[previous] [upcoming]</ref> presentation task?" were rated using different labels (1 ϭ no time at all, 10 ϭ all the time). All items were presented in random order. The eight items had a good internal reliability (Cronbach's ␣ ϭ .94) and, thus, a single rumination score was used.</p><p>Strenuousness of LTPA. To assess whether the intensity manipulation was successful, participants were asked to provide a rating of perceived exertion (RPE), a single item 10-point scale (1 ϭ no exertion at all, 10 ϭ very exerting).

We tested our hypotheses using the Mplus 7 software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2012)</ref>. Two path models were estimated. In Model 1, paths were modeled between condition (0 ϭ moderate LTPA, 1 ϭ strenuous LTPA) and rumination, and between rumination and positive and negative activation at t3. Positive and negative activation at t2 were included as control variables and were modeled to be related to their respective counterparts at t3. Model 2 was identical to Model 1, except that in this model additional paths between condition and the recovery indicators at t3 were included, to examine if more strenuous LTPA was also directly related to improved recovery.</p></div>

The table shows that the randomization was successful as, except for positive activation t1-that was higher in the high intensity condition (d ϭ .91)-the groups did not differ on any variables before the groups received their separate exercise interventions. However, as positive activation and negative activation at t1 and t2 are only used to check whether the stress manipulation was successful, and groups did not differ at t2, this was not considered problematic.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows that Model 1 did not provide a good fit to the data. As adding the direct associations between condition and the affect measures at t3 in Model 2 did not improve model fit (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>), these relationships were excluded from further analyses. Because of the suboptimal fit of Model 1, and based on the modification indices, we extended this model by adding a path between negative activation t2 and rumination (Model 3). Although this did not change the estimates of the paths in Model 1, it did result in a model with a satisfactory fit in an absolute sense (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). All estimated paths of this model are graphically depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, which shows that there is a negative relationship between LTPA condition and rumination, which indicates that participants in the strenuous LTPA condition reported lower levels of rumination. This finding support Hypothesis 1a, which proposed that compared with the time spent on LTPA with a lower level of strenuousness, the time spent on highly strenuous LTPA would show a stronger positive relationship with mental disengagement from stressors. Also, rumination was positively related to negative activation t3 (controlled for negative activation t2), but not to positive activation t3 (controlled for positive activation t2). Therefore, Hypothesis 1b-that posed that mental disengagement from stressors would be positively related to recovery-is partially supported. All in all, these Note.

Hence, these findings indicate that Hypothesis 1c, which assumed that the time spent on highly strenuous LTPA would show stronger relationships with recovery than the time spent on LTPA with a lower level of strenuousness, and that this relationship would be mediated by mental disengagement from stressors, is partially supported (for negative activation, but not for positive activation). Bayesian estimation in Mplus 7 (using the Mplus default priors) indeed revealed a significant indirect effect between condition and negative activation t3 through rumination (B ϭ Ϫ0.12, 95% confidence interval, CI, between Ϫ0.289 and Ϫ0.002). All in all, these results support Hypothesis 1a, 1b, and 1c for negative activation, but not for positive activation. Exploratory analyses. To examine in an explorative way if the beneficial effects of strenuous LTPA were maintained until after participants were informed that they did not have to give their second presentation (t4) and/or until an hour rafter leaving the laboratory (t5), we extended Model 3 by including the measures of negative activation at these two additional time points. Paths were estimated between negative activation t3 and t4, and between negative activation t4 and t5. Bayesian estimation in Mplus 7 (using the Mplus default priors) revealed that the beneficial effects of strenuous LTPA were indeed maintained until t4 (B ϭ Ϫ0.05, 95% CI between Ϫ0.152 and Ϫ0.005) and t5 (B ϭ Ϫ0.03, 95% CI between Ϫ0.092 and Ϫ0.003).</p><p>Also, to explore whether this study's findings were affected by the extent to which participants generally engage in exercise, we conducted a regression analysis to examine if the effect of 'condition' (i.e., moderate or strenuous LTPA) on rumination is moderated by the number of hours participants indicated to generally engage in exercise on a weekly basis. We did not find a significant Condition ϫ Weekly exercise interaction effect, though (␤ ϭ Ϫ.07, p ϭ .73).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to replicate Study 1's findings by using an experimental design to examine the hypothesis that highly strenuous LTPA would be more beneficial for recovery than less strenuous LTPA, and that this effect would be mediated by higher levels of mental disengagement from strsessors associated with more strenuous LTPA. This hypothesis was indeed confirmed for negative activation as an indicator of recovery. A similar effect for positive activation was lacking, though. This may be explained by the fact that our stress task failed to induce negative changes in this indicator of recovery. Hence, there was no need to "repair" this indicator of affect. Although previous experimental recovery research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Radstaak et al., 2014)</ref> used similar items as the ones used in our study to assess positive activation, apparently, they were not suitable to capture changes in experimentally induced stress because of a presentation task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We believe that our study enhances insight in the role of LTPA in the recovery process in two ways. First, we showed that the extent to which LTPA is positively related to recovery through mental disengagement from stressors depends on its level of strenuousness. That is, Study 1 found that only time spent on strenuous LTPA (and not time spent on moderate or mild LTPA) showed beneficial relationships with recovery indicators (i.e., negative activation and positive activation), by way of its positive association with psychological detachment from work. This finding does not necessarily imply that only strenuous LTPA is beneficial for recovery, though. It could still be that moderate or mild LTPA are positively related to recovery via other mediating mechanismssuch as physical self-perceptions or sense-of belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feuerhahn et al., 2014)</ref>-that were not addressed in this study.</p><p>Study 2 corroborated Study 1's findings in an experimental set-up by showing that-compared with moderate LTPA-strenuous LTPA caused larger improvements in negative activation as indicator of recovery after exposure to a stress task (but not in positive activation) and that this effect was mediated by lower levels of rumination associated with the strenuous LTPA. Together, our two studies' findings illustrate that when examining the relationship between LTPA and recovery, it is important to not only focus on the time spent on these activities, but also on their level of strenuousness. When focusing exclusively on a general measure of time spent on LTPA-as was the case in many previous studies on this topic-the differential associations of varying levels of strenuousness with recovery indicators are likely to be obscured. Indeed, when we re-estimated the path model of Study 1 using a composite measure of the time spent on all three types of LTPA, we found a significant positive association between LTPA and detachment (multilevel estimate ϭ 0.17, p Ͻ .01). Only by looking at the three different levels of strenuousness were we able to show that this relationship was in fact driven by strenuous LTPA.</p><p>Our results are in line with our proposition based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hutchinson and Tenenbaum's (2007)</ref> reasoning that higher intensity LTPA would leave less room for negative work or stress-related thoughts and hence would be more strongly related to mental disengagement from stressors (as indicated by higher levels of psychological detachment and/or lower levels of rumination), which is beneficial for recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Sonnentag &amp; Fritz, 2015)</ref>. Our studies' findings also support and extend previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feuerhahn et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">ten Brummelhuis &amp; Bakker, 2012</ref>) that identified mental disengagement from work as a mediator in the LTPA-recovery associations. Interestingly, though, in Study 1, we only found significant associations between detachment and the recovery indicators on the day-level (i.e., "within-level") and not on the person-level (i.e., "between-level"). This implies that daily fluctuations in detachment are associated with employees' daily recovery state, whereas the "general" level of detachment that participants reported during the study period was not related to their general recovery level during this period. As such, this underlines the importance of examining recovery processes from a day-to-day perspective.</p><p>A second contribution of our study lies in the fact that we shows that the beneficial relationships between strenuous LTPA and recovery in Study 1 were not limited to the evening, but lasted until the next morning. This indicates that engaging in strenuous LTPA facilitates that employees start their next workday in an optimally recovered state, which makes it likely that they are able to fulfil their work demands without having to expend compensatory effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Meijman &amp; Mulder, 1998)</ref>. Consequently, the burden placed on their psychophysiological systems is limited, which reduces their This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>need to recover after work and hence the likelihood of an accumulated lack of recovery and associated health complaints. All in all, by showing that the strenuousness of LTPA is an additional factor to take into account-besides duration-when aiming to understand the LTPA-recovery relationship, our study adds to previous research on the role of LTPA in the recovery process, in which it was implicitly assumed that only the amount of time spent on this activity matters for recovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</head><p>We believe a number of limitations of our studies need to be mentioned. A first issue that deserves attention is our operationalization of strenuousness in both studies. In Study 1, we relied on self-reports of employees' time spent on mild, moderate and vigorous LTPA. Although the Godin-Shephard LTPA questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Godin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Godin &amp; Shephard, 1985)</ref> has been shown to be a valid measure to examine LTPA of various levels of strenuousness, and although this questionnaire contains examples of activities within all three categories, we cannot guarantee that participants' categorization of their own activities into mild, moderate and strenuous coincides with more objective indicators of strenuousness such as heart rate. Furthermore, in Study 2, relying on findings from previous research that justified this approach, we determined moderate intensity by asking participants to cycle at their preferred intensity. When participants could no longer master an increase in intensity, they were assumed to have reached their maximum intensity. In both instances, however, we could not corroborate the validity of these intensities by comparing them to-for example-participant's percentage of their maximum heart rate. In support of our procedure, though, it should be noted that our manipulation check showed that participants in the strenuous LTPA condition rated their levels of perceived exertion significantly higher than participants in the moderate LTPA condition. By also including objective indicators of LTPA, future research may further increase our understanding of the extent to which the level of strenuousness matters for recovery. This can be achieved-for example-by first determining participants' maximum heart rate and subsequently relating their heart rate during LTPA to this individual maximum.</p><p>A second limitation refers to the types of LTPA included in our studies. In Study 2, only one type of LTPA was incorporated (i.e., cycling), which limits the possibility to generalize this study's findings to other types of LTPA. Contrary to Study 2, in Study 1, there likely was variation in activities, as there were no restrictions in the type of LTPA participants could engage in to be eligible for inclusion in the study. However, in this study, we did not know exactly which type of activities participants performed. Although theoretically, there is no reason to expect that the mediating role of mental disengagement in the relationship between strenuousness of LTPA and recovery would depend on the specific type of LTPA that is performed, future research may obtain a clearer picture of the role of strenuousness of LTPA for recovery by examining various levels of strenuousness for each of different types of LTPA.</p><p>Third, our study focused exclusively on mental disengagement from stressors as a mediator. We did not address other psychological mechanisms that may underlie the LTPA-recovery association, nor did we pay attention to physiological processes that may play a role in this relationship. On a psychological level, for example, previous research has shown that sense of belonging and physical self-perceptions mediate the beneficial association between LTPA and recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Feuerhahn et al., 2014)</ref>. On a physiological level, changes in core body temperature (that may cause beneficial changes in mood; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Craft &amp; Perna, 2004)</ref>, or the release of endorphins (that may relate to a positive mood and increased well-being; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Craft &amp; Perna, 2004</ref>) may play a role. Future research may further disentangle the relationship between strenuousness of LTPA and recovery by addressing these and other additional mechanisms.</p><p>Fourth, although our studies incorporated multiple indicators of recovery, we did not include fatigue, despite it being considered an important proxy measure of (failed) recovery <ref type="bibr">(Sonnentag &amp; Geurts, 2009)</ref>. To advance knowledge regarding the recovering potential of LTPA of varying levels of strenuousness, it would be valuable if future studies also examine associations with fatigue. In doing so, it would be important to carefully distinguish between psychological and physical fatigue, because it may be that-notwithstanding its psychologically recovering effect-engagement in LTPA could result in increased levels of physical fatigue later in time.</p><p>Fifth, although we identified strenuousness as a characteristic of LTPA that is important for recovery, we realize that we did not pay attention to other aspects that might play a role in the recovery process as well. For example, we did not include the competitive nature of various types of LTPA. It can be imagined, though, that engaging in competitive forms of LTPA is more mentally absorbing and, therefore, stronger related to psychological detachment than engaging in noncompetitive LTPA. Future research may advance insight in the LTPA-recovery association by examining such other characteristics of LTPA.</p><p>Sixth, although an increase in negative activation was observed in our experimental study, the effect was smaller than effects found in literature on the TSST, which may be because of our use of a modified version of this task. However, the stress manipulation appeared to be sufficient for recording the effects that we were interested in. We recommend that future studies use more powerful stressors, for example, by having participants present in front of a real audience.</p><p>Finally, the generalizability of this study's findings needs attention. Our studies were conducted among rather physically active participants. Specifically, Study 1 was based on a sample of employees who generally engaged in physical exercise at least twice a week, and participants in Study 2 on average exercised three times a week. Consequently, our participants might be assumed to have relatively high levels of physical fitness. Therefore, it remains unknown if the associations found in our studies can be extended to participants with lower levels of physical fitness. Future research might provide insight in this respect by studying a sample with more variation in time spent on LTPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Based on these studies' findings, spending time on strenuous LTPA during after work hours can be recommended as a means to recover from work-related load effects, at least among employees who are already physically active in their off-job time. They can be advised to conduct at least part of their LTPA on a high level of strenuousness. This seems especially valuable after demanding workdays that resulted in a high need to recover. As existing This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>research <ref type="bibr">(Sonnentag &amp; Jelden, 2009)</ref> and theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Häusser &amp; Mojzisch, 2017)</ref> have indicated that employees are less, rather than more, likely to engage in LTPA when their need for recovery is high, it may also be valuable to assist employees in creating habits for LTPA. These habits may act as a buffer against the negative impact of employees' current recovery state on their engagement in LTPA. Also, employers may facilitate employee recovery by providing access to exercise facilities, or by developing and implementing LTPA interventions. However, when designing interventions to increase LTPA, it is important that employees are not forced to engage in very strenuous exercise, as this may cause them to experience LTPA as unpleasant, and hence reduce adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ekkekakis et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, given the positive association between mental disengagement from stressors and recovery found in these (and previous) studies, employees may also be advised to engage in other activities that may promote psychological detachment from work or limit their rumination about work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Despite its limitations, we believe our studies contributed to insight in the role of LTPA in the process of daily recovery from work-related load effects, and showed engagement in this type of activities to be positively related to employees' recovery state. All in all, our studies seem to indicate that there's some truth to the proverb "no pain, no gain": to fully savor LTPA's beneficial effects through mental disengagement from stressors, it is best conducted on a high level of strenuousness.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure2.
