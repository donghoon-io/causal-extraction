<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In Ethiopia, land, water, energy, and food (LWEF)  nexus resources are under pressure, due to population growth, urbanization and economic growth. However, the impact of these factors are less explored at local scale level. As a result, securing nexus resource is becoming a serious challenge. This necessitates identification of driving factors for sustainable utilization of scarce LWEF nexus resources. Our study provides a systemic look at the driving factor indicator that induces nexus resource degradation. We use Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to develop indicator weight and Path Analysis Model(PAM) to quantitatively estimates the effect of driving factor indicators on LWEF nexus resources. The result indicates that, social (48%), economic (19%) and policy and institutional changes (14%) are the major nexus resource driving factor indicators. The path analysis result indicates that from social driving factor indicators population growth, and consumption patterns have significant direct effect on LWEF nexus with the path coefficient of 0.15 and 0.089, respectively. Similarly, the potential of LWEF nexus resources is also influenced by the institutional and policy change drivers such as outdated legislation and poor institutional structure with the path coefficient of 0.46 and 0.39, respectively. This implies that population growth and consumption pattern are the leading social drivers, while outdated legislation and poor institutional structure are institutional and policies change drivers which have potential impact on LWEF nexus resources degradation. Similarly, other driving factor indicators (environmental, economic and technological) also affect nexus resources with varying amount. The finding of our study show the benefits of managing identified driving factors for the protection of LWEF nexus resources, which have close link with human health and the environment. In order to alleviate the adverse effects of driving factors, all stake holders need to show permanent individual and collective commitment. Furthermore, we underline the necessity of applying LWEF nexus approaches to manage these drivers, and optimize environmental and social outcomes.</p></div>

However, the complex relationship existing among these nexus resources is making it difficult to easily understand the synergies between them and identify their drivers. This complicates the management and leads to nexus resources degradation <ref type="bibr">(Wiegleb and Bruns, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, understanding nexus resource drivers play essential roles for sustainable nexus resource management. However, the driving factors are not distributed uniformly across the region and varies with the patterns of geography, climate, economic development, social and political integration and transformation of the landscape <ref type="bibr">(Duan and Chen, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang and Zhao, 2018)</ref>. This necessitates site specific action in terms of management which can be achieved by identifying resources driving factor indicators. These indicators are perceived by the public and used as simplified and aggregated forms to present information pertaining to a certain region <ref type="bibr">(Collomb et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dale and Beyeler, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Results of various studies demonstrated that demand for productive land, water, energy and food is driven by common driving factors such as rapid population growth, urbanization and climate change <ref type="bibr">(Dibaba et al., 2020)</ref>. However, there are many other driving factor indicators affecting nexus resources especially at local level. Eventhogh the nexus resource driving factor indicators are varying on the basis of small geographical units, while studies conducted so far were focused at large scale <ref type="bibr">(Ding et al., 2020)</ref>. Hence the existing studies have not developed the nexus resources driver indicators from local level perspective, for which our study area is not exceptional. In the study landscape the existence of LWEF nexus and the prevalence of their drivers appear to be high and vary throughout the area as a result of multifaceted of land-uses, water, energy access, and food insecurity that had been causing the nexus resource degradation <ref type="bibr">(Dibaba et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, this study attempts to select nexus resource drivers in relation to the prevailing conditions in the study area and finally use path coefficient analysis to model the causal relationship between LWEF nexus and drivers. With this, the study intended to (i) identify LWEF nexus resources driving factor indicators that affect nexus resource (ii) explore the extent and trends of a driver on four nexus resources (iii) identify the direct and indirect impact of driving factors on LWEF nexus resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Material and Methods</head><p>2.1 Study area Gidabo watershed was chosen as the subject of this study to explore the relationship between land, water, energy and food nexus and its driving factors. This watershed is part of central rift valley of Ethiopia, where agricultural expansion and built up land is expanding rapidly <ref type="bibr">(Wolde et al., 2020)</ref>. The expansion of agriculture and built up in this watershed resulted in population growth and increased demand of productive land and water, energy, and food nexus resources.</p><p>In central Ethiopia, the main Ethiopian Rift, divides the Ethiopian highlands into northeastern and southwestern halves. This rift includes the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes which occupy the floor of the rift valley, with different sub-watersheds. The Gidabo watershed is located from 6 0 9' 4'' to 6 0 56' 4''N latitudes and 37 0 55' to 38 0 35''E longitude (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). It has a peak of 3213 m a.s.l. and the lowest altitude is about 1171m.a.s.l. This watershed is bordered by the catchment of Lake Hawassa to the North, River Bilate to the West, river Galana to the South and Genale-Dawa River basin to the East, which considered as a potential livelihoods sources for Southern Ethiopia. The populations are settled more towards the eastern highland and the population density decreases towards the eastern low lands. There is more population around the eastern highlands and it reduces as one goes down to eastern lowlands. However, the population of the watershed has been growing alarmingly in the last three decades and currently it is more than 1.5 million. The upper part is more populated (&gt;500 inhabitants per square kilometers), and has immense impact on potential nexus resources. The livelihoods of the local community in the study area primarily depend on mixed farming and livestock rearing <ref type="bibr">(Ketema et al., 2020)</ref>, which are sensitive to land, water, energy and food. Therefore, due to the current nexus resource degradation by various driving factors, most farmers in the watershed live with lowest access to electricity, clean water and modern infrastructure and they are vulnerable to frequent food insecurity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data sources and Techniques</head><p>This study focuses on driving factors indicator of LWEF nexus, which were identified from varied literature sources and deep survey in the history of nexus resources status. Additionally, data were collected from key informants and local community using combination of structured interviews. Secondary data sources were also used for validation of LWEF nexus indicators. Identification of driving factor indicators helps to have common understanding and to easily categorize which LWEF nexus resources directly or indirectly affected by driver.</p><p>The survey was conducted within four-month period from July 2019 to October 2019, following two approaches. First, expert interviews and focus group discussion (N=50) were conducted with respondents from natural resources, agriculture, water and energy sectors in order to characterize driving factors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Second, questionnaires were distributed to a total of 434 households, in order to find out how local community perceives identified driving factor indicators. To perform this, the respondents were asked to rank each predefined indicator impact on LWEF nexus from 0 to 4 ranking (4= extreme, 3= high, 2=medium, 1= low, 0= negligible).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Selection of LWEF nexus resources drivers</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Taherzadeh and Caro (2019)</ref>, driving factors are defined as driving forces consisting of different components that can affect societal change or natural system.</p><p>Understanding driving factors helps in identifying status, development and management of LWEF nexus resource to ensure equity and sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2018)</ref>. The driving factor indicator is a variable that describes the status of the nexus resources and its impact on the availability, and distribution trends of nexus resources. In nexus resources management, a single indicator cannot efficiently describe a complex process that affects land, water, energy and food degradation <ref type="bibr">(Spiegelberg et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, indicators are combined to create a composite index to monitor the state of the nexus resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Sola et al. (2017)</ref> stated that environmental indicators may be considered as a simplified form to present information to a certain region. Therefore, in our current study, we consider nexus resources drivers' indicators to clearly understand area specific driving factors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The nexus resources driving factor variables were selected in relation to the objectives and the prevailing conditions in the case study area from relevant literature and discussed further with expert's. Finally, the researchers and expertise from the four sectors were organized in a group, to provide feedback on interim results of the factors affecting nexus resources. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides five main and twenty-five sub driving factors indicators and their explanation. To verify this result we computed multicollinearity for the entire identified indicators using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis. The finding of the analysis revealed that 22 indicators had strong correlation with each other and removed from the analysis the final result of the analysis shows that the computed mean VIF is 3.4 which is satisfactory to show there is no multicollinearity. Therefore, finally 25 sub-indicators were identified and categorized into five main driving factor indicators. Besides, we also defined each subindicator in order to reduce data-based multicollinearity, which can be removed using subject-area knowledge and factor in the goal, as reported by <ref type="bibr">(Graham, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Shieh, 2010)</ref>  </p></div>

From social driving factors population growth (SC1), poverty (SC2) and lack of public involvement (SC6); and from institutional and policy change inadequate financial capital (IP2) and poor institutional structure(IP3) indicators have strong impact on nexus resources degradation (Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Path coefficient can be expressed as standardized coefficient which is typically computed either by first standardizing all variables and then computing the path coefficients from the ratios of the standard deviation of the variable. Standardized coefficients allow direct comparisons of the magnitude of effects of two causal variables measured on different scales <ref type="bibr">(Chouksey et al., 2020)</ref>. A path model may look similar to multiple regression <ref type="bibr">(Maydeu-Olivares et al., 2019)</ref>, where an exogenous variable is analogous to a predictor variable and an endogenous variable is a response; however, the difference is that the endogenous variable can be both a predictor and response in a system of equation. An important assumption is that exogenous variables are measured without error, On the other hand, each endogenous variable is assumed to have error.</p><p>In path analysis, the correlation co-efficient is partitioned in to direct and indirect effect of independent variable (i.e. driving factors) on the dependent variable (i.e. LWEF nexus resources). In order to estimate direct and indirect effects of the correlated characters, let say 𝑘 1, ,𝑘 2 and 𝑘 3 as driving factor effects on n nexus resources, a set of simultaneous equations is required to be formulated as shown blow;</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑌 𝑛𝐾 1 = 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 1 + 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 2 𝑌 𝑘1𝑘2 + 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 3 𝑌 𝑘1𝑘3</formula><p>(2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑌 𝑛𝐾 2 = 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 1 𝑌 𝑘1𝑘2 + 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 2 + 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 3 𝑌 𝑘2𝑘3 (3) 𝑌 𝑛𝐾 2 = 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 1 𝑌 𝑘1𝑘3 + 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 3 𝑌 𝑘2𝑘3 + 𝑃 𝑛𝐾 3 (4)</formula><p>Where, 𝑃 denotes path coefficients, 𝑌 denotes simple correlation co-efficient.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Result and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Analysis of land, water, energy and food (LWEF) nexus driver factor indicators</head><p>This section introduces main and sub-driving factors that affect one or more of the land, water, energy, and food nexus system. We identified twenty-five sub driving factors, which were categorized under five main driving factors. The results of the analysis indicated that from the five main driving factor indicators, social (48%), economic (19%), as well as institutional and policy changes (14%) are the major driving factors that affect nexus resources (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Similarly, the average weight of the main nexus resource driving factor is also computed shows the same trends (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). The direct and indirect impacts of these driving factors are explained in the subsequent section. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Social drivers</head><p>Six social driving factor indicators were identified based on the related literature (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> indicates the path coefficient analysis result of sub-social driving factor indicators that affect nexus resources; population growth (SC1), poverty (SC2), lack of alternative livelihoods (SC3), consumption patterns (SC4), community awareness (SC5) and lack of public involvement (SC6). The result of path co-efficient analysis revealed that population growth (p=0.15), lack of alternative livelihoods (p=0.56) and lack of public involvement (p=0.15) had a positive direct effect on LWEF nexus resources (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). Population growth also affects LWEF nexus indirectly (p= 0.005) which is mediated by consumption pattern, while poverty had a negative indirect effect (p= -0.16) on LWEF nexus which is mediated by consumption patterns (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</p><p>The result of path analysis in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> revealed that community awareness (SC5) had positive direct effect (p= 0.096) on LWEF nexus degradation in the study area. This implies lack of community awareness in nexus resource management disrupts the planning and execution of nexus resources management. Since, it is important for the success and failure of resource management. The demographic development and characteristics in the study area has implication for high demand on the existing patterns of land, water, energy and food availability and strongly driven nexus resource potential. The rural and urban population in the study area has been increasing from 2005 to 2020, and also expected to increase up to 2035 with increasing demand of nexus resource (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). This population growth may also increase levels of poverty which results in unwise land use, water, energy and food. The relationship between population growth and nexus resource demand is changing and becoming complex due to increased consumption (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). It also shows the impact of urban and rural population growth on land, water, energy, and food nexus alongside socioeconomic and political factors. Such kind of population increase needs adopting an integrated method of monitoring the LWEF nexus for the studied landscape.</p><p>The current institutional setup and implementation of policies in land, water, energy and food nexus are still facing challenges in Ethiopia. However, it is the only option to restore degraded nexus resources. The country becomes the second most populated nation in Africa which needs additional food production, which could be obtained by intensive management of LWEF nexus resources. Karlberg et al <ref type="bibr">(Karlberg et al., 2015)</ref> showed that while on-going agricultural intensification require more use of energy, the energy required by the majority of smallholder farmers comes from biomass sources rather than centralized energy infrastructure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Economic drivers</head><p>An increase in nexus resource scarcity is linked with economic well-being. Low economic potential declines the quality and quantity of nexus resources which enforces human beings to deplete, convert, pollute or degrade nexus resources (Agboraw and Jones, 2017). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> depicts five economic nexus resource driving factor indicator. The weight of the driving factor indicator shows increasing income variability (EC1) and increasing WEF prices (EC3) are the dominant economic driving factors that affect nexus resources in the study area (Appendix table 1). The result of path coefficient analysis indicates that increasing income variability (p= 0.044) and increasing WEF prices (p=0.057) have positive direct impact on LWEF nexus resource (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</p><p>Regarding low capital (EC2), it has both direct (p=0.12) and negative indirect (p=-0.003) impacts on LWEF nexus resources (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). This necessitates governments to set capitals to stimulate economic activity to meet particular sectorial development goal. The low capital, which is the characteristics of low economic potential have taken the brunt of the blame by causing unsustainable use of nexus resources which is caused by low investment.</p><p>Therefore, the identification of pathway of economic driver impacts on LWEF nexus resource degradation, which requires an understanding of direct economic driver and solving it through prioritization. To incorporate this understanding the pathway between LWEF nexus degradation and economic driving factor indicator need to be mapped (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</p><p>Increasing land value (EC4) indirectly drives (p=0.015) LWEF nexus resources which are mediated by increasing income variability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). The improper land use practices affect the availability of water, energy, and food which have environmental effects. This implies that due to economic development water and energy demand for food production is influenced by past land uses which in turn affect future land use. With this, the economic benefits of nexus resources by the local community have recently changed dramatically because wider forces such as overexploitation and unsustainable use permit them to do so.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Technology as driver</head><p>Technological developments necessitate higher levels of productivity in terms of the use of land, water, and energy to increase food production. Technology can be expressed in various indicators, however, the current study identified four indicators based on expert's judgment and literature, such as lack of input supply (TC1), inadequate technology adoption and implementation (TC2), attitude towards technology innovation and development (TC3) and lack of infrastructure (TC4).</p><p>Based on the weight of the indicator, lack of input supply (TC1) is ranked as the most important technology driver that imposes LWEF nexus in the study area (Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Lack of access to technological input supply results in unproductive use of land, water, and energy resources <ref type="bibr">(Kanianska, 2016)</ref>. However, the technological processes may also produce unwanted results, such as loss of biodiversity, ecosystem disturbance, increased deforestation which create a trade-off on LWEF nexus. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> exhibits TC1, TC2, TC3 have a significant correlation with LWEF nexus resources, while TC4 does not, which implies TC4 did not have a significant direct impact on LWEF nexus. Similarly, the path coefficient analysis shows that inadequate technology adoption and implementation (p= 0.198) reveals the highest magnitude of a direct impact on LWEF nexus resources, followed by an attitude towards technology innovation and development (p= 0.079) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). This implies inadequate technology adoption, implementation and low attitudes towards technology can limit proper use of land, water, and energy resources. Nowadays in Ethiopia due to lack of site-specific technology extension land wastage, irrigation water loss, and energy disruption are becoming serious problems in agreement with study of <ref type="bibr">Bezuneh et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> depicts that the attitude towards technology innovation and development has significant indirect impact on nexus resources which is mediated by TC1(p= 0.001), TC2 (p= 0.818) and TC4 (p= 0.012). This implies people are causing environmental changes, notably in the biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere which are associated with a lack of technology-based inputs supply, inadequate technology, and a lack of infrastructure. These changes are the result of human activities linked with time and space, leading to global environmental problems. In general, one of the major causes of prolonged environmental problems is a technology and how humans use it since it can be both source and remedy of environmental problems. It also plays a critical role as an instrument for observing and monitoring the environment on global and local scales, in agreement with the finding of <ref type="bibr">(Ferreira et al., 2020)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Institutional and policy change as a driver</head><p>Aligned institutional structure and policy help to utilize nexus resources effectively, efficiently, and equitably. However, to date, the institutional structure and policy to integrate and manage the LWEF system as one component in Ethiopia entangled with complex problems of relevance, quality, accessibility and equity <ref type="bibr">(Flintan and Tedla, 2010)</ref>, which results in land, water, energy, and food insecurity.</p><p>Even though institutions and policy are working on Ethiopian forests, in the last three decades, the forest cover of the country drops from 40% to 3% <ref type="bibr">(Gebrehiwot et al., 2014)</ref>. This is linked with unintended institutional and policy change which induce land degradation, results on WEF nexus insecurity across the country.</p><p>The causes of failure in nexus resources insecurity were linked with frequent institutional and policy change. These changes became LWEF resource drivers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Based on the literature review and consultation with expert's we consider outdated legislation (IP1), inadequate financial capital (IP2), poor institutional structure (IP3), and poor stakeholder network (IP4) as the common institutional and policy change indicators that affect the LWEF nexus.  <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) the nexus approach is becoming gradually prominent on policymakers' agenda at the global and national level. However, in Ethiopia, particularly, in the case study area, inclusive outdated legislation among land, water, energy and food sectors is challenging. This could be due to those sector applies different concepts and contrasting types of interaction from the budget allocation, management scope, and organogram. Such differences prevent shared understanding which manipulates LWEF resources.</p><p>The result of the analysis indicates that outdated legislation (p= 0.24) and poor institutional structure (p= 0.15) directly affect LWEF nexus resources (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>). Lack of updating regulation and performing institution on the basis of time and resource use, with the current era of increasing population adequately disrupt the balance between resource and resource usage. Inadequate financial capital indirectly affects LWEF nexus resources through outdated legislation (p= 0.089) and poor institutional structure (p= 0.008). These results depict most programs, projects and activities did not aim to set in place the conditions under which local communities will be economically willing, and able, to conserve LWEF resources, results in nexus resource degradation by placing unsustainable demands on natural resources.</p><p>Poor stakeholder network affects nexus resources indirectly through outdated legislation (p= -0.026) and poor institutional structure (p=0.07) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>). In the last two decades many policies and projects designed in the current study area have not achieved LWEF nexus security due to poor stakeholder network. Lack of understanding institutional and policy changes as driving factors influences nexus resources consumption, regulation and management which results in negative externalities across sectors. The result of the path coefficient analysis revealed that economic (p=0.025) and social (p=0.011) driving factors had a positive direct effect on LWEF nexus resource degradation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). This implies LWEF resource degradation often results from immediate causes such as economic crisis and unsustainable resource management practices, or with underlying causes including population density, poverty, lack of alternative livelihoods, and consumption patterns.</p><p>Institutional and policy change indirectly affect LWEF nexus resources by enhancing or reducing technological advancement. Similarly, social structure and characteristics need a binding policy in order to regulate unsustainable resource utilization activities that contribute to natural degradation. In the study area, there are losses of biological and economic productivity caused by the complexity of land uses, water, energy access, and food insecurity. This could be associated with rapid population increase, urbanization and climate change which will pose a huge pressure on the socio-economic, ecological, and livelihood of the local community <ref type="bibr">(Chung et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>

However, access to these resources is complicated by factors driving nexus resource degradation. According to Mohamed (2017), following the complexity of LWEF nexus resource, more than 18.1 million people in Ethiopia are forced for frequent nexus resource insecurity which will affect different socio-economic components.</p><p>The result shows that access/availability of food (34.6%), overall electric supply (26%), and poor health conditions (10.57%) are key socio-economic characteristics strongly affected by LWEF nexus degradation in the study area (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). LWEF nexus degradation affects access/availability of food by 34.6% as compared with other socio-economic characteristics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). This implies that land use change, water and energy crisis challenges food security under changing climatic conditions. Understanding sustainable management of land, water and energy is one of the keystones for establishing livelihood security, maintaining the provision of ecosystem services and adaptive capacity against nexus resource degradation.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).

During our field investigation, the farming community reported that land use change, water potential reduction, lack of fuel wood, and declining food production was observed in the last four decades. Following this ecological variation in 2017 frost occurrence was observed in the highland part of the study area that affected the major livelihoods of the local community by declining productivity of crops particularly coffee and Enset (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref>).  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>Nowadays in accelerated global socio-environmental change the land, water, energy and food nexus has received increasing attention in academia and policymakers to restore nexus We argue that many nexus discourses focus on population growth and urbanization as a major nexus resource driver. However, these drivers were studied from a macro scale and growing megacities for the last decades, but the variability of these drivers from region to region was under looked at and needs policy attention. Therefore, this study focuses on understanding social, economic, environmental, institutional and policy change, and technology as a driver which induce degradation.</p><p>The result of the analysis indicates that in the study area LWEF nexus resources are significantly influenced by eight direct driving factors (such as SC1, SC2, EC1, EC2, EC4, EN3, EN4, and TC2), while other affects indirectly. These analyzed driving factors and their effects help stakeholders to better plan and design relevant policies to keep synergy and tradeoff for sustainable nexus resources management.</p><p>The finding of this study can also share experiences for nexus resources driving factor from local to a national scale, which can be of interest to the audience of nexus resource managers and planners to provide a better opportunity to reduce pressure on LWEF nexus resources.</p><p>Managing identified driving factor is essential to protect LWEF nexus resources which have a close link with human health and the environment. Addressing the adverse effects of driving factors needs all stakeholders to make a permanent individual and collective commitment which protect the environment and reduce the impact of driving factor on the environment and public health. Furthermore, we underline the necessity of applying LWEF nexus approaches to manage those drivers, in order to optimize environmental and social outcomes. For future research, different driving factor indicators and their impacts can be used to define benchmarks to identify the requirement of sustainable LWEF nexus for different parts of the country.  </p></div>
