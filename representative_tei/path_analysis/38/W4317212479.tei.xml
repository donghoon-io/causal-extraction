<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>communication system. It is essential to coordinate the elements of education, so they are well realized in achieving educational goals.</p><p>The principal is a person who has full authority in the management of the school. The principal plays a role in empowering all components of education. In implementing education, the principal must have communication skills to create and foster correlations with his employees in the organization he leads. It will make it easier for his staff to understand what the principal wants or needs to facilitate the running of the school organization.</p><p>The results of a preliminary study conducted by researchers at several elementary schools in Binuang Subdistrict, Tapin Regency, revealed that the principal's communication with the subordinate principal went quite well because the teachers could understand what the principal meant. Meanwhile, the work ethic of each teacher runs as it should because teachers carry out their duties and responsibilities following applicable rules and norms. It is just that some teachers have done things that are not following the teacher's code of ethics. For the work motivation of teachers in SD Negeri Binuang Subdistrict, Tapin Regency, some still have low work motivation. This situation can be seen from the degree of punctuality of the teacher concerned in teaching because the teacher is often late. The low motivation of teachers can be seen in how teachers teach them because some teachers prefer to give homework to students while explaining the material in class. The teacher concerned seems lazy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODOLOGY</head><p>This research included quantitative research with a correlational approach with a path analysis method, namely research aimed at explaining existing facts and knowing how much effect between variables. The population in this study was 153 state elementary school teachers. The sampling technique used was proportional random sampling. The number of samples was determined based on the slovin formula of 111 people. Data was collected through the principal's communication instruments (humanistic, pragmatic), work ethic (work is grace, work is trust, work is a vocation, work is actualization, work is worship, work is art, work is an honor, work is service), work motivation (internal motivation, external motivation), performance (work quality, quantity, punctuality, effectiveness, independence). The instrument was analyzed by testing the validity and reliability of the description of the collected data using path analysis to see direct and indirect effects by first conducting a test on normality, linearity, and homogeneity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The direct correlation of the principal communication with teacher performance</head><p>The results showed a direct correlation between the principal's communication and teachers' performance at the State Elementary School in Binuang District Tapin Regency. It was completed with a Beta score of 0.658 with a Significance score of 0.000, which stated that there was a direct correlation that was unidirectional, strong, and significant between the principal's communication and teacher performance at the State Elementary School in Binuang District Tapin Regency. Communication plays a significant role in an organization. Therefore it affects the world of work so that work activities can be optimized. The use of communication has a considerable effect on the work environment, embodied in the school's vision and mission. The communication needed is effective communication so that the organization can.</p><p>An educational institution has a principal, staff, education supervisor, teachers, and students. A principal has full authority over the progress of the school he leads. As a schoolmaster who performs management functions, he significantly affects his subordinates. A principal is in charge of helping direct, organize and monitor the work of each of them. The headmaster is the driving force rather than the resources and tools available to a group of organizations. The principal must have a good nature that can be used as an example in the school environment. One of them must be humble or simple, patient or have emotional stability, be confident, honest, and expert in his position. The principal should be an example to his employees regarding good behavior, as well as in terms of discipline and the academic field, and also in terms of achieving teacher performance.</p><p>With the things already mentioned, good communication is needed between the principal as the director and the staff and teachers as the object of the direction given by the principal in the form of communication. This communication carried out by the principal occurs in the form of a reciprocal exchange of information that can be understood jointly. Thus, the principal must be able to convey or communicate matters related to the school to improve the quality of teachers as a whole to improve teacher performance. This study's findings align with previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Aslamiah</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The direct correlation of work ethic to teacher performance</head><p>The results showed a direct correlation between work ethic and teacher performance at the State Elementary School in Binuang District Tapin Regency. It was completed with a Beta score of 0.547 with a Significance score of 0.000, which said there was a direct, moderate, and significant correlation between the principal's communication and teacher performance at the State Elementary School in Binuang District Tapin Regency.</p><p>Ethos is shaped by habits, cultural effects, and the value systems it believes in. The word ethos is also known as the word ethics, etiquette that is almost close to the notion of morals or values related to good and bad (moral). So that in that ethos, there is a powerful spirit to do something optimally and better and strive to achieve excellent quality work.</p><p>The quality of the work ethic that develops in a school, directly or indirectly, will affect and impact the teacher's performance. The better the work ethic that develops and runs in a school, the greater the chances of the school achieving better achievements.</p><p>This study's results align with the research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alkarni et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pratiwi et al., 2022)</ref>, which states that work ethic is closely related to performance. This result means that the better the work ethic, the more perfect the performance will be displayed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The direct correlation of teacher work motivation with teacher performance</head><p>The results showed a direct correlation between work motivation and teacher performance at State Elementary Schools in Binuang District Tapin Regency. It was completed with a Beta score of 0.879 with a Significance score of 0.000 which stated that there was a direct, powerful, and significant correlation between work motivation and teacher performance at State Elementary Schools in Binuang District Tapin Regency.</p><p>McClelland put forward the need for achievement (N.Ach) theory which states that motivation varies according to the strength of one's need for achievement. As quoted by Winardi, Murray formulated the need for such achievements as a desire:" Carrying out a difficult task or job. Mastering, manipulating or organizing physical, human, or ideological objects to carry out these things as quickly and independently as possible, according to applicable conditions. Overcoming obstacles, achieving high standards, achieving peak performance for yourself, being able to win in competition with other parties, and improving one's abilities through the successful application of talent."</p><p>According to McClelland, the characteristics of high achievers have three common characteristics, namely: (1) a preference for doing tasks with a moderate degree of difficulty; (2) a favor for those situations in which their performance arises due to their efforts, and not because of other factors, such as efficacy for example; and (3) want feedback on their successes and failures, compared to those who are low achievers.</p><p>The </p></div>

The indirect correlation of the principal's communication to work motivation</head><p>The results showed a direct correlation between the principal's communication and the teacher's work motivation at the State Elementary School in Binuang District Tapin Regency. It was completed with a Beta score of 0.292 with a Significance score of 0.000, which stated that there was a direct, weak, and significant correlation between the principal's communication and the teacher's work motivation at the State Elementary School in Binuang District Tapin Regency.</p><p>Leaders who can implement good communication with subordinates will guide subordinates to carry out their duties and responsibilities well. It indirectly states that the communication of the leadership can generate work motivation in subordinates. It means that the better the way or technique of the leader in communicating with subordinates, the higher the work motivation of the subordinates.</p><p>The that reveals that the communication of the principal as a leader in a teaching institution will have an impact on the work motivation of teachers or subordinates in carrying out tasks. The meaning is that the better and more precise the communication techniques applied by the principal, the more motivation will be formed in the teachers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The direct correlation of work ethic with the teacher's work motivation</head><p>The results showed a direct correlation between work ethic and teacher work motivation at a State Elementary School in Binuang District Tapin Regency. It was completed with a Beta score of 0.484 with a Significance score of 0.000 which said there was a direct, moderate, and significant correlation between work ethic and teacher work motivation at a State Elementary School in Binuang Kabupaten Tapin District.</p><p>The work ethic possessed by a person or community group will be a source of motivation for their actions. A high work ethic will be used as an absolute prerequisite if it is associated with a "constructive" situation in human life. It must be cultivated in that life because it will open the eyes and attitudes of the human being to judge high towards hard and earnest work to erode the perfunctory work attitude, not oriented towards the quality or quality that should be.</p><p>The motivational aspect is distinguished between the active or dynamic aspect and the sand or static aspect. In the active or dynamic aspect, motivation appears as a positive effort in moving and directing human resources to productively succeed in achieving the desired goals. In the passive or static aspect, motivation will appear as a need and also, at the same time, as a stimulant to be able to direct and move the potential of human resources toward the desired goal.</p><p>Related to work ethic, desire and excitement can be based on considerations about the existence of 2 static aspects of motivation. Namely: first, Static motivational aspects appear as basic human desires, and needs are the basis and expectations that will be obtained by achieving organizational goals. Second, static motivational aspects in the form of stimulating or intensive tools are expected to meet the desires and basic needs that he expects.</p><p>In line with the previous, Mc Clelland put forward the following motivation pattern: First, achievement motivation is a desire to overcome or defeat a challenge for progress and growth. The second, Affiliation motivation, is the impulse to make correlations with others. Third, Competence motivation is the drive to perform well by doing high-quality work. Fourth, Power motivation is the urge to be able to control a situation and the tendency to take risks in destroying obstacles that occur. This trait is often practiced by people who are in politics. This power motivation is pretty good if followed by good achievement, affiliation, and competence motivation. This study's results align with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Grabowski, 2021</ref>) that states that work ethic is closely related to work motivation. On the one hand, the work ethic is related to autonomous motivation, including specific intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, with the struggle for success resulting from work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. The indirect correlation between principal communication and teacher performance through teacher work motivation</head><p>Sobel's calculations show that the value of the Sobel Test Statistics is an indirect correlation of the Principal's Communication Variable to the teacher performance variable through the Work Motivation variable of state elementary school teachers in Binuang District, Tapin Regency is 3,658. The z score value is greater than z table 1.96. Then Ho is rejected, so the principal's communication indirectly significantly affects teacher performance variables through the variable Work Motivation of state elementary school teachers in Binuang District, Tapin Regency.</p><p>The principal's leadership and the teacher's work motivation affect teacher performance. Therefore, principals and teachers are required to have the ability to carry out their duties. But the role of the principal in achieving school goals, in general, will be more dominant than that of teachers. Even the leadership of the principal will affect the performance of the teacher as his subordinate and the performance of the teacher he leads. Because of the importance of the principal's role, it is necessary to discuss the principal with all its dimensions, especially regarding how the principal processes the policies imposed. One of the essential aspects of the principal is the field of management. The principal is obliged to manage the school as well as possible, achieving the effectiveness and efficiency of the expected results. It will relate to the principal's leadership (type or model of leadership), which will directly affect the general management and achievement of teacher performance.</p><p>The </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.</head><p>The indirect correlation between work ethic and teacher performance through teacher work motivation Sobel's calculations show that the value of the Sobel Test Statistics is an indirect correlation of work ethic variables to teacher performance variables through the Work Motivation variable for state elementary school teachers in Binuang District, Tapin Regency, 6,075. The z score value is more significant than z table 1.96. Hence Ho is rejected, so it can be said that work ethic is indirectly significantly related to the teacher performance variable (Y) through the Work Motivation (Z) variable of state elementary school teachers in Binuang District, Tapin Regency.</p><p>Work ethic is looking at a person towards work or positive work values. Work ethic is shown through behavior and attitude towards a job. A person with a high work ethic will strive to improve the quality of his work so that his existence will always be maintained.</p><p>The cultivation of work ethic in teachers needs to be done as early as possible so that teachers will get used to carrying out tasks and work with a sense of responsibility. Work ethic is closely related to a person's work readiness because people with a high work ethic will have better work readiness. People with a high work ethic will not give up quickly in the face of work problems because they have high motivation and a creative and innovative spirit. This study's results align with research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Grabowski, 2021)</ref> states that work ethic is closely related to work motivation. On the one hand, the work ethic is related to autonomous motivation, including specific intrinsic motivations, and on the other extrinsic motivation, with the struggle for success, which is the result of work. Reinforced by research <ref type="bibr">(Alimmudin et</ref>  that states that motivation is directly related to performance. So work ethic will form work motivation which will ultimately have an impact on performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSION</head><p>There is a direct and indirect correlation between principal communication, work ethic, work motivation, and performance. Teachers further increase the intensity of communication with parents or guardians of students, especially in terms of talking or discussing student development, be it in students who experience positive development or vice versa.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>et al., 2019; Firdaus et al., 2022; Hajidah et al., 2022; Mistiah et al., 2022; Shonubi &amp; Akintaro, 2016; Suriansyah et al., 2022.
