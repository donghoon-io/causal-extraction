<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study tries to understand the determinants of Chinese consumers' purchase behavior and reveal the role of gender in shaping consumers' buying decisions for agricultural products from live-streaming platforms. For this purpose, an online survey was carried out to collect data in Southern China. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed for path analysis and multi-group analysis. The results confirm the substantial influences of consumer attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on consumer buying intention. Next, gender difference only exists concerning the effect of perceived behavioral control on consumer intention. However, the gap between male and female consumers on this point is small.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Agricultural products refer to "any agricultural commodity or product, whether raw or processed, including any commodity or product derived from livestock for human or livestock consumption" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> . Generally, fresh products like vegetables and fruits are easily perishable <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . In this case, an effective agricultural product supply chain is critical. For example, if perishable products can be sold and quickly delivered to consumers in the shortest possible time, the losses of farmers can be significantly reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . Hence, live-streaming commerce plays a crucial role. Yu and Zheng (2022) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> defined live streaming as "an emerging online social and commerce tool", and live streaming commerce emerged when many anchors used live streaming as a means of real-time interaction with customers to sell products <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . Therefore, live-streaming commerce is deemed the latest trend in e-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> .</p><p>The emergence of COVID-19 has given birth to new business models and formats, such as "live streaming of agricultural products" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , which stands out among many agricultural product online marketing models with its unique advantages, showing huge development potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . Livestreaming commerce has effectively activated the stalemate in the sales of agricultural products in the region and has been widely practiced by farmers and concerned by society in China. The sales of agricultural products on the live broadcast e-commerce platform have skyrocketed, which not only lifted many farmers out of poverty and promoted the development of the local economy but also popularized knowledge about agriculture and agricultural products to the public <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . For instance, the sales of agricultural products achieved 6 billion yuan, and over 500 county magistrates became live-streaming anchors, assisting farmers in increasing their income <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> . More interestingly, as revealed by the "2022 China Agricultural Products Ecommerce Development Report", digital transformation and innovation become the new hot spots for the expansion of agricultural products in 2021, which has triggered different ways to promote agricultural products in online settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . In this context, the prevalent live streaming of agricultural products will likely shorten the distance between farmers and the market and allow the unique agricultural products in rural areas to be sold farther and better. In addition, the promotion cost of live streaming is relatively low. Due to market supply and demand information asymmetry, many unique agricultural products often need to be discovered. Compared with advertising, live streaming has lower operating costs and broader coverage and is not limited by the market, time, and space. Therefore, live streaming has gradually become an essential means of agricultural product sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> .</p><p>As an emerging trend of marketing, live streaming commerce is still in its' infant stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> , which consequently has attracted attention from mainstream scholars who have emphasized consumer behavior in a general context, including Sun et al. (2019) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> , Sohn and Kim (2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> , Wongkitrungrueng and Assarut (2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> , and Molinillo et al. (2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> , etc. However, two research gaps require more attention. First, there still needs to be more evidence to reveal how consumers respond to live streaming in the context of agri-food marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> . The use of live-streaming for agricultural product marketing is a relatively new form to promote agriculture in the digital age, and research on how consumers respond to this type of agricultural product marketing is still limited. Further research is needed to understand the effectiveness of live streaming as a marketing tool for agricultural products and to identify the most effective strategies for reaching consumers through live streaming. Second, it is meaningful to discover the role of gender in the live-streaming setting. Gender is a universal characteristic independent of culture and time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> . Generally, male and female consumers have different motivations, views, reasons, and concerns about shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> . Various studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> have revealed the effect of gender in e-commerce; still, similar studies are limited to live-streaming commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> . Thus, further research is needed to understand the impact of gender on consumer behavior and purchase decisions in the context of live commerce. This information may be useful to marketers and businesses looking to effectively target and engage audiences through live streaming. For this reason, we intend to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to reveal how consumers' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control influence consumers' buying intention for agricultural products in live streaming. Further, we attempt to understand how male and female consumers react to buying agricultural products through livestreaming platforms.</p><p>This study is structured as follows. The literature review will be discussed in the second section followed by the research method in the third section and the findings in the fourth section. Discussion and conclusion are provided in the fifth section, and the managerial implication is discussed in the sixth section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)</head><p>The theory of planned behavior developed by Ajzen (1991) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> is an essential social psychological model that aims to illuminate differences in the voluntary behavior of consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> . TPB model has been widely acknowledged and applied because of "its strong predictive power and high validity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> .</p><p>In the TPB model, individual behavioral intention is directly affected by individual attitude, subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref> . As an endogenous variable, intention implies an individual consumer's readiness to engage in a specific behavior, such as purchasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref> . According to Roseira's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> , the higher level of purchase intention that consumers generate, the more possibility that consumers will make an actual purchase. Thus, purchase intention is deemed the most critical step for the food industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . The first antecedent is the personal attitude, a willingness generated from past experience that influences a person's response to a particular object or situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref> . Regarding attitude toward a particular behavior, it is about a person's assessment of performing a particular behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> . If an individual possesses a positive attitude towards a behavior, his or her intention to engage in a particular action tends to be more robust <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> . Previous studies, including Gidaković et al. (2022) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> , Shihab and Putri (2018) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> , and Singh &amp; Banerjee (2018) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> have also proved the significant role of attitude in influencing consumer purchase intention. The second antecedent is perceived behavioral control, which relates to "personal control over the internal resource, such as confidence, skills or ability" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> . Perceived behavioral control manifests how difficult or easy it is to perform a behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref> . Various studies have confirmed perceived behavioral control's significant role in predicting an individual's behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> . For the third antecedent, the subjective norm is described as the perception of general social pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> regarding how behavior is viewed by references such as friends, parents, relatives, and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref> . Prior studies have shown the substantial effect of subjective norms on behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref> . Accordingly, the following hypotheses are developed:</p><p>H1: Attitude towards buying agricultural products significantly affects purchase intention.</p><p>H2: Perceived behavioral control significantly affects purchase intention.</p><p>H3: Subjective norm significantly affects purchase intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gender</head><p>Gender strongly influences consumers' cognitive thinking, emotional feelings, and purchasing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> . Gender differences are assessed based on a constellation of factors that crucially affect consumer behavior, including "perception, attitude, motivation, preferences, perceived risk and satisfaction" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> . More importantly, gender is associated with psychological and sociocultural behavioral traits in men and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref> who present different states when processing information and making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> . For instance, women tend to be influenced by the surrounding environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> . Women spend more time shopping and evaluating relevant product information <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref> than men, who perceive shopping as a mission and pay attention to the items they need <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> . Thus, to develop more accurate strategies and campaigns to effectively and efficiently reveal the preferences of male and female consumer groups, an exploration of the similarities or differences between the two consumer groups becomes desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> .</p><p>In recent years, gender differences have prevailed in understanding consumer behavior and attitude in the e-commerce milieu. There are significant gender differences in cognitive, affective, and behavioral attitudes toward online shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> , online purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> , and loyalty intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref> , etc. Notably, gender serves as a moderator in various previous studies. For example, gender is treated as a moderator when applying UTAUT and UTAUT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55]</ref> . Gender moderates the association between consumers' online shopping motivations and their shopping intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> , between consumers' perceptions and trusts to trigger users' intention to use electronic payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref> , and between consumers' perceived benefits and online repurchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> . However, the impact of gender on live e-commerce remains to be explored. For this reason, this study focuses on gender differences in consumers' buying intention of agricultural products in live streaming. Consequently, the following hypotheses are developed:</p><p>H4: The strengthening of the relationship between attitude towards buying agricultural products and purchase intention will differ between male and female consumers.</p><p>H5: The strengthening of the relationship between perceived behavioral control and purchase intention will be different between male and female consumers.</p><p>H6: The strength of the relationship between subjective norm and purchase intention will vary between male and female consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Design</head><p>The data collection was conducted online in Southern China from January to April 2020. G*Power was applied to verify the least possible sample size for the study. The results showed that at least 77 respondents should be recruited to ensure the study had a power level of 80% with a small effect size of 0.15 at a significant level of 5%. Eventually, 400 sample sizes were obtained with valid information; thus, the sample size of this study was considered sufficient for further data analysis.</p><p>Regarding questionnaire design, there are four items measuring attitude towards buying agricultural products, four assessing subjective norm, three measuring perceived behavior control, and three evaluating purchase intention. A 5-point Likert scale developed by Rensis Likert <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref> was applied to evaluate to what extent respondents agree or disagree with a given statement <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref> . The items were derived from the manual "Constructing a Theory of Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire" developed by Ajzen (https://people.umass.edu/aizen/tpb.html) (see also Xu et al., 2022) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> .</p><p>More importantly, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was utilized in this study. In the study of Xu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> , the impacts of consumer attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural con-trol on consumers buying intention were tested by structural equation modelling to provide a general scenario of consumers' responses to live shopping. In this study, based on existing findings, we not only further examined the structural relationship between the proposed structures via PLS-SEM, but also specifically examined multigroup analysis based on permutation tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref> . Consquently, more accurate and up-to-date consumer information will be obtained, such as how are male and female consumers similar or different in live shopping, particularly for agricultural products. Firms and scholars can develop more precise market strategies for different customer groups in more detail. For this purpose, Partial Least Squares Multigroup Analysis (PLS-MGA) was conducted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct reliability and validity</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows this study's construct reliability and validity, consisting of the factor loading, Cronbach's alpha, Dijkstra-Henseler's rho_A, Composite Reliability, and Average Variance Extracted (AVE).</p><p>Regarding factor loadings, all loading values are more significant than 0.7. Also, the AVE values of all constructs are more than the cutting-off point of 0.5 suggested by Hair et al. (2017) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref> . Therefore, the convergent validity is confirmed. Next, Cronbach's alpha values varied from 0.827 to 0.861, over 0.7 advised by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref> . As for composite reliability (C.R), all values are more significant than a recommended value of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref> . Besides, Dijkstra-Henseler's rho_A <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref> is a vital measure of internal consistency reliability for PLS-SEM, and all values should be greater than 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67]</ref> . Hence, since all values fulfil the criteria, internal consistency is confirmed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discriminant validity</head><p>Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio of correlation is applied to evaluate discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> . HTMT is "the ratio of the between-trait correlations to the within-trait correlations" <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref> . The thumb of rule is that if the value of HTMT is above 0.9, we failed to verify the existence of discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67]</ref> . Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reveals that all values of HTMT are smaller than 0.9; consequently, discriminant validity is proved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation of Structural Model</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the outcomes of hypothesis testing in which all the hypotheses are supported. Subjective norm (β = 0.400, t = 7.398) affects consumers' purchase intention most followed by attitude towards buying agricultural products (β = 0.283, t = 4.810) and perceived behavior control (β = 0.126, t = 3.166). In addition, the multicollinearity issue is not detected as all values of VIF are less than 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64]</ref> . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> visualizes the path analysis by presenting both path coefficient and t values. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Multi-group Analysis</head><p>Before proceeding to multi-group analysis, model fit was proved including Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.054, Normed Fit Index (NFI) = 0.962, Exact fit criteria d_ULS = 0.310 and d_G = 0.152. Then, a power analysis was conducted to ensure that the number of observations in each group would meet the minimum sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref> . The results derived from G*Power showed that 64 observations in each group were required to reach a power level of 80% at a significant level of 5%. Thus, the group-specific sample size for both males (N = 155) and females (N = 245) was regarded as sufficient.</p><p>Next, measurement invariance was evaluated, which was a vital step before the multigroup analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref> . If invariance cannot be proved, it will result in the "low power of a statistical test, the poor precision of estimators, and misleading results" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69]</ref> . In this context, the measurement invariance of composite models (MICOM) procedure developed by Henseler et al. (2016) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> was introduced, which consists of three steps: 1) Evaluating configural invariance, 2) establishing compositional invariance, and 3) assessing equality of a composite's mean value and variance across groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref> . Accordingly, the permutation test was applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref> .</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents the results of MICOM using the permutation test. Firstly, in general, configural invariance is automatically established at step 1. Next, in step 2 correlations between the composite scores are compared with a 5% quantile for all variables (ATT, INT, PBC and SUB_ N). The results show that only the quantile of PBC was  smaller than its correlation, indicating that compositional invariance was only established for the construct of PBC. Consequently, partial measurement invariance of PBC was confirmed. In step 3, the equality of mean (3a) and variance (3b) were tested. The original difference between male and female groups is compared with 95% confidence intervals. At step 3a, the mean of ATT and PBC fell "within the 95% confidence interval of the lower (2.5%) and upper (97.5%) boundaries" <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref> At the same time, INT and SUB_N did not, meaning that there were no significant differences between mean values of two groups (male Vs. female) for ATT and PBC constructs. At step 3b, only the variance of PBC fell within the 95% confidence interval, concluding that full measurement invariance was established only for PBC construction.</p><p>Further, Henseler's MGA (PLS-MGA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> was applied to analyze group-specific differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71]</ref> . Henseler's MGA is a nonparametric test that generates boostrapping results for each group <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69]</ref> . By using PLS-MGA, "a pvalue of differences between path coefficients lower than 0.05 or higher than 0.95 indicates a 5% level of significant difference between specific path coefficients across two groups" <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72]</ref> . Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> reveals that gender difference exists regarding the effect of PBC on INT while no differences are found in the paths from ATT and SUB to INT. However, male and female have little difference in the impact of PBC on INT as the path coefficient difference is 0.002.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>The hypothesis testing results confirm the significant influences of attitude towards buying agricultural products (H1), perceived behavior control (H2), and subjective norm (H3) on consumers' intention to buy agricultural products. Interestingly, the subjective norm is the most influential factor, which shows the importance of group influence in Chinese society. Under the influence of group consciousness and norms, social groups can produce common and consistent behaviors at any time. In this paper, consumers' purchase intention is influenced by the group they belong to and the people around them, that is, the preference of the people around them (family members, relatives, friends, or colleagues, etc.) for a particular product or a brand will influence their purchasing decision.</p><p>Next, in terms of multi-group analysis of gender difference, through measurement invariance of composite models (MICOM) procedure, full measurement invariance was established only for perceived behavioural control. Further, the multi-group analysis results reveal gender differences in predicting perceived behavioral control on consumer intention, indicating that the relationship between perceived behavior control and intention is slightly stronger for female consumers. It can be said that female respondents did not perceive buying agricultural products from a live-streaming commerce platform as complex.  This phenomenon may be related to the increasing number of female anchors on live broadcast platforms. As pointed out by Chen (2021) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref> , by 2020, female anchors in China's live-streaming commerce industry accounted for 65.3%, and among the three platforms of Taobao, Kuaishou, and Douyin, female anchors account for 71.5% in Kuaishou. 68.3% in Taobao and 57.5% in Douyin. Compared to male consumers, female anchors are more able to resonate with female consumers. In Chinese society, women usually spend more energy and time caring for their families. For example, they care about what their family eats, how to eat healthily, etc. The positioning of this traditional role also makes female consumers more willing to take the time to understand the agricultural products sold in the live broadcast room and actively interact with anchors seeking (predominantly female anchors) more relevant information. Therefore, they will feel that it is easy to buy agricultural products via livestreaming commerce platforms. This article also has its limitations. First, limited to quantitative research, it is impossible to obtain rich descriptive data on specific phenomena of consumers' behavior in purchasing agricultural products. Therefore, future studies using mixed methods studies are encouraged. Furthermore, in addition to gender differences, intergenerational differences can also be used for future research. Generation Y and Z's consumption behaviors, characteristics, and patterns in online shopping are a good focus.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Theoretical Implications</head><p>This study contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, it confirms the validity of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in the context of agricultural marketing. Second, the study reveals the importance of gender differences in promoting agricultural production in a digital setting. Therefore, this study can be used as a reference to explain the role of gender in encouraging consumers' choice of agricultural products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Managerial Implications</head><p>At a practical level, managerial implications are provided to increase consumer intention to buy agricultural products.</p><p>As far as subjective norms and attitudes are concerned, the "Family Coupon" program can be implemented in the live-streaming room of agricultural products to provide different degrees of discount. Consumers can apply for "parent-child coupons" in the live broadcast room or platform to share with relatives and friends. With more participation of relatives and friends, consumer attitude towards buying agricultural products will be more positive. This will trigger consumers' willingness to buy agricultural products.</p><p>As far as perceived behavior control is concerned, mainly when gender difference is considered, it is suggested that the live-streaming room or commerce platform should make purchasing more convenient and more manageable. In e-commerce, male consumers are generally more intuitive than female consumers. They tend to get information directly to make better comparisons; therefore, the convenient and time-saving live-streaming shopping experience is more favored by male consumers. Consequently, if live-streaming anchors or platforms provide more detailed product information while promoting agricultural products, it will reduce ambiguity. The policy to claim for the product return, to redeem to get gifts or discounts should be clear to reduce the risk. In addition, live-streaming platforms should conduct regular reviews of agricultural products quality and production qualifications to reduce consumer concerns about such issues. These practices will benefit both female and male consumers. Live broadcast platforms and anchors should strive to provide consumers with a safe, simple, and intuitive consumption experience while promoting agricultural products to increase consumers' intention to purchase and ultimately promote actual purchase behavior.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
