<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The present study explores how emotional memories, shame and submissive behavior in adulthood are differently related to depression and paranoia, in a sample of 255 subjects from the general community population.</p><p>Results show that emotional memories (especially, shame traumatic memory) are significantly correlated with external and internal shame. Emotional memories are significantly associated with submissive behavior. Both types of shame are correlated with submissive behavior, particularly internal shame. Emotional memories, external and internal shame are linked to depressive symptoms. Emotional memories, external and internal shame and submissive behavior are significantly related to paranoia.</p><p>Path analysis results suggested that: (1) shame traumatic memory and recall of threat and submissiveness in childhood predicted depressive symptoms through external and internal shame; (2) early emotional memories of shame, threat and submissiveness predicted paranoid ideation both directly and indirectly, through external shame; and (3) emotional memories impact on paranoid ideation both through their effect upon external shame and also through their indirect effect upon submission, which in turn fully mediates the effect of internal shame upon paranoid ideation.</p><p>These findings highlight the differences between depression and paranoia. In depression, it is the internalization of early experiences of shame, threat and submissiveness that heighten the vulnerability to depressive states. In paranoia, not only shame traumas and recollections of threat and submissiveness directly influence paranoid beliefs, but also these memories promote external and internal shame thoughts and feelings and submissive defenses, which in turn increase paranoid ideation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shame memories</head><p>An important type of emotional memories are shame memories. Shame experiences occur early on in our interactions with significant others and continue throughout our lives. Early shaming rearing experiences (where one experiences the emotions of others being directed at oneself) are recorded in autobiographical memory as conditioned emotional memories and operate as traumatic memories, involving intrusiveness, hyperarousal, and efforts to avoid shame <ref type="bibr">(Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>When triggered, they can affect body memory and the 'felt sense of self' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brewin, 2006)</ref>, and guide attention, emotional and cognitive processing, determining the activation of defensive strategies/behaviors (e.g., fight, flight, submission) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gilbert, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Matos, Pinto-Gouveia, &amp; Costa, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, these threat memories can texture the whole sense of self and become central to ones' self-identity and life story <ref type="bibr">(Pinto-Gouveia &amp; Matos, 2011)</ref> and have a major impact on who and how we engage socially <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gilbert, 2007)</ref> .</p><p>Several studies have shown that recall of aversive early experiences is associated with a range of psychological problems in adulthood, especially depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gilbert, Cheung, Grandfield, Campey, &amp; Irons, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Perris, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Perris &amp; Gilbert, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stuewig &amp; McCloskey, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Webb, Heisler, Call, Chickering, &amp; Colburn, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Particularly, recent research has found that shame traumatic memories from childhood and adolescence are related to shame feelings in adulthood and moderate the impact of shame on depression <ref type="bibr">(Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2010)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Matos, Pinto-Gouveia and Gilbert (2012)</ref> reported that shame trauma memories were significantly associated with paranoid symptoms, but not social anxiety, even when controlling for current external and internal shame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shame</head><p>The self-conscious emotion of shame emerges from our evolved abilities to be aware of 'how we exist for others' as a response to the social threat of being unattractive. So, key to the experience of shame is external shame, related to how one experiences oneself as living in the minds of others (e.g., as inferior, inadequate, worthless, bad). In external shame, the world is experienced as unsafe since others are perceived as harsh, critical and hostile and may reject, criticize, harm or even persecute the self. In order to deal with external shame people may engage in defensive maneuvers, with the behavior orientated towards trying to positively influence one's image in the mind of other (e.g., by submitting, appeasing, displaying desirable qualities, avoiding).</p><p>On the other hand, the internalization of external shame can result in seeing and evaluating the self in the same way others have, that it is flawed, inferior, rejectable and globally self-condemning (negative internal models of self and others; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gilbert, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gilbert, , 2002a;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2005)</ref>. Internalized shame is then linked to complex memory systems (e.g., previous shaming episodes; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kaufman, 1989)</ref> and to negative self-evaluations and feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Tracy &amp; Robins, 2004)</ref>, which are partly related to ones imaginary audiences created through experiences with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baldwin, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, external and internal shame are closely linked, given that both are important for social functioning and shame experiences usually involve their interaction, fueling one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gilbert, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kim, Thibodeau, &amp; Jorgensen, 2011)</ref>. Shame, both externally or internally focused, has been associated with increased vulnerabilities to psychopathology, namely depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andrews, Qian, &amp; Valentine, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cheung, Gilbert, &amp; Irons, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2010)</ref>, and paranoia <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gilbert et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Matos et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>One of the major defenses to (external) shame is the internalized shame response, where one adopts a subordinate, submissive strategy associated with selfmonitoring and self-blaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gilbert, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gilbert, , 2002a))</ref>. In fact, research has shown that shame is highly associated with tendencies to behave submissively, inhibit anger expression, self-monitoring and self-attributional styles in an effort to avoid aggression and conflict with powerful hostile others or appease them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allan &amp; Gilbert, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gilbert, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gilbert, , 2000a))</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From early (shame) experiences to submissiveness</head><p>Early shaming and devaluing experiences can then locate the child as unattractive and in an inferior rank position, setting the child up to view themselves as subordinate, having poor status and attractiveness in the eyes of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gilbert, Allan, &amp; Goss, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Evolutionary theory, specifically social rank theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gilbert, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gilbert, , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gilbert, Allan, Brough, Melley, &amp; Miles, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Irons, Gilbert, Baldwin, Baccus, &amp; Palmer, 2006)</ref>, considers the child-parent relationships as power relationships, and focuses on down rank threats and submissive behavior. Thus, when children are frightened of their parents and feel forced into unwanted or involuntary subordinate positions they may adopt a variety of submissive and 'low rank' defensive behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gilbert, 2000b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gilbert et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gilbert, Cheung, Grandfield, Campey, &amp; Irons, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, submissive behavior is a basic defensive strategy common to animals and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(MacLean, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gilbert, 2000b)</ref> and is associated with dominantsubordinate hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allan &amp; Gilbert, 1997)</ref>. In humans, the consequences of losing social rank or being allocated a lower rank against ones wishes (i.e., involuntary subordination; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gilbert, 1992)</ref> can involve defensive emotions (e.g., anger, shame) and entail primitive social defensive behaviors (e.g., submissive behaviors of escape, passive inhibition). Moreover, human subordinate behaviors can involve either seeking closeness or seeking/keeping distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Birtchnell, 1993)</ref>. Besides aimed at signaling no threat and avoiding conflict and aggression from the other, subordination in humans can involve complying with others or appear friendly when one wants to be dominant, to appease others and avoid being excluded from the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allan &amp; Gilbert, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gilbert, 2000b)</ref>.</p><p>Submissive displays involve behaviours such as backing down quickly if challenged, eye gaze avoidance (e.g., subordinate non-human primates always avoid eye gaze with dominants), fear grinning, and not confidently making claims on resources or advertising oneself. As mentioned before, there is much in submissive behaviour that is mirrored in shame displays: e.g., backing down and wanting to hide or escape if challenged, eye gaze avoidance, lack of, or inhibition of, confidence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gilbert 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gilbert , 2000a))</ref>. In addition, a shame display seems to have a similar purpose to that of a submissive display: inhibiting and reducing attacks from other and avoid losing social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Keltner &amp; Harker, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Research has suggested that, a fearful subordinate/submissive style, particularly involuntary submissive behaviour, is highly linked to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allan &amp; Gilbert, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gilbert &amp; Allan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gilbert, 2002b)</ref>. In fact, depressed people tend to see themselves as inferior in comparison to others, to behave submissively in conflict situations and feel trapped and defeated <ref type="bibr">(Gilbert &amp; Allan, 1994)</ref>. Furthermore, submissive behaviour was found to be associated with paranoid beliefs and ideation and social anxiety in mixed clinical and student samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gilbert, 2000a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gilbert, Boxall, Cheung, &amp; Irons, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The current study</head><p>Taken together these theoretical considerations and empirical findings, this study intended to explore how emotional memories, shame and submissive behavior in The first aim of the present study was explore how emotional memories were related to submissive behavior in adulthood. It is known that recollections of feeling subordinate and acting in a submissive way in childhood contribute to submissive behavior <ref type="bibr">(Allan &amp; Gilbert, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, 1997)</ref>. However, little is known about the influence of shame traumatic memories on these basic defensive behaviors. We hypothesized that both emotional memories would be linked to submissive behaviour. Second, we sought out to understand the relationships between external shame and internal shame and submissive behaviour. We expected that individuals with higher levels of shame would engage in submissive behaviors.</p><p>Finally, the main goal of this study was to investigate how emotional memories, internal and external shame, and submissive behavior are distinctively related depression and paranoia. Thus, we a mediational chain path model for the relationships among emotional memories, external shame, internal shame and submissive behaviour and depression and paranoid beliefs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). In the theoretical model we predicted that shame traumatic memory and recall of threat and submissiveness in childhood would indirectly impact upon depression and paranoid beliefs through their effect upon external shame, internal shame and submissive behavior. Also, we test whether emotional memories indirectly impact upon submissive behavior through their effect upon external and internal shame. In turn, we hypothesize that external and internal shame would indirectly impact upon depression and paranoid beliefs through their effect upon submissive behavior. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants in this study were 255 subjects from general community population. 68.2% were females (n = 174) and 31.8% males (n = 81). The mean age is 36.96 (SD = 10.99) and the mean years of education is 13.34 (SD = 3.54). Concerning marital status, 56.4% of the participants were married or in a relationship (n = 144), 36.5% were single (n = 93), 5.5% were divorced (n = 14) and 1.6% were widows (n = 4). 61.2% of the subjects have middle class professions (n = 156).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>A battery of self-report questionnaires was administered to participants by the authors, within the staff of institutions, namely schools and private corporations. These institution's boards were contacted, the research aims were clarified and authorization was obtained so that their employees could participate in the study. Afterwards, the personnel was elucidated about the investigation goals and invited to voluntarily participate. Then, self-report questionnaires were filled by volunteers in the presence of the researcher. In line with ethical requirements, it was emphasized that participants cooperation was voluntary and that their answers were confidential and only used for the purpose of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recall of Threat and Submissiveness in Childhood</head><p>Early Life Experiences Scale (ELES; Cheung, Grandfield, Campey, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">&amp; Irons, 2003</ref>; Portuguese version by <ref type="bibr">Lopes &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2005)</ref>. This scale was designed to measure recall of perceived threat and subordination in childhood. ELES consists of 15 items focusing on recall of perceived threat (six items) and feeling subordinate and acting in a submissive way (nine items). The response measure consisted of a Likert type scale with participants required to rate how frequently and how true each statement was for them in childhood (1 = completely untrue, 2 = very occasionally true, 3 = sometimes true, 4 = fairly true, 5 = very true). This scale is composed by three factors: a factor for threat (e.g., "In order to avoid getting hurt I used to try to avoid my parents."), a factor related to submissiveness (e.g., "I often had to go along with others even when I did not want to.") and a factor related to feeling (un)valued (e.g., "I felt able to assert myself in my family." -reversed item). In the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gilbert et al., 2003)</ref>, the Cronbach's alpha of the subscales were .89 for threat, .85 for submissiveness and .71 for (un)valued. Given our research aims, and as performed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gilbert et al., 2003)</ref>, the total of the ELES was used as a general measure of recall of threat and submissiveness in childhood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shame traumatic memory.</head><p>Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Portuguese version by Matos, Pinto-Gouveia, &amp; Martins, 2010)</ref>. The IES-R is a self-report measure designed to assess current subjective distress for any specific life event, in our study specifically, a shame experience from childhood or adolescence. The IES-R has 22 items, seven items having being added to the original 15-item IES <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997)</ref>, each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0-4). This scale is constituted by three subscales that measure the three main characteristics of traumatic memories: avoidance (e.g., "I stayed away from reminders of it"), intrusion (e.g., "Any reminder brought back feelings about it") and hyperarousal (e.g., "I was jumpy and easily startled") that parallel the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In the original study, the Cronbach's alpha of the subscales ranged from .87 to .92 for intrusion, .84 to .86 for avoidance and .79 to .90 for hyperarousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997)</ref>. In the current study, all analyses were conducted using the total of the IES-R, since the validation study for the Portuguese population found a unidimensional structure that revealed strong psychometric properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Matos, Pinto-Gouveia, &amp; Martins, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Priming for a Shame Memory</head><p>In this study, as performed in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Matos, Pinto-Gouveia, &amp; Costa, 2011)</ref>, instructions of the IES-R were modified to prime participants with a shame memory and complete the scale with that memory as their focus. Participants were instructed to answer the questionnaire based on the impact throughout their lives that a significant shame experience they recalled from their childhood or adolescence had. After a brief introduction about the concept of shame it was instructed: 'Now, please try to recall a (significant) situation or experience in which you think you felt shame, during your childhood and/or adolescence. Below, is a list of comments made by people after stressful life events. Using the following scale, please indicate the degree of distress that each difficulty has caused you throughout your life. That is, concerning the shame experience you recalled, how much were you distressed by these difficulties?'</p></div>

The scale consists of 18 items measuring external shame (global judgments of how people think others view them). For example, respondents indicate the frequency on a 5-point scale (0-4) of their feelings and experiences to items such as, "I feel other people see me as not quite good enough" and "I think that other people look down on me".

Emotional memories also impact upon paranoia directly and indirectly through external shame. The effects of emotional memories on submission are fully through their effects upon internal shame.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Recent studies have shown that shame traumatic memories influence cognitive and emotional processing and are related to psychopathology, specifically depression, anxiety, paranoia and current shame feelings <ref type="bibr">(Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pinto-Gouveia &amp; Matos, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pinto-Gouveia, Castilho, Matos, &amp; Xavier, 2012)</ref>. Moreover, emotional memories of threat and feeling subordinate in childhood and submissive behavior in adulthood are both associated with psychopathological symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allan &amp; Gilbert, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gilbert et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Irons &amp; Gilbert, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The current study investigated the relations among emotional memories, shame traumas, current shame feelings and submissive behavior on depression and paranoia.</p><p>Following previous research on the role of early negative rearing experiences and shame memories to the emergence of shame in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andrews, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Claesson &amp; Sohlberg, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gilbert &amp; Gerlsma, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gilbert et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matos, Pinto-Gouveia, &amp; Gilbert, 2011)</ref>, we began to explore the relationship between emotional memories and shame feelings in adulthood. Results showed that the emotional memories evaluated were significantly correlated with shame but it was especially shame traumatic memory that was strongly linked to external and internal shame. So, individuals whose shame memories reveal traumatic characteristics and who recall feeling frightened of their parents and having to behave in subordinate ways in their family tend to believe they exist negatively in the minds of others (e.g., as unattractive, worthless, inadequate) and to perceive themselves as inferior and undesirable.</p><p>The present study also aimed at exploring the relationship between emotional memories and submissive behavior. In accordance to our hypothesis, we found that emotional memories of threat and submissiveness and shame traumatic memories were significantly associated with submissive behaviour. These results suggest that individuals with memories of feeling threatened and subordinate in their family and shame traumatic experiences tend to behave more submissively in their relations with others.</p><p>As expected, both types of shame were correlated with submissive behavior, particularly internal shame. It seems that the experience of the self as inferior, worthless, defective, inadequate or bad in its own eyes along with the perception that one exists negatively in the mind of the other (e.g., to see self as inferior to others, thinking that other look down on the self), can trigger submissive behaviours in order to compete for social acceptance and avoid losing social status.</p><p>Regarding psychopathology, both emotional memories were related to depression, although shame traumatic memories showed more expressive associations with depressive symptoms. As expected, current external and internal shame were strongly linked to depressive symptoms, with internal shame revealing the highest correlation. Interestingly, for paranoia, positive correlations were found with both emotional memories variables, external and internal shame and submissive behavior. Shame traumatic memories, external and internal shame showed the strongest associations. Thus, individuals with emotional memories of being shamed, devalued, subordinate or threatened by their parents, who see themselves negatively and believe to exist negatively in the mind of the others and who tend to adopt a subordinate attitude, seem to see others as hostile, powerful and harmful, with negative intentions towards the self, and feel they are in the attentional field of others.</p><p>Taken together these results and the aforemencioned hypothesis, we tested a path model in which we investigated a meditational chain among emotional memories, external and internal shame, submissive behavior, depressive symptoms and paranoid ideation. Path analyses results show that shame traumatic memory and recall of threat and submissiveness in childhood predicted elevated depressive symptoms through increased external and internal shame. So, current shame feelings fully mediated the effects of emotional memories upon depression.</p><p>In regard to paranoid ideation, we found that early emotional memories of shame, threat and submissiveness predicted great paranoid ideation both directly in indirectly, through greater external shame. That is external shame partially mediated effects of emotional memories on paranoid beliefs. Furthermore, while external shame and submissive behavior revealed a direct effect on paranoid ideation, internal shame only predicted paranoid beliefs indirectly, through submissive behavior. So, submissive behavior fully mediated the effect of internal shame on paranoid ideation.</p><p>In addition, early memories of threat and submissiveness and shame traumatic memories predicted a increased submissive behavior fully through heightened internal shame. That is, internal shame fully mediated the effect of emotional memories upon submissive behavior. External shame had no significant impact on submissive behavior.</p><p>Moreover, the impact of emotional memories on paranoid ideation seems to operate both through their effect upon external shame and also through their indirect effect upon submission, which in turn fully mediates the effect of internal shame upon paranoid ideation.</p><p>These findings are in line with previous research emphasizing the importance of the quality of early interactions with significant others to the construction of selfidentity and self-other schemas and thus, to the emergence of the self-consciousness emotion of shame <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Claesson &amp; Sohlberg, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gilbert, Baldwin, &amp; Dandenau, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gilbert, &amp; Gerlsma, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gilbert et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matos &amp; Pinto-Gouveia, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Matos, Pinto-Gouveia, &amp; Costa, 2011)</ref>. Hence, shame, threat, subordination and devaluing experiences in early life may lead to self-perceptions of being inferior (in a low rank position), subordinate, unattractive and unvalued in one's own eyes and in those of the others. These perceptions of inferior social rank may then give rise to shame feelings and to the subsequent activation of submissive defenses, in order to minimize harm from others, avoid conflict and appease others. Thus, these data are in line with <ref type="bibr">Gilbert's theoretical model (2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Irons &amp; Gilbert, 2003)</ref> suggesting that children who are frightened of their parents and feel forced into unwanted or involuntary subordinate positions and who went through severe and traumatic shame experiences in childhood or adolescence, may adopt various submissive and "low rank" defensive behaviours.</p><p>Our results add to this view by suggesting that these negative emotional memories seem to foster negative perceptions of the self as inferior, subordinate, powerless (i.e., internal shame), which in turn may trigger submissive defenses in order to keep the self safe by signaling no threat and prevent harm or attack from others.</p><p>The evolutionary and biopsychosocial model of shame <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gilbert, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gilbert, , 2007) )</ref> postulates that the experience of not being able to create positive images/feelings in the mind of the other creates a sense of the world as unsafe and leads people to engage in defensive strategies. These findings support the idea that one of these major defenses is the internalization of shame where one adopts a subordinate, submissive strategy associated with self-blaming and self-monitoring in an effort to minimize harm and promote social approval.</p><p>A key finding was the indirect effect of shame traumatic memory and recall of threat and submissiveness on depression fully through external and internal shame. So, it seems that shame memories that function as trauma memories and recollections of feeling threatened and subordinated within family may promote a perceptions of the self as inferior, inadequate, defective, worthless, unattractive in the mind of the others and in one's own eyes. These devaluating self-perceptions and feelings may in turn render one more vulnerable to enter defeat and entrapment states in face of difficult life events. These data are in line with the evolutionary model of shame and depression, that conceives depression as a defensive response to defeat states, perceptions of being inferior to others, feelings of entrapment and powerlessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gilbert, 2000b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gilbert &amp; Allan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gilbert, Allan, Brough, Melley, &amp; Miles, 2002)</ref>. These result are also consistent with recent empirical studies on the role of shame on depression vulnerability (Cheung, <ref type="bibr">Gilbert, &amp; Irons, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gilbert, 2000a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pinto-Gouveia &amp; Matos, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pinto-Gouveia, Castilho, Matos, &amp; Xavier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pinto-Gouveia, Castilho, Matos, &amp; Xavier, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Of note was also the finding that early emotional memories impact upon paranoid beliefs both directly and indirectly through external shame. In other words, it seems that, on the one hand, memories of shame traumas, threat and subordination experiences in childhood may influence the emergence of negative relational schemas linked to perceptions of others as critical, hostile, dominant and thus may hold malevolent intentions towards the self. On the other hand, it seems that this association between these adverse emotional memories and paranoid ideation also operates through the impact of such negative experiences on promoting a negative sense of self as existing negatively for others, which in turn may increase one's vulnerability to beliefs that others are harsh and powerful and may want to harm the self. These findings are in line with the evolutionary models of paranoia <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Freeman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Freeman et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Freeman et al., , 2005;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gilbert, 1998a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gilbert, , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gilbert et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Salvatore et al., 2011)</ref> and give further support to recent research showing that shame memories that function as traumatic ones and external shame were particularly related to paranoid ideation <ref type="bibr">(Matos et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the indirect effect of shame traumatic memories and recalls of threat and submissiveness on paranoid ideation also operated through internal shame, which had an indirect effect upon paranoid beliefs through submissive behavior. These results suggest that emotional memories of shame, feeling threatened and forced into a subordinate position by one's parents may lead to negative self-directed thoughts and feelings, of being inferior, defective, inadequate (i.e., internal shame), which in turn may activate defensive outputs, such as submissive behaviors. These defensive/safety strategies function as a way to protect the self against damages to one's self-image and possible criticism and attacks from others. In line with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Freeman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gilbert et al., 2005)</ref>, we found that these perceptions of inferior social rank associated with submissive behaviors may increase one's focus on being vulnerable to rejection and attacks from others, which might contribute to the occurrence of paranoid ideation. Key to our findings is the confluence of these variables (emotional memories, external shame and internal shame and submissive behavior) in the prediction of paranoia. These results extend previous findings on the role of shame and shame memories in the development of paranoid symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gilbert et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matos, Pinto-Gouveia, &amp; Gilbert, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pinto-Gouveia, Castilho, Matos, &amp; Xavier, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results point to relevant differences in how negative emotional memories, shame and submission impact on depression and paranoia. Specifically, in depressive symptoms it is the internalization of early experiences of shame, threat and submissiveness into beliefs that one exists as an unattractive social agent in the others' minds and into perceptions of the self as inferior, worthless, powerless, that heightens one's vulnerability to enter depressive states. However, in paranoia, not only shame traumas and recollections of threat and submissiveness directly influence paranoid beliefs, but also these memories promote external and internal shame thoughts and feelings and submissive defenses, which in turn increase perceptions of the self as vulnerable in face of others who hold malevolent intentions towards he self.</p><p>We hope that the data offered here helped shed light on the importance of emotional memories, shame traumatic memories, shame, and submissive behavior to the understanding of the nature of depression and paranoid beliefs.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>revealed an excellent model fit (CMIN/DF = .690; CFI = 1.00; TLI = 1.010; NFI = .993; RMSEA = .000). All the paths were statistically significant and the significance of indirect mediational paths was further confirmed through bootstrap resampling method. The model accounted for 35% of internal shame, 22% of external shame, 29% of submissive behaviour, 40% of depressive symptoms and 37% of paranoid ideation variances.Regarding depression, indirect mediational tests results showed that shame traumatic memory (IES-R) predicted increased depression fully through heightened feelings of external shame (OAS) and internal shame (ISS) (b IES-R = .296, 95% CI = .205 to .373; p = .002). Recall of threat and submissiveness in childhood (ELES) predicted elevated depressive symptoms fully through greater external shame (OAS) and internal shame (ISS) (b IES-R = .143, 95% CI = .061 to .230; p = .002). Both external shame (b OAS = .241) and internal shame (b IES-R = .437) directly predicted increased depressive symptoms.For paranoia, indirect mediational tests results indicated that shame traumatic memory (IES-R) predicted elevated paranoid ideation partially through increased external shame (OAS) (b IES-R = .159, 95% CI = .087 to .239; p = .002) and showed a significant direct effect of .227. Similar results were found for recall of threat and submissiveness (ELES), which predicted greater paranoid ideation partially through increased external shame (OAS) (b IES-R = .079, 95% CI = .026 to .142; p = .002) and also revealed a direct effect of .124. External shame (OAS) (b IES-R = .318) and submissive behaviour (SBS) (b IES-R = .157) predicted greater paranoid ideation directly, whereas internal shame (ISS) predicted elevated paranoia fully through greater submissive behaviour (b IES-R = .085, 95% CI = .006 to .158; p = .030).In addition, as to submission (SBS), only internal shame (ISS) directly predicted greater submissive behaviour. Shame traumatic memory (IES-R) (b IES-R = .256, 95% CI = .177 to .333) and recall of threat and submissiveness (ELES) (b IES-R = .122, 95% CI = .055 to .192) predicted increased submissive behaviour fully through heightened internal shame (ISS). External shame (OAS) had no significant effect on submission.</figDesc></figure>
