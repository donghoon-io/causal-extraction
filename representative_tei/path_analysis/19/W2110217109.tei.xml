<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Aiming to develop a model seeking to investigate the direct effects of personality types on internet addiction, this study was set and tested on tertiary level students receiving education within two learning modes: face to face and distance education. The participants of the study, selected through maximum variety method within purposive sampling, included 210 students enrolled on face-to-face and distance education programs of computer programming department. In addition to a personal data form aiming to obtain information on demographic features of the participants, a personality inventory and an Internet addiction scale were utilized to gather data. As an analysis model concurrently exerting both the mediation and direct effects, path analysis with observed variables was utilized in the current study to test the developed model. The findings revealed that while the most powerful predictor variable of internet addiction was conscientiousness, openness to experience was found as the weakest independent variable predictor. Additionally the developed model was observed as valid for both face to face and distance education students.</p></div>

These behaviors could affect the lives of users irreparably if not treated with appropriate methods.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process</head><p>The data were gathered voluntarily from face to face students on a group basis. Distant students were provided data individually through the school's online system. Students were provided with explanations on the objective of the study prior to the application of the instruments which took face to face learners 15 minutes to complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>This section is devoted to the results of descriptive and correlational statistical analysis conducted in relation to the dependent and independent variables.</p><p>Means and standard deviations were calculated and tabulated below. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> highlights that while the respondents received the highest point from the consciousness ( X = 10,62) sub-scale among the personality types, openness to experience ( X = 7,57) was the least popular option. The mean of the respondents` values obtained from internet addiction was observed as 32.45.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of personality traits and internet addiction model</head><p>The findings related to zero-order correlations between the variables and standardized coefficients, representing relations among the variables of the developed model are presented here. The correlations among the variables are shown below in Table : 3. The results relating to the correlation between personality types and internet addiction indicates that while the highest correlation rate (r=-.20, p&lt;.01) is observed as the conscientiousness trait, the lowest rate (r=.14, p&lt;.05) is observed as openness to experience. <ref type="table">4</ref>.  Therefore, conscientiousness (ß=-.31, p&lt;.01) at a medium level effect size is observed as the most powerful predictor variable of internet addiction. Conversely, openness to experience (ß .01, p&lt;.01) having a low effect size is the weakest predictor variable of internet addiction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The good fit indexes of the model are given in Table</head><p>The model also implies that while extravertedness possesses a very low effect on internet addiction (ß=-.02, p&lt;.01), agreeableness (ß=.17, p&lt;.01) and emotional instability (ß=.16, p&lt;.01) also have low effect sizes. In other words, a one point increment observed on the conscientiousness relates to internet addiction as a 0.31 decrease or a one point increment on openness to experience influences addiction by having a value of 0.01and so on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of the model`s validity on learning modes</head><p>The validity of the model on the face-to-face and distance education groups was tested with a multi-group path analysis. Prior to conducting the model analysis, since the CFI value is not affected from the sample size comparing to the other fit indexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kline, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tabachnick, &amp; Fidell, 2007)</ref>, and the number of participants in each group is relatively low, the CFI values belonging to models calculated for each group were provided.</p><p>The results for the groups were observed as follows; 0.92 for face-to-face group and 0.90 for distance education group. Hence, assuming that model analysis is not under effect of sample size, multi-group path analysis was conducted. The descriptive are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">: 5</ref> The research focusing on the differences among the good fit indexes of multi-group model analyses applications conclude that the difference between RMSEA values should be higher than 0.01 in order to indicate a difference between two models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002)</ref>. The differences between the RMSEA values of the models were checked (ΔRMSEA) and the model having a lower rate was considered as valid when the difference is over the critical value proposed by the literature.</p><p>When the difference is not over that critical value, the other models (B, C, D) were considered not providing a better explanation than model A.

The results shown above indicate that the means of both groups on all scales are rather similar. The values related to the models are presented in Table : 6.

Besides, χ2/sd values are observed as very closer to each other (χ2/sd ratios for all models are nearly 2.5). In light of the findings, Model A, having the highest fit indexes comparing to the other groups, is accepted. In brief, the personality type-internet addiction model is valid for both face to face and distant learners. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This study produced results which partially support the findings of a wealth of previous work in the field. However, the findings of the current study do not support the findings of all previous studies. For instance, findings are not consistent with those of Kraut et al., (2002) (though it focused on internet usage rather than IA) who found a positive relation between extravertedness and internet addiction. Extravertedness was observed as having a negative effect on IA. Although this result differs from some published studies, the contradiction may be explained by the fact that the majority of the previous research in the field was conducted in the western culture which is generally considered to prize individuality. However, the current study was conducted within a Turkish-orientated society commonly considered as a social community prizing collectiveness as opposed to individuality (Kağıtcıbaşı, 1996), reducing the need to use the internet for extraverted people when compared to other personality types. Another possible explanation for the inconsistency is that the relevant literature posits a triggering effect of IA caused by a lack of social support (Papacharissi, &amp; Rubin, 2000; Yeh, Ko, Wu, &amp; Cheng, 2008). Extraverted people tend to initiate social interaction and are considered more successful in establishing effective communication. These findings further support the idea of Inderbiten, Kubey, Lavin and Barrows arguing that introvert people having problems in interpersonal relations do prefer using the internet and may substitute real and face to face relations for cyber communication (Kubey, Lavin, &amp; Barrows, 2001). The relevant literature also states that emotional instability (Hamburger, &amp; Ben-Artzi, 2000) and being open to experience (Tuten, &amp; Bosnjak, 2001) have a positive relationship with IA. The findings of the current study, in relation to emotional instability and openness to experiences, seems to be consistent with those of other studies showing that emotionally instable people who are described as stressed, fragile, depressed, and careless are not fully capable of developing reliable relations and pursuing social interactions (Hojat, 1982). Morahan-Martin and Schumacher (2000) underlines that emotionally unstable people feel greater inner loneliness and become addicted to the internet more easily. A few previous researchers emphasized the positive relation between the high rates observed on internet addiction and loneliness ((Durak-Batıgün &amp; Kılıç, 2011; Eijnden, et al. 2008; Erdoğan, 2008). Additionally, the minor positive effect of openness to experience on IA can be explained by the motivation of these people for their interest in experiencing new things and their curiosity towards exploring the internet (Levine &amp; Stokes, 1986). One of the notable outcomes of the current study is that there is a negative effect between agreeableness and conscientiousness (medium level) and internet addiction. This particular finding corroborates the ideas generated within the literature (Durak-Batıgün, &amp; Kılıç, 2011; Tuten &amp; Bosnjak, 2001). Tuten and Bosnjak (2001) elaborate that since conscientious people are known as dependable and disciplined, they have no barriers against developing face to face relations and meeting their social support needs. Thus, the negative relationship between the conscientious personality type and IA should be considered reliable.In contrast to the previous research stating a negative effect of agreeableness and internet addiction<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bayraktar, 2001)</ref>, current study indicates a low positive effect of that personality type on internet addiction. Since agreeable people are generally known as introvert and shy, they may have a tendency to seek social support using the internet rather than seeking it naturally in real life. A solid body of literature focuses on the relationship between social support and IA (other findings of the study is that the developed model is valid for both face to face and distance education students. In view of the relevant literature, there appears to be no study that specifically investigates these variables in a model and analyzes their validity in different groups. Jackson and his colleagues expressed that education and income levels once had a relationship with internet usage, however, this is no longer the case<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jackson et al. 2003</ref>).</figDesc></figure>

TIPI was considered to be capable of measuring personality within 10 items through many validity studies (Denissen, et al. 2008; Ehrhart, et al. 2009; Gosling, 2012; Hofmans, Kuppens, &amp; Allik, 2008; Muck, Hell, &amp; Gosling, 2007; Soto, et al. 2011). A va riety of mea surements a nd methods were utiliz ed to assess internet addiction in the previous work (Beard, 2005; Cengizhan, 2003; Chou, Condron, &amp; Belland, 2005; Thompson, 1996; Y oung, 1 99 8). The internet addic tion sc ale including 20 items with six-level rubric was developed by young and adapted to Turkish by Bayraktar (2001) who declared a .91 Cronbach`s Alpha value. Batıgün and Hasta (2010) also maintained in their study that the internet addiction scale possesses a .90 Cronbach`s Alpha value. Data Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participants` demographic features and means of scales. Path analysis with observed variables was utilized to test the developed model at a .05 significance level. Prior to pursuing model analysis, the assumptions of the model (outlier, multicollinearity, relations between the variables and sample size) were tested. The relations among the variables were observed as linear and no variance was observed through the levels of the variables (heteroscedasticity). All the clues have maintained that the assumptions of the path analysis were provided within the data set.</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table /></figure>
