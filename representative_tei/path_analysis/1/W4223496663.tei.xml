<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Type header information here Type footer information here Purpose: Collaborative consumption (CC), a unique business model, provides several monetary and non-monetary benefits to customers. Several adapted Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) based models were developed and tested to understand this consumption behaviour with the findings inconsistent and fragmented. Thus, this study aims to develop a general and consistent TPB model using a meta-analytic path analysis to better understand customers' CC adoption behaviour.</p><p>Design/Methodology/Approach: Using 37 studies, a meta-analysis was performed adopting several analytical methods; bivariate analysis, moderation analysis, and path analysis. Findings: Our universal TPB model shows that factors, i.e. trust, attitude, perceived environmental responsibility and communication facilities drive both perceived usefulness and collaborative consumption. However, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and emotional value drive only perceived usefulness. Moderation analysis shows that the relationships between variables used in the proposed TPB model tends to vary depending on four moderators, i.e. countries' economic development level, type of collaborative consumption, sample type and survey administration method. Research Limitations: The consideration of only quantitative papers and papers written in English language in this meta-analysis may bias the study's findings. Originality/Value: By developing the universal TPB model, our study theoretically contributes to the TPB model and by conducting the moderation test, the study contextually contributes to the TPB literature in the CC context. Practical implication: Based on the findings regarding important factors that consumers consider when adopting CC, this study provides insightful recommendations to companies facilitating collaborative consumption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Collaborative consumption is a type of business model that allows sharing unused assets and resources through website-based peer to peer marketplaces, where unused products and services, such as unused goods, space, skills, or services are exchanged between different parties. Collaborative consumption is a relatively recent economic phenomenon facilitated through widespread information and communication technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Belk, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hamari, Sjöklint, &amp; Ukkonen, 2016)</ref>. It has also been defined as an economic model providing an opportunity for systematically sharing underutilised resources to obtain monetary and nonmonetary benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ianole-Călin, Francioni, Masili, Druică, &amp; Goschin, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The growth of collaborative companies is evident in the report of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">PwC (2015)</ref> where it has been predicted that the sales revenue of collaborative companies will increase from $15 billion in 2013 to $335 billion in 2025<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . Companies adopting the collaborative consumption model have substantially increased their sales revenues and become competitive threats to their counterparts using the traditional business model. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lane (2016)</ref> showed that in 2016, Airbnb, an online based shared accommodation provider adopting the collaborative consumption model, had a higher reservation rate (120%) than hotels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Zervas, Proserpio, and Byers (2017)</ref> also showed that Airbnb and other sharing accommodation providers had acquired 8-10% sales revenue of hotel companies in recent years. Similarly, Uber and other companies that provide shared transportation facilities adopting the collaborative consumption model, have contributed a significant reduction in the sales revenue of the car industry; car manufacturers, car dealers, and car distributors <ref type="bibr">(Arnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017)</ref>. Thus, because of its unique operating system and the enormous effects on the traditional business model, the concept of collaborative consumption has drawn the attention of academics and practitioners. Accordingly, a significant number of studies have been carried out on consumer decision making when participating in collaborative consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Marimon, Llach, Alonso-Almeida, &amp; Mas-Machuca, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Shao, Li, Guo, &amp; Zhang, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Stollery &amp; Jun, 2017)</ref>. In doing so, several studies have used the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explain consumers' intention to participate in collaborative consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kim, Woo, &amp; Nam, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">H. Lee, Yang, &amp; Koo, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Roos &amp; Hahn, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni, Renzi, &amp; Mattia, 2018)</ref>. These studies have modified the original TPB model to explain collaborative consumption behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kim et al., 2018)</ref>. However, constructs used in modified TPB based models to understand collaborative consumption behaviour vary across studies making findings inconsistent and fragmented. Thus, although many studies have proposed modified TPB models to understand consumers' decision making in the context of collaborative consumption, little effort has been made to develop a more general TPB model through a meta-analytic path analysis to get a better understanding of consumers' decision making around collaborative consumption. An absence of such a universal TPB based model could impede a solid understanding of the core factors driving customer collaborative consumption behaviour and ultimately inhibit designing effective marketing strategies within the collaborative consumption marketplace.</p><p>The above-mentioned research problem has inspired us to develop a universal TPB model using the meta-analytic path analysis within the collaborative consumption context. To achieve this, this study has set two objectives. The first objective is to develop a universal TPB model using a meta-analytic path analysis to gain a better understanding of collaborative consumption behaviour. The second objective is to assess the relative impact of moderators on the association between antecedents and outcome variables of this universal TPB model using the multivariate and multi-regression meta analyses.</p><p>Academically, this study makes two contributions. Firstly, this study will develop a universal TPB model to better understand collaborative consumption behaviour. Secondly, the study will investigate whether the predictive ability of TPB model differs due to moderators, also contributing to the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Overall, this study will contribute to the literature on TPB and collaborative consumption. Practically, this new TPB model will help companies facilitating collaborative consumption design marketing strategies within this marketplace.</p><p>The rest of the paper has been structured as follows. In the next section, we present the literature review, propose a TPB based model and hypothesise associations between the variables in the model, followed by the methodology section. We then present the analysis and discussion of factors within the model. Afterwards, the academic and managerial implications are stated based on the findings of this study. The paper concludes with limitations and future research directions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Application of the theory of planned behaviour to collaborative consumption research</head><p>The theory of planned behaviour, an extension of the theory of reasoned action (TRA), has been widely used in conceptualising, and empirically identifying factors driving customers' purchase intention and actual purchase relating to products and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2005)</ref>. According to TPB, three determinants; i.e. attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control drive customers' behavioural intention (e.g. purchase intention), and behavioural intention drives customers' ultimate behaviour, for example, purchase of goods and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. The first determinant affecting customers' purchase intention is attitude which, in the context of consumption, refers to a customers' beliefs regarding the desired benefits or expected drawbacks associated with purchasing and using a good or service <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2005)</ref>. The second determinant is subjective norm which, in consumption context, refers to the effect of social pressures on consumers' decision making relating to buying a good or service <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. The final determinant affecting purchase intention is perceived behavioural control referring to a customers' perceptions of facing difficulty or feeling convenient when buying and using a good or service <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>With the TPB model being widely used for predicting buying behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Roos &amp; Hahn, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni et al., 2018)</ref>, this model has been used for explaining consumers' collaborative consumption behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Marimon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Shao et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Stollery &amp; Jun, 2017)</ref>. More specifically, the TPB model has been used to predict individual buying behaviour in the case of shared accommodation, shared transport, and shared apparel 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Becker-Leifhold &amp; Iran, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lindblom, Lindblom, &amp; Wechtler, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mao &amp; Lyu, 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mohlmann, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Oyedele &amp; Simpson, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Y. Wang, Asaad, &amp; Filieri, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The collaborative consumption literature shows that the TPB model has been modified by adding or dropping variables. For example, Arteaga-Sánchez, Belda-Ruiz, Ros-Galvez, and Rosa-Garcia (2018) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crucke and Slabbinck (2019)</ref> have removed two fundamental independent variables, i.e. attitude and perceived behavioural control from the original TPB model; and added trust as a new independent variable to their TPB based conceptual model for explaining consumer collaborative consumption behaviour. The TPB model has also been modified by adding mediators which are different from the fundamental mediator (i.e. behavioural intention) proposed in TPB. For example, H. <ref type="bibr">Lee et al. (</ref> <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) incorporated a different mediator (i.e. psychological ownership) in their TPB based conceptual model to better 2 In the literature, in the context of accommodation, shared accommodation, peer to peer accommodation, and sharing accommodation have been interchangeably used to refer to collaborative consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kim et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">T.

Literature also shows that cloth sharing, shared apparels, and collaborative fashion consumption have been interchangeably used to mean collaborative consumption in the apparel context <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Iran et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Yang, Cao, &amp; Yang, 2017)</ref>. explain collaborative consumption in the context of shared transport. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Yi, Yuan, and Yoo (2020)</ref> incorporated desire as a mediator to TPB based conceptual model. Moreover, multiple mediators have been used in TPB based conceptual models to explain collaborative consumption. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barnes and Mattsson (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kim et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Existing TPB models in collaborative consumption</head><p>The Theory of Planned Behaviour has been widely used to explain collaborative consumption.</p><p>However, this theory is not without limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Sniehotta, Presseau, &amp; Araújo-Soares, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Corsini, Laurenti, Meinherz, Appio, and Mora (2019)</ref>, the core fundamental TPB model does not have sufficient and appropriate components to predict consumer behaviour satisfactorily. From a meta-analysis of 142 research studies which applied the TPB, Armitage and Conner <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref> showed that an average of only 40% variance in behavioural intentions can be predicted by the three determinants conceptualised in the TPB. Similarly, several other researchers suggest that additional constructs should be incorporated to better predict behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr">(Fielding et al. 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fielding et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shaw and Shiu 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wall et al. 2007</ref>). As such, to better explain consumer behaviour in a particular context, researchers have modified the fundamental TPB model by adding or subtracting variables.</p><p>Consistent with the argument above, researchers have modified the TPB models to better explain consumer behaviour in the context of collaborative consumption with several modified TPB models developed and tested in this marketplace. However, all these adapted models create inconsistencies in the model with little effort made to develop a generally accepted TPB model to get a better understanding of consumers' decision making around collaborative consumption. It is therefore important to develop a universal TPB model that will provide a solid and consistent understanding of factors driving customer collaborative consumption behaviour and ultimately help design effective marketing strategies in this marketplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Development of universal TPB model for predicting collaborative consumption</head><p>Based on the review of the collaborative consumption literature, seven independent variables and two outcome variables have been considered for model development, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>.

The associations between these variables are discussed in the following section focusing on hypotheses development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Hypotheses development Trust  Perceived Usefulness</head><p>In any service, customers' perceptions of trust in the service provider plays an important role in their decision to adopt the service <ref type="bibr">(Mao &amp; Lyu, 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang, Gu, &amp; Jahromi, 2019)</ref>. In the case of collaborative consumption, since customers meet with peer service providers who are mostly unknown to them, their perceptions of trust in these providers plays an important role in driving them to adopt these services. Peer service providers are those who provide collaborative services to customers (i.e. listed house owners in the case of shared accommodation, drivers in the case of shared transport, and individuals or retailers in the case of cloth sharing) <ref type="bibr">(Mao &amp; Lyu, 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Tussyadiah &amp; Park, 2018)</ref>. Developing and maintaining trust is important to reduce the perceived risks associated with the peer service providers and the services provided by them <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benoit, Baker, Bolton, Gruber, &amp; Kandampully, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lamberton, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Oyedele &amp; Simpson, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The sense of trust and fairness about service providers and their service policy helps customers enjoy a service. More specifically, when customers are confident in service quality, service environment, and service delivery, customers' perceptions of perceived usefulness increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abutaleb, El-Bassiouny, &amp; Hamed, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, in the context of collaborative consumption, it can be assumed that customers' perceptions of trust affect their sense of perceived usefulness. Based on this discussion, we expect: H1: Trust positively affects the perceived usefulness in the context of collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitude  Perceived Usefulness</head><p>In consumption contexts, attitude refers to customers' evaluations of benefits or advantages of purchasing and using goods and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Roos &amp; Hahn, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barnes and Mattsson (2017)</ref> have shown that customers give more priority to economic benefits while deciding to use car-sharing services, thus, prioritising economic benefits when developing their attitude towards such services.</p><p>When customers think they will get the desired advantages or benefits from using a product and service, they believe that the product or service suits them. For example, if environmentally conscious customers find that a product or service has a lesser impact or no impact on the environment, the customers tend to believe that the product or service is more useful to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni et al., 2018)</ref>. Similarly, in the case of collaborative consumption, if customers perceive that they will get the expected benefits from a peer service provider, then, customers' perceived usefulness of the services of that service provider will be higher. Based on this discussion, we expect: H2: A positive attitude positively affects the perceived usefulness in the context of collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Environmental Responsibility  Perceived Usefulness</head><p>Customers' perceived environmental responsibility refers to customers' beliefs about a firm's practices and policies related to sustainability and environmental protection <ref type="bibr">(Alvarado-Herrera et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sparks, Perkins &amp; Buckley, 2013)</ref>. The mass production of goods and services impacts environment contributing to a depletion of natural resources and an increase in wastages and bio-products which ultimately endanger environment and as such, today, customers consider the harmful effects of their consumption on environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Toni et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>As a result, if they believe that the consumption of a particular product or service has less environmental hazards, they consider the product or service more useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benoit et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020)</ref>, environmentally conscious customers take product or production efficiency of a product or service into consideration while evaluating a quality of product or service. If the production process for a product or service helps maximise the efficient use of natural resources and minimise the harmful effects on environment, the customers consider the product or service more useful and effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Collaborative consumption is regarded as an environment friendly or ecologically sustainable form of consumption, because in collaborative consumption, such as shared transport and shared accommodation, people share resources and products which leads to less wastage, less resource absorption and less production <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Botsman &amp; Rogers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ertz, et al., 2018)</ref>. As a result, consumers with a higher perceived environmental responsibility will have a greater perceived usefulness of collaborative consumption. Based on the preceding discussion, we expect: H3: Environmental responsibility positively affects perceived usefulness in the context of collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communication facilities  Perceived Usefulness</head><p>Companies use several media to communicate with customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ampountolas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mao &amp; Lyu, 2017b)</ref>. However, media usage varies across products and services. In the case of services, companies provide detailed information as well as attractive images and pictures of provided facilities in their websites to visualise their services to customers. These companies also provide customer reviews about their offerings on their websites to display service reliability.</p><p>Literature indicates that customers use such websites to search and choose peer service providers (i.e. providers of peer to peer accommodation, car sharing or cloth sharing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Stollery &amp; Jun, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Y. Wang et al., 2020)</ref> where customers evaluate the quality of their services based on the information provided on websites. Therefore, in the context of collaborative consumption, communication facilities (e.g., service information) affects perceived usefulness. Thus, based on the preceding discussion, we hypothesise: H4: Communication facilities positively affect perceived usefulness in the case of collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Norm  Perceived Usefulness</head><p>Individuals consider the opinions of people who are close to them or who are important to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kim et al., 2018)</ref>. Subjective norms are the expectations, attitudes, and perceptions of important people, such as family members, peers, partners and friends relating to performing or not performing a behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni et al. (2018)</ref>, subjective norms impose an external pressure on customers that instigates or prohibits a particular consumption behaviour. This perceived social pressure affects the decision of what to buy or what not to buy in order to be accepted in a social group.</p><p>Often in collaborative consumption contexts, as customers meet with service providers unfamiliar to them, they consider the suggestions and opinions of people who are close and important to them to select a service <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Poon &amp; Huang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni et al., 2018)</ref>. If these people suggest the customers to adopt and use the service, the customers believe that the service is suitable and useful to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agag, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, in the context of collaborative consumption, perceived subjective norm affects customers' perceived usefulness. Based on the preceding discussion, we hypothesise: H5: In collaborative consumption, subjective norm positively affects perceived usefulness.</p><p>Perceived Behavioural Control  Perceived Usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1991)</ref> defines perceived behavioural control (PBC) as "the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behaviour of interest" (p. 183). Accordingly, difficulties associated with purchasing and using a product often influence consumption decisions relating to the product <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kim et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020)</ref>. Customers' perceived difficulty is their perception of uncertainty, risk, and tensions associated with consuming a product or service. Compared to products, the difficulties (e.g., uncertainty, risk, and tensions) associated with consuming and using services are higher due to its unique characteristics (e.g., a lack of ownership, intangibility, and user participation). Since consuming services requires an active participation of customers, interacting with unknown service providers increases customers' perceived difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Toni et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barnes and Mattsson (2017)</ref>, perceived difficulty negatively affects perceived usefulness of using a service. That is, if customers think that the level of difficulties associated with a service is high, then their perceived usefulness of the service declines. In collaborative consumption contexts, since consumers need to meet with unknown service providers, their perceptions of difficulties associated with using the services are high, ultimately reducing their perceptions of the usefulness of the service. On the other side, if consumers are confident in overcoming the difficulties (e.g., uncertainty) associated with using peer services, they tend to feel that the services are useful. Thus, in the peer services, customers' perceived behavioural control drives customers' perceived usefulness. Based on the preceding discussion, we hypothesise: H6: In collaborative consumption, perceived behavioural control positively affects perceived usefulness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emotional Value  Perceived Usefulness</head><p>Emotional value refers to customers' need of pleasure and enjoyment when using a service.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hamari, Sjöklint, and Ukkonen (2015)</ref>, customers' need of pleasure and enjoyment affects their attitude and intention relating to adopting a service. Thus, emotional values (i.e. need of pleasure, enjoyment, and belongingness) play an important role in their decision to adopt a service. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zhang, Cui, Cheng, Zhang, and Li (2020)</ref> indicated that collaborative consumption is a pleasant and enjoyable service alternative to traditional service offerings. For example, while taking uber service (i.e. a type of collaborative consumption), customers engage in pleasant conversation with uber drivers, ultimately making a trip enjoyable and pleasant to customers. Similarly, in shared accommodation, when customers (i.e.</p><p>guests) stay at a service provider's house, they experience an enjoyable and friendly stay at the house along with a sense of belongingness to a local community when they use the accommodation. Overall, in the case of collaborative consumption, customers' emotional value (i.e. pleasure, enjoyment, and sense of belongingness) drives their perceived usefulness of a peer service. Based on the preceding discussion, we hypothesise: H7: In collaborative consumption, emotional value positively drives collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Usefulness  Collaborative Consumption</head><p>Perceived usefulness refers to customers' belief that a product or service is useful and effective in satisfying a particular need.

J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liang, Choi, &amp; Joppe, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mao &amp; Lyu, 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nisar, Hajli, Prabhakar, &amp; Dwivedi, 2019)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barnes and Mattsson (2017)</ref>, customers' perceived usefulness of a service offering drives their intention to adopt it. For example, if customers perceive that they will get the desired benefits or advantages by using a particular service, they will adopt it <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Shao et al., 2020)</ref>. Similarly, consumers decisions to adopt peer services depends on their perceived usefulness of peer services <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kim et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020)</ref>. Thus, in collaborative consumption contexts, customers' perceived usefulness of peer service drives their intention to adopt peer services. The preceding discussion leads to hypothesise: H8: In collaborative consumption, perceived usefulness positively affects collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Potential moderators</head><p>Whilst collaborative consumption behaviour has been extensively studied using the TPB models, the findings of empirical studies are inconsistent and erratic across studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kim et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020)</ref>. This inconsistency could be due to the variation in research design artefacts, such as the country where the data were collected from (developed vs developing), type of collaborative consumption (shared accommodation vs other forms of collaborative consumptions), sample size (small vs large)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> , sample type (student vs nonstudent), and the survey administration method (offline vs online). Accordingly, these factors were considered potential moderators in this study. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows the coding of the moderators. A brief explanation for the moderators and moderation hypotheses follows; &lt;Table 2 here&gt;</p></div>

Thus, findings can vary across studies conducted in different countries (Zhu, Cheng, <ref type="bibr">Wang, Ma, &amp; Jiang, 2019)</ref>. More specifically, a stronger effect is expected in research conducted in developed countries where the use of peer services is higher than developing countries. Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p></div>

For example, time and money spent on staying at shared accommodation are much higher than those associated with shared transport or shared clothing. As such, differences in service features and customer consumption processes could create different consumption experiences among customers, which ultimately create differences in research findings. More specifically, a stronger effect is expected in case of research conducted on shared accommodation than research conducted on the other forms of collaborative consumption.

Since the current study aims to develop a universal TPB model using existing findings to gain a better understanding of factors driving customer collaborative consumption behaviour, meta-analysis is deemed a suitable method for this purpose. The steps taken for the meta-analysis are described below <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gravier, Randall, and Strutton (2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection</head><p>An extensive literature search was performed to identify papers on the factors driving collaborative consumption <ref type="bibr">(McEachan, Conner, Taylor, &amp; Lawton, 2011)</ref>. Relevant papers have been identified by carefully following several delimiting conditions. The first delimiting condition was that papers be accessible via the major databases, namely ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Gale Academia OneFile, EBSCO, Research Gate, Scopus, Taylor and Francis, Emerald, JSTOR, J-Gate, ScienceOpen, Springer, Web of Science and SAGE. Several synonymous keywords-"collaborative consumption", "peer service providers", "shared consumption", "peer services", "shared accommodation", "ride sharing", "cloth sharing", "collaborative fashion consumption", "peer-to-peer accommodation", "shared transport", "shared parking", "peer to peer marketplace", "Uber", "Airbnb", and "sharing economy"were used to identify relevant papers in the databases. Accordingly, 101 papers were initially identified using these keywords. The second delimiting condition was that duplicate papers (i.e. the same paper downloaded more than once from the same or different databases) be removed from the list of papers <ref type="bibr">(Fairfield, Harrison, &amp; Wigmore, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wood, 2008)</ref> to avoid methodological inadequacies <ref type="bibr">(Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004)</ref>. As such, 33 duplicate papers were deleted from the identified papers.</p><p>The third delimiting condition was that papers selected for the meta-analysis be published in conference papers or peer-reviewed journals <ref type="bibr">(Chattopadhyay &amp; Mitra, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">McEachan et al., 2011)</ref>. Accordingly, 11 documents (e.g. Book chapters, PhD theses, and Master theses) were omitted. Only published scholarly works were considered because a) the probability of getting the representative sample of all the unpublished studies is low, b) the quality of unpublished studies is questionable because of the absence of the peerreview process, and c) the exclusion of unpublished work does not affect the findings of a metaanalysis <ref type="bibr">(Bergh et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dalton et al. 2012)</ref>. The fourth delimiting condition was that empirical papers using methods other than quantitative methods should be excluded from the list of papers resulting in 16 papers being excluded (i.e. papers using focus group discussions or in-depth interviews, review papers, and conceptual papers). The last delimiting condition was that quantitative papers not reporting correlation coefficients, or other statistical values, such as F ratios and t-statistics be excluded from the search. As such, 7 quantitative papers were excluded from the analysis. Ultimately, 34 quantitative papers were selected for the metaanalysis to analyse customer collaborative consumption behaviour.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Recording of information</head><p>A Microsoft Excel worksheet was used for recording information from the 34 shortlisted research papers and assigned unique serial numbers. Please note, in some of the papers, authors considered two different conditions and conducted two separate studies using separate samples and reported separate values for "r". For example, in his single research paper, Mohlmann (2015) conducted two separate studies paper; one for "other type of collaborative consumption" and other for "shared accommodation". Similarly, in their paper, Ianole-Călin et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) conducted two separate studies for two countries; one for "Romania" and other for "Italy". In accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zaremohzzabieh et al. (2019)</ref>, such studies were considered separate studies and assigned different serial numbers, even though they were published in a single research paper. After assigning serial numbers to all included studies, we recorded a brief information for every study, i.e. name of the author(s) with the year of publication, sample size, type of collaborative consumption, type of sample, name of the country(s) where the data were collected from, and survey administration method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Coding</head><p>To perform the meta-analytic path analysis on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, relevant variables from the selected studies were located and coded. Variables were coded based on their definition and meaning as several variables were found with different names but had similar definitions and meaning. For example, "environmental benefits" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017)</ref> and "ecological sustainability" (Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020) had different names, but these were similar in terms of their definition and meaning. Hence, these variables were considered and coded as "perceived environmental responsibility". Reliability of coding was assessed through the use of two independent coders with a 90% similarity in coding. Any conflicting issue was resolved via discussion between coders <ref type="bibr">(Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Analysis</head><p>Data analysis involved several steps. In the first step, we selected and included a total of 632 bivariate relationships relating to the constructs under study. Here, the bivariate relationship means the association between study constructs in terms of correlation coefficient or other statistical values, such as F-ratios and t-statistics. Like other meta-studies in marketing and other fields, at least three bivariate relationships were considered for each of the associations between variables in the proposed model <ref type="bibr">(Geyskens, Steenkamp, &amp; Kumar, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Henard &amp; Szymanski, 2001)</ref>. In the second step, all bivariate relationships considered for the study were converted into Fisher's z scale to calculate the random effect average correlation (r+) and confidence interval (CI) for testing the hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp; Rothstein, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sutton et al., 2000)</ref>. In the third step, a moderation analysis was carried out to assess the possible moderating effects of factors, such as sample size, type of collaborative consumption, type of sample, country of data collection, and survey administration method, on the relationship between the coded constructs and perceived usefulness, and between perceived usefulness and collaborative consumption. Finally, using SPSS 25 and AMOS 25 software, a meta-analysis structural equation modelling (MASEM) was performed to run a path analysis enabling to assess the association between the variables in the proposed model. The path analysis also enabled us to identify the goodness of model fit.</p></div>

In regards the type of sample, the non-student sample (i.e. used in 26 studies) has been used more than student sample (i.e. used in 11 studies). Similarly, as a single country, the highest number of studies has been carried out based on samples from USA (i.e. 9 studies), followed by Germany (i.e. 5 studies), South Korea (i.e. 3 studies), and China (i.e. 3 studies). Finally, regarding the survey administration method, the online method has been more widely used (i.e. used for 29 studies) than the offline method (i.e. used for 8 studies)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Publication bias</head><p>Publication bias means including studies with larger effect sizes, rather than smaller effect size <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Borenstein et al., 2011)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Bivariate analysis</head><p>We performed bivariate analysis to examine the association between the drivers, mediator (i.e. perceived usefulness), and the dependent variable (i.e. collaborative consumption). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> shows the findings (i.e. r+ with significance level, z-statistics, and range of confidence interval) of the bivariate analysis. This table also shows the value of K (i.e. number of studies reporting a particular association), N (i.e. total sample size across the studies reporting a particular association), range of correlations, and fail-safe N values.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> shows that all I 2 values are greater than 90%. According to the benchmark developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, and Altman (2003)</ref>, I 2 values below 25%, between 25% and 50%, and above 50% indicate the low, moderate, and high moderating effect on the effect sizes, respectively. Thus, the heterogeneity test suggests a strong moderating effect of the factors-country of study, type of collaborative consumption, sample size, sample type, and survey administration method-on the association between the drivers and perceived usefulness, and between perceived usefulness and collaborative consumption. Moreover, the significant T 2 values indicate variances in effect sizes (i.e. variation in correlation coefficient or other statistical values, such as F-ratios and t-statistics) across the studies. Thus, both measures (i.e.</p><p>I 2 and T 2 ) used in the heterogeneity test support the presence of moderating effects on the hypothesised relationships. 4 The study has used the equations (i and ii) to identify the degree of heterogeneity of effect sizes across the studies considered for this meta-analysis. Since the heterogeneity test suggests moderating effects, to further determine the moderating effect of each covariate on the hypothesised relationship between the variables of the proposed model, a meta-regression analysis was carried out using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (refer Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Figure 3</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> indicates that the association between TT-PU (ꞵ 1 =0.5524), PER-PU (ꞵ 1 =0.4301), CF-PU (ꞵ 1 =0.6163), and PBC-PU (ꞵ 1 =0.8374) is higher in studies that collected data from developed countries than the studies that collected data from developing countries, thereby supporting H9a, H9c, H9d, and H9f.

According to the suggestion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zaremohzzabieh et al. (2019)</ref>, the values for mean and standard deviation were set to 0 and 1 respectively during the path analysis. The results of the path analysis of the proposed TPB model have been shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The goodness of fit indices (i.e. SRMR=0.082, GFI=0.963, AGFI=0.761, CFI=0.919, RMSEA=0.165, AIC=3047.528, BIC=3338.275) of path analysis were reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> which show that Model 1 does not fit the data well. Model 1 explains only 17% variance (R 2 =0.17) in customers' collaborative consumption behaviour. Overall, the poor fit of the Model 1 suggested a revision to the model. &lt;Table 8 here&gt; &lt;Figure 4 here&gt; Model 1 was modified by adding direct paths from independent variables: trust, attitude, perceived environmental responsibility, and communication facility to the final outcome variable, collaborative consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kim et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nadeem, Juntunen, Shirazi, &amp; Hajli, 2020)</ref>. These modifications have provided us a revised model, i.e.</p><p>Model 2 (see Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Fit indices (i.e. SRMR=0.011, GFI=0.998, AGFI=0.980, CFI=0.997, RMSEA=0.045, AIC=209.332, BIC=523.033) of Model 2 reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> show a good model fit to the data. The fit indices also show that the model predictability in explaining intention to participate in collaborative consumption has increased from 17% to 31%. Overall, Model 2 has a good model fit and is suitable to explain customer collaborative consumption behaviour. Accordingly, based on Model 2, we have calculated beta weights and standard errors for the path relationship between variables of the proposed TPB model and in Table <ref type="table">9</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussions of the findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Trust</head><p>Consistent with the literature, our findings (i.e. results of bivariate analysis and MASEM) show that trust plays an important role in driving the perceived usefulness and the decision to adopt collaborative consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhang, Jahromi, and Kizildag (2018)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Mao and Lyu (2017b)</ref>. Our moderation analysis (meta-regression analysis) indicates that the association between trust and perceived usefulness is stronger among customers in developed countries than those in developing countries, a finding consistent with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barnes and Mattsson (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Roos and Hahn (2017)</ref> but contradicting that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pappas (2019)</ref>. Furthermore, this association is stronger for studies on shared accommodation than those on other forms of collaborative consumption thereby contradicting those reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Iran et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">J.-K. Liang, Eccarius, &amp; Lu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lindblom et al., 2018)</ref>. Our moderation analysis also suggests that this association is stronger for studies that considered non-student samples than studies using student samples. This may be due to non-students, for example mature customers, being comparatively more concerned about the service reliability and safety of shared services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Attitude</head><p>Confirming the findings reported in the literature <ref type="bibr">(Hwang &amp; Griffiths, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Iran et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mohlmann, 2015)</ref>, the analysis suggests that customers' attitudes (e.g., perceived financial benefits or any perceived expectations) drive perceived usefulness and intention to participate in collaborative consumption. Furthermore, the moderation analysis indicates that the association between customers' attitude and their perceived usefulness is stronger among customers in developing countries than in developed countries. An explanation of this might be because customers in developing countries prioritise economic benefits when adopting collaborative consumption, a finding consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Boateng, Kosiba, &amp; Okoe, 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ianole-Călin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Shao et al., 2020)</ref>. Also, this association is stronger for shared accommodation because of lengthy use and sizable costs involved with shared accommodation. Further, this association is higher in non-student samples than student samples mainly because of the former's obligations for several expenses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Perceived environmental responsibility</head><p>Consistent with the literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Botsman &amp; Rogers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ertz, Durif, Lecompte, &amp; Boivin, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020)</ref>, our findings show that customers' perceived environmental responsibility enhances both their perceived usefulness, and intention to adopt collaborative consumption. However, the moderation analysis suggests that the association between perceived environmental responsibility and perceived usefulness is stronger in developed countries than developing countries. Further, this association is stronger in other forms of collaborative consumption. Reasons to this scenario may include customers' concerns about environmental pollution as well as natural resource depletion when using a large number of vehicles and brand-new apparels. Our findings also show that this association is stronger in non-student samples than student samples, and this finding is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ampountolas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">H. Lee et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Communication facilities</head><p>Consistent with the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ampountolas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mao &amp; Lyu, 2017b)</ref>, our findings suggest that communication facilities drive customers' perceived usefulness and their intention to adopt collaborative consumption. However, our moderation analysis shows that the association between communication facilities and perceived usefulness is stronger in developed countries than developing countries, and this finding is supported by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ampountolas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Laurenti &amp; Acuña, 2020)</ref>. This may be because communication facilities are well advanced in developed countries compared to developing countries, and therefore, customers in developed countries rely more on the information available on company websites when deciding to use peer services. Further, this association is stronger in shared accommodation than the other forms of collaborative consumption possibly because customers give more importance to communication facilities while searching for and adopting shared accommodation due to high cost and time involved with shared accommodation stay.</p><p>Moreover, our moderation analysis shows that this association is higher in non-student samples than student samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Subjective Norm</head><p>Consistent with the literature, our findings show that subjective norms drive customers' perceived usefulness of collaborative consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kim et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni et al., 2018)</ref>. The moderation analysis indicates that this influence is stronger in the context of both developing countries and shared accommodation. Customers in developing countries give more importance to others' views and opinions when forming their own attitudes towards products, and further when deciding to stay in shared accommodation, customers seek the suggestions and opinions of their friends and family members who have already used shared accommodation. Our moderation analysis also suggests that students or young people strongly consider the opinions or suggestions of their peer groups while developing their perceptions and adoption intention relating to peer services. Through social media sites, young customers seek suggestions and opinions about peer services and accordingly they develop their own perceptions of these services, a finding consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Toni et al. (2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Perceived behavioural control</head><p>As reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes and Mattsson (2017)</ref>, the findings of our meta-analysis show that customers' perceived behavioural control drives their perceived usefulness of collaborative consumption. However, the moderation analysis shows the association between perceived behavioural control and perceived usefulness is stronger in developed countries than developing countries possibly because customers in developed countries are more concerned about safety and security when adopting collaborative consumption. The moderation analysis also suggests that this association is stronger in shared accommodation contexts than the other forms of collaborative consumption because of the higher costs and lengthy use involved with shared accommodation. Further, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nisar et al. (2019)</ref>, our moderation analysis suggests that this association is stronger in non-students than students possibly because nonstudents, for example, mature customers are more concerned about safety and reliability when using the services of peer service providers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Emotional value</head><p>Consistent with literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hamari et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019)</ref>, this study shows that customers' perceived emotional value drives their perceived usefulness of collaborative consumption. However, the association between emotional value and perceived usefulness is stronger in developing countries than developed countries. This finding is consistent with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zhang et al. (2020)</ref>. Our findings also show that this association is stronger in the context of shared accommodation than other forms of collaborative consumption potentially because customers consider hedonic values, such as sense of belongingness, developing friendships, and the other forms of pleasure, when using shared accommodation. Moreover, the association between these constructs is stronger in student samples than non-student samples possibly because students give more importance to hedonic benefits when using collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Perceived usefulness</head><p>Our meta-analysis shows that customers' perceived usefulness drives their adoption of collaborative consumption, consistent with the findings reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnes &amp; Mattsson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mao &amp; Lyu, 2017a)</ref>. However, the moderation analysis suggests that this association is stronger in developing countries than developed countries. Possible reason to this scenario may be customers living in developing countries consider collaborative consumption an effective service option to meet both utilitarian and hedonic needs due to its low cost and wider availability. The moderation analysis also shows that the association between these constructs is stronger in shared accommodation context than the other forms of accommodation because of more use and low cost involved with shared accommodation. Further, this effect is higher in non-student samples than in student samples mainly because non-students use collaborative consumption for both utilitarian and hedonic purposes due to its low cost and wider availability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Academic and Managerial Implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Academic Implications</head><p>This study contributes to the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the literature on collaborative consumption in multiple ways. First, although previous studies have used modified TPB models to understand collaborative consumption, no effort has been made to develop a generally accepted TPB model using a meta-analysis approach. Accordingly, we have reviewed and analysed the TPB-based literature within collaborative consumption to develop a universal TPB-based model using MASEM, which is a contribution to the TPB in the context of collaborative consumption. Second, in the previous studies, the findings on the predictors of collaborative consumption are inconsistent. However, this study has provided the generally accepted findings on factors affecting collaborative consumption. More specifically, this universal TPB based model incorporates all variables reported in the literature on collaborative consumption, thereby providing a core model to assess TPB in the context of this marketplace.</p><p>Third, in addition to developing the model, this study has examined the moderating effect of research design artefacts on the relationship between variables in the proposed TPB based model. As such, this study has identified the moderating effect of factors-country of study, type of collaborative consumption, sample size, sample type, and survey administration method-on the relationship between variables of the proposed TPB based model. More specifically, our study shows that the associations between variables in the proposed TPB based model vary in different moderating conditions, for example, in case of moderating effect of country of study, the associations between variables vary between developing countries and developed countries.</p><p>Overall, our study provides a clear picture of collaborative consumption behaviour by developing a universal TPB based model that shows the decision-making mechanism for adopting collaborative consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Managerial implications</head><p>Based on the meta-analysis of the factors affecting collaborative consumption, this study provides several insightful recommendations to peer service providers. These recommendations are elaborated below.</p><p>Our findings show that trust enhances both perceived usefulness and adoption intention for collaborative consumption, thus, it is recommended that peer service providers highlight their service quality and service reliability when designing and promoting their services. For example, they can post highly positive and amazing guest experiences and travel stories on their websites, and official social media pages to build customer trust. It is especially important that peer service companies targeting customers in developed countries give more importance to ensuring safety in service delivery and service environment. It is also suggested that compared to companies providing other forms of collaborative consumption, companies providing shared accommodation put more focus to enhance customer trust and perceived certainty of their services. Moreover, trust, service quality, and services reliability are more influencing factors for non-student customers than student customers, it is therefore recommended that peer service companies give more importance to trust building, service quality and service reliability when targeting non-student customers.</p><p>Our findings suggest that attitudes primarily focused on economic benefits drive both the perceived usefulness and adoption intention of peer services. Hence, it is recommended that peer service providers emphasise the economic benefits when designing their offerings and marketing strategies. For example, they may provide competitive prices to customers or highlight in their communication campaigns that they provide greater facilities and benefits to justify the prices they charge. Further, economic benefits are more important to the customers in developing countries than those in developed countries, thus, developing countries-based peer service providers are recommended to give more importance to the economic benefits.</p><p>Also, the findings suggest that economic benefits are more important in shared accommodation contexts than other forms of collaborative consumption, accordingly, it is advised that shared accommodation providers adopt competitive pricing strategies. In addition, economic benefits are comparatively more important for non-student or mature customers than student customers, thus, peer services providers are recommended to offer economic benefits mainly to nonstudent customers.</p><p>As the findings showed that communication facilities trigger both perceived usefulness and adoption intention of collaborative consumption, it is recommended that peer service providers use well-designed websites with sufficient information on service offerings along with attractive images and pictures of offered services. In addition to official websites, social media platforms and blogs can be used for the promotion where customers can share their experiences and write reviews. As customers in developed countries give more consideration to communication facilities, peer service companies targeting customers in developed countries are recommended to give more importance to these aspects when designing their communication campaigns. It is also recommended that compared to companies providing the other forms of collaborative consumption, those facilitating shared accommodation put a special emphasis on these communication facilities and design attractive and informative websites. Moreover, compared to young customers, when targeting mature customers, peer service companies should concentrate more on providing these communication facilities to take a competitive advantage in the mature age customer segment.</p><p>Our findings showed that customers' perceived environmental responsibility enhances both their perceived usefulness and intention to adopt collaborative consumption. Thus, it is suggested that in communication campaigns, websites and social media platforms, peer service providers promote their facilities as environment friendly and highlight that their services instil sustainable consumption by reducing the depletion of resources, wastage of resources and energy, and emission of carbon-dioxides and other harmful gases. This is more so in developed countries because such countries-based customers give more consideration to environmentalfriendly initiatives when deciding to adopt peer services. It is also recommended that companies offering other peer services, such as shared clothing and shared transport, give more importance to such communication strategies than shared accommodation providers. For example, shared transport companies can post documentaries or videos on company websites and social media platforms featuring how their services reduce environmental pollution.</p><p>Further, compared to young customers, when targeting mature customers, peer service providers should emphasise environmental sustainability aspects to promote their services.</p><p>It is important that peer service providers concentrate on incorporating more emotional and hedonic aspects into their service offerings by displaying an enjoyable, and pleasant service usage experience to their customers. It is especially important that peer service companies targeting customers in developing countries give more importance to hedonic aspects when designing and promoting service offerings. Our findings also recommend that it is more important to satisfy customers' emotional needs in the shared accommodation contexts than other forms of peer services. Accordingly, to fulfil the emotional needs in shared accommodation context, these companies could consider providing spacious and wellfurnished dining rooms, large lounges, and recreation facilities e.g., home theatre and indoor game facilities. Further, hedonic aspects are more appealing for young customers, therefore, peer service companies are recommended to put more focus on hedonic aspects when targeting young customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Limitation and Future research directions</head><p>This study is not without limitations. The first limitation is that in this study, we included papers written only in English language, potentially causing the possibility of researching relevant papers published in other languages. The second limitation is that this study is based on the findings of quantitative studies only; thus, the exclusion of qualitative studies might have caused a biasness in the findings.</p><p>This meta-analysis proposes some insightful directions for future research. First, this study has developed a universal TPB-based model to understand collaborative consumption. Future meta-studies can be conducted to develop a generally accepted model based on different theories to better understand customer collaborative consumption behaviour. Second, future meta-study can be carried out to investigate differences in customer adoption behaviour in various sectors of collaborative consumption, such as shared accommodation, shared transport, and shared clothing. That is, similar meta-study can be replicated in the different sectors of collaborative consumption, and the findings can be compared between them. Finally, in future meta-studies, researchers can introduce time frame as a moderator to examine differences in customers' collaborative consumption behaviour over time. Such a study will help understand the changes in factors driving collaborative consumption behaviour in different time periods.
