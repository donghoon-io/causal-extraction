<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Soil C:N:P stoichiometry plays a vital role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems, but its importance to P transformation in paddy soil remains unclear. We investigated the effect of soil C: N:P stoichiometry on P mobility and uptake under long-term fertilization. Three treatments, CK (no fertilization), NPK (inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilization) and NPKM (combined inorganic NPK fertilizer and manure application), were selected from two long-term experiments of paddy soil that were initiated in 1991 and 1982 in Chongqing and Suining, respectively. The results showed that in comparison the control treatment, under long-term fertilization, soil pH decreased. In comparison with the NPK and CK treatments, the NPKM treatment significantly increased soil nutrient contents, P uptake and phosphatase activities. In comparison to the CK treatment, the NPK and NPKM treatments significantly decreased soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratios. In comparison to NPK and CK treatments, the NPKM treatment decreased residual-P at both sites. Compared with CK treatment, the NPKM treatments increased labile-P and moderately labile-P by 987% and 144%, respectively, and NPK treatment increased these factors by 823% and 125%, respectively, at the Chongqing site. At the Suining site, with NPKM treatment, increases in labile-P and moderately labile-P were 706% and 73%, respectively, and with NPK treatment, the increases were 529% and 47%, respectively. In contrast, non-labile-P was significantly decreased with NPKM treatment in comparison to that with NPK and CK treatments. Moreover, increases in soil C:N and C:P ratios decreased the labile-P pools and increased non-labile-P pools. A path analysis indicated that soil C:N:P stoichiometry indirectly controlled P uptake by directly affecting P transformation from non-labile to labile-P pools. Moreover, the non-</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Crop productivity is directly affected by P availability in agricultural soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, in some agricultural soils, the concentration of total P is naturally high, which can limit plant growth due to the low solubility and rapid conversion of P compounds to unavailable or poorly available P after fertilizer application <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A synthetic chemical fertilizer application can ensure sufficient availability of P for plant uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, there has been growing confirmation that long-term excessive application of inorganic P fertilizers decreases P use efficiency that may result in excessive accumulation of P in soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.Specifically, in intensive cultivation areas, during surface runoff or erosion the P-rich soil particles may reach surface water and cause eutrophication <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>The excessive use of inorganic fertilizers could be reduced by animal and green manure application in fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Organic amendments can increase the P recovery in soil by decreasing the formation of irreversible adsorption complexes in soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> or by increasing the P mobility in soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Additionally, organic amendments not only provide macronutrients and micronutrients, but also improve soil physical and chemical properties by increasing SOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, in practice the rate of manure addition to fields is mostly calculated based on N input rates, which may cause excessive P addition with manure, especially under long-term fertilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Therefore, the combined application of inorganic fertilizers and manure could be beneficial to increasing the efficiency of applied P and thus improving crop productivity. The arable land in the Chongqing and the Suining (southern China) are mainly paddy soils, which are mostly cultivated under rice based cropping systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Paddy soils, especially in the southern regions of China, are inherently low in available P due to acidification. Therefore, to meet plant P requirements, excessive inorganic fertilization is a common practice in these regions, which causes environmental P losses and degraded soil fertility <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In these regions, previous studies mainly focused on long-term fertilization effect on crop yields and soil fertility <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, and recommended, integrated nutrient management through the combination of applying inorganic fertilizer and manure addition to improve soil P fertility <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Most existing studies have clearly shown that the combined application of inorganic and manure increases the availability of P and crop yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, but the mechanism that causes the redistribution of residual-P under long-term fertilization in paddy soils is not well studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. There could be many factors regulating P in paddy soil under long-term fertilization. In a previous study, Ahmed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> found that the combined application of manure and inorganic fertilizers increased the labile-P fraction, and different soil properties (pH, SOM, total P and Olsen-P) showed different relationships with P fractions, however, the authors did not explain the mechanism of P pools transformation, mobility and uptake in paddy soils associated with soil nutrient stoichiometry. One of the most important factors for P mobility in paddy soil could be soil nutrient stoichiometry, coupling and interactions of the C, N and P cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In recent years, great progress related to C:N:P stoichiometry in terrestrial ecosystems with focuses on microorganisms, plant leaves and litter, has been made <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Therefore, C:N:P stoichiometry could be used as a powerful tool to understand nutrient cycling and processes in soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Tian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> also reported that soil C:N:P stoichiometry could be a potential indicator for assessing soil nutrient status during soil development. However, the impact of soil C:N:P stoichiometry on P cycling, especially in paddy soil, is poorly understood.</p><p>The phosphorus that is applied to soil goes through many complex transformations (desorption-adsorption and dissolution-precipitation) controlled by soil properties such as pH, SOM and exchangeable iron-aluminum (Fe-Al) hydroxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. The sequential procedure of P extraction developed by Hedley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, extracts the different fractions of P that is bound with complex organic and inorganic compounds using solutions of different strengths for the P extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The Hedley method of P fractionation is one of the comprehensive methods that is used to investigate the dynamics of P lability and the P cycle in soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. However, the sequential procedure of P fractionation alone does not provide insight into the transformation of P pools affected by different treatments and soil factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Path analysis could be used as a valuable tool to investigate the interrelationship between soil P pools in different soils and management practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil nutrient stoichiometry on P pool transformation and P mobility in paddy soil after long-term fertilization using a structural equation modeling (SEM) pathway technique.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design and site description</head><p>In this study, we selected two sites from long-term experiments located in Chongqing ( <ref type="formula">1062</ref>4'33"E, 29˚48'36"N) and Suining (105˚03'26"E, 30˚10'50"N) that were initiated in 1991 and 1981, respectively. These experimental sites belong to national public welfare research institutions. Research at these experiment sites was carried out with the permission of the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Agricultural Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, as cooperative research agreements were signed with these experimental sites. Climate at the Chongqing site is subtropical, and the climate at the Suining site is subtropical humid. The initial soil physical and chemical properties and climatic conditions of the experimental sites are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Soils in both sites are Purple-Udic Cambisols according to Chinese soil classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The cropping systems at both sites were rice-wheat double cropping systems. Hybrid indica rice was planted in the rice season at both sites, and we used data from only the rice season. Treatments at both sites were arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. Each plot was separated by permanent cemented ridges. In this study, the three selected treatments were common at both sites. The treatments included no fertilization (CK), inorganic fertilization (NPK) and inorganic fertilizer plus manure (NPKM). The rates of fertilization are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. The chemical fertilizers applied at both sites were urea for N, calcium superphosphate for P and potassium sulfate for K. In the NPKM treatment, a half dose of the fertilizers was applied from an inorganic fertilizes, and the remaining half dose of nutrients was supplemented with pig fecal urine at the Chongqing site and fresh pig manure at the Suining site based on N content. The remaining P and K application rates were adjusted by inorganic fertilizers. In both experiments, phosphorus fertilizer and manure were applied as a basal fertilization before transplantation of the seedlings, and half of the N and K fertilizers were applied as a basal application. The remaining half were dressed in two splits at the tillering and panicle initiation stages of the crop. The nutrient content of the pig manure was 0.2% N, 0.17% P 2 O 5 , and 0.1% K 2 O, and the nutrient content of the pig fecal urine was 1.1% N, 0.9% P 2 O 5 , and 0.4% K 2 O experiment. The rice seedlings were transplanted in the middle of May, and the crop was harvested at the end of August at full maturity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling and chemical analysis</head><p>After crop harvest, plant samples were air dried, and the yield was measured and the total P content in the plant samples was measured after oven drying at 60˚C to calculate the P uptake. Soil samples were collected in the first week after the rice harvest in 2017. Composite soil samples were collected at a 0-20 cm soil depth from four randomly selected locations in each replicate block of treatments. Subsamples from each composite sample were stored at 4˚C to prevent the moisture losses and to determine phosphatase activities within a week of sampling. Apart from the composite samples, the other samples were air dried and sieved &lt; 2 mm to determine the soil chemical properties. Soil pH was determined in suspensions of water: soil (2.5: 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Conventional routine methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> were used to analyze the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The wet oxidation method was used to determine SOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and the Kjeldahl digestion-distillation method was used to determine soil total N. Soil total P was measured by the molybdenum blue colorimetric method using a HClO 4 -H 2 SO 4 solution for digestion. Mineral N, also known as alkali hydrolysable N, was determined according to Lu <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and available P was measured according to Olsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Except for the refrigerated sample, the soil moisture contents of the samples were measured by oven drying at 105˚C for 24 h before processing the soil samples for enzyme activities. The activities of acid phosphomonoesterase (AcP) and phosphodiesterase (PD) were determined according to Tabatabai <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The substrate solution used for AcP was p-nitrophenyl phosphate and the pH of the buffer solution was 6.5. The substrate solution used for PD was bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and the pH of the buffer solution was 8. The activities of Acp and PD were expressed as mg p-nitrophenol kg -1 soil h -1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phosphorus fractionation</head><p>Organic and inorganic fractions of soil phosphorus were determined using the Hedley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> fractionation method modified by Tiessen and Moir <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Briefly, the soil samples were divided into three replicates each of 1 g soil and sequential extraction procedure was carried out as follows: NaHCO 3 -P was extracted by continuous shaking for 16 h after adding 0.5M NaHCO 3 at pH 8.5 in 1 g soil. Then, shaking continued with 0.1M NaOH for 16 h to extract NaOH-P in solution. Next, shaking was continued with 1 M HCL for 16 consecutive hours to obtain diluted HCl-P and then heated with 10 ml of concentrated HCl at 80˚C in a water bath for 10 minutes after adding 5 ml 12M HCl, a final volume of 50 ml was made with deionized water to obtain concentrated HCl-P (conc. HCl-P). Finally, to obtain residual-P, the residual soil samples were mineralized by adding 300 μl of concentrated H 2 SO 4 in each soil sample of 30 mg followed by heating at 350˚C for 3 h. The tubes were centrifuged at 25,000×g and 4˚C for 10 minutes between two consecutive steps. The supernatant was passed through 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate filters, and extra soil particles were recovered by washing filters with extracted solution used in the following steps. Both organic and inorganic P (by taking the difference between total P after digestion with persulfate and inorganic P by colorimetry) levels were determined by measuring with 0.5 M NaHCO 3 , 0.1 NaOH and 12 M HCl extracts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>The soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratios were calculated from SOC, total N and total P. We used oneway ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test at the P = 0.05 level for each variable to evaluate the significant differences among the different treatment means <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The main effects of the fertilizer treatments, sites and their interactions were evaluated by two-way ANOVA. To determine the relationship between soil C:N:P stoichiometry and the P pools, linear regression analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Redundancy analysis (RDA) and variance partitioning analysis were performed using Canoco (version 5.0) software. Structure equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical procedure to determine the direct and indirect effects and estimates the partial contribution of explanatory variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. We used SEM to explore the hypothesized linkage among C:N:P stoichiometry, P pools and P uptake using the AMOS package with SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between soil C:N:P stoichiometry and phosphorus mobility</head><p>The results from the linear regression showed that the soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratios were negatively correlated with labile-P and moderately labile-P pools (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The C:N ratio had a highly significant (P � 0.05) positive correlation (R 2 = 0.73) with non-labile-P. The soil C:P and N:P ratios had a weak correlation with soil non-labile-P pool. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed the effect of soil C:N:P stoichiometry on P fractions (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Non-labile-P fractions especially residual-P, showed a close relationship with the N:P and C:P ratios, while, HCl conc-P i and HCl conc-P o showed a strong positive relation with the C:N ratio. RDA-1 explained 55% of the total variation, and RDA-2 explained 8.6% of the total variation.</p><p>The variance portioning analysis (VPA) showed that soil properties, soil C:N:P stoichiometry and phosphatase totally explained 97.5% of the variation in the soil P fraction distribution (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Soil properties included soil pH, SOM, total N, total P, and soil C:N:P stoichiometry (C:N, C:P and N:P ratios), and phosphatase activities included AcP and PD. Out of total variance the soil properties, soil C:N:P stoichiometry and phosphatase explained 30.3, 4.9 and 4.6% of the total variation, respectively, indicating the relative dominance of soil properties as a major factor.</p><p>We also investigated the direct, indirect and total effects of soil C:N:P stoichiometry on P pools and P uptake by a SEM pathway analysis (Fig 9A <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref>). The results showed that at the Chongqing site, SEM explained 99, 95, 90 and 99% of the variance in labile-P, moderately labile-P, non-labile-P and P uptake, respectively. N:P stoichiometry explained that the C:N and C:P ratios directly affected the non-labile P pool and indirectly affected the moderately labile and labile-P pools (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9A</ref>). However, the C:N, C:P and N:P ratios indirectly affected P uptake by directly influencing P pools. Non-labile and labile-P both directly influenced P uptake, while moderately labile-P indirectly affected P uptake by directly affecting labile-P. At the Suining site, SEM explained 99, 99, 89 and 99% of the variance in labile-P, moderately labile-P, non-labile-P and P uptake, respectively. C:N, C:P and N:P ratios directly affected non-labile and moderately labile-P and indirectly affected labile-P (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref>). However, P uptake was directly affected only by labile-P. Non-labile had no significant effect on moderately labile-P, but moderately labile-P had a direct effect on labile-P and an indirect effect on P uptake.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of long-term fertilization on soil properties, soil C:N:P stoichiometry and enzyme activities</head><p>Long-term inorganic and organic fertilizer application significantly influence soil properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. In this study, we found a significant (P � 0.05) effect of long-term chemical fertilizer and manure application on soil chemical properties (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) that affected soil C:N:P stoichiometry and enzyme activities. In this study, soil pH was significantly decreased by long-term chemical fertilization. Our results are consistent with those of Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and Cui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, who investigated the long-term effects of organic and inorganic fertilization on soil acidification and found that the soils receiving different rates of chemical fertilizer inputs showed accumulation of exchangeable acidity and a reduction in soil pH. Soil pH may also influenced by the removal of base cations from soil with long-term cultivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Some studies have suggested that long-term manure application may increase the soil pH due to alkalinity of manure <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, a result is consistent with our results. In comparison with no fertilization and inorganic fertilization, long-term fertilization, especially combined application of NPK plus manure, highly increased SOM (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). These results were also supported by the results of previous studies under long-term fertilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. As a long-term combined application of manure and inorganic fertilizer enhances the productivity, an increase in carbon input in soil is also expected because it is a key driver of increased SOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. The results were also consistent with findings of Ladha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, who found that long-term fertilization increases the soil organic matter, especially in paddy soil, due to a slower decomposition of SOM under flooded conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. However, due to different soil properties, the SOM content in both soils was significantly  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). SOM and nutrient availability are directly affected by fertilizer management <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. In our study, the long-term combined application of inorganic fertilizer and manure also significantly increased the total and available N and P in at both experimental sites (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The increases in nutrient availability with a continuous manure addition were observed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, and this increase could be due to the contribution of nutrient reserves in SOM-rich soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>In comparison with no fertilization, long-term addition of chemical fertilization and manure in paddy soils changed the soil C:N:P stoichiometry (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Surplus P accumulation in paddy soil under long-term combined inorganic fertilizer and manure application decreased the soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratio in the NPKM treatment in comparison with the inorganic fertilization and no fertilization treatments. This result was also due to the low supply of N and P in the CK and NPK treatments. Previous studies have also suggested that land-use changes such as cultivation practices and long-term fertilization may produce soil nutrient stoichiometric shifts, especially in paddy soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. In our study, in both soils, the C:N and C:P ratios in the topsoil (0-20 cm) were approximately similar to the average ratios for China (12.3 and 52.7, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and to global average ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The N:P ratio in our results was lower than those found by Wojciech et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> in a forestland and by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> in subtropical wetlands in China. In another study, an N:P ratio similar to our results was reported by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> during the afforestation on loess Plateau of China. Regardless of the treatments, the overall lower N:P may be due to the higher solubility of N than of P and the consequently higher losses of N than of P due to continuous flooding <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. In addition, a lower N:P ratio under long-term combined application of inorganic fertilizer and manure supports the hypothesis of a more productive ecosystem with high P accumulation and a lower N:P ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Enzyme activities play a vital role in the biochemical reactions of C, N and P cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> and have different responses to different type of fertilization, soil and environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. The changes in soil nutrient availability and stoichiometry under different types of long-term fertilization changed phosphatase activities (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In both soils, the highest activities AcP and PD were found in combined inorganic and manure application treatment (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), which might be due to long-term manure addition and high C inputs compared with those in the NPK and CK treatments. Nayak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> also suggested that phosphatase activities increased by increasing soil organic matter. In another study Ohm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> also found positive relationship between soil carbon and phosphatase activities. Therefore, studying phosphatase activities could be helpful to understand the lability of P under long-term fertilization regulated by soil C:N:P stoichiometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phosphorus fractions, uptake and its relationship with soil C:N:P stoichiometry</head><p>Long-term fertilization significantly influenced P fractions distribution (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) and P uptake (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The changes in P fractions could be associated with soil properties. Many studies have explained the effect of soil pH, SOM, and P input rates on P fractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. In our results, in contrast to previous studies, in comparison to no fertilization, long-term combined application of inorganic fertilizers and manure greatly increased the inorganic and organic fractions of P, except for the concentrated HCl organic and inorganic fractions of P (HCl conc-P i and HCl conc-P o ) and residual-P (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Yan <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> found that soil inorganic P fractions significantly increased following long-term inorganic fertilization but no corresponding differences were found in organic P fractions. In comparison to no fertilization, both the NPK and NPKM treatments decreased residual-P by increasing the labile-P. Because continuous manure application increased the lability of P by increasing both organic and inorganic fractions in labile pool which decrease the residual-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The P characteristics of organic material may also influence soil P content. For example, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> reported that in comparison to chemical fertilization, pig manure contained higher P KCl content, therefore, the major available proportion of P in pig manure could be H 2 O-P or NaHCO 3 -P, which is readily available P for P uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> Similarly, in our results, in comparison with inorganic and no fertilization, longterm combined application of inorganic fertilizer plus manure significantly increased P uptake in rice crops more by increasing the labile-P pool due to long-term manure addition (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Our results are also consistent with results from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Dobermann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> also found that P application with or without manure increased the soluble inorganic P fractions with little or no effect on residual-P. Different studies have reported that, soil containing high organic C content showed less P sorption and retention capacities for P <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, which indicates the high P availability for uptake.</p><p>Soil nutrient stoichiometry is more complex than in plants in the response to nutrient availability, because nutrient mobility in soil is influenced by both fertilization and plant uptake. In our results, soil C:N:P stoichiometry influenced P pools in paddy soils (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Many studies have reported poor P fertility in flooded soil conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. However, there could be many soil and environmental factors that control the P mobility in soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, but most important factor controlling P mobility in paddy soil could be soil C:N:P stoichiometry. Because under long-term fertilization, the increase in carbon inputs by long-term combined inorganic fertilizer and manure addition shift the nutrient cycling in cropland, the decoupling of soil C:N:P in previous studies is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, however, the effect of soil C:N:P stoichiometry on P lability specially in paddy soil has not been studied before. The negative relationship of C:N and C:P ratios with labile-P and the positive relationship of C:N and C:P ratios with non-labile-P (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) indicate that long-term manure addition increased carbon input <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and increased the non-labile fractions of P in paddy soils. The non-labile-P fractions contained organic P with different characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>, which could be increased by long-term manure addition. Lehmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> also reported that organic amendments mainly increase the organic fractions of P. In another study, Gonza ´lez Jime ´nez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> also found that organic soils contained relatively higher concentrations of labile and non-labile organic proportion of P. Moreover, some studies have explained that manure addition in paddy soil decrease the decomposition rate of organic matter, especially under flooded conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, which may affect the P release mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Therefore, in the present study high C:N and C:P ratios showed negative relationship with labile-P.</p><p>The SEM showed that soil C:N:P stoichiometry indirectly affected the P uptake by controlling P transformation and mobility in paddy soils (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>). In a previous study, Gonza ´lez Jime</p><p>´nez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> explained the pathways of P pools. However, to our knowledge no study before explained the soil C:N:P stoichiometric effect on P mobility in paddy soils by using pathway analysis. The C:N and C:P ratios directly affected the non-labile-P, possibly due to high carbon input under long-term manure addition. Soil organic matter and soil total P could be the main factors affecting P mobility in paddy soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Labile-P had a direct effect on P uptake (Fig 9A <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref>), because a labile-P pool is the sum of the all readily available P fractions, which have a direct effect on P uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>.The indirect effect of the soil N:P ratio on P uptake could be due to a positive direct effect of the N:P ratio on moderately labile-P. Previous studies have explained the synergistic effect of N on P uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. N application also affects P uptake by increasing biomass production and soil carbon inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Interestingly, at the Chongqing site, non-labile-P had a direct effect on P uptake, and at the Suining site, non-labile-P had an indirect effect on P uptake (Fig 9B ), because the soil P at the Chongqing site was relatively higher than that at the Suining site, which directly affected P uptake. These results are consistent with the results of previous studies, for example, in a path analysis study by Gonza ´lez Jime ´nez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, soil residual-P directly affected the labile-P and therefore, increased the P uptake. In this study we found that the soil C:N:P stoichiometry controlled P lability in paddy soil. Therefore, our results emphasized the significance of soil C:N:P stoichiometric effect on P mobility and uptake in paddy soil. SEM explained the unique relationship between soil C:N:P stoichiometry and P mobility in paddy soils affected by long-term fertilization, and it could be helpful to understand the mechanism of P transformation in paddy soil affected by soil C, N and P cycle interaction. It also could be helpful to manage soil P fertility by understanding the mechanism of P mobility under long-term fertilization in paddy soils of the Chongqing and the Suining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We concluded that in comparison with no fertilization and chemical fertilization, long-term combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers significantly increased soil total and available nutrient content. In comparison to the CK and NPK treatments, the NPKM treatment significantly increased phosphatase activities in both soils. The soil C:N and C:P ratios was highest in the CK treatment, and no significant difference was observed between the NPK and NPKM treatments for the C:N ratio at both sites. While, the lowest soil C:P and N:P ratios were observed in the NPKM treatment at both sites. The NPKM treatment significantly increased P mobility and uptake, and reduced residual-P at both sites via increasing SOM. SEM pathways provided new insights into P lability mediated by the soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratios. The C:N, C:P and N:P ratios had a direct effect on moderately labile-P and non-labile-P, thus indirectly affecting mobile-P and P uptake. The soil organic matter and soil P content at the Chongqing site were relatively higher than those at the Suining site. Therefore, non-labile-P at the Chongqing site directly affected P uptake, and at the Suining site indirectly affected P uptake, indicating that soil C and P were two most important driving factors of P lability in paddy soil. Our findings suggest that soil nutrient stoichiometry is very important for managing the soil P fertility in paddy soil under long-term fertilization in these regions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
