<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Path analysis applied to sequential chemical fractionation of Hedley may improve our understanding on the linkage between P forms and its availability in soils. In this work, we assessed the role of Hedley-P fractions in buffering Resin-P (a plant-available soil P index) in a very clayey Oxisol (720 g kg -1 clay) and the validity of the postulated causal models for two long-term (23-yr) tillage systems (conventional-CT and no-till-NT) by path analysis. The model that accounted for the path from the less labile organic and inorganic P fractions to more labile ones, and from these fractions to the Resin-P showed the highest p value in NT (p = 0.36) and CT (p = 0.05), showing that the proposed models are a plausible representation of the tested causal relationships. These models explained 75 and 93% of Resin-P (U = 0.25 and 0.07) in CT and NT systems, respectively. The buffering flux of organic fractions was more pronounced in NT. However, the organic P pool has a higher direct contribution to buffer Resin-P in CT (94%) than in NT (35%), due to higher mineralization of organic P forms with moderate lability caused by soil disturbance. On the other hand, in the long-term NT, moderate inorganic P showed a high contribution to directly buffer Resin-P (40%). Although inorganic P associated with Ca is a very small fraction of P in strongly weathered soils, the path analysis showed that this fraction was a direct source of P in both soil tillage systems, but it was more important in NT (16.7%) than in CT (1.9%). Residual organic and inorganic P fraction were neither a sink nor a source of P in both tillage systems. The path analysis showed to be an important tool to interpret the results obtained in sequential chemical fractionation of P, improving our understanding of the soil P dynamics in contrasting tillage systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Phosphorus (P) is considered one of the nutrients that most limits crop yields in tropical and subtropical environments, where large amounts of phosphate fertilizers are annually applied to crop fields to overcome this problem. However, sources of phosphate fertilizers are limited and the maximum exploitation capacity of P reserves is expected for the next decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cordell et al., 2009)</ref>. Moreover, high P input levels in agriculture triggers environmental problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cassidy et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sharma et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zafar et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, the knowledge of soil P dynamics is essential to develop good practices to ensure the maximum fertilizer efficiency.</p><p>One of the most widespread techniques to evaluate soil P dynamics is the sequential chemical fractionation proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hedley et al. (1982)</ref>, which provides information on both the lability and the nature of soil P. P fractionation methodology may be adapted to the most diverse laboratory conditions, has low cost, requires a small amount of samples and may be performed with a relatively large set of samples and/or repeats <ref type="bibr">(do Nascimento et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Hedley fractionation has provided great advances in the understanding of the soil P dynamics, but its interpretation has often been limited to individual comparisons of each form of P between treatments, depths, sampling periods, or comparisons by exploratory multivariate analyzes, such as principal component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gatiboni et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gatiboni et al., , 2007;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guardini et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Herlihy and McGrath, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Huang et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maltais-Landry et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Negassa and Leinweber, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Schmitt et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Teles et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yang and Post, 2011)</ref>. On the other hand, some studies have shown the potential of path analysis to provided a better understanding of interactions between Hedley P fractions in soils of differing pedogenesis in United States of America <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tiessen et al., 1984)</ref>, in nonfertilized and fertilized system in Peru <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beck and Sanchez, 1994)</ref>, in different crop rotation systems and nutrient sources (mineral fertilizer and liquid dairy manure) in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zheng et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zheng et al., , 2002))</ref>, in a wide range of unfertilized soil types under different land use systems in tropical regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gama-Rodrigues et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sales et al., 2015)</ref>, in Eucalyptus plantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Costa et al., 2016)</ref> and in cacao agroforests <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aleixo et al., 2016)</ref> in Brazil. Accordingly, path analysis allows to distinguish functional pools and identify processes of P transformation in the soil between pools based on a source-sink relationship. However, so far, path analysis has not been used to evaluate these relationships in contrasting soil tillage systems.</p><p>Therefore, we used data from previous studies that limited their discussion to individual comparisons of each soil P form between tillage systems (no tillage -NT, and conventional tillage -CT) <ref type="bibr">(Tiecher et al., 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Tiecher et al., , 2012b))</ref>. This study aimed to evaluate the links between the Resin-P (a plant-available soil P index) and the other Hedley-P fractions and to use the postulated causal models obtained by path analysis for a better understanding of soil P dynamics in a very clayey Oxisol from Southern Brazil managed for 23-yrs in NT and CT.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data source</head><p>This study was based on a dataset of organic and inorganic soil P forms published by <ref type="bibr">Tiecher et al. (2012a,b)</ref>, which are presented in the Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The P forms were obtained from the sequential chemical fractionation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hedley (1982)</ref>: inorganic labile P extracted by anion exchange resin (Resin-P); labile organic (Po BIC ) and inorganic (Pi BIC ) P extracted by NaHCO 3 0.5 mol L -1 at pH 8.5; moderately labile organic (Po HID-0.1 ) and inorganic (Pi HID-0.1 ) P extracted by NaOH 0.1 mol L -1 ; moderately labile inorganic (Pi HCl ) P extracted by HCl 1.0 mol L -1 ; poorly labile organic (Po HID-0.5 ) and inorganic (Pi HID-0.5 ) P extracted by NaOH 0.5 mol L -1 ; and nonlabile residual organic (Po RESIDUAL ) inorganic (Pi RESIDUAL ) P. Data of P fractions comprised three soil layers (0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm) from conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, totaling 18 samples per soil layer and per soil tillage system (total n per system = 54). Summer crops received fertilizer every year and the total amount of P applied during 23 years was 659 kg P ha -1 in the form of inorganic soluble phosphate. Moreover, during this period, lime was applied six times for a total of 11.5 Mg ha -1 (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.0 Mg ha -1 of lime (dolomite) in all <ref type="bibr">plots, in 1989, 1992, 1995,1999, 2001 and 2006, respectively)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Building path analysis models</head><p>Path analysis was used in causal test models to explain the contribution of Hedley P fractions to buffer the Resin-P, which is a soil index that estimates the plant-available P. Despite to be only an index, the Resin-P has a strong relationship with P availability to the crops, and it is taking into account in the fertilization programs of the most regions of Brazil (CQFS-RS/SC, 2016). In the analysis, we used the d-separation approach (Shipley 2000), in which a set of independent relations among the variables included in the model were defined for each proposed causal model by linking P fractions to the Resin-P and their combinations with each other. Each of these independent relationships involved correlations and partial correlations that were tested by permutation (Manly 2007).</p><p>Each causal model generated a value of probability for a composite statistic (C of Fisher's statistic; Shipley 2000), which was tested using the χ 2 probability distribution. A valid causal model must have p-value greater than an acceptable probability threshold (p&gt;0.05). For a valid model, regression models were used to determine the path coefficients and corresponding probabilities, found by permutation (Manly 2007), in addition to a non-determination coefficient.</p><p>The variables (responses and factors) were centralized and standardized for the unit of variance and, therefore, the path coefficients (β) were compared between the models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Potential contribution of each P form to buffer Resin-P</head><p>The potential contribution of each Hedley P form to buffer the Resin-P (a plant-available soil P index) was estimated by multiplying the average concentration of each P form in the 0-20 cm soil layer (in mg kg -1 ) by its path coefficient (β) whenever it was significant at p&lt;0.1 (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Then, the relative contribution of each source was calculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Building path analysis models</head><p>We proposed causal models linking the organic and inorganic P fractions to the Resin-P (a plant-available soil P index) in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Other causal models were postulated (not shown) testing inverse paths between P fractions, considering the possibilities that Resin-P could be source to some P-fractions and accounting paths from more labile organic and inorganic P fractions to less labile fractions (data not shown). However, but the p-values were below the limit to validate these models (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>The model that accounted for the path from the less labile organic and inorganic P fractions to more labile ones, and from these fractions to the Resin-P (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) showed the highest p value in NT (p = 0.36) and CT (p = 0.05). These values are above the critical limit, showing that the proposed model is a plausible representation of the tested causal relationships, providing reliable information about the P dynamics in the soil. In CT, 75% of Resin-P was explained by the variables used in the model (U = 0.25), reaching 93% in NT system (U = 0.07) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Effect of soil tillage on plant-available soil P index</head><p>The path analysis highlighted the differences of P dynamics in different soil tillage systems (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In both tillage systems, it is evident that the Resin-P is the smallest P fraction. This is due to the high clay content in the soil (720 g kg -1 ), which is composed by 14% of iron oxides <ref type="bibr">(Tiecher et al., 2012a)</ref>, resulting in high adsorption capacity <ref type="bibr">(Fink et al., 2016a)</ref>. Nevertheless, P availability is higher in no-tilled soil and the content of Resin-P is very close to the critical level for grain production (20 mg kg -1 ) according to the Commission of Soil Chemistry and Fertility of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina States (CQFS-RS/SC, 2016).</p><p>On the other hand, in conventionally tilled soil, the P availability is classified as low (8.8 mg kg -1 , Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In CT, soil plowing expose adsorption sites and intensify decomposition of soil organic matter increasing adsorption of P by ligand exchange in comparison to NT soil <ref type="bibr">(Fink et al., 2016a, b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Potential of different P forms to buffer Resin-P</head><p>Plant-available soil P index (Resin-P) is the result of interaction of organic and inorganic fractions of different lability. According to the path analysis, in both tillage systems, Resin-P was directly buffered (p&lt;0.1) by the more labile P fractions, extracted by NaHCO 3 (organic -Po BIC ; and inorganic -Pi BIC ), and the moderately labile P inorganic fraction extracted by HCl (P HCl ) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The influence of soil tillage system on P availability can be observed in moderately labile fractions, where Resin-P was direct buffered by inorganic P extracted by NaOH 0.1 mol L -1 (Pi HID-0.1 ) in NT and by organic P extracted by NaOH 0.1 mol L -1 (Po HID-0.1 ) in CT. The other fractions contributed indirectly to the Resin-P, buffering those that had a direct influence.</p><p>Among the organic P fractions, Po BIC contributed more intensely to buffer Resin-P in NT ( = 0.70) than in CT ( = 0.32) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Besides, in both tillage systems, moderately labile (Po HID-0.1 ) and poorly labile (Po HID-0.5 ) organic P fractions buffered the organic labile fraction (Po BIC ). However, the buffering flux of organic fractions was more pronounced in NT, as indicated by -values [Po HID-0.5 ( = 0.83) → Po HID-0.1 ( = 0.77) → Po BIC ], than in CT [Po HID-0.5 ( = 0.26) → Po HID-0.1 ( = 0.39) → Po BIC ]. These results indicated that the biological reactions of the P cycle are favored in this strongly weathered Oxisol managed in NT, where a large amount of crop residues is deposited on the soil surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pavinato et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rodrigues et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Teles et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In NT, Po HID-0.5 and Po HID-0.1 seems to have no direct influence on the Resin-P (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>However, in CT the Po HID-0.1 directly buffer the Resin-P (p = 0.05). Possibly, this occurs because in soil management systems with intensive physical disturbance by plowing and disc harrowing, such as CT, the more oxidative environment favor organic matter decomposition, exposing adsorption sites of P mainly in iron oxide surfaces. Therefore, the P from soil solution tends to be adsorbed with greater avidity by iron oxides, reducing Resin-P content. Moreover, soil disturbance may induce mineralization of organic P forms with moderate lability (Po HID-0.1 ) further buffering Resin-P fraction (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>Path analysis reveal that Pi BIC had similar importance to maintain the level of Resin-P in NT ( = 0.56) and CT ( = 0.60) systems (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Nevertheless, the influence of inorganic P pool to maintain the Resin-P is higher in NT system compared to CT. Resin-P in NT soil was more buffered by inorganic fractions of moderate lability, such as Pi HID-0.1 ( = 0.44) and Pi HCl ( = 0.93), while in CT only Pi HCl fraction contributed directly but with lower intensity ( = 0.35).</p><p>For NT soil, all labile and moderately labile inorganic P fractions show a significant path to Resin-P (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In CT system, however, only the Pi BIC and Pi HCl pool were directly related to Resin-P. Despite a significant continuous buffering among inorganic P fractions in both tillage systems, the buffering flux of inorganic fractions was more pronounced in NT, as indicated by values [Pi HID-0.5 ( = 0.40) → Pi HID-0.1 → ( = 0.70) Pi BIC ], than in CT [Pi HID-0.5 ( = 0.33) → Pi HID-0.1 ( = 0.55) → Pi BIC ]. These results shows that in NT soil the inorganic P cycle is also favored in comparison to CT soil, probably due to the due to the lower exposition of adsorption sites in the undisturbed soil <ref type="bibr">(Fink et al., 2016b)</ref> and its enrichment with organic matter from top soil layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Conceição et al., 2013)</ref>, which competes with phosphate by adsorption sites <ref type="bibr">(Fink et al., 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>Pi HCl extracts inorganic P associated with Ca, which is considered moderately labile fraction in acid soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Liu et al., 2004)</ref>. This fraction is normally very small in acid soils.</p><p>However, the frequent application of fertilizer and lime in this experiment may result in P concentrations in the region under influence of the diffusion of soil-fertilizer reaction products higher enough for the neoformation of secondary Ca phosphates <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rheinheimer and Anghinoni, 2001)</ref>. The path analysis shows that this fraction was a source of P in this soil, especially under NT system ( = 0.93), and less important when soil was plowed in CT ( = 0.35). This result is in agreement with previous study that Pi HCl is a buffer of Resin-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guo et al., 2000)</ref>, but it contrast with many previous studies in Southern Brazil that consider this fraction as recalcitrant or of low availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gatiboni et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pavinato et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rheinheimer and Anghinoni, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The organic (Po RESIDUAL ) and inorganic (Pi RESIDUAL ) residual fractions were neither a sink nor a source of P in both soil tillage systems. Nevertheless, these were the greatest P-pool in this soil. Although there is some evidences that residual P can be used by plants under limited P conditions with low dry matter yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gatiboni et al., 2007)</ref> or by the reduction of the P-oxides complex under anaerobic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gonçalves and Meurer, 2009)</ref>, this fraction is usually considered as of very low availability (or not available) to plants and soil microorganisms. Due to its significant size, some authors highlights that a sustainable strategy to better use the P in the soil is to growth plants that are efficient to acquire P from more recalcitrant forms, such as residual P, or to improve P use efficiency of the crops through breeding (van de <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wiel et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Considering path coefficients () and the size of P fractions, we may estimate the relative contribution of each fraction to buffer plant-available P (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In NT soil, 65% of the relative contribution was originated from inorganic fractions (8% from labile Pi and 57% from moderately labile Pi), and the remaining 35% was buffered by labile organic P (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In CT, the plant-available P was mainly buffered by organic fractions (84% from moderately labile and 10% from labile Po), and only 6% was buffered by inorganic fractions (4% from moderately labile Pi e 2% from labile Pi).</p><p>These results indicate that in CT soil, the mineralization of Po was the main pool buffering the plant-available P (94%). When soil is frequently disturbed there is a greater exposure of the sorption sites, and the inorganic colloids act as a drain competing with plants by inorganic P <ref type="bibr">(Fink et al., 2016b)</ref>. In NT, there is a balance between the organic and inorganic fractions buffering the plant-available P (35% Po and 65% Pi). Although there is less P interacting directly with the plant-available P in NT (47.1 mg kg -1 ) compared to CT (77.3 mg kg -1 ) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), the P availability was greater in NT due the more pronounced continuous buffering flux existing among inorganic and organic P fractions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>Links between Resin-P (a plant-available soil P index ) and the organic and inorganic Hedley-P fractions were evaluated using path analysis in a very clayey Oxisol managed for 23 years in NT and CT systems. Results indicate that the biological reactions of the soil P cycle are favored in long-term of NT, but the organic P pool have a higher direct contribution to Resin-P in CT soil. Exposition of adsorption sites resulting from the physical disturbance of soil and more intensive decomposition of organic matter in conventionally-tilled soil reduces Resin-P, inducing mineralization of organic P forms with moderate lability (Po HID-0.1 ) to buffer Resin-P fraction. On the other hand, the enrichment the soil surface layers with organic matter and the lesser exposition of adsorption sites on mineral surfaces, both due to the no soil disturbance in no-tilled soil, increase the contribution of moderately labile inorganic P to buffer Resin-P.</p><p>Although inorganic P associated with Ca is a very small fraction of P in strongly weathered soils, the path analysis showed that this fraction was a direct source of P in both soil tillage systems, but it was more important in NT. Residual organic and inorganic P fraction were neither a sink nor a source of P in both tillage systems. Finally, there is greater balance in contribution of organic and inorganic fractions buffering the plant-available P in conservative soil tillage systems, and this may explain the higher Resin-P content in NT compared to CT.</p></div>		</body>
