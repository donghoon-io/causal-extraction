<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research examines the relationship between motivational factors, job performance, employee engagement and the impact of motivational factors on job performance function of employee engagement as a mediator in the government sector in the Sultanate of Oman. A quantitative study methodology was used, and six hypotheses were evaluated using 111 representative government employees from the Ministry of Education. This study is a pilot test. This study uses quota sampling, and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and path analysis techniques were used for the analysis. The study's findings indicate that these factors have a favorable association, that motivational factors have significant positive relationships with employee engagement and job performance, and that employee engagement acts as a partial mediator in the relationship between motivational factors and job performance. This study is critical for leaders and regulators interested in enhancing job performance in Oman's public sector. This is one of the few studies on the mediating function of employee engagement in the link between motivational variables and job performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This is the first research of its kind in Oman for the public sector. Other motivational variables could be examined and evaluated in the private sector in Future research.</p><p>Keywords: motivational factors, job performance, employee engagement, government sector in the Sultanate of Oman Performance in the institutional context is a major factor in managing employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(June &amp; Mahmood, 2011)</ref> and has become a critical element in an enterprise's performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahmad et al., 2018)</ref>. Enhancing workforce success through effective communication and motivating strategies is a primary objective of the institution's leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ahmed et al., 2016)</ref>. Employee success is critical to achieving an organization's purpose and business objectives and employee efficiency is a critical factor in an institution's growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(June et al., 2013)</ref>. To reach these goals, the company's regulatory authority implements numerous strategies and practices to optimize efficiency under a variety of operational environments and to achieve the best possible results for the organization by relying on the efforts of employees <ref type="bibr">(Ahmed et al., 2016)</ref>. Key workers are vital to achieving targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mohamed et al., 2020)</ref>. Improved efficiency results in decreased organizational challenges. Employees are an institution's most valuable commodity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Detienne et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown a clear correlation between job satisfaction and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Anitha, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">e.g., Gorgievski et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dajani, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ismail et al., 2019)</ref>. Several studies have shown that interaction improves outcomes. Without regard for work success, organizations would be unable to energies and motivate employees for target accomplishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dess et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ghaffari et al., 2017)</ref>. Psychologists believe that as companies place a higher premium on employee success by motivation and engagement, they would be well equipped to motivate people to achieve goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aarabi et al., 2013)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Detienne et al. (2020)</ref>, communicating the optimistic value of tasks as a motivating resource to engage employees is significantly more effective than discussing the negative consequences of an incomplete job, and framing tasks and jobs in terms of rewards significantly increases their expected attractiveness and inner drive.</p><p>Work output is described and interpreted differently in science and industrial fields. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lawler and Porter (1967)</ref> described job performance as the contribution of an individual's abilities, skills, and effort to a particular situation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bernardin and Beatty (1984)</ref> described job performance as a database of a work process's or activity's outputs over a specified period. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hunter (1986)</ref> described job output as the result of an employee's Labour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Campbell (1990)</ref> described job success as the actions or behaviors that contribute to the achievement of the company's objectives and employee success as the consolidated financial or nonfinancial contribution added by employees to the accomplishment of the business's goals both internally and externally. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Borman and Motowidlo (1993)</ref> described job performance as having three critical components: (a) defined in terms of behavior rather than consequences, (b) limited to tasks critical to the institution's goals, and (c) being a multidimensional concept. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Viswesvaran and Ones (2000)</ref> described job performance as the adaptive actions, behaviors, and outcomes that employees participate in or bring about that contribute to the achievement of institutional objectives. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Price (2001)</ref>, employee output is an individual's good alignment with their work. Performance is the monetary worth of a person's or team's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Reynoldsa et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Griffin (2007)</ref> described job output as the number of activities and behaviors performed by employees. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pushpakumari (2008)</ref> described job output as an application of the principle of effort to the worker's mission. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Addair et al., (2019)</ref> described job success as the value that workers bring to the organization that employs them. An individual's job success is measured by the degree to which duties and responsibilities are performed. The number of jobs and the nature of the work are the two primary factors to remember when determining job results <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Reynoldsa et al, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Addair et al., (2019)</ref> described job performance as all employees' activities and practices that may influence the recruiting institution's outcomes. Job output can be described as the behavior of employees that affects the institution's outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Jalalkamali et al., 2016)</ref>. Employee success is a complex and nuanced phenomenon in contemporary society, formed by the network of shared values, roles, and aspirations through cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Aliekperova, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Numerous factors affect job results, including the person and the work climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Tripathy, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tamkin (2005)</ref> asserted that collaboration would improve job efficiency. Outstanding skills and preparation result in an increase in organizational success <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Misra, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Searle et al. (2001)</ref> contended that social assistance would help workers perform better. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">George (2000)</ref> claimed that emotional intelligence is a factor in work success. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ghaffari et al. (2017)</ref>, work efficiency improved as a result of the following factors: pay, fringe benefits, monitoring, advancement, accountability, and preparation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aarabi et al. (2013)</ref> said career performance variables include compensation, job protection, advancement, freedom, a comfortable work climate, and preparation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dajani (2015)</ref> discovered that the factors of leadership, organizational fairness, wages and rewards, work practices and processes, and preparation all had an impact on job efficiency. Numerous hypotheses address human desires, like Herzberg's two-factor hypothesis, Vroom's expectancy theory, and Maslow's desire theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ghaffari et al., 2017)</ref>. This analysis aims to determine the connection between job performance and motivating factors <ref type="bibr">(training and compensation)</ref>. This research investigates the functions of employee engagement as a moderator in the partnership between training, compensation, and work performance. This study has focused on the government sector in the Sultanate of Oman, and the case study was the Ministry of Education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem of the Study</head><p>Many countries and organizations worldwide have faced economic challenges as a consequence of low job performance. According to a survey conducted by Blue Cross Blue Shield, depression diagnoses among millennials and teenagers are growing at a faster pace than in any previous generation. In any event, the condition is estimated to cost $44 billion annually in lost productivity in the United States alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Detienne et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In reality, Oman still struggles with job performance in the government sector. There are currently no reliable performance metrics in the public sector. Whatever mechanism is used, whether institutional or human, performance is low <ref type="bibr">(Orabi, 2020)</ref>. Diversifying the economy and increasing the national GDP will be impossible unless government units improve their performance <ref type="bibr">(Orabi, 2020)</ref>. Implementing efforts and programs to improve performance in the government sector is critical <ref type="bibr">(Almatani, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>This study is intended to build a more in-depth view of training and compensation as motivation that impacts workplace performance in the context of the Sultanate of Oman government sector using the Ministry of Education as a case study. Decision makers in the Sultanate of Oman's government sector may benefit from this research in terms of developing policies and methods to inspire and encourage their employees to continue achieving organizational goals.</p><p>In addition, the present research extends knowledge and better understanding of the link between motivation and performance through the mediating function of employee engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature and Hypotheses Development</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Government sector in the Sultanate of Oman</head><p>The Sultanate of Oman is an Arab Muslim country in western Asia located on the Arabian Peninsula. It has a total population of roughly 4.6 million people, of which only 58% are Omanis, and the rest are foreigners. The Sultanate of Oman is classified as a Sultanate with a middle-range income. Oman's revenues are based on oil and gas as the principal sources of income. In 2019, almost 2.4 million people were employed in Oman. The Sultanate of Oman comprises 15 authorities and 23 ministries, all of which are governed by labor legislation (National Centre for Statistics and Information [NCSI], 2019).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivational Factors and Employee Engagement</head><p>There are several motivational factors. Training and compensation will be studied in this research as motivational factors. Training is an essential part of employee performance because it allows workers to focus on the most important aspects of their job <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dajani, 2015)</ref>. Training and education may be used as a motivation to encourage employee development and improve personal employment goals by fulfilling fundamental human needs such as the desire for stability, teamwork, and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Khan, 2012)</ref>. The findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Oyovwe et al., (2021)</ref> revealed a substantial association between training and work performance. Additionally, quality training will reduce learning durations, encourage training transfer to the workplace, and increase workers' enthusiasm to transmit training results to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garavan et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Compensation can be a huge motivator for leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Rasheed et al., 2016)</ref>. The authors found that poor earnings contribute to stress. Compensation is the primary measure of motivation since people often accomplish more than they expect in exchange for their efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bao &amp; Nizam, 2015)</ref>. In reality, "compensation" encompasses both monetary and nonmonetary rewards. <ref type="bibr">Swapna and Narayanamma (2019)</ref> investigated the influence of monetary and nonmonetary incentives on employee performance and satisfaction. They discovered that top-level employees are more satisfied and perform better with nonmonetary incentives, but lower-level employees are more satisfied and perform better with monetary incentives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Oetomo et al. (2020)</ref> found compensation had a substantial influence on employee anxiety; compensation had a substantial influence on job performance, and anxiety had a substantial influence on job performance. Therefore, hypotheses 1 and 2 (H1 &amp; H2) are as follows:</p><p>H1: There is a significant relationship between training and job performance.</p><p>H2: There is a significant relationship between compensation and job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employee Engagement and Job Performance</head><p>When employees are engaged, they recruit and combine various aspects of their cognitive and psychological self to transform their job tasks and special interactions into concrete accomplishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Byrne, 2014)</ref>. Unlike disengaged employees, those with a high level of involvement are enthusiastic about their employment, focused on their professions, and demonstrate their dedication to their organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ismail et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Parker and Griffin (2011)</ref> demonstrated that organizational commitment results in increased job performance by fostering constructive emotions and increasing passion for finishing work assignments and responsibilities. Employee motivation clearly affects job outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stairs &amp; Galpin, 2009)</ref>. Evidence-based research showed that worker involvement directly impacts job success <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ismail et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gorgievski et al. (2010)</ref>, for example, used a multidimensional analysis to examine the relationship between employee involvement and achievement among 54 Dutch educators. They discovered a positive bond. This result is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gorgievski et al. (2010)</ref>, who evaluated 2,162 staff over 1.5 years and discovered that employee conduct has a significant impact on the project and qualitative results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Anitha (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ismail et al. (2019)</ref> reiterated their findings of the close association between employee motivation and work success. Many previous studies have found a direct correlation between employee motivation and job success because dedicated employees are expected to perform more than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Demerouti &amp; Cropanzano, 2010)</ref>. Therefore hypothesis 3 (H3) is as follows:</p><p>H3: There is a significant relationship between employee engagement and job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivational Factors and Employee Engagement</head><p>The Motivating elements of training and compensation vary. Because of its beneficial correlation with employee performance, the notion of training has grown in prominence within human resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baker &amp; Asiimwe, 2014)</ref>. Training is a component of capacity development in any business that aims to boost employee performance, enhance employee engagement, and help the business to accomplish its goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Tahir et al., 2014)</ref>. Staff training typically results in a long-term shift in employee behavior in the form of greater productivity. Training is primarily focused on the development and enhancement of workers' experience and competencies that eventually contribute to work performance through increased employee engagement. Training is a critical component in increasing employee engagement. When workers get enough training on how to control their tension at work or home, they become more effective and engaged in their work. Training has a tremendous impact on an organization's employee engagement. Thus, by offering the appropriate training, employee engagement may be favorably impacted <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Azeem et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sendawula et al., (2018)</ref> found a strong association between training and employee engagement.</p><p>Compensation has a critical role in employee engagement. It offers both monetary and nonmonetary rewards, including recognition and benefits such as worker support services, free eating facilities, transit coupons, flexible work hours, and longer vacations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Anitha, 2014)</ref>. When workers are happy with their payment and recognition inside their firm, the majority of workers react with high engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Saks, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dajani (2015)</ref> indicated that a lack of adequate financial incentives might potentially result in burnout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Zacher et al. (2015)</ref> confirmed that compensation has a significant positive influence on employee engagement. Therefore, hypotheses 4 and 5 (H4 &amp; H5) are as follows:</p><p>H4: There is a significant relationship between training and employee engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5:</head><p>There is a significant relationship between compensation and employee engagement.</p><p>Additionally, organizations use a variety of resources to foster interaction to maintain efficiency and improve outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dajani, 2015)</ref>. Employee commitment results in increased workplace success by eliciting optimistic emotions and increasing enthusiasm for job duties and responsibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ismail et al., 2019)</ref>. When workers are happy with their pay and recognition within their company, most employees react with a high commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Saks, 2006)</ref>. Economic incentives hugely impact workers' productivity and success <ref type="bibr">(Swapna &amp; Narayanamma, 2019)</ref>. Numerous companies have used cash incentives to motivate and retain staff as well as to increase their efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Woodruffe, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cappelli, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Mehrzi, &amp; Singh, 2016)</ref>. Many companies use cash incentives as a tool to boost workforce satisfaction and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hongal et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The commitment benefit is the greatest potential benefit to an organization as it directly impacts how employees do their duties and results in increased engagement in a supportive work climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dajani, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahakwa et al., 2021)</ref>. Leaders may make a significant contribution to fostering a healthy work climate that increases employee motivation and results in improved job efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kahn, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">May et al., 2004)</ref>. The job climate is a significant motivator and includes "working environments, tools available to them, and administrators' ethical behavior" <ref type="bibr">(Rasheed et al., 2016, p. 109)</ref>. By maintaining an appropriate work climate, job efficiency may be improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Shah et al., 2010)</ref>. Employees become invested as they feel secure in the leadership and encouraging environment at work. These both contribute to mental and emotional protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Koyuncu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">May et al., 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dajani (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ahmed et al. (2016)</ref> confirmed the mediating effect of employee engagement between training, compensation, and job performance. Therefore, hypothesis 6 (H6) is as follows: H6: Employee engagement mediates the relationship between motivational factors and job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual framework</head><p>This study hypothesized that job performance as a dependent variable has significant relationships with employee engagement and motivational factors. The conceptual model also has employee engagement as a mediator. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the conceptual framework of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Research Framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>This paper used a causal descriptive quantitative analysis approach based on a summary of the literature. Descriptive statistics are used to describe conclusions, precisely how workers interpret the actions under investigation, while causal statistics are used to illustrate the causal model of variables. SPSS and path analysis techniques were used for the analysis. Path mapping is often used to describe both primary and indirect partnerships <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Riduwan, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population</head><p>A population is a group of anticipated participants to whom the researcher seeks to generalize the research's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Shepherd et al., 2017)</ref>. This study was a pilot test. The population for this study is the present workers of the Ministry of Education. These government workers will be operationally defined as those who work in a ministry and have completed the 1-year work experience requirement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling methods</head><p>"Sampling" refers to the process of selecting an acceptable quantity of correct things from a population <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Sekaran &amp; Bougie, 2010)</ref>. The sampling technique used to identify participants in this study was quota sampling, which often permits the author to exercise very limited control over the survey's selectivity, allowing the research to eliminate bias during the selection step. This study's quota was determined by the number of Ministry of Education workers with 1 year of work experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>The total number of participants was 111 employees. <ref type="bibr">Krejci and Morgan (1970)</ref> served as a guide for establishing an appropriate sample size for the study population that ended up being 111 individuals. The sample size is 111 workers, using the Krejcie-Morgan formula. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hair et al. (2010)</ref> proposed that a minimum of 100 responders be analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity</head><p>Content validity, also known as face validity, is a subjective assessment of the degree of connection between the scale's items and its theoretical explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. The current research examines content validity by analyzing how well the items assessed covered all parts of the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability</head><p>"Reliability" refers to the degree to which a measurement remains consistent over time, or the duration of time during which results may be replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bryman, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">George and Mallery's (2010)</ref> "rules of thumb" were used to assess these analytic results. The outcomes of the study's reliability evaluation that included employee engagement, work performance, and motivating factors, are presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.8. The findings of the investigation indicated that the instrument was appropriate for this study. The researcher determined what things will be used. Cronbach's Alpha values of &gt; 0.8 were found for employee engagement, motivating variables, and work performance, indicating the measurement's strong and positive correlation. This research applied the questionnaire procedure through which surveys are distributed and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref> shows that their relevance assessment is used to evaluate whether the mediation of employee engagement exists in the relationship between job performance and motivational factors. In conclusion, job performance is impacted by motivating variables that operate indirectly (This collaborates to maintain H4 &amp; H5.), and the impact predicted is (β = 0.2686).</p><p>There are also typical error and confidence intervals to bootstrap from the starting point. The indirect impact has a b-value ranging between 0.1243 and 0.4410. A 0 (indicating a positive indirect impact) and is not included in this scale because it shows anticipated results. Employee engagement is a factor that connects the things that motivate people and their work performance; this collaborates to maintain H6.  <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) with a case study at the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, who found there was a significant and positive relationship between motivations and job performance. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Anitha (2014)</ref> found there was a significant and positive relationship between engagement and job performance. Similar to the findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aguenza et al (2018)</ref>, research showed that when there is a link between a person's interests and their motivation, engagement is likely Additional empirical evidence for the claim that motivation has a strong effect on work performance has been found <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ghaffari et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The conclusions of this research confirm that the mediator may affect the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Because these variables have a role in predicting work performance, this study predicts that employee engagement is a partial mediator for motivational variables and overall work success, as confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dajani (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ahmed et al. (2016)</ref>. Motivation is so powerful is affects both work performance and employee engagement. Additionally, this implies that the employee's work performance, as well as directing practices, may assist managers in including motivational aspects that may be reinforced and fueled by employee involvement.</p><p>This work has some limitations; the data collected do not include all layers of government.</p><p>Common technique bias cannot be eliminated because the data used in this research were gathered at a single moment in time from a single source; nevertheless, potential research could gather repeated sampling from the same population periodically over a prolonged period.</p><p>Overall, this research outcome confirmed from all aspects a strong connection among motivational factors, employee engagement, and job performance for employees in the government sector of the Sultanate of Oman. A manager who implements the dimension of motivational factors will increase job performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations for future research</head><p>The purpose of this study was to examine two motivating factors: training and remuneration and their link to job performance and employee engagement. There is little research on employee engagement's mediating effect. Further research may be conducted to examine other motivating variables.

Every query was created using a Likert scale (1 -6). This study spread 130 questionnaires and collected 111 useable responses. This indicates the institution's labor demographic.

Found that employee engagement is linked to employee motivation (training and compensation). With substantial research evidence supporting the claim, it can be confirmed that employee engagement is favorably influenced by motivating variables (β = 0.435, SE = 0.121, p = 0.00) that collaborate to maintain H1 and H2. Results have shown that job performance is influenced positively by motivating variables β = -0.085, SE = 0.127, p = 0.00) that collaborate to maintain H3, and results have shown that job performance is influenced positively by employee engagement (β = 0.734, SE = 0.072, p = 0.00) in the government sector in the Sultanate of Oman. This supports H4 and H5. </p></div>			</div>
