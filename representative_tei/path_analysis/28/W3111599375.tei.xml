<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To support school physical education, United States (US) national organizations in medicine, health, and education recommend that schools adopt comprehensive school physical activity programmes (CSPAPs). An important factor in successful CSPAP implementation is the involvement of the school principal. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between principals' self-reported CSPAP involvement and their social-ecological-based perceptions about CSPAPs. We analysed survey responses from a national sample of principals in the US who indicated their school had a CSPAP (n ¼ 198). Exploratory structural equation modelling supported a single-factor solution for CSPAP involvement (12 items) and three social-ecological factors, which we labelled 'intrapersonal' (nine items mainly focused on expected outcomes of CSPAPs), 'interpersonal' (five items focused on parents' and teachers' support of the CSPAP), and 'environmental' (12 items focused on the support of the overall school environment, the community surrounding the school, and public policy for the CSPAP). Path analysis showed involvement factor scores are predicted by intrapersonal factor scores, which, in turn, are predicted by interpersonal and environmental factor scores. The results of this study are helpful in identifying targets for future research and practice related to CSPAP implementation and can inform efforts to prepare and support principals with respect to their CSPAP involvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the United States (US), the Physical Activity (PA) Guidelines for Americans (US Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), 2018) recommend that children and adolescents ages 6-17 should accumulate at least 60 minutes of mostly moderate-to-vigorous PA each day, as this can lead to health benefits such as healthy bones and muscles, improved muscular strength and endurance, reduced development of chronic disease risk factors, improved self-esteem, and reduced stress and anxiety (Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2018). Unfortunately, approximately three quarters of children and adolescents in the US are not meeting this benchmark for daily PA participation <ref type="bibr">(National Physical Activity Plan Alliance, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, children spend 80-93% of their waking hours in sedentary time <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Turner et al., 2014)</ref> and it is estimated that the majority of school-aged youth are not meeting national content standards in physical education <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hastie, 2017)</ref>. National organizations (e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2011; Institute of Medicine (IOM), 2013 (now named the National Academy of Medicine); Society of Health and Physical Educators (SHAPE) <ref type="bibr">America, 2015)</ref> suggest that schools should be a key focus of intervention efforts when attempting to increase and promote youth PA engagement. Schools have access to nearly all youth in the US and school-based PA not only can improve students' health but also enhance their academic performance <ref type="bibr">(IOM, 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, education settings can play a major role in public health initiatives related to PA, given that schools directly reach approximately 25% of the US population <ref type="bibr">(National Physical Activity Plan Alliance, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comprehensive school physical activity programmes</head><p>In 2008, the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) (formerly an association of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPERD), and now encompassed within SHAPE America) published a position statement <ref type="bibr">(NASPE, 2008)</ref>, which was updated in 2015 <ref type="bibr">(SHAPE America, 2015)</ref> called 'Comprehensive School Physical Activity Programs' (CSPAPs). A CSPAP is described as a multicomponent approach to enhancing physical education and promoting increased PA among school communities. The components of a CSPAP can include (a) physical education, (b) PA before and after school, (c) PA during school, (d) staff involvement, and (e) family and community engagement <ref type="bibr">(SHAPE America, 2015)</ref>. However, given limited descriptive research on CSPAPs, recent literature reflects a broader conceptualization of a CSPAP, which focuses less on the total number of programme components and more on whether a school, through multiple possible approaches, provides all students with sufficient opportunities to meet the programme goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Webster et al., 2020b</ref><ref type="bibr">(Webster et al., , 2020c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Webster et al., , 2020d))</ref>. Implementing a CSPAP is intended to provide children and adolescents with PA support and opportunities before, during, and after school as a means to <ref type="bibr">'[developing]</ref> physically educated students who are physically active for the nationally recommended 60-plus minutes each day and who develop the knowledge, skills and confidence to be physically active for a lifetime' <ref type="bibr">(SHAPE America, 2015: 3)</ref>.</p><p>A survey conducted by AAHPERD in 2011 found that CSPAPs existed in only 16% of elementary schools, 13% of middle schools, and 6% of high schools. In 2013, the IOM endorsed a multicomponent, or 'whole-of-school', approach to youth PA promotion <ref type="bibr">(IOM, 2013: 30)</ref> and the CDC partnered with SHAPE America to develop a step-by-step guide for implementing a CSPAP <ref type="bibr">(CDC, 2013)</ref>. However, based on a recent survey by the CDC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brener et al., 2017)</ref>, a mere 3% of secondary schools have implemented a CSPAP. Thus, while CSPAPs are recommended to increase students' daily PA and support the educational goals of physical education <ref type="bibr">(SHAPE America, 2015)</ref>, and the CDC has adopted the CSPAP framework as the national framework for physical education and PA in the US (CDC, 2019), the apparent continued low prevalence of CSPAPs in the US underscores the need to investigate the factors that are associated with programme implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principals' involvement in CSPAPs</head><p>One factor that has consistently been cited as critical in school reform efforts and in creating and maintaining an effective school is the principal (also referred to as the head teacher, headmaster/ headmistress, school director, and other titles in various contexts) and their involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dow and Oakley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fullan, 2016)</ref>. As a figurehead of school leadership, the principal is a key driver in the school's mission, vision, and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bryk et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leithwood and Jantzi, 1999)</ref>. A principal's involvement in a school programme, for example by actively assisting in its development and taking part in its promotion, can lead to teachers feeling they are supported and showing increased commitment to the programme <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Leithwood and Jantzi, 1999)</ref>. The principal is the main reason programmes are or are not successful in schools; they hold the most influence for implementation of programmes and policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Datnow and Castellano, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carson et al. (2014)</ref> proposed that support from administrators, such as the principal, is necessary to the successful implementation of a CSPAP. However, the concept of 'support' may not fully encompass the range of ways in which a principal might be involved with a CSPAP. According to <ref type="bibr">Webster et al. (2020e: 130)</ref>, 'Staff involvement with promoting PA can be broadly conceptualized in terms of the direct and indirect actions staff members take to increase the concomitant or future amount of PA in which youth engage'. A recent scoping review <ref type="bibr">(Webster et al., 2020a)</ref> identified three themes in the published recommendations for school administrators' involvement in schoolbased health promotion. These themes included collaboration (e.g. using a distributive leadership style, being involved with defining health issues, identifying solutions, and monitoring progress), advocacy (e.g. knowing about and valuing health promotion, and educating policymakers about the importance of school health promotion), and support (e.g. providing resources for teachers, visiting teachers' classrooms, and offering feedback). Yet, a descriptive research base to inform the specific actions school principals might take to be involved with a CSPAP is lacking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A social-ecological perspective of principals' CSPAP involvement</head><p>In addition to the limited research available to operationally define principals' CSPAP involvement, little is known about variables that may influence principals' involvement with CSPAPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Van den Berg et al. (2017)</ref> found that principals perceived PA to have academic, physical, and social-emotional benefits but also perceived barriers to implementing PA that were related to time limitations, school priorities, space constraints, and financial challenges. A gap that remains in the literature, however, is research on principals' perceptions specifically pertaining to CSPAPs. It is important to investigate these perceptions, particularly to understand how they may be related to principals' CSPAP involvement. In the present study, we adopted a social-ecological perspective to investigate principals' perceptions of CSPAPs and how these perceptions relate to principals' CSPAP involvement.</p><p>Based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bronfenbrenner (1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bronfenbrenner ( , 1977))</ref>, a social-ecological perspective of human behaviour considers the influence of a wide range of variables on targeted behaviours of interest. Social-ecological models are used to organize these variables into multiple levels of influence and illustrate relationships among individuals, groups, and their environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Golden et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">McLeroy et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sallis et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sallis et al., , 2008;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stokols, 1996)</ref>. Numerous examples of socialecological models exist in theory and research specific to school-based PA promotion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Langille and Rodgers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webster and Suzuki, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webster et al., 2013)</ref>. In general, these models encompass five levels of influence: (a) intrapersonal, (b) interpersonal, (c) organizational, (d) community, and (e) public policy. Intrapersonal variables may include beliefs (e.g. self-efficacy in implementing an educational programme, expected outcomes of implementing the programme), attitudes, and other psychological attributes (e.g. motivation to implement a new programme) of the individual whose behaviour is being targeted (e.g. school principal). Variables at the interpersonal level tend to focus on relationships between the individual and others with whom the individual interacts (e.g. other administrators, teachers, students, parents, community stakeholders). The organizational level of influence is usually comprised of variables that reflect institutional resources (e.g. school facilities, available educational materials), norms (e.g. cultural customs commonly followed by students and staff, a school honour code), practices (e.g. allocated curriculum time for different school subjects, instructional approaches used by teachers), and policies (e.g. expectations for student conduct, whether or not teachers are allowed to withhold recess as a punishment). At the community level, variables often centre on factors, such as the support of other organizations (e.g. a facility joint-use agreement between the school and a local YMCA), which surround the individual's own organization. Public policy variables may include the presence of any local, state, or federal policies that are pertinent to the targeted behaviour (e.g. a state policy that requires schools to provide students with a certain number of minutes of PA each week). In the context of a CSPAP, a social-ecological perspective can help to identify key variables that should be the focus of interventions and professional learning directed towards influencing the PA promotion efforts of programme implementors. Previous social-ecological research in the area of school-based PA promotion has not conceptualized or investigated the intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, or public policy variables that may influence school principals' CSPAP involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose of the study</head><p>Overall, although considerable research exists on the staff involvement component of the CSPAP framework, particularly in regard to classroom teachers and afterschool programme staff, there is currently an absence of research on principals' involvement in CSPAPs <ref type="bibr">(Webster et al., 2020e)</ref>. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between principals' CSPAP involvement and their perceptions about CSPAPs from a social-ecological perspective. In accordance with social-ecological theory and research related to school PA promotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Langille and Rodgers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webster et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webster and Suzuki, 2014)</ref>, we hypothesized that intrapersonal variables would have the strongest and most direct association with the targeted behaviour (i.e. principals' CSPAP involvement), while variables at each subsequent level (interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy, respectively) would have an indirect and increasingly weaker association. The results of this study will help to advance research focused on the role of principals in CSPAP implementation and may inform future directions in CSPAP planning and professional development for school administrators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods Instrumentation</head><p>We developed an online survey to investigate principals' involvement in CSPAPs. The survey encompassed a range of variables hypothesized to be associated with principals' CSPAP involvement from two distinct theoretical perspectives (social ecology theory and social learning theory). The present investigation, which focuses on social-ecological variables and their relationship to principals' CSPAP involvement, is the first study using data from the survey. The final version of the survey, specifically the parts of the survey used in the present study and as administered to the main study sample, is described in this section. The development of the survey is described in the Procedures section that follows. All phases of survey development and administration were facilitated via Survey Monkey.</p><p>The survey was organized into seven sections: (a) informed consent, (b) introduction, (c) CSPAP implementation, (d) CSPAP involvement, (e) social-ecological factors, (f) professional/ context biography, and (g) participant demographics. The first page of the survey was an informed consent form. Subsequently, in the introduction section, participants were provided with an overview of the CSPAP framework and the purpose of the survey. The CSPAP implementation section of the survey listed possible CSPAP components (e.g. physical education, PA during school, PA before and after school) with examples and included a single dichotomous response question ('yes/no') asking participants if their school has a CSPAP. A CSPAP was conceptualized as follows, based on the recent work by <ref type="bibr">Webster et al. (2020a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Webster et al. ( , 2020b</ref><ref type="bibr">Webster et al. ( , 2020c</ref>):</p><p>[your school provides] OPPORTUNITIES, through any combination or variety of CSPAP componentsfor all students at your school to: (a) receive standards-based physical education experiences designed to prepare individuals for a lifetime of participation in physical activity, and (b) meet the national guideline for school-aged youth to accumulate at least 60 minutes of mostly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day (including lunch time activities, and before and after school activities).</p><p>A logic mechanism was built into the survey so that 'yes' respondents proceeded to the subsequent two sections (involvement and social-ecological factors) with items written in the past/present tense (e.g. 'I am involved with supporting my school staff in their efforts to promote physical activity'). 'No' respondents proceeded to two identical sections except that items were written in the future tense (e.g. 'I would be involved with supporting my school staff in their efforts to promote physical activity'). The final two sections on professional context/biography and participant demographics focused on the PA promotion strategies, within each CSPAP component, currently used at participants' schools, as well as participants' school context (e.g. geographic location, total student enrolment), educational background (e.g. highest degree earned, licensure obtained), professional experience (e.g. years serving as a principal, years serving as a teacher), age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Items focusing on PA promotion strategies within each CSPAP component were based on recommended strategies from SHAPE America (2015) and the CDC (2019).</p><p>In all, 80 items from the final survey were used for this study. This item count is based on having counted equivalent items for 'yes' and 'no' respondents as single items. One item was included to assess CSPAP implementation; 12 items were included to assess the dependent variable (principal involvement in a CSPAP); 52 items were included to assess social-ecological variables at five levels of influence, including intrapersonal (29 items), interpersonal (five items), organizational (nine items), community (five items), and public policy (four items); 12 items were included to assess professional context/biography; and three items were included to assess participant demographics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>Phase 1: item construction, scale development, and participant instructions. To construct an initial set of items for the survey, we completed a comprehensive literature search to find published records (e.g. peer-reviewed articles, books, doctoral dissertations, public policies) in the areas of CSPAP (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rink et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">SHAPE America, 2015)</ref>, principals' perceptions of health-related school programming (e.g. physical education, recess, fitness, wellness) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Davis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Greaney et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Morrison, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Van den Berg et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Weiler et al., 2003)</ref>, and social-ecological theory and research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Golden et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">McLeroy et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sallis et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webster and Suzuki, 2014)</ref>. We developed a six-point Likert-type response scale (see the Instrumentation section) for the items based on recommendations for scale development <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fink, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson and Morgan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Krosnick and Fabrigar, 1997)</ref> and the treatment of categorical variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Finney and DiStefano, 2006)</ref>. Based on recent literature, including research on physical education teachers' perceptions related to CSPAPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Webster et al., 2020b</ref><ref type="bibr">(Webster et al., , 2020c) )</ref> and conceptual work intended to advance CSPAP research and practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Webster et al., 2020d)</ref>, we incorporated instructions for participants along with a definition and examples of a CSPAP (see Instrumentation section).</p><p>Phase 2: pilot testing. Before data collection started, we obtained approval from the first author's university institutional review board (IRB) to conduct the study. There were two rounds of pilot testing. The purpose of the first round of pilot testing was to enhance the content validity of the survey and obtain feedback about the length, formatting, and clarity of the survey. The purpose of the second round of pilot testing was to obtain feedback about the survey from a convenience sample of principals and to conduct a preliminary assessment of the survey's psychometric properties.</p><p>For the first round, we emailed the survey to CSPAP authors (n ¼ 41), authors who have published research using social-ecological theory (n ¼ 51), and university faculty in the area of educational leadership (n ¼ 89). We identified CSPAP authors from an edited book about CSPAP research and practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carson and Webster, 2020)</ref>. For each section of the survey, we instructed participants to rate the appropriateness of the items (completely inappropriate, mostly inappropriate, somewhat inappropriate, mostly appropriate, and completely appropriate) and provide feedback about the content on each page. A total of 24 CSPAP authors (59% response rate) provided responses. Using their ratings and comments, 24 items were removed (15 items intended to measure intrapersonal variables, seven items intended to measure interpersonal variables, and two items intended to measure organizational variables). Additionally, several minor revisions were made: the term 'CSPAP' was replaced with 'physical activity opportunities' and 'physical activity programming' in two of the items on the involvement scale, negatively worded items (e.g. 'A CSPAP would lead to a chaotic school environment') were either deleted or revised as positively worded items, and items that included the term 'parents' were changed to read 'parents/ guardians'.</p><p>To identify authors in the area of social-ecological theory, we located published articles online (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Golden et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">McLeroy et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sallis et al., 2008)</ref>. We found email addresses for 51 authors and emailed the authors with instructions to match each of the social-ecological items on the survey to its respective level of influence (intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, organizational, or public policy). We also asked the authors to provide feedback on the quality and appropriateness of specific items and/or the items in general. A total of six authors provided responses (12% response rate). Based on their feedback, items were found to match their intended social-ecological levels, so no changes were made to the survey.</p><p>We compiled a list of 89 university faculty, representing 58 US institutions, who work in the area of educational leadership and policy. These individuals encompassed all levels of academic rank/seniority from assistant professor to retired professor, and many of the faculty had served as former school-and district-level administrators. For each section of the survey, participants were instructed to rate the appropriateness of the items (completely inappropriate, mostly inappropriate, somewhat inappropriate, mostly appropriate, and completely appropriate), considering the roles and responsibilities of a school principal, and provide feedback about the content on each page. A total of 16 educational leadership faculty provided responses (18% response rate), which informed several changes to the survey. Specifically, two items were removed ('Others in my school environment notice/would notice the impact of promoting physical activity' and 'I have a good relationship with the teachers at my school'). Educational leadership faculty believed the principals would have low efficacy in judging the first item, and felt the second item was 'leading' and that principals would not admit to having a bad relationship with their staff. Also, the introduction to the survey was revised to use less academic jargon.</p><p>After making revisions to the survey based on the first round of pilot testing, we sent the survey to a convenience sample of principals (n ¼ 42) from elementary, middle, and high schools and asked them to complete the survey, as well as to provide general feedback. Twenty-one principals responded (16 indicated they had a CSPAP at their school) for a 50% response rate. Using the data from this second round of pilot testing, we employed Bayesian exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to individually examine each survey scale. This served as a preliminary statistical analysis to identify any additional items for potential removal from the final survey to be used with the main study sample. Previous research showed that EFA can provide accurate results with samples as small as 20 or 10 observations when the data are well conditioned (i.e. high oe, low f, high p) (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Winter et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Preacher and MacCallum, 2002)</ref>. Further, the Bayesian estimation method does not rely on a large-sample theory, and therefore can provide accurate results with small samples, such as our convenience sample of principals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Heerwegh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Muthén and Asparouhov, 2012)</ref>. Items with non-significant factor loadings were only removed for subsequent data collection in the main study if the loadings were below 0.320 or if removing the items created convergence problems. In all, five items were removed based on the results of the EFA. Additionally, in accordance with respondents' feedback about the survey, we revised the CSPAP implementation section of the survey for brevity.</p><p>We also asked the respondents from the convenience sample to retake the survey one week after their survey closed, to assess test-retest reliability. A one-week time limit was provided for them to retake the survey. There were 13 respondents (11 indicated they had a CSPAP at their school) for a 62% response rate. Thirteen items were removed from the survey due to having a Kappa value lower than 0.2.</p><p>Phase 3: main study. The administration of our survey to the main study sample occurred in the spring of 2019. Using information available on a federal website listing all public schools in the US, we applied stratified random sampling to select 60 schools (20 elementary, 20 middle/junior high, and 20 high) from each state (total of 3000 schools). Next, we visited the schools' websites to find email addresses (where available) for principals and compiled a list of 2941 email addresses. With these addresses, we sent a blanket email briefly describing the study and inviting recipients to complete the survey. The link to the survey was included in the email. Respondents for the main study were 291 principals. For the purposes of this study, we only analysed data from participants who indicated their school has a CSPAP (n ¼ 198).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis for the main study</head><p>Before conducting statistical analyses, we screened survey variables to examine the prevalence of 'don't know' responses as well as the distribution of missing values. Missing responses represented approximately 1.9% of the data. The 'don't know' response option was included to prevent item non-response, forced responses, or guessing, but was not included in statistical analysis because it indicates insufficient information to provide an informed opinion. To avoid losing data, we recorded 'don't know' responses as missing values. Cases with more than 15% invalid responses were listwise deleted. The resulting proportion of values that were missing or recoded as missing ranged between 0.0% and 2.7% per item and represented approximately 2.3% of the data. Little's Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) test showed that these values were distributed completely at random ( 2 (1825) ¼ 1800.867, p ¼ .652); therefore, we imputed them using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The resulting sample included 198 respondents. We computed the mean and standard deviation for all survey items to examine the distribution of survey responses and identify the items with the highest ratings.</p><p>Exploratory structural equation modelling. Although social-ecological research exists in the area of school PA promotion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Langille and Rodgers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webster and Suzuki, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webster et al., 2013)</ref>, researchers in previous studies have not examined principals' CSPAP involvement from a social-ecological perspective. Since we developed the survey for our research and had not previously examined the factor structure of the final survey, the initial step of our investigation with the main study sample was to identify the latent variables underlying the data. We used exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) for this purpose because it allows the estimation of an exploratory factor model with rotations and estimation of cross-loadings, thus yielding a more realistic representation of the data and reducing estimation bias, while also allowing the computation of goodness-of-fit indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Marsh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Morin and Maiano, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Morin et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>A group of 51 observed indicators was used to estimate latent variables. Our study met the recommendation of 3:1-6:1 observations per variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cattell, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">de Winter et al., 2009)</ref>. Studies have shown that sample sizes as low as 50 or even 20 may be suitable for factor analysis when the factor loadings are high, the number of factors is low, and the number of observed variables is high (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Winter et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">MacCallum et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Marsh et al., 1998)</ref>. We used the mean and variance adjusted weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimation method and geomin rotation with the Mplus 8.2 software. This estimation method is recommended for small sample sizes and data that are ordinal or non-normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Finney and DiStefano, 2006)</ref>. The geomin rotation is an oblique procedure; oblique rotation methods are employed when factors are expected to correlate <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Browne, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The optimal number of factors was determined after examining the scree plot, the number of eigenvalues larger than one, the interpretability of the factor structure, and goodness-of-fit indices. The indices used to assess model fit were: (a) 2 and corresponding p-value, (b) 2 /df, (c) the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and 90% confidence interval (CI), (d) the comparative fit index (CFI), (e) the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and (f) the weighted root mean residual (WRMR). We sequentially removed cross-loading items and items with loadings lower than .320 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Costello and Osborne, 2005)</ref>. When an optimal solution was identified, we estimated the internal consistency of each factor using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient.</p><p>Path analysis. Following the identification of the factors underlying the data, we computed factor scores, which show the location of each individual on the identified factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(DiStefano et al., 2009)</ref>. Relationships between factor scores were then examined using path analysis. Relationships in the path model were based on theoretical considerations and results from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Langille and Rodgers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webster and Suzuki, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webster et al., 2013)</ref>, as well as on specified scores on social-ecological factors as predictors of factor scores measuring principals' CSPAP involvement. The indices used to assess model fit were: (a) 2 and corresponding p-value; (b) 2 /df; (c) the RMSEA and 90% CI; (d) the CFI; (e) the TLI; and (f) the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of the main study Participant demographic and professional context/biographical information</head><p>The demographic and professional context/biographical information for participants in the main study is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> displays participants' self-reported age band, gender identification, race, education level, years of experience working as a principal, and grade level, as well as participants' self-reported school context information including total student enrolment, number of students participating in free or reduced cost school lunch (a proxy for socioeconomic status), school setting, and the region of the US where they are located. Overall, the percentages in each of these categories were similar for principals who indicated their school has a CSPAP compared to principals who indicated their school does not have a CSPAP. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> displays the PA promotion strategies, by CSPAP component, that the principals identified as being used at their schools. These data clearly demonstrate that, based on principals' self-reports, schools with a CSPAP are using more PA promotion strategies across all CSPAP components than schools without a CSPAP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor structure</head><p>Initial exploratory analyses yielded six eigenvalues larger than one, while the scree plot indicated solutions with 3-5 factors as optimal. We estimated models with 3-5 factors. Although the fivefactor solution had the best fit to the data, the fifth factor included only three items and all of them were cross-loading. Based on goodness-of-fit indices ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>(557) ¼ 123.452, p &lt; .001, 2 /df ¼ 0.221, RMSEA (90% CI) ¼ 0.079 (0.073-0.085), CFI ¼ 0.947, TLI ¼ 0.933, WRMR ¼ 0.950) and the interpretability of the factors, we considered the four-factor solution optimal (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The 2 test is an overall measure of model fit; a non-significant 2 statistic indicates good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barrett, 2007)</ref>; however, this statistic is sensitive to sample size and model size. Therefore, the 2 /df is often used, where values lower than 3 show good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Finney and DiStefano, 2006)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">and Muthén, 2002)</ref>. All items in the four-factor solution had statistically significant loadings, above the cutoff of .320 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Costello and Osborne, 2005)</ref>. Items with lower loadings and items that were cross-loading were sequentially removed; the final solution retained 39 items. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> lists the items included in each factor along with their means, standard deviations, factor loadings, standard errors, corresponding t statistics and p values. Descriptive analyses showed that most respondents provided high ratings on the majority of the survey items. The item with the highest average response was 'A CSPAP enhances students' physical development' (M ¼ 5.31, SD ¼ .755), followed by the item 'A CSPAP promotes students' social development' (M ¼ 5.24, SD ¼ .748). The item with the lowest average was 'I am involved with setting performance standards for my school's CSPAP' (M ¼ 3.47, SD ¼ 1.316). The strongest factor was labelled F1 ('Involvement') and included 13 items referring to CSPAP involvement. Item loadings ranged between .463 and .851, and the item with the highest loading was 'I am involved with CSPAP planning at my school'. Cronbach's alpha index of internal consistency for this factor was .900. The second factor, F2 ('Intrapersonal'), included nine items mostly referring to beliefs about the outcomes of a CSPAP. Item loadings ranged between .578 and .914 and the item with the highest loading was 'A CSPAP promotes a whole-child learning approach'. Cronbach's alpha index of internal consistency for this factor was .898. The third factor, F3 ('Interpersonal'), included five items, which referred to personnel within the school community and their support of a CSPAP.  Loadings on this factor ranged between .513 and .869 and the item with the highest loading was 'Parents/guardians at my school are interested and willing to help our school toward our CSPAP goals'. The internal consistency of this factor was alpha ¼ .842. The fourth factor, F4 ('Environmental'), included 12 items referring to organizational, community, and public policy variables that may facilitate CSPAP implementation. Loadings on this factor ranged between .322 and .862, and the item with the highest loading was 'Policies in my school support physical activity'. The internal consistency of this factor was alpha ¼ .840. As indicated in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, all factor covariances were statistically significant. The strongest relationships were F2-F1 and F2-F4, whereas the weakest relationships were F3-F1 and F4-F1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path model</head><p>The estimated path model specified: (a) F4 factor scores as predictors of F3 factor scores; (b) F3 factors scores as predictors of F2 factor scores; and (c) F2 factor scores as predictors of F1 factor scores (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This model had an overall good fit to the data ( 2 (3) ¼ 7.031, p ¼ .071, 2 /df ¼ 2.344, RMSEA (90% CI) ¼ 0.082 (0.000-0.164), CFI ¼ 0.982, TLI ¼ 0,964, SRMR ¼ 0.040) and all path coefficients were statistically significant. The strongest relationship in the model was F3-&gt;F2 (estimate ¼ 0.610, S.E. ¼ 0.045, estimate/S.E. ¼ 13.693, p &lt; .001), followed by F2-&gt;F1 (estimate ¼ 0.467, S.E. ¼ 0.056, estimate/S.E. ¼ 8.392, p &lt; .001), and F4-&gt;F3 (estimate ¼ 0.402, S.E. ¼ 0.031, estimate/S.E. ¼ 12.894, p &lt; .001). The indirect effect of F3 and F4 factor scores on F1 factor scores were, therefore, .285 and .114, respectively. promotion of school programmes is critical to whether teachers feel they are supported for, and whether teachers are committed to, such programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Leithwood and Jantzi, 1999)</ref>, initiatives to prepare principals for CSPAP implementation should emphasize the importance of their setting performance standards for the programme, serving on a CSPAP committee, and providing CSPAPrelated professional development. Principals also agreed less overall that parents/guardians are interested or engaged in supporting CSPAPs. Multicomponent interventions to increase youth PA through school environments have been more effective when they include a focus on family and/or community engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Russ et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, strategies to increase family engagement in CSPAPs should be another key focus of principal training.</p><p>Since we developed new measures to assess principals' CSPAP involvement and perceptions, we took several steps to increase the rigour of our measures, including an extensive literature search, two rounds of pilot testing, and psychometric analysis. ESEM with data from the main study sample indicated that the most robust and parsimonious model was a four-factor solution containing a total of 38 items. This solution supports a single factor for principals' CSPAP involvement and three social-ecological factors. The items comprising the involvement factor closely reflect the broad themes identified in published recommendations for administrators' involvement in school-based health promotion, which include collaboration, advocacy, and support <ref type="bibr">(Webster et al., 2020a)</ref>. This suggests that many of the ways in which principals become involved with CSPAPs may generalize to conceptualizations of school administrators' involvement in other school-based health initiatives, although additional research is needed to further explore this proposition.</p><p>The three social-ecological factors each represent distinct levels of influence in relation to such involvement, specifically intrapersonal, interpersonal, and 'environmental', which encompasses items focusing on organizational, community, and public policy variables. While proposed social- ecological models often include five levels, it is not uncommon for researchers to collapse levels into groupings that are similar to the factors retained in the present study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fisher et al. (2018)</ref> examined the relationship between the personal, social, and environmental factors regarding PA in community-dwelling older adults, whereas <ref type="bibr">Wilk and colleagues (2018)</ref> researched the PA levels of grade 5 children by focusing on individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels of influence. Other examples include studies in which individual, social, and environmental factors were used to investigate young women's participation in PA at transitional life stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Craike et al., 2009)</ref> and PA participation of adolescents in Spain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Devís-Devís et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the main focus of our study, we found significant associations between principals' CSPAP involvement and all social-ecological factors (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental) assessed via the survey. Therefore, from a social-ecological perspective, variables across all levels of influence appear to be important in the extent to which principals are involved with CSPAPs. Furthermore, the strength of the relationships between factors and the results of the path analysis support our hypothesis that intrapersonal variables have the strongest and most direct association with principals' CSPAP involvement, while factors at each subsequent level -interpersonal and environmental (i.e. organizational, community, and public policy, respectively)have an indirect and increasingly weaker association. These results are consistent with those reported in previous studies of school-based PA promotion that have used a social-ecological perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Langille and Rodgers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webster and Suzuki, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webster et al., 2013)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Webster et al. (2013)</ref> found that intrapersonal factors (i.e. domain-specific innovativeness and perceived attributes of PA promotion) directly predicted elementary classroom teachers' selfreported PA promotion in the classroom setting, and that the organizational level of influence (i.e. perceived school support for PA promotion) and the public policy level of influence (i.e. awareness of a state PA policy for elementary schools) were indirect predictors. Given the extant research and the results of the present investigation, we suggest that initiatives (e.g. professional development, interventions) focused on supporting school-based PA promotion should include strategies that target all levels of influence, but special attention should be given to the intraindividual level of influence. To increase principals' CSPAP involvement, it is important to ensure principals recognize the many positive outcomes that a CSPAP can help to facilitate, such as increased PA before and after school, decreased off-task behaviours, and increased academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carson and Webster, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine principals' CSPAP involvement. Notable strengths of the study are its theoretical grounding within a social-ecological perspective, systematic development of appropriate survey measures with sound psychometric properties, and use of a stratified random national sample. However, this study is limited by the low response rate to the survey, potential response bias, and reliance solely on principals' perceptions. Future survey studies of principals' CSPAP involvement should aim to recruit proportionately representative (e.g. by state) samples and use incentives to increase the response rate. It is also worth exploring whether there are times during the year that principals may be more inclined to participate in a survey. For this study, data from the main study sample were collected in the mid-to-late spring, which coincides with end-of-year testing for many schools and may be a more hectic time for principals than the beginning or middle parts of the school year. Finally, examining others' (e.g. teachers, parents) perceptions of principals' CSPAP involvement and conducting studies that use different methods (e.g. observation) and designs (e.g. qualitative) will allow for deeper analysis of CSPAP implementation and help to build upon the results of the present study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Participants' self-reported demographics and school contexts for the main study.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Participants who</cell><cell>Participants who</cell></row><row><cell>responded 'no' to their</cell><cell>responded 'yes' to their</cell></row><row><cell>school having a CSPAP</cell><cell>school having a CSPAP</cell></row><row><cell>(n ¼ 36)</cell><cell>(n ¼ 147)</cell></row></table></figure>

As this was the first study to investigate these variables, a discussion of the descriptive data from the survey and the psychometric properties of our measures is warranted before addressing the main results.  Overall, principals indicated robust agreement concerning the benefits of a CSPAP for students, but they expressed less agreement about certain aspects of their involvement in CSPAPs. Based on these results, we suggest that while principals understand and appreciate the important contributions of a CSPAP to school goals, they may feel their 'boots on the ground' involvement with CSPAPs is beyond their call of duty.
