<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The major players and drivers of university policies are the human resources which usually constitute of academic and non-academic staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Owan, 2018)</ref>. While the academic staff are saddled with the primary responsibilities of teaching, research, and community service, the non-academic staff, on the other hand, perform complementary roles such as records keeping, providing safety, keeping the environment neat, amongst others. Apart from the mere recruitment and placement of staff into various roles, their commitment to the job is as important as their employment. It is the commitment and total devotion of workers within an organization that actually determines the extent to which the organization attain set goals and not by mere presence. An organization with highly qualified and adequate workers that are not committed is indifferent from the one that is understaffed.</p><p>Job commitment refers to the total and whole-hearted dedication of academic staff to the policies, initiative, programmes, reforms, and prospects of the university with the willingness to obey and follow all prescribed rules and regulations towards the realization of short-or long-term goals. Employees commitment may also be explained as the strong association linking workers to their organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nzewi, Chiekezie, Ekene, Raphael, &amp; Ebuka, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Neyshabor &amp; Rashidi, 2013)</ref>. To some scholars, organizational commitment includes the following: employee loyalty, emotional affiliation, as well as the cost of leaving an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Price &amp; Mueller, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aleke, Akeke, &amp; Awolusi, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>There are three aspects used to measure the commitment of academic staff in an organization. This includes affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allen &amp; Meyer, 1996)</ref>. Affective commitment is the emotional attachment of employees to their organization. Continuance commitment is the deprivation and the cost an employee stands to lose if he/she leaves the organization. While normative commitment is the feeling of obligation to remain with the employer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Biwott &amp; Kemboi, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Three-way model for measuring job commitment; Source: <ref type="bibr">(Allen and</ref> Meyer cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biwott &amp; Kemboi, 2017)</ref> This study adopts the three-way Allen-Meyer's model for measuring the job commitment of workers in an organization as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The framework as presented in Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the aspects that are likely to make employees stay connected to an organization. However, the issue bordering around the commitment of academic staff suggests that many staff do not consider these aspects of affective, continuance, or normative commitment when making decisions. "The problem of staff retention is a global one which affects both developing and industrialized countries" <ref type="bibr">(Biwott &amp; Kemboi, 2017: 55)</ref>. This difficulty in staff retention arise in part, due to the poaching of quality staff from other organizations which is a common practice in recent times; and in part, due to the quest of organizational members to get better incentives.</p><p>It is worth revealing that the job commitment level of many academic staff in Nigerian universities has become a major issue of concern. Many workers appear to be disconnected from their organisations and are unwilling to discharge duties in line with expected standards. Keen observations have shown that many academic staff are switching from one university to another in search for greener pastures. Some are also observed working simultaneously for more than one university. The implication of such switching and simultaneous work in different institutions is a high rate of ineffectiveness, instability, and dismal or inconsistent discharge of duties. Many of these staff are always not seen when they are needed by superiors, they are often characterised by irregularities to class attendance and poor service delivery.</p><p>Many staff has listed the poor conditions of service, as well as the poor and irregular motivational packages offered to them as one of the reasons responsible for their poor commitment and discharge of duties. The Government's failure to implement signed agreements with trades union has resulted in universities embarking on incessant strike actions as both the academic and nonacademic staff strive to draw the Government's attention to their plight. As many academic staff are switching from one public university to another in search of better conditions of service, gives the impression that some public universities may be better than others in terms of welfare provision. Considering that all of these public institutions receive the same kind of treatment from the Government and are being regulated by the Nigerian Universities Commission.</p><p>Studies have made efforts to address this issue in different parts of the world including Nigeria <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdullah, Almadhoun, &amp; Ling, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aleke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Maina, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Diraviam, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aliakbari &amp; Amoli, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rao, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mukanzi &amp; Senaji, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Iman &amp; Wayan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arop, Ekpang, &amp; Owan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nguru &amp; Gichuhi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owan, Arop, &amp; Agunwa, 2019)</ref>. These studies have used several independent variables in an attempt to address the issue. Previous studies have focused on the job commitment of secondary school teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arop, et al, 2018)</ref>, while others considered teachers' satisfaction, empowerment or effectiveness to work to be synonymous with employee commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boudrias, Gaudreau, Savoie &amp; Morin, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aleke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ulutas, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bassey, Owan, &amp; Eze, 2019)</ref>. This study did not treat commitment as a whole but based on the three dimensions (affective, continuance, and normative) that are in wide use in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allen &amp; Meyer, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Neyshabor &amp; Rashidi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Farid, Izadi, Ismail &amp; Alipour, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Diraviam, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biwott &amp; Kemboi, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mukanzi &amp; Senaji 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Iman &amp; Wayan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Osibanjo, Oyewunmi, Abiodun, &amp; Oyewunmi, 2019)</ref>. The present study was, therefore, designed to consider other variables such as work-life policies, psychological empowerment and how they associate with the job commitment of academic staff in public universities.</p><p>Work-life policies refer to the provisions made in an organization with the intention of giving all workers a balance that can enable them work effectively in the organisation while giving their personal lives some level of attention. Such policies include the schedule of work, nature of job assigned to workers, the frequency of workflow and operations allocated to employees. Within the context of a university, work-life policies are necessary to strike an equilibrium between the demands placed by the organization on workers and the consideration given to workers to live meaningful lives even as employees. Work-life policies are very important in any organization since they serve as a source of motivation to employees. Studies on work-life policies have shown with empirical evidence that it has some nexus with the commitment of employees to an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hervie &amp; Baffoe, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mwangi, Boinett, Tumwet, &amp; Bowen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rao, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nguru and Gichuhi (2018)</ref> found that there is a strong positive correlation between work-life balance and employee commitment in an organization with growth and development opportunities being the most important factor in determining employee commitment.</p><p>The findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mukanzi and Senaji (2017)</ref> supported this position by revealing that work-family conflict had a positive relationship with affective commitment (AC), continuance commitment (CC), and normative commitment (NC). Other studies have also shown that there is a connection between work-life policies and employees commitment in terms of affective, continuance, and normative commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Farid, et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Diraviam, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mwangi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arop, Owan, &amp; Ibor, 2019)</ref>. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biwott and Kemboi (2017)</ref> showed that work-life policies was the strongest predictor of employee commitment (β = 0.300, t=5.670, p&lt; 0.01), followed by employee empowerment (β = 0.154, t=2.820, p&lt;0.01). The findings indicated also that a significant positive relationship exists between employee work-life policies and affective commitment (r=0.317, p&lt;0.01), normative commitment (r=0.329, p&lt;0.01), and continuance commitment (r=0.328, p&lt;0.01). On the contrary, the findings of Darko-Asumadu, Sika-Bright, and Osei-Tutu (2018) discovered that the influence of work-life policies on employee commitment is not statistically significant in the banking sector. With career advancement and job security as sub-variables of work-life policies, the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Osibanjo, et al. (2019)</ref> discovered that there is a negative relationship between career advancement, job security, and organizational commitment.</p><p>Psychological empowerment is another critical aspect of this study which refers to the techniques used in the organization to boost the morale of workers and promote the chances of them discharging their duties whole-heartedly and happily. Psychological empowerment is intrinsically driven and affects the emotional disposition of workers once they are stimulated. A lot of activities, devices, and resources could be used to empower the academic staff psychologically including rewards, promotion, praises, proper placement, recognition, and remuneration. The confidence and competence of employees is boosted once they are empowered, making them able to influence their job and work environment in a meaningful way, they are likely to be proactive and innovative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hunjra, UlHaq, Akbar, and Yousaf (2011)</ref> opined that one of the most important instruments for the successful growth, productivity, and achievement of any organisation is the psychological empowerment of employees. Often regarded as a motivational practice that aims to increase the performance, psychological empowerment of workers increases the participative opportunities and involvement of workers in decision-making and task performance.</p><p>Studies involving psychological empowerment of workers and its relationship to the affective, continuance, and normative commitment have revealed mixed results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biwott and Kemboi (2017)</ref> established that there is a significant positive correlation between employee empowerment and affective commitment (r=0.186, p&lt;0.01); normative commitment (r=0.194, p&lt;0.01); and continuance commitment (r=0.188, p&lt;0.01). Using employee participation and job satisfaction as a proxy for psychological empowerment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Osibanjo et al. (2019)</ref> found a positive relationship between employee participation, job satisfaction, and organisational commitment.</p><p>Hanaysha (2016) found a significant positive effect of workers empowerment on organizational commitment. Using a structural equation approach, the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aliakbari and Amoli (2016)</ref> revealed that teacher empowerment was found to be important in the classroom and instructional decisions that enhance organizational effectiveness and improve student performance. The stepwise regression results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Toremen, Karakus and Savas (2011)</ref> showed that personnel empowerment significantly predicts both the total score of organizational commitment and the dimensions of "affective and normative commitment". This finding is also in the same direction as those of other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdullah et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Iman &amp; Wayan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ulutas, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>From the foregoing, there is clear evidence that several scholars have attempted to address the menace of poor job commitment of employees. Studies have been carried using the banking sector as well as other Government parastatals, in different parts of the world. It is quite shocking and unfortunate to observe that there is still a paucity of research evidence in the Nigerian perspective. In Cross River State, there appears to be a very scanty literature on the subject of academic staff job commitment. The few studies observed in the State focused on teachers' effectiveness at the secondary school level. All these are the gaps that gave the impetus for carrying out this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Statement of hypotheses</head><p>The following null hypotheses were formulated to direct the study:</p><p>i. There is no significant effect of work-life policies on the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities. ii. Psychological empowerment has no significant effect on the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities. iii. There is no significant composite effect of work-life policies and psychological empowerment on the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study adopted a descriptive survey research design. The descriptive survey focuses on the use of questionnaires to obtain information about phenomena of interest with the objective of describing or reporting the manifestations of the events as they occur in the population through the sample. This design was considered very suitable to the study since the study presented evidence concerning the work-life policies of academic staff in universities using data collected through questionnaires about phenomena playing out in the population.</p><p>The population of this study comprised all the academic staff in public universities sited in Cross River State. There are two public universities in Cross River State, namely, the University of Calabar, Calabar (UNICAL) and the Cross River University of Technology (CRUTECH). Multi-stage sampling procedure was adopted by the researchers in selecting the sample of the study. In achieving this, in each of the two universities, 40% of the available faculties were selected. The University of Calabar has 16 faculties (six were selected) while CRUTECH has eight faculties (3 faculties were selected). From each selected faculty, four departments were randomly selected using simple random sampling technique, and in each selected department, only the academic staff that were intact in their offices during the data collection process were selected studied. Thus, a total of 315 academic staff were studied based on their availability as distributed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Source: Field survey (2019).</p><p>The instruments used for data collection was a questionnaire tagged "Work-Life Policies, Psychological Empowerment and Job Commitment Questionnaire (WPPEJCQ)". This instrument was designed by the researchers and arranged on the revised four-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree to Strongly Disagree. The WPPEJCQ was divided into five sections with each section having eight items. Section 1 was designed to measure academic staff work-life policies, Section 2 was used to measure the psychological empowerment of academic staff. Section 3, 4, and 5 of the WPPEJCQ measured the affective, continuance, and normative job commitment of academic staff respectively. The instrument received face and content validity from five experts in test and measurement who vetted the items and made suggestions for improvement. Copies of the instrument were administered to the 315-academic staff in their offices since they were intact during the data collection process. All the administered instruments were retrieved from the respondents immediately after completion, hence there was no loss. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were employed in establishing the construct validity of the instrument, while reliability was established using the Cronbach alpha technique. Path analysis which is a type of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used in testing the three null hypotheses formulated with the aid of SPSS v23 and Amos v23 programs. This multivariate statistical technique was employed due to its robusticity in modelling the effects of several independent factors as predicators on a particular or a set of response variables. The statistical technique was also employed in building the structural equation models of this study. The results of the analyses are presented in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Factorial/Construct validity of the instrument</head><p>The data collected for this study were subjected to an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as the extraction technique, with a varimax rotation based on Eigen-values greater than one. The Kaiser-Meyer-Ohlin (KMO) value of sampling adequacy revealed a coefficient of .894 and Bartlett's test of sphericity yielded a coefficient of 7795.820 (df = 780, p&lt; .05) providing sufficient evidence to perform factor analysis. A KMO value from .06 and above indicates that the sample size is large enough (adequate) to perform factor analysis with values closer to one being more preferred. For Bartlett's test of sphericity, the results must be significant (p&lt; .05) for the data to be considered as being factorizable. The results of the KMO and Bartlett test in this study all met these assumptions hence, EFA (Exploratory Factor Analysis) and CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis) were performed.</p><p>The results of the EFA yielded a five-factor solution which explained a total of 62.262% of the total variance in the instrument. The five factors were labelled work-life policies, psychological empowerment, affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment based on the factor loadings on a particular construct. Out of the total variance explained by the five factors, work-life policies accounted for 9.361%, while psychological empowerment, affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment contributed 16.050%, 12.305%, 14.301%, and 10.246% respectively. Cronbach alpha was further employed in testing for the reliability of the respective constructs as well as the overall internal consistency of the instrument. The following reliability coefficients of .867, .861, .915, .941, .939, and .811 were obtained for work-life policies, psychological empowerment, affective, continuance, normative commitment, and the overall instrument respectively. The results of the analysis as interpreted above, are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>It can be seen from the results in Table 2 that all the items had high factor loadings on the constructs they all measured. Hence, all the eight items designed to measure each construct were retained for measurement. The confirmatory factor analysis was performed as a means of verifying the results of the EFA. It is a good practice to perform a CFA after an EFA whether or not there was a prior model. The results of the CFA are also contained in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, with Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> used to provide a clearer picture of the model. The values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows also that the items all loaded highly on their respective constructs. Seven fit indices were used in evaluating the fitness of the confirmatory factor model including the Chi-square, Normed Fit Index (NFI), Relative Fit Index, Incremental Fit Index, Tucker-Lewis Index, and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.  The fit indices presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> indicates that the Chi-square value was significant (p&lt;.05), which in an ordinary sense, implies that the model has no goodness of fit. However, due to the large sample size of this study (n = 315) it is not strange that the results appeared significant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Hypothesis Two</head><p>Psychological empowerment has no significant effect on the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities. This hypothesis was tested using Path analysis and the result is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The results in Fig 4 disclosed that the psychological empowerment has a strong positive relationship with the affective commitment of academic staff and a weak positive relationship respectively, with the continuance and normative commitment. Psychological empowerment explained 63%, 25%, and 27% of the total variance in affective, continuance, and normative commitment. By implication, the remaining 37%, 75%, and 73% of the total variance are explained by other extraneous variables that were not included in the model. In determining the significant paths as expressed in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the result in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> was used.  As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, the results of the analysis indicate that the paths linking psychological empowerment to affective, continuance, and normative commitment are all significant (***). Based on this result, the null hypothesis was rejected, implying that psychological empowerment has a significant effect on the affective (β = .795, t = 23.199, p&lt; .05), continuance (β = .501, t = 10.261, p &lt; .05) and normative commitment (β = .520, t = 10.795, p&lt; .05) of academic staff in universities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Hypothesis three</head><p>There is no significant composite effect of work-life policies and psychological empowerment on the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities. This hypothesis www.richtmann.org</p><p>Vol 11 No 2 March 2020 96 was tested using SEM approach (Path analysis) and the result is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. The results in Fig 5 revealed that work-life policies and psychological empowerment jointly accounted for 71% of the total variance in the affective commitment of academic staff. The two independent variables (work-life policies and psychological empowerment) jointly contributed a total of 27% and 30% respectively, to the total variance in the continuance and normative commitment of academic staff in universities. The implication of this result is that the remaining 29%, 73%, and 70% of the total variance in the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff respectively, could be explained by other independent variables not included in this study. The results in Fig 5 also showed that there is a strong positive relationship (r = .725) between work-life policies and psychological empowerment. In determining the relative and unique contribution of each variable, and to ascertain the paths that were significant, the result presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> was used. The result presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> disclosed that all the paths linking the independent variables to the dependent variables are significant since their respective p-values are below the .05 alpha level. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected while the alternate hypothesis which states that there is a significant composite effect of work-life policies and psychological empowerment on the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities is retained. Relatively, psychological empowerment was the strongest predictor of affective commitment (β = .493, t = 11.255, p&lt; .05), continuance commitment (β = .368, t =5.254, p&lt; .05), and normative commitment (β= .347, t= 5.063, p&lt; .05). Work-life policies was the weakest predictor of affective commitment (β = .416, t= 9.509, p&lt;.05), continuance commitment (β = .183, t = 2.613, p&lt; .05), and normative commitment (β = .238, t= 3.475, p&lt;.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of Findings</head><p>The first finding of this study established that there is a significant effect of work-life policies on the affective commitment (β= .774, t = 21.636, p &lt; .05), continuance commitment (β=.450, t = 8.932, p&lt;.05), and normative commitment (β=490, t = 9.967, p&lt;.05) of academic staff in universities in Cross River State. With work-life policies accounting for 60%, 20%, and 24% of the total variance in affective, continuance, and normative commitment respectively. This finding is very apt since it is the work-life policies in an organization that provides the opportunity for academic staff to maintain a balance by adding meaning to their individual lives while working as staff in the universities.</p><p>Employees who enjoy such work-life balance will be poised to take the matters of the organization seriously since, in the first place, the organization sees them as valuable resources. Such perception in the minds of staff will serve as a boost in promoting their job commitment levels. This finding is consistent with findings of Hervie and Baffoe (2016), <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mwangi, et al (2017)</ref>, Rao (2017), and Nguru and Gichuhi ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) which all discovered that there is a strong positive correlation between work-life balance and employee commitment in an organization. The findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mukanzi and Senaji (2017)</ref> supported this position by revealing that work-family conflict had a positive relationship with affective commitment (AC), continuance commitment (CC), and normative commitment (NC); Other studies have also shown that there is a connection between work-life policies and employees commitment in terms of affective, continuance, and normative commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Farid et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Diraviam, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mwangi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arop, et al, 2019)</ref>. However, this finding disagrees with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Darko-Asumadu, et al (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Osibanjo et al. (2019)</ref> which discovered that there is a negative relationship between career advancement, job security, and organizational commitment It was established through the second finding of this study that psychological empowerment has a significant effect on the affective (β = .795, t = 23.199, p&lt; .05), continuance (β = .501, t = 10.261, p &lt; .05) and normative commitment (β = .520, t = 10.795, p&lt; .05) of academic staff in universities. The independent variable explained 63%, 25%, and 27% of the total variance in affective, continuance, and normative commitment respectively. Empowering the academic staff by taking into consideration their emotional and psychological needs is a very important factor in any organisation striving towards goals realization. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the finding of this study yielded such results. This finding corroborates the findings of Hanaysha (2016) Aliakbari and Amoli (2016) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Osibanjo et al. (2019)</ref> found a significant positive effect of workers empowerment on organizational commitment. The finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biwott and Kemboi (2017)</ref> also established that there is a significant positive correlation between employee empowerment and affective commitment (r=0.186, p&lt;0.01); normative commitment (r=0.194, p&lt;0.01); and continuance commitment (r=0.188, p&lt;0.01). This finding is also in the same direction as those of other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdullah et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Iman &amp; Wayan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ulutas, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The third major finding of this study discovered that there is a significant composite effect of work-life policies and psychological empowerment on the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities is retained. Both variables (work-life policies and psychological empowerment) jointly accounted for 71%, 27%, and 30% of the total variance in the affective, continuance, and normative commitment of academic staff in universities. Between the two independent variables, psychological empowerment is the strongest predictor of academic staff job commitment in three dimensions assessed (affective, continuance commitment and normative commitment). The finding in this section provides implication for managers of universities to understand the combined role work-life policies and psychological empowerment plays in the job commitment of academic staff. When academic staff are adequately catered for through sound worklife policies and psychological empowerment, it boosts to a significant extent, their affective, continuance, and normative commitment to the university. This will lead to quality service delivery, improved student performance, and consequently, economic productivity of the nation.</p><p>This finding aligns with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biwott and Kemboi (2017)</ref> which indicated also that there is a significant positive relationship exist between employee work-life policies and affective commitment (r=0.317, p&lt;0.01), normative commitment (r=0.329, p&lt;0.01), and continuance commitment (r=0.328, p&lt;0.01); and there is a significant positive correlation between employee empowerment and affective commitment (r=0.186, p&lt;0.01); normative commitment (r=0.194, p&lt;0.01); and continuance commitment (r=0.188, p&lt;0.01). In the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Biwott and Kemboi (2017)</ref>, it was shown that work-life policies was the strongest predictor of employee commitment (β = 0.300, t=5.670, p&lt; 0.01), followed by employee empowerment (β = 0.154, t=2.820, p&lt;0.01). It was however shown in the present study that psychological empowerment was the strongest predictor of academic staff commitment, followed by work-life policies. The little variation in the findings of Biwott and Kemboi and that of the present study may be attributed to the differences in the characteristics of the respondents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Based on the findings of this study, it was concluded generally that, employee work-life policies and psychological empowerment are very important stimuli that can be used to promote the affective, continuance, and normative commitment levels of academic staff in universities in Cross River State. An improvement in the quality of work-life policies available to academic staff in universities will lead to a significant improvement in their job commitment levels in the various dimensions. Similarly, the psychological empowerment of academic staff affects the way they are committed towards carrying the organisation forward. Lastly, efforts made towards strengthening the work-policies as well as the psychological empowerment of academic staff will create a better organisation of highly committed staff than would have been had only one aspect been improved. This study has implication to both educational counsellors, psychologist, and managers. These group of professionals must collaborate and unify their efforts towards developing policies that create a balance for workers and empower them psychologically for effective service delivery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Based on the conclusion reached in this study, the following recommendations were made:</p><p>i. Sound policies that specify how workers will be treated when academic work clashes with their personal activities of high relevance, should be formulated. This will create an effective work-life balance in universities. ii. Departmental heads, faculty deans, and other universities administrators should ensure that the welfare of academic staff within their jurisdiction are given top-most priority. The presence of the academic environment should be felt in staff personal events like marriages, burial of loved ones, and others. iii. Academic staff should be regularly promoted and consistently remunerated in order to promote the level of their commitment to work. iv. Birth and sabbatical leaves should be granted to deserving staff from time to time, while</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>However, the values of all other fit indices such as TLI =.969, NFI= .884, IFI= .971, CLI= .971, and RFI= .877, are all very close to 1 indicating that the model in Fig 2 is an acceptable model.
