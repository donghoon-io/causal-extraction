<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Teachers have the greatest impact on the development of high-quality educational procedures and outcomes. As a result, without the backing of competent and trained teachers, all reform attempts to increase the quality of education would be ineffective. Teachers are expected to perform at a high level. The level of human resources in Indonesia will steadily develop as a result of strong performance, particularly among the younger generation. In order to build a nation that is intellectual and capable of tackling future problems. Teachers' job is not easy, and he or she has a lot of responsibilities. They also have to make students smarter by reasoning (honing IQ intelligence). <ref type="bibr">Supardi (2013:38)</ref> argues that teacher performance is said to be successful if it has an effect on the development of student potential in a psychological and physical context, which is positive for what they learn, both in terms of goals and benefits. So that cognitive, affective and psychomotor intelligence develop. The point is whether there is a change in behavior, think systematically and skillfully about what is happening. Educational Administration is a branch of social science that studies human behavior whose activities are both subject and object. Philosophically, human behavior is formed by interactions between humans, organizational climate (context), and systems. These three interactions, either individually or together, interact with the external environment. Development. In this case, <ref type="bibr">Usman (2014:13)</ref> asserts that Education Administration is the art and science of managing educational resources to realize the process and learning outcomes of students in an active, creative, innovative, and fun way in developing their potential. The role of teachers in the field of education is expected to be more optimal so that teacher job satisfaction must be considered. As the theory put forward by As'ad (2012) that social factors are factors related to social interaction between fellow employees, employees and superiors, as well as between employees of different types of work, can affect job satisfaction. The second factor that affects satisfaction is motivation in employees. In addition, teachers need to demonstrate high performance so that it is expected to increase job satisfaction. Teacher job satisfaction is the embodiment of work carried out by a teacher which is usually used as a basis for assessing teachers or schools. Good teacher job satisfaction is a step towards achieving educational goals.</p><p>Job satisfaction is deserving of attention and should be thoroughly investigated as a criterion for carrying out a teacher's tasks and obligations. Job happiness is linked to increased teacher empowerment, since teachers must be able to enhance their performance as a result of their job satisfaction. Job satisfaction might reflect a school principal's effectiveness in meeting educational objectives. Job satisfaction also reflects how far the principal has gone to help the teachers advance. How many teachers are employed at the school to meet the needs and expectations of the community who have committed their children's education to the school? Job satisfaction is one of the determinants of the creation of teacher performance as expected, therefore the quality of teachers as human resources is very important to note.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principal Communication</head><p>Communication is a crucial aspect of human life as social creatures. When a human interacts with other people, communication activities develop, hence it can be argued that communication is a product of social connections. This idea indicates that communication and human life are inextricably linked. <ref type="bibr">Mulyana (2015:4)</ref> claims that communication entails the equal sharing of an idea, a thought, a meaning, or a message. Meanwhile, according to Effendy (2014: 5), pragmatic communication is the act of transmitting a message from one person to another in order to inform or influence attitudes, views, or behavior, either directly or indirectly through the media. <ref type="bibr">Wahyudi (2016: 29)</ref> states that the notion of communication is indeed very simple and easy to understand, yet in practice it is very difficult to understand, especially if those involved in communication have different references, or communication goes one way, for example the mass media, of course to form this equation. will face many obstacles. Thoha (2012:167) said that communication is a process of delivering and receiving news or information from one person to another, principal communication is one component of education that plays a role in improving the quality of education. The principal is responsible for organizing educational activities, school administration, fostering other educational staff, and empowering and maintaining facilities and infrastructure. Meanwhile, according to Effendy (2014: 6), communication is the event of delivering human ideas. From the above understanding it can be seen that communication is a process of delivering messages which can be in the form of messages of information, ideas, emotions, skills, and so on through symbols or symbols that can cause effects in the form of behavior carried out with certain media. Communication as a form of behavior can change and is very ineffective. At one time the communication could be worse and at another time it could be better. However, it should be remembered that every act of communication is different and has its own characteristics and uniqueness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Climate</head><p>According to experts, organizational climate has numerous meanings. Davis <ref type="bibr">(Badu, 2017:116)</ref> defines organizational climate as "the human context in which an organization's workers execute their job." Davis's comment suggests that the organizational climate is linked to all of the current environment or challenges that humans confront in the workplace. Then, according to Steers <ref type="bibr">(Badu, 2017:116)</ref>, "organizational climate may be understood as the organization's personality as represented by its members." Employees perceive a specific organizational climate, which is not necessarily the actual environment, and the climate that appears in the organization is the primary element that influences employee behavior.An assessment of organizational climate can be done by digging up data from the perceptions or opinions of each member of the organization. Soetopo (2010) defines organizational climate as a quality of the environment within the organization that is experienced by its members, affects their behavior and can be described with the characteristic values of the organization. Organizational climate can be summed up as a collection of descriptions of organizational characteristics that differentiate one organization from other organizations that form the point of view of each member of the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work motivation</head><p>Motivation, according to <ref type="bibr">Kadarisman (2013: 275)</ref>, is the act of encouraging or stimulating people such that they are willing to work without being pushed. Hasibuan (2015: 67) goes on to say that motivation is a question of how to boost employees' job passion so that they desire to work hard. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anoraga, 2014)</ref>, motivation can come from within the individual as well as from outside the individual, both of which have an impact on behavior and work performance. Motivation is defined as the desire and strength that originates from inside a person to achieve objectives, great excitement for work, goal-oriented, and having clear work aims both individually and in groups, based on some of the descriptions above. Furthermore, motivation may be defined as a driving force that motivates people to take action in order to attain their objectives. Motivation is a symptom that entails a want to act toward a certain objective in this scenario. So, in this example, motivation is a reaction to an action, namely a goal. Human motivation does develop from inside, but it is stimulated or encouraged by the existence of external variables, such as the objective in this example. This aim is all about requirements. In line with that, Purwanto (2015: 79) says that the function of motivation for humans is: (1) as a driving force for humans, like fuel in vehicles, (2) determining the direction of action, namely towards the realization of a goal or ideals, (3) preventing deviations from the path that must be taken to achieve the goal, and (4) selecting one's own actions means determining which actions must be carried out that are harmonious in order to achieve the goal by setting aside actions that are not beneficial to that goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation among Principal Communication, Organizational Climate, Work Motivation and Job Satisfaction of Banjarbaru State Senior High School Teachers</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between the main communication characteristics, organizational atmosphere, and work motivation, and teacher job satisfaction. Path analysis was used to examine the effect between variables. Path Analysis was used to examine the data with the aid of the SPSS 2 5 program. This study uses quantitative methodologies and is a form of descriptive study. The participants in this study were 248 State Senior High School in Banjarbaru teachers. Proportional random sampling was used to choose the sample. With 153 persons, the number of samples was calculated using the Slovin formula. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of job satisfaction (Ability utilization, Achievement, Activity, Advancement, Authority, Company policies and practices, Compensation, Coworkers, Creativity, Independence, Moral values, Recognition, Responsibility, Security, Social service, Social status, Human relations supervision, Technical supervision, Variety, Working conditions), principal communication (Humanistic, Pragmatic), organizational climate (Organizational Policies and Regulations, Communication Effectiveness Level, Relationship Level between Employees, Leadership Participation Level), and work motivation (Internal Motivation, External Motivation). In accordance with the conceptual relationship model between variables as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Before beginning the research, 30 teachers outside of the research sample were given the opportunity to join the try out of the the instrument, including the instrument validity test and the instrument reliability test. The following are the phases of data analysis employed in this study: data description, test requirements analysis, and hypothesis testing for each purpose. The normality, linearity, and homogeneity tests are all part of the test requirements analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Based on the results of data findings assisted by SPSS, found results as described in Tabel 1. Based on the results of the analysis in tables 1, 2, and 3 above, this study found a relationship between variables which can be explained as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> There is a direct relationship between Principal Communication and Job Satisfaction</head><p>The results of the analysis of this study indicate that there is a direct relationship between principal communication and teacher job satisfaction. This can be seen from the coefficient value of 0.148. This research Research conducted by Rahayu (2017) also explains the same thing. The results of hypothesis testing produce a correlation coefficient of 0.424, indicating a significant and unidirectional relationship between the influence of principal communication and teacher job satisfaction. The whole series in the school is an effort to fulfill the school's goals, so that all activities of the school organizational climate should be managed more optimally, in order to realize these goals, the quality of teacher work needs to be improved. And therefore, the role of the principal is needed to encourage teachers to work more optimally. One of the principal's duties is a spokesperson, so the principal must be good at communicating. The results of the analysis of this study show that there is a direct relationship between organizational climate and teacher job satisfaction. This can be seen from the coefficient value of 0.234. These results can be interpreted that there is a direct relationship between organizational climate and job satisfaction of State Senior High School teachers in Banjarbaru. This is in line with Marliana's research (2017), the results of the study show: 1) There is a positive and significant influence between principal leadership on teacher job satisfaction. This means that the principal's leadership variable has a real influence and has a positive impact on teacher job satisfaction by 22.2% with a low correlation. So the conclusion is that hypothesis H1 is accepted.</p><p>There is a significant influence between teacher motivation on teacher job satisfaction. This means that the teacher's motivation variable has an influence on teacher job satisfaction of 18.9% with a low correlation. So the conclusion is that hypothesis H1 is accepted. There is a significant influence between principal leadership and teacher motivation together on teacher job satisfaction. This means that the principal's leadership and teacher motivation variables together have a significant effect on teacher job satisfaction by 27.2% with a low correlation. So the conclusion is that hypothesis H1 is accepted.  There is a direct relationship between teacher work motivation and job satisfaction According to the findings of this study's research, there is a link between work motivation and teacher job satisfaction. The coefficient value of 0.425 demonstrates this. These findings suggest that there is a clear link between work motivation and job satisfaction among Banjarbaru State Senior High School teachers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Subariyanti (2017)</ref> conducted previous research to determine the relationship between work motivation and employee performance, the relationship between job satisfaction and employee performance, and the relationship between work motivation, job satisfaction, and employee performance among PTLR BATAN employees.</p><p>A person's level of success in carrying out his task is measured by job satisfaction. Every business wants its workers to be happy in their jobs. Because the more satisfied people are with their jobs, the higher the company's productivity will be. The same may be said for educational institutions such as schools. As a manager, the principle desires the highest level of job satisfaction from his employees. Teachers, as members of the educational staff, are required to deliver the highest level of job satisfaction in order to develop the best students.</p><p>Teachers who are most satisfied with their jobs must have underlying triggers, one of which is motivation. Motives, as triggers, are always accompanied with a "push engine" known as motivation. The higher the motivation, the more satisfied you will be at work. As a result, it is thought that motivation and teacher job satisfaction are linked. Teachers with high motivation are more likely to create high levels of work satisfaction. The aspect of teacher job satisfaction is strongly influenced by the motivation of the teacher, because job satisfaction is an interaction between the abilities and motivations of a person. Motivation is an impulse that exists in individuals in the form of encouragement from within the individual itself (intrinsic) and encouragement from outside the individual (extrinsic) to perform an action that has a specific purpose. Someone who has high motivation will certainly take all actions to achieve his goals as well as possible. This also applies to a teacher in an organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> There is a direct relationship between Principal Communication and Work Motivation</head><p>The results of the analysis of the study show that there is a direct relationship between principal communication and teacher work motivation as evidenced by the coefficient value of 0.246. With this value, it can be concluded that there is a direct relationship between principal communication and work motivation of State Senior High School teachers in Banjarbaru. Based on the findings obtained from the answers of the teachers who were used as respondents in this study, it can be concluded that the principal's communication and work motivation of Banjarbaru State High School teachers are interrelated. This research is in line with research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hadiana (2016)</ref>. The results showed that there was a partial influence of principal's leadership, communication, and work motivation on teacher job satisfaction at private high school, Medan Sunggal sub-district. Based on the analysis obtained Fcount 78.066 &gt; Ftable 2.85 which is indicated by multiple linear regression with a coefficient of determination (r2) 0.926, which means that there is a simultaneous relationship between the teacher's perception of the principal's leadership, communication, and motivation, including a very high level of relationship with the level of determination. of 0.857% and 14.3% influenced by other factors. Leaders who are able to implement good communication with subordinates will provide encouragement for subordinates to carry out their duties and responsibilities well. This implies that leadership communication is able to produce subordinate work motivation. This means that the better the leadership method or technique in communicating with subordinates, the higher the work motivation of the subordinates will be. Work motivation is defined as a force that moves a person to produce the planned goals. It is the communication from the principal to the work situation that strengthens his motivation. This is inseparable from good communication from the principal. It is known that communication is a basic variable that can serve as a guide for changes in a person's behavior. A teacher must be based on motivation and belief as a dedication to the homeland, nation, and humanity to educate the nation, give birth to the next generation of quality or the next generation that is more reliable. So, in the act of educating driven by motivation in itself, the teacher will work optimally so that it will produce a professional teacher for the work he is doing without any burden contained in him. On the basis of love, the teacher will do the best for his students and for educational institutions  There is a direct relationship between Organizational Climate and Work Motivation According to the findings of this study's research, there is a clear link between organizational atmosphere and teacher motivation at work. According to the coefficient value of 0.559, this is correct. These findings suggest that there is a clear link between organizational atmosphere and job motivation among Banjarbaru State Senior High School teachers. Several studies support the findings of this study, including research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Werang and Irianto (2018)</ref>, which found a positive and somewhat significant relationship between school atmosphere and teacher motivation and work satisfaction. A number of important roles that exist in the organizational climate in increasing work motivation, among others, the level of supportive people who are working with each other; the friendship of people who are working; and the intimate level of the people at work. This for teachers can be used to develop personal bonds with the organization and provide behavioral guidelines, as a result of behavioral norms that have been formed. If this is realized, the teacher will be encouraged to carry out activities based on the values above, this will affect the teacher's work motivation. The values above as a work climate, if the role is increased, the employee's work motivation will be higher.</p><p> There is an indirect relationship between Principal Communication and Teacher Job Satisfaction through Work Motivation The results of the analysis of this study indicate that there is an indirect relationship between principal communication and teacher job satisfaction through teacher work motivation. This can be seen from the coefficient value of 0.063. These results can be interpreted that there is an indirect relationship between principal communication and teacher job satisfaction through the work motivation of senior high school in Banjarbaru. This is in line with previous research, the research objectives by Rahayu (2017), namely: 1) Interpersonal communication, principal leadership and organizational work culture have a simultaneous and significant contribution to job satisfaction indirectly through teacher work motivation; 2) Interpersonal communication, principal leadership and organizational work culture contribute directly to work motivation; and 3) work motivation contributes directly to teacher job satisfaction. Principal communication in increasing teacher motivation is to lead to activities to educate teachers to comply with school rules by personally calling the person concerned for advice, so that it does not have a negative impact on other teachers, and being invited together to improve discipline so that students can imitate it. The principal form of communication is communicating from heart to heart in certain moments and places, in addition to holding weekly meetings. While the form of teacher discipline that is expected by the principal is attendance on time, teaching according to plan.  There is an indirect relationship between Organizational Climate and Teacher Job Satisfaction through Work Motivation The results of the analysis of this study indicate that there is an indirect relationship between organizational climate and teacher job satisfaction through work motivation. This can be seen from the coefficient value of 0.099. These results can be interpreted that there is an indirect relationship between organizational climate and teacher job satisfaction through the work motivation of State Senior High School teachers in Banjarbaru. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Suriansyah (2014)</ref> explains that there are several factors that affect a person's job satisfaction, one of which is the presence or absence of a leadership model in an educational institution. This is in line with Normiati's research (2019) which states that the results of research analysis indicate that principal communication is indirectly related to job satisfaction through teacher work motivation. This is evidenced by the path coefficient value of 0.233, which means that there is a weak indirect relationship between principal communication and teacher job satisfaction through the work motivation of elementary school teachers in South Labuan Amas District. The same thing was also stated by Ngadimun (2019) through the results of path analysis in his research, it is known that principal communication has an influence on teacher discipline then again teacher discipline has an indirect influence on teacher performance of 0.215. Organizational climate is very important to develop because it has many benefits, not only for the school, but also for the teachers themselves. With a good organizational climate, school activities can be carried out in an orderly and smooth manner. Learning can be carried out on time so that curriculum targets can be achieved. In addition, student achievement can also be realized optimally. With the balance between the organizational climate, the teacher's work motivation also increases. The existence of a harmonious organizational atmosphere that is well-run so that an educator has a high level of job satisfaction does not negate his work drive. It is hoped that, as a result of the school's positive organizational climate, teachers will no longer be lazy in carrying out their duties and will be able to indirectly improve their abilities so that they can maximize their ability to convey learning to their students through innovations and variations that cause students to be more enthusiastic about receiving lessons. Meanwhile, it is predicted that a teacher with high job satisfaction would have a high degree of self-confidence and morale in implementing and increasing their professional competence, resulting in the desired teacher performance results.</p></div>
