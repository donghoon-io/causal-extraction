<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Good teacher performance can be interpreted as work achievement, work implementation, work achievement, work results, or performance. <ref type="bibr">Syamsudin (2016)</ref> provides the definition of performance as the level of task implementation that a person can achieve by using existing capabilities and established boundaries to achieve the organization. Bangun (2012) explained that performance is the result of work achieved by a person based on job requirements. Performance is an activity carried out to carry out, complete tasks and responsibilities in accordance with the expectations and goals that have been set <ref type="bibr">(Supardi, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the performance of a teacher can be seen from the work achievements obtained by a teacher, how a teacher carries out tasks in each learning and evaluates learning outcomes and provides follow-up of learning evaluations, and work results obtained by a teacher.</p><p>The factors that can affect a person's performance are complex. Sutermeister in Karweti (2010) describes these factors including training and work experience, education, personality attitudes, organizations, leaders, social conditions, individual needs, physical conditions of the workplace, ability, work motivation and so on.</p><p>The principal as the highest leader in a unit of an educational institution that has duties and responsibilities. In addition to being a leader responsible for educational leadership, as a manager, as well as a decision maker, the principal is the first party to determine the educational dynamics of the school both in terms of progress and setbacks <ref type="bibr">(Iskandar, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, the principal is an educator who has a significant role and function in the quality of education, including in this case the quality of educational output, managerial education, satisfaction with the servants of educational stakholders.</p><p>The leadership style in the organization which includes the functions of conveying information (telling), guiding (selling), participating and delegating will determine the goals of the organization to be achieved, in this case the work performance of its subordinates. Work achievements are the result of work achieved by a teacher in carrying out the tasks charged to him. The better the leadership style in an organization, the more teacher work performance in the organization is expected to increase.</p><p>Situational leadership is a leadership behavior (style) that is based or adapted to the various possible organizational situations (Wahjosumidjo, 2013). The situation in question is the readiness or maturity that subordinates show in carrying out certain tasks and goals.</p><p>In addition to being effectd by the leadership style of the principal, teacher performance is also effectd by several other factors such as organizational culture. Organizational culture is an invisible social force that can move people in an organization to carry out work activities. Organizational culture consists of various elements or elements that not all of which can be observed easily. Organizational culture has a strong impact on work performance or performance. Organizational culture is a more important factor in determining the success or failure of an organization <ref type="bibr">(Tika, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Organizational culture is a very important component in improving a person's performance. The existence of an organizational culture will make it easier for members to adjust to the work environment and help them to know what actions should be taken in accordance with the values that exist in the organization.</p><p>Work motivation is one of the factors that also determine a person's performance. Uno (2016) revealed that teacher work motivation is nothing but a process carried out to move teachers so that their behavior can be directed at real efforts to achieve the goals that have been set. Furthermore, Anoraga (2014) explained that work motivation is something that causes enthusiasm or encouragement to work. This motivation can be internal or external, and can be strong and weak, so motivation is a model in moving and directing teachers to be able to carry out their duties in achieving the goals / objectives that have been set with full awareness and full responsibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>This research uses a quantitative approach. The next research design uses a quantitative approach with a causal correlation design because this study tries to find out the causal correlation, especially on the variables that are correlated, and if any, how close the correlation is and whether or not the correlation is meaningful or not. The correlation between independent variables to dependent variables. The correlation of situational leadership variables (30 items) and work culture (34 items) to teacher performance (14 items) through teacher work motivation (30 items).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Research Design correlation between Variables X, Z1, Z2, and Y</head><p>The population of this study is all teachers consisting of 124 people from 13 elementary schools and is homogeneous, the Slovin formula (Ridwan, 2010: 65) with a confidence level of 5%, then a sample of 95 teachers was obtained. This research technique uses proposional random sampling because the sampling of sample members from the population in a study is carried out randomly without looking at the strata that exist in the population <ref type="bibr">(Sudaryono, 2018: 169)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the data collection method, this research includes quantitative research because this study is characterized by statistical analysis with multiple regression techniques. The design of this study consists of: 1 free variable, 2 intermediate variables and 1 bound variable. The data analysis process follows the steps: (l) data description, analysis requirements, and (3) hypothesis testing. The results of the data description are used as a reference to describe and describe the tendency of each researcher's variable.</p><p>To test the hypothesis using simple regression analysis and multiple regression. For significant tests using a significance level of 0.05.If t-count &gt; t table then Ho is rejected is significant. Conversely if t-count &lt; t-table, Ho received means insignificant.</p><p>The steps taken and the data collection methods used in this study are data on situational leadership (X) on teacher performance (Y) through work culture (Z1) and teacher work motivation (Z2) SDN in West Martapura District. Data are obtained with questionnaires that have been tested for validity and reability. As a respondent-is this existing teacher made a questionnaire. Before the research instrument is used to collect data, an instrument trial is carried out first so that the instrument used really meets the requirements of validity and reliability. Before the instrument is used, an instrument test is carried out. The data from the instrument trials were analyzed to determine the validity and reliability. Furthermore, hypothesis testing in this study uses path analysis with a path structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The data obtained in the study are data on the implementation of situational leadership (X), work culture (Z1), teacher work motivation (Z2), and Teacher performance (Y) Details of the data obtained description of the data as follows:   can be seen that the work culture at intervals of &gt;142.81 in the classification is very high as many as 61 people or by 64.21%. Based on these results it can be stated that The labor culture of labor is at a very high classification.</p><p>3) The degree of tendency to the teacher's work motivation score can be seen in the following table: Based on the table above, it can be seen that there was no assessment of work motivation at intervals of 103 -126 in the high category of 48 people or 50.53%. Based on these results it can be stated that the teacher's work motivation is at a high classification.</p><p>4) The level of tendency to teacher performance scores can be seen in the following table: can be seen that there was no performance appraisal at intervals of ≥ 48 in the very high category of 74 people or 77.89%. Based on these results it can be stated that the teacher's performance is at a high classification Furthermore, the model of analysis of situational leadership paths, work culture and work motivation towards teacher performance as presented in the Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Based on the results of the path analysis research between situational leadership, work culture and work motivation towards Teacher Performance, the discussion of each hypothesis is as follows: A.</p><p>The correlation Between Principal Situational Leadership And Teacher Work Culture The results of the analysis conducted in this study showed that there was a positive and significant correlation directly between the situational leadership of the principal and the work culture. This is evidenced by the value of the path coefficient of 0.330 with a calculated t of 3.542 and a significance of 0.001 so that the significance value is smaller than 0.05. This proves that the situational leadership of the principal can provide a direct connection to the teacher's work culture in teaching and improve the teacher's achievement and creativity. The magnitude of the correlation given by the principal's situational leadership variable to the work culture shown by the R 2 value of 0.332 means that 10.9% of the teacher's work culture is high due to the direct correlation of the principal's situational leadership. Based on the results of the research on the teacher's perception of the situational leadership of the principal, especially the dimensions on high correlation behavior that have the effectiveness of the principal to realize the suggestions of the teachers in the implementation of work tasks to achieve school goals. It can be seen that the behavior of the principal must be able to create a high correlation behavior towards teachers in order to work innovatively and professionally in order to create maximum results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KS (X)</head><note type="other">MK</note><p>Situational leadership is an effort to motivate employees to work to achieve organizational goals, supervise teachers so that their work is coordinated and meets their needs at a higher level. Situational leadership according to Burns is a process that basically "leaders and followers raise themselves up to each other". <ref type="bibr">( Komariah, 2005:77)</ref> The results of this study are in accordance with expert opinion, Robbins (Hariyanto, 2016) states that the work culture is built and maintained based on the philosophy of the founder or leader. culture is strongly associated with the criteria used in employing its followers. The actions of the leadership will be closely related to behavior that is acceptable or unacceptable to his followers.</p><p>Furthermore, this research also strengthens Ndraha's opinion (Sitepu, 2013) saying "The formation of a work culture occurs because it is initiated by the founders or top leaders (top management) or appointed officials, where the magnitude of the correlation they have will determine a separate way what is carried out in the work unit or organization he leads".</p><p>Furthermore, Muchlas &amp; Makmuri (Sitepu, 2013) put forward how the start of work culture is: 1) A person himself (founder) has an idea for a new company; 2) Then the founder brings in one or more other key people and creates a core group that shares the founder's shared vision; 3) The core group of founders began to act harmoniously to create an organization by means of the search for funds, the acquisition of patents, the incorperation, the placement of rooms, construction and so on; 4) At that point, others were brought into the organization and a commonly known history began to be documented.</p><p>Another opinion that is in line with the results of this study was expressed by Susanto (Purnamasari, Bagia &amp; Suwendra, 2016) stating that work culture and situational leadership are interconnected. Leadership involves more than just using power and exercising authority, and is displayed at different levels. At the individual level, for example, leadership involves providing advice, guidance, inspiration and motivation.</p><p>The results of the study on the correlation of situational leadership with work culture that are in line with this study are Suwendra's research (2016) which concluded that situational leadership is positively related to work culture. The magnitude of the situational leadership correlation to work culture is 0.258 which means that there is a direct correlation with the low category. This study shows that the correlation of situational leadership to work culture is 25.80%.</p><p>The results of this study are also in line with Rovida's research (2019) concluding that situational leadership is positively related to work culture. The magnitude of the correlation between situational leadership and work culture is 0.639, which means that there is a direct correlation with the high category. This study showed the correlation of situational leadership to work culture was 63.9%.</p><p>The results of this study are in line with Kailoka's research (2017) which concluded that situational leadership is directly related to work culture. This means that changes in the improvement of situational leadership will cause an increase in the work culture of state junior high school teachers in Depok City. Improved situational leadership will have an impact on work culture. The principal improves learning activities, motivates teaching and learning activities, creates a safe and comfortable working atmosphere and collaborates with teachers to improve the quality of learning in schools. This is in accordance with the results of research by Hefrizon (2014) concluding that situational leadership is related to organizational culture, meaning that the more improved the application of situational leadership styles, the organizational culture will also increase. Situational leadership style to the culture of the organization in relation to the police force that with the presence of a leader who applies a situational leadership style, then members will feel trust, admiration, thoroughness and respect for their leader. Members will also be motivated to do tasks that are more than what they originally expected and are able to be innovative and creative.</p><p>The results of this study reinforce the results of previous studies that found that The results showed situational leadership style gives a positive and significant effect on organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aisyafarda &amp; Sarino, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chichi Rahmayanti, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Tetuko, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The correlation Between Principal Situational Leadership and Teacher Work Motivation</head><p>The results of the analysis of the study showed that there is a direct correlation between situational leadership and work motivation, which is evidenced by the value of the path coefficient of 0.330. With this value it can be concluded that there is a direct correlation of situational leadership to the motivation of the teacher's work. Based on the findings obtained from the answers of teachers who were used as respondents in this study, it can be concluded that situational leadership is related to the work motivation of teachers.</p><p>The results of the study are also relevant to Saleh's research (2019) with the title "The correlation between Principal Leadership, Motivation and Satisfaction with Elementary School Teacher Performance". The results showed that there was a direct correlation between the Principal's Leadership and the teacher's work motivation of 0.974.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation between Situational Leadership and Teacher Performance through Work Culture and Teacher Work Motivation at SDN Martapura Barat, Banjar Regency</head><p>The results of this study are in line with research conducted by Akuoko and Dounkor (2012) which said situational leadership is able to relate to the teacher's work motivation that guides a person's behavior. This requires all teachers to be given teacher motivation in carrying out their duties, namely teaching.</p><p>The results of this study are also relevant to Normianti's research (2019). The results of the analysis of the study showed that directly the leadership of the head is related to the motivation of the teacher's work. This is evidenced by the value of the pathway coefficient of 0.579, which means that there is a moderate correlation between the situational leadership of the principal and the motivation of the work of teachers in Labuan Amas South Primary School.</p><p>The results of this study are also in line with Agustina's research (2019). The results showed that the average score of the total work motivation of teachers was 4.08, which means that the work motivation of state elementary school teachers in Kandangan District, Hulu Sungai Selatan Regency is very high. The opportunity to grow sub-variables obtained the highest average value of 4.20. This value belongs to the very high category, meaning that the teacher has the support of the principal to participate in various activities aimed at improving the teacher's abilities, such as education and training or improvement. In addition, the principal also provides convenience for teachers who want to improve their educational qualifications in the sense that they continue their education to a higher level.</p><p>This research is also corroborated by Murdani's (2016) research "The correlation between The Situational Leadership of Principals and Organizational Commitment with the Work Motivation of State High School Teachers in Banjar Regency. The results of the study stated: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> there is a correlation between the situational leadership of the principal and the work motivation of state high school teachers in Banjar Regency, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> there is a correlation between organizational commitment and work motivation of state high school teachers throughout Banjar Regency, and (3) there is a correlation between the situational leadership of the principal and organizational commitment with the work motivation of state high school teachers throughout Banjar Regency.</p><p>Syarwani (2019) mentioned that leadership style also has a positive effect on motivation with a standard coefficient of 0.117 which means that there is a correlation in the leadership style of the principal on the work motivation of teachers at the State Vocational High School in Banjarmasin.</p><p>The results of the study are also relevant to Aprianti's (2016) research on: "The Contribution of Situational Leadership and Organizational Climate to the Work Motivation of State Elementary School Teachers in North Banjarmasin District". The results of the study concluded that (1) there was a contribution of the principal's situational leadership to the work motivation of state elementary school teachers in North Banjarmasin Subdistrict, (2) there was a contribution of organizational climate to the work motivation of state elementary school teachers in North Banjarmasin District, and (3) there was a contribution of situational leadership of principals and organizational climate to the work motivation of state elementary school teachers in North Banjarmasin Subdistrict.</p><p>The leader has a duty to direct, mobilize, relate and empower members (4 M). Thus, leadership in schools can be interpreted as a person's ability to move, direct, effect and empower the pattern of work and the way teachers and school staff work to be independent in their work <ref type="bibr">(Suhaimi, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Suriansyah (2015)</ref> mentioned that there are 4 indicators that must be met in order for the principal to be successful in carrying out his duties, namely: (1) Openness, (2) Attention to teachers and school staff, (3) Interaction and (4) Decision Makers. Principals can increase teacher motivation by: (1) Implementing open management, (2) Implementing job descriptions with clear tasks and functions, (3) Implementing downward correlation verticals, (4) Mapping programs and activities to improve work motivation, (5) Sustainability and comprehensive supervision, (6) Evaluation. <ref type="bibr">Suriansyah (2015)</ref> mentioned that motivation is an impulse that grows from oneself, both from within and from outside himself to do a job with high spirits using his abilities and skills. To motivate employees, the leadership of the institution / organization must know the motives and motivations desired by the employees. One thing must be understood that people are willing to work because they want to meet their needs, both conscious needs and unconscious needs, in the form of material or non-material, physical and spiritual needs. In addition, the fulfillment of the needs of employees for service and appreciation by superiors for the work achievements they produce in accordance with the principles of justice can motivate their work.</p><p>In his leadership practice, the principal becomes a figure who sets an example, becomes a leader for the school, always motivates and encourages his subordinates to always innovate, work hard and professionally so that they can support development, increase priorities, establish greater interest, always cultivate the loyalty and enthusiasm of teachers and employees in the school, and encourage subordinates to be able to think in a new way in every activity in the school (Suhaimi, 2018).</p><p>The magnitude of the correlations that the leader has determines what and how a job is carried out in an organization he leads. As Sutrisno (2012) posits situational leaders motivate others to do something more than they intended, often even more than what they think. They set more challenging expectations. A leader is expected to be able to create work motivation for teachers. In its implementation, school rules must be fair to all teachers. The rules on display are not just used as attributes of the school. There is no guarantee of complying with the established regulations if it is not supported by high work motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation between Situational Leadership and Teacher Performance through Work Culture and Teacher Work Motivation at SDN Martapura Barat, Banjar Regency</head><p>The results of this study reinforce the results of previous studies which found that Leadership and Work Motivation had a significant effect on The Job Satisfaction ofGadgets, both simultaneously and partially <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fauzyah, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Intopiana et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rismayadi &amp; Maemunah, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The correlation between Principal Situational Leadership and Teacher Performance</head><p>The results of the analysis conducted in this study showed that there was a positive and significant correlation directly between the situational leadership of the principal and performance. This is evidenced by the value of the path coefficient of 0.265 with a calculated t of 2.794 and a significance of 0.006 so that the significance value is smaller than 0.05. This proves that the situational leadership of the principal can provide a direct correlation to the performance of the teacher. The magnitude of the correlation given by the principal's transformational leadership variable to performance indicated by an R 2 value of 0.070 means that 7.0% of teacher performance is due to the direct correlation of the principal's situational leadership.</p><p>Based on the above calculations, it can be concluded that there is a positive correlation of the principal's situational leadership to the performance of teachers. This shows the correlation between one-way walking variables where the higher the situational leadership style of the principal, the higher the teacher's performance, the calculation of the correlation coefficient obtained in this study is 0.265. The value of the correlation coefficient is in the strong category. This means that there is a fairly strong correlation of the principal's situational leadership style to teacher performance. The correlation of the principal's situational leadership style to teacher performance was 26.5%. Teachers cannot be separated from the efforts made by the principal in improving teacher performance through activities carried out by the principal to convey thoughts, give and receive information by applying leadership, providing understanding, straightening out misunderstandings, and providing motivation to teachers who are conveyed directly and non-directly so that teachers improve performance (Rohmah and Karwanto, 2014). This is in line with the role of the principal who acts as a manager or administrator who controls the school's resources to achieve organizational goals. Among these roles include providing effective leadership, thereby improving performance among teachers. (Adeyemi, 2011). Effective leadership depends on the interaction between the situation and the behavior of the leader (Wahyudi, 2015). The above information refers to the conclusion that situational leadership is effective leadership that can be applied by the principal to be able to improve teacher performance, because situational leadership is leadership that is adjusted to the level of maturity of followers in relation to certain tasks <ref type="bibr">(Wahyudi, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The results of the analysis of this study show that there is a direct correlation of the principal's situational leadership to teacher performance. This corresponds to the value of the path coefficient of 0.330. These results can be interpreted as having a direct correlation between the principal's situational leadership and the teacher's work discipline.</p><p>The results of this study in accordance with layton's opinion (Haj &amp; Jubran, 2016) affirm that the principal's practice of situational leadership will achieve the performance of teachers and motivate them to do their best in the workplace. The same thing is stated tucker&amp; russell (Ragaisis, 2018) Situational leadership improves the performance of organizational members by implementing innovation and encouraging others to pursue their role in the organization.</p><p>Further bozkuş (2018) as stated, the fact that individuals who are in the workplace are led by professional leaders can relate to the level of performance. Leaders have an important role to play in providing a correlation to the level of performance. A similar opinion was also expressed by Leithwood (2018) that when situational leadership is effectively applied to educational organizations, it has a positive impact on the condition of schools, as well as on the internal state and behavior of teachers, also contributing to their performance. In addition, Tesfaw (2014) reveals that the lack of effective leadership skills negatively relates to teacher performance.</p><p>Next Okçu (2014) posits that the followers of situational leaders are more motivated towards success and have a higher work discipline when their needs are valued as given tasks. Situational leaders listen to their followers by creating awareness of ideals such as freedom, justice, peace, and equality. They are less bureaucratic, more relational, and more empathetic with their followers, which leads to an increase in the motivation of followers and interest in the success of the organization.</p><p>The results of this study are in line with research by Suyono (2014) which concluded that the situational leadership of the principal is positively related to teacher performance. The magnitude of the correlation between the principal's situational leadership and teacher performance is 0.529, which means that there is a direct correlation with the moderate category. This study showed that the direct correlation of the principal's situational leadership to teacher performance was 52.9%.</p><p>The results of this study are also in line with Nuryuniarti's research (2014) on the correlation of Situational Leadership to Teacher Work at SMK Bina Warga Bandung. Based on the calculation results, the respondent's scoring tendency for Variable X (Situational Leadership) was in the good category, with an average score of 3.79 and Variable Y (Teacher performance) was in the good category, with an average score of 3.93. The magnitude of the correlation of Variable X to variable Y is shown from the results of the analysis of the coefficient of determination of 38.07%, this shows that 38.07% and the remaining 61.03% are related to other factors. The Y regression equation over X. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that there is a positive and significant correlation between Situational Leadership towards teacher performance in The Bandung Citizen Fostered Vocational High School.</p></div>

Thus, it can be concluded that directly the variables of organizational culture have a significant effect on teacher performance.</p><p>The coefficient of determination of the effect of Organizational Culture on Teacher Performance obtained a score of 0.276 It illustrates that the Principal's Managerial Activities have an effect on teacher performance by 27.6%, while the rest can be effectd by other variables that are not included in this study.</p><p>Wirawan (2016) suggests that organizational culture affects the attitudes and behaviors of organizational members which then determines the performance of organizational members. Suhardan (2015) stated that the school's organizational culture fosters how quality and performance are implemented by its members. How habits work to improve themselves is felt as part of his life.</p><p>Robbins (2013:293) describes that organizational culture is an intervening variable. The members of the organization form an overall subjective perception of the organization. This overall perception becomes the culture or culture of that organization. Perceptions that are supportive and perceptions that do not support it, then affect the performance and satisfaction of employees.</p><p>The results of this study are in line with Brown's theory (Masana, 2012: 108) states that: "A strong organizational culture will lead to the achievement of organizational goals and objectives. The members of the organization with all their resources and efforts with full initiative and enthusiasm unite in the same direction by utilizing resources in a non-wasteful manner. That means organizational performance is achieved in a healthy way and pleasing the members of the organization. Thus it can be said that a strong organizational culture will have an impact on the overall performance of the organization". The results of this study are in line with research conducted by (Gusman, 2014; Masambe et al., 2015; Sedarmayanti &amp; Rahadian, 2018; Suriansyah, 2014) who suggests that there is an effect of work culture on the performance of staff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The correlation between work culture and teacher work motivation</head><p>The fifth hypothesis of this study is the existence of a direct correlation of organizational culture to teacher motivation. The conclusion that can be drawn based on the tests that have been carried out is that there is a direct correlation of positive and significant organizational culture variables to teacher motivation. Increasing organizational culture, it will increase the motivation of teachers. One of the determining factors for the high level of low motivation of teachers is determined by the high level of low organizational culture of teachers.</p><p>Based on the results of respondent distribution data on the pie chart chart , it shows that respondents' answers regarding teacher motivational statements are mostly in the category. This means that the motivational indicators, both internal and external, of the teachers obtained quite good results. Internal teacher motivation factors include the encouragement to achieve achievements in carrying out their duties as teachers. As a teacher, the achievement to be achieved is of course the achievement of the completeness of student learning with satisfactory results. If students get an assessment evaluation score with a high category, then it means that the teacher has successfully carried out his duties in learning activities. This achievement will encourage teachers to be even more enthusiastic in carrying out learning activities to get the best grades from students.</p><p>In addition, factors of the teacher's work culture can be internal work motivation are the agenda of rewarding teachers when they excel, challenges that interest teachers in their duties, the teacher's sense of responsibility to their duties, and a promising career path for teachers. These things will provide motivational stimulation to the teacher in carrying out his duties.</p><p>The positive organizational culture of these teachers includes innovating in each of their duties as teachers. The main task of a teacher is to carry out learning. In implementing this learning, a teacher is required to always innovate to get something new. These innovations in learning will improve the quality of teaching and learning activities from teachers, both in terms of methods, models, techniques, and learning strategies.</p><p>Furthermore, the good culture of the teacher is that a teacher must dare to take risks in his duties. Whatever field of work a person certainly has risks, as well as work as a teacher. a teacher must dare to take risks in every action. There are many</p></div>

Based on the response from elementary school teachers in West Martapura Subdistrict, Banjar Regency, it shows that the majority of teachers feel that the principal gives directions to prioritize school stability. The principal encouraged the teacher to pay attention to every detail of the task charged to him. In addition, the principal encourages teachers to innovate in tasks and work with great precision. On the other hand, the respondents' answers stated that respondents felt that the principal still did not encourage teachers to work with a focus on results and did not think about teachers for their welfare.</p><p>The same previous research was Sutoro's research (2020) which found that there was a correlation between organizational culture and the work motivation of BPSDM employees in Jambi Province. In the research of Masykur, Septuri, &amp; Setiawati (2019) obtained the results that there is a positive and significant correlation of organizational culture to teacher work motivation.

The study showed that the magnitude of the correlation coefficient was 0.634 and the value of r was 0.402. The contribution resulting from work motivation to teacher performance is 40.20%. This means that the greater a person's work motivation, the greater the performance of the teacher.</p><p>Many opinions explain the correlation between work motivation and performance, including Nawawi <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref> states that motivation has a basic motive that means encouragement, cause or reason for someone to do something.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. The Indirect correlation between principal situational leadership and teacher performance through teacher work culture</head><p>From the results of the above calculations can be calculated the indirect effect of Situational Leadership on teacher performance through Work Culture. It was concluded that the indirect effect of Situational Leadership on teacher performance through Work Culture was 0.092. The gains are contributed by a significant direct correlation between the principal's situational leadership and work culture. with a path coefficient value of 0.330 and the correlation of organizational culture with teacher performance obtained an R value of 0.276 Thesituational leadership of the principal is one of the factors that effect teacher performance through Organizational culture is a key factor that plays an important role in daily activities, work culture is an intrinsic factor of organizational behavior. Leadership is an overarching pattern of the actions of a leader, whether visible or invisible to his subordinates, implicated by the existence of policies related to the richness of school organizations in treating every school citizen to achieve teacher performance.</p><p>Situational leadership is leadership that focuses on the appropriateness of the relevant level of maturity or development of the followers. Maturity in situational leadership is formulated as the ability and willingness of people to take responsibility in directing their behavior related to a specific task. (Thoha, 2012, pp. 322-324).</p><p>With Organizational culture as values, beliefs, customs norms and ethics that give symbols to each member within the organization. Facilitating the achievement of performance is an activity carried out to carry out tasks and responsibilities in accordance with the expectations and goals that have been set. According to (Supardi, 2014) with leadership and work culture in carrying out the best implementation of learning tasks in planning teaching programs, implementing learning activities and evaluating learning outcomes. Therefore, performance can be interpreted as the result of leadership and work culture that can be achieved by a person or group of people in an organization in order to achieve goals.</p><p>Dwiyani and Sarino (2014) stated that there is a positive effect between the situational leadership style of the principal on teacher performance through work culture. This is evidenced by the simple linear regression equation for the hypothesis of the principal's situational leadership style variables towards teacher performance is: y= 39.749x+ 0.495 with a constant of 39.749 can be interpreted teacher performance and work culture is worth 39.65 if the principal's situational leadership style remains. This shows the correlation between one-way walking variables where the higher the situational leadership style of the principal, the higher the work culture followed by teacher performance, the calculation of the correlation coefficient obtained in this study is 0.5362. The value of the correlation coefficient is in the medium / quite strong category. This means that there is a considerable effect of the principal's situational leadership style on teacher performance through teacher culture. Based on the value of the coefficient of determination, the effect of the principal's situational leadership style on teacher performance through work culture was 28.75%.</p><p>Likewise, Suparno's research, the results of this study stated that the situational leadership variable (X2) linearly has a positive effect on teacher performance (Y) by 0.797 through work culture, which means that the better the situational leadership (X2), the work culture (Z) followed by teacher performance (Y) will increase. Meanwhile, when viewed from the results of the coefficient of determination of 0.584, it shows that teacher performance (Y) is effectd by situational leadership (X2) of 58.4%.</p><p>Furthermore, the results of this study were supported by Nurhidayah's research in a study entitled "Situational Leadership Impact on Performance through the work culture of elementary school teachers in Cluster 1, Berabai District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency". The results of this study stated that situational leadership (X) with Ry1.2 = 0.6354 is the first rank, while the partial correlation coefficient of the work culture variable (Z) with ry2.1 = 0.3923 is the second rank. This means the principal's situational leadership has a stronger effect than the work culture on teacher performance (Y). Thus situational leadership is prioritized to effect the improvement of teacher performance through improving work culture. The results of this study strengthen the results of previous research (H <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kara, 2014</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect correlation between Principal Situational Leadership and Teacher Performance through Teacher Work Motivation</head><p>The results of the analysis of this study show that there is an indirect correlation of the principal's situational leadership to teacher performance through work motivation, which is evidenced by the multiplication of the path coefficient of the direct correlation of variable X to Z1 (P3) with the path coefficient of direct correlation of variable Z1 to Y (P5), namely: 0.330 x 0.306 = 0.101. This means that there is an indirect correlation between the situational leadership variable (X) to teacher performance (Y) through work motivation (Z1) of 0.101 This is in line with Agustina's research (2019) which states that there is an indirect correlation between the role of the principal and teacher performance through the work motivation of state elementary school teachers in Kandangan District of 0.895. This is in line with research by Sundari (2019) which states that there is a correlation between the situational leadership of the principal and the performance of teachers through work motivation of 0.238. It is stated that one of the important competencies that a leader must possess is the ability to be able to motivate his subordinates. The principal acts as a motivator for subordinates and the surrounding environment. Leadership has a very large correlation in improving the performance of employees, because the leader is a role model and a highlight from subordinates. So if an organization wants to have high performance, it needs leadership that is able to move subordinates so that they feel motivated indoing high-performance work.</p><p>Wahyu (2019) also stated that the same is evidenced from the results of the analysis that the situational leadership of the principal is situational with the performance of the teacher through work motivation. This is evidenced by the path coefficient value of 0.688 which means that there is a strong correlation between situational leadership and teacher performance through teacher work motivation at SMP Negeri Banjarmasin Timur Kota Banjarmasin.</p><p>The results of this study are in accordance with the theorization of Budiman (2016) states that the interaction between leaders and subordinates is to change the behavior of subordinates to feel capable and highly motivated and strive to achieve higher and higher quality work achievements. It is further stated that making changes in the attitudes and behavior of members/staff can only be done with situational leadership.</p><p>The results of this study are also in accordance with the opinion of Tarter (Budiman, 2016)) stated that given the importance of the principal's leadership to the performance of teachers in schools, a principal must be able to encourage and create work motivation for teachers, which allows teachers to work comfortably and calmly, full of familiarity and mutual respect. The same thing was also stated by Miner (Budiman, 2016) that the interaction between qualified superiors and subordinates will have an impact such as work motivation, productivity and employee performance.</p><p>The same thing was also stated by Suhaimi (2019) who said the results of the research analysis showed that indirectly the situational leadership of the principal was related to teacher performance through work motivation. This is evidenced by the pathway coefficient value of 0.517, which means that there is a moderate indirect correlation between the principal's situational leadership and teacher performance through the motivation of teachers working at Labuan Amas Selatan Primary School. This is in line with research from Cahyani (2016) which states that between situational leadership to performance through work motivation obtained a value of 0.161 &lt;0.588, this shows that work motivation mediates situational leadership on positive performance. This means that better situational leadership will lead to high work motivation. So situational leadership has a positive correlation to performance through work motivation and can be expressed if there is an indirect correlation between situational leadership and performance.</p><p>The results of this study are also supported by research from Priyanto (2016) which states that situational leadership has a significant positive correlation to performance through work motivation. Then it is also supported by research from Tucunan, (2014) which states that situational leadership has a positive and significant correlation to performance through motivation. So it can be concluded that with high leadership and motivation can improve performance.</p><p>This research is also in line with previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Rizal (2019)</ref> on the correlation of Leadership and Work Motivation to the Performance of Junior High School Teachers in Bantarbolang District.

The Indirect correlation between school principal's situational leadership and work motivation through teacher work culture</head><p>The results of the analysis of this study show that there is an indirect correlation of the principal's situational leadership to work motivation through the teacher's work culture, which is evidenced by the multiplication of the path coefficient of the direct correlation of variable X to Z2 (P1) with the path coefficient of direct correlation of variable Z2 to Y (P5), namely: 0.332 x 0.286 = 0.095. This means that there is an indirect correlation between the Principal's Situational Leadership variable (X) and teacher motivation (Z2) through work culture (Z1) of 0.095. The results of this study prove that the situational leadership factor of the principal is related to teacher motivation through work culture. A good work culture and work motivation cannot run optimally if the leader in a school does not have good situational leadership of the principal.</p><p>The results of this study are in accordance with expert opinion, Robbins (Hariyanto, 2016) states that a work culture is built and maintained based on leaders. culture is strongly associated with the criteria used in employing its followers. The actions of the leadership will be closely related to behavior that is acceptable or unacceptable to his followers. In this section, the factors of teacher work culture can be used as internal work motivation is the agenda of rewarding teachers when they excel, challenges that are interesting to teachers in their duties, teachers' sense of responsibility for their duties, and promising career paths for teachers. These things will provide motivational stimulation to the teacher in carrying out his duties.</p><p>Then the factors of the teacher's work culture can be the motivation of work from is, reasonable supervision of the teacher, a conducive work climate that provides comfort to the teacher at work, a harmonious correlation in getting along with colleagues, the income that the teacher receives that is decent and commensurate with his work, the rules set by the school are felt to meet the sense of justice and welfare of the teacher. The motivational indicators of the teacher can be related, one of which is by the positive organizational culture of the teachers in their school environment.</p><p>Another opinion that is in line with the results of this study was expressed by Susanto (Purnamasari, Bagia &amp; Suwendra, 2016) stating that work culture and situational leadership are interconnected. Leadership involves more than just using power and exercising authority, and is displayed at different levels. At the individual level, for example, leadership encourages and relates work motivation.</p><p>The results of the study on the correlation of situational leadership with work culture that are in line with this study are suwendra's research (2016) which concluded that situational leadership is positively related to work culture. The magnitude of the situational leadership correlation to work culture is 0.182 which means that there is a direct correlation with the low category. This study shows that the correlation of situational leadership to work motivation through work culture is 18.20%,</p><p>The results of this study are in line with Kailoka's research (2017) stating that situational leadership is directly related to work culture. And situational leadership is indirectly related to work motivation through work culture, which means that changes in situational leadership improvement will lead to an increase in work motivation through the work culture of state junior high school teachers in Depok City. Improving situational leadership will have an impact on work motivation through work culture. The principal improves learning activities, motivates teaching and learning activities, creates a safe and comfortable working atmosphere and collaborates with teachers to improve the quality of learning in schools. This is in accordance with the results of research by Hefrizon (2014) concluding that situational leadership is related to work motivation through organizational culture, meaning that the more increased the application of situational leadership styles, work motivation through work culture will increase. Situational leadership style to the culture of the organization in relation to the police force that with the presence of a leader who applies a situational leadership style, then members will feel trust, admiration, thoroughness and respect for their leader. Members will also be motivated to do tasks that are more than what they originally expected and are able to be innovative and creative.
