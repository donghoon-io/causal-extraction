<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Gambling behavior has received considerable research attention from academicians and therapists. Gambling behavior refers to betting on specific games, such as cards, dice, lotteries, roulette, races and sport events. Numerous studies have presented the prevalence rates of gambling in various areas and pointed out the severity of problem gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Shaffer et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ladouceur, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dickerson et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Wong &amp; So, 2003)</ref>. In Macau, gambling has always been one of the most conspicuous issues. On one hand, Macau is the only place where casino gambling is legalized in China. The administration decided to open up the casino sector in order to promote economic growth. Since then, gambling has been serving as the main contributor to Macau's economy. Owing to the large quantity of tourists from mainland China, Macau has overtaken Las Vegas as the world's No. 1 gambling market. Tax revenue from gaming sector in year 2013 is over 134 million MOPs, accounting for 86.4% of total government revenue (Macau Statistics and Census Service). On the other hand, gambling can become a form of addiction for some individuals, which may induce serious gambling problems for many people. Pathological gambling can lead to a range of severe familial and social problems.</p><p>Many countries are recognizing the harm from gambling behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Strorer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Delvin &amp; Walton, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lobsinger &amp; Beckett, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dowling et al., 2014)</ref>. A study of Macau's people participation in gambling activities conducted by Macau University (2014) revealed that Macao residents' gambling participation rate in 2013 was 49.5%. Additionally, the survey found that personal background is associated with gambling behavior. To deeper understand the problem of gambling, researchers have completed a large amount of reviews and analyses.</p><p>A substantial body of research has been conducted on risk propensity personality and risk taking behavior. The results suggested that various forms of risky behavior tend to correlate with higher risk-taking personality trait score (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Samuals et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Zuckerman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">White et al., 1994)</ref>. If such personality traits are associated with real-world risk-taking in various domains, high levels of these traits should be significantly associated with a behavioral preference for risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Maclaren et al. (2015)</ref> found that gambling motive and distorted belief mediate the personality trait and gambling behavior among electronic gaming machine. Drawing on learning style theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Curry, 1983)</ref> which illuminates the connection of personality, cognition, and behavior, we developed a model that incorporates gambling cognition as mediator in order to gain a more complete understanding the relationship between risk propensity and gambling behavior.</p><p>Previous gambling research has explored the interaction effects among internal components of gamblers such as emotions, stress or impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Tang, Chua, &amp; Wu, 2011)</ref>. We are interested in testing the interplay among external components, namely familial monitoring and peer gambling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Low and Espelage (2014)</ref> found that parental monitoring protects adolescents from deviant behavior, thus buffered the effects of community violence exposure on perpetration and victimization. As for peer influence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allen et al. (2006)</ref> figured out that individual with a lower resistance to peer influence is prone to engage in risk-taking or antisocial behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Maxwell (2002)</ref> analyzed peer influence across five risky behavior-smoking, alcohol consuming, marijuana use, tobacco chewing, and sex debut. He found that a random same sex peer predicts a teen's risky behavior initiation.</p><p>In this study, we offer a theoretical framework presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> that is designed to enhance our understanding of the way in which gambling cognition mediates relationship between risk propensity and gambling behavior. We then empirically examined this framework to evaluate the mediating role. In the process, our analyses serve to respectively examine the moderating effects of familial monitoring and peer gambling in different context. The present study explains and synthesizes conclusions obtained in extant literature and provides new insights regarding the theoretical connection between risk propensity and gambling behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Theoretical model of study prediction</head><p>Finally, the sample of our study deserved mentioned. Dominant studies on gambling have been conducted from Western samples. As one of the largest gambling market in the world, Macau has rarely been subject to sophisticated empirical studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ozorio and Fong (2004)</ref> estimated the prevalence rates of gambling in Macau and analyzed the ratio of different groups of gamblers. <ref type="bibr">Tao et al. (2011)</ref> collected data from Macau to develop an indigenous inventory GMAB (Gambling Motives, Attitudes and Behaviors) for Chinese gamblers. In our study, we tested some critical components related to gambling behavior using the data collected from Macau.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Risk Propensity and Gambling Behaviors</head><p>A key feature of gambling is that it involves risky choice, in that outcomes are typically both uncertain, and potentially harmful. Evidence from risk and health behavior research suggests that when faced with risky choices, agents' perceptions of risk play a significant role in determining intention, and subsequent behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Breakwell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Morgan et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Oei &amp; Jardim, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Siegrist et al., 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Knowles et al. (1973)</ref> found that subjects who had a greater preference for gambling were viewed by peers as risk-takers, were less likely to avoid research sessions dealing with risk, more likely to report risky driving behavior, and were more likely to smoke cigarettes.</p><p>Theoretically, risk propensity positively relates to gambling behaviors for several reasons. First, gambling behaviors can be regards as a situation-specific risk taking domain. <ref type="bibr">MacCrimmon and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wehrung (1988, 1990)</ref> suggested that risk taking tended to be situation-specific. These situations with which respondents had demonstrated different degrees of risk taking included games of chance/gambling, financial investment, business decisions, and personal decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ozorio and Fong (2004)</ref> concluded that gambling and investment were two situation-specific risk taking domains. Furthermore, on the basis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Zaleskiewicz's (1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Zaleskiewicz's ( , 2001) )</ref> stimulating-instrumental risk taking behavior, individuals were found to exhibit what they labeled Stimulating Risk Taking (SRT) behavior in stimulating situations of high excitatory value like gambling. While in instrumental economic situations like investing in the stock market or in one's own education, individuals were found to behave in what was labeled as Instrumental Risk Taking (IRT) way. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Weber, Blais and Betz (2002)</ref> suggested that both SRT and IRT were found related contributing significantly and positively to gambling.</p><p>Second, gambling may be seen as not only a form of risk-taking but also sensation-seeking. Extant literature has found that high sensation seekers choose riskier strategies (e.g., gambling, dangerous driving) compared to low sensation seekers <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mishra &amp; Lalumière, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Waters &amp; Kirk, 1968</ref>). Sensation-seeking describes a preference for varied, stimulating experiences and a willingness to engage in risk-taking in order to obtain such experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Zuckerman, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Wong and Carducci (1991)</ref> reported that the risks related to gambling involvement have a tendency to increase levels of enjoyment/arousal preferred by individuals who are high in sensation-seeking. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Powell et al. (1999)</ref> attempted to determine whether risk-taking and sensation-seeking differentiated pathological from problem gamblers. Drawing support from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lesieur and Blume's (1987)</ref> South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), which is widely used measure in the assessment of pathological gambling, they indicated that pathological gambling was strongly related to risk-taking and sensation seeking behavior. Thus, higher levels of risk propensity are more likely lead to stronger sensation-seeking, resulting in choices of riskier strategies such of gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cloninger, 1987)</ref>. In other words, as gambling may bring high levels of sensation as a risk-taking domain, higher risk takers may be more willing to engage in gambling to obtain or absorb this enjoyment/arousal. Third, support for the relationship between risk approach motivation and the choice to approach a risky situation (e.g., gambling), has been provided in the previous research. With assessments via Risk Taking Questionnaire (RTQ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Knowles (1976a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Knowles ( , 1976b) )</ref> indicated that the RTQ was positively correlated with the decision to participate in a gamble as high risk subjects had a greater likelihood of wagering a dollar in the hypothetical situation than low risk approach subjects. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Knowles (1976c)</ref> found that high-risk takers viewed the risk as more appealing and significantly less risky compared to low-risk takers. In other words, individuals with high-risk taking may be more willing to enter a risk situation because they do not perceive it as risky as do low-risk approach ones. Therefore, as discussed above, we hypothesize the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Risk propensity is positively related to gambling behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gambling Cognition and Gambling Behavior</head><p>On the basis of the three-layered "Onion Model" theory designed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Curry (1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Curry ( , 2000))</ref>, individual's cognition is related to his behavior. The "Onion Model" theory situates existing style theories in an integrated model that distinguishes three levels, organizing as the layers of an onion: an inner "cognitive personality style" layer, a middle "information-processing style" layer, and an outer "instructional preference" layer. The outermost layer labeled as "instructional preferences" refers to "the individual's choice of environment in which to learn" <ref type="bibr">(Curry, 1983, p. 8)</ref>. As the layer interacts most directly with external features, it is regarded as the most observable layer, linking individual's internal features such as cognition and personality with behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cools &amp; Bellens, 2012)</ref>. In this study, based on the "instructional preferences" theory, we hypothesize that gamblers' cognitive distortions are related to gambling behaviors. Support for the role of cognitive variables in gambling behavior has been reviewed by various literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ladouceur &amp; Walker, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Toneatto, 1999)</ref>. They suggested that problem gamblers hold cognitive distortions, leading to their inability to adequately control their gambling. Identifications of gambling-related cognitive distortions include two major aspects: the gambler's fallacy, which is the belief that future outcomes can be predicted on the basis of previous outcomes (e.g., if heads has come up on 10 consecutive tosses of a coin, then tails is more likely to come up on the next toss), and an illusion of control, referring to the belief that one can influence the outcome of a chance-determined event <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Langer, 1975)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Steenbergh et al. (2002)</ref> designed the Gamblers' Beliefs Questionnaire (GBQ) to assess this two-factor conceptualization of gambling-related cognitive distortions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Spurrier &amp; Blaszczynski, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ladouceur &amp; Walker, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Walker, 1992)</ref>, including the "Luck/Perseverance" and "Illusion of Control" factors. Therefore, in this study, we develop this two-factor model of gamblers' cognitive distortions linking with gambling behaviors.</p><p>Theoretically, two perspectives can be explained into the reasons for the positive relationships between g gamblers' cognitive distortions and gambling behaviors. First, higher level of gambler's fallacy on "Luck/Perseverance" has been supported to be a significantly factor in increasing risk-taking behaviors, with more positive expectations on future outcomes based on past outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Spurrier &amp; Blaszczynski, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gillespie, Derevensky, &amp; Gupta, 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wickwire, Whelan, &amp; Meyers, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Walker (1992)</ref>, for example, explained that gambler's fallacy on "Luck/Perseverance" leads gamblers to overestimate their chances of winning. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Gillespie, Derevensky, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Gupta (2007a, 2007b)</ref> found that Probable Pathological Gamblers (PPGs) and at-risk gamblers more strongly anticipated positive outcomes (winning; enjoyment; self-enhancement) than social gamblers, who in turn anticipated positive outcomes more than non-gamblers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wong and Tsang (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wickwire, Whelan and Meyers, (2010)</ref> also suggested that Chinese adolescents with greater gambling involvement reported higher expectations of positive outcomes (social benefit and material gain) and some negative outcomes (being out of control). Thus, with higher levels of fallacy on "Luck/Perseverance", gamblers may overestimate their chances and exhibit more positive expectations on outcomes, which in turn increase their gambling behaviors.</p><p>Second, "Illusion of Control" factor, as a skill orientation toward gambling, has been linked to gambling behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dixon, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Griffiths, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ladouceur &amp; Walker, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Langer, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Walker, 1992)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Langer (1975)</ref> found that individuals placed higher wagers on games that fostered an illusion of control. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Delfabro and Winefield (2000)</ref> found that players who staked more money also exhibited more thoughts, which in turn would suggest they erroneously assessed their ability/skills to control the game. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Davis, Sundahl and Lesbo (2000)</ref> suggested that gamblers placed higher bets on their own dice rolls relative to when others rolled the dice, with beliefs that they obtained more skills/controls to influence outcomes. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Martinez et al. (2011)</ref> also validated a causal model where the knowledge of another person's win increased gamblers' illusion of control with the belief that the other person had some control over the outcomes, which in turn encourages risk taking. Therefore, a direct causal link between gamblers' cognitive distortions and gambling behaviors remains to be empirically established in this study.</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Gambling cognition is positively related to gambling behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The Mediating Role of Gambling Cognition</head><p>The "Onion Model" theory provides a theoretical basis for understanding how gambling cognitive distortions may mediate the relationship between risk taking and gambling behaviors. In <ref type="bibr">Curry's onion model (1983)</ref>, the innermost layer is defined as "cognitive personality style", which is an approach to adapting and assimilating information. He further explained "this adaptation does not interact directly with the environment; rather this is an underlying and relatively permanent personality dimension. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Farley (1991)</ref> described the personality dimension of sensation seeking, arousal seeking, and risk taking as "Type T Personality", risk taking can be regarded as a dimension of personality.</p><p>The second layer is named "information-processing style" and refers to the individual's approach to assimilate information (i.e., orientation, sensory loading, short-term memory, enhanced association, coding system, long-term storage), creating their own cognitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cools &amp; Bellens, 2012)</ref>. Thus, the link between these two layers-"cognitive personality style" and "information-processing style" can be explained that specific personality will result in the seeking for this matching information. On the basis of Curry's model, people with higher level of risk-taking as a specific personality domain, are more willing to collect and adapt information, which related to risk-taking behaviors such as gambling. When gamblers with higher risk-taking are exposed to the gambling-related distorted and deceptive information (e.g., "the knowledge and skill in gambling contribute to the likelihood that it will make money"), they are more likely to generate cognitive distortions, which in turn lead to more risk-taking behaviors in gambling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Caron and Ladouceur (2003)</ref>, for example, showed that gamblers exposed to an accomplice's deceptive verbalizations (e.g., "now, I played really badly!") took more risks. Given that they assemble more information about luck or chances in their experience, they are easier to foster any gambling-related cognition such as "gambling is challenging" and "gambling is more than just luck". "Instructional preferences", the outermost layer, is most observable and most influenced layer, referring to "the individual's choice of environment in which to learn" <ref type="bibr">(Curry, 1983, p. 8)</ref>. In this layer, individuals may have specific behaviors in the matching environment which provides them correlating information to learn. Thus, the link between the second layer-"information-processing style" and the outermost layer-"instructional preferences", can be describe that specific information collection and processing will create corresponding cognition, which in turn lead to its observable behaviors. On the basis of Curry's theory, gamblers with greater cognitive distortions are more likely to take risky behaviors such as gambling. For example, gamblers with higher level of fallacy on cognitive distortions are more likely to expect more positively on future outcomes, leading to increasing risky behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Spurrier &amp; Blaszczynski, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wickwire, Whelan, &amp; Meyers, 2010)</ref>. Gamblers may also behave with overestimation of their skills and abilities on expecting the outcomes, and then they are more willing to take risk in the gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, Sundahl, &amp; Lesbo, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>According to Curry's model, these three layers-"cognitive personality style", "information-processing style" and "information-processing style" can be linked into a integrated mechanism explaining the relationship between risk taking, gambling cognitive distortions and gambling behaviors. In the gambling scenario, individuals with higher level of risk-taking personality may be more willing to seek and obtain information related to risk taking such as gambling, influencing the creation of cognitions about gambling, which in turn lead to the effects on gambling behaviors. Thus, according to the above logic, we expect gambling cognitive distortions to play a mediating role in the risk propensity-gambling behavior relationship. That is, risk taking, through their positive impact on gambling cognitive distortions, increases gambling behaviors.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Gambling cognition mediates the relationship between risk propensity and gambling behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">The Moderating Role of Familial Monitoring</head><p>Prior research has noted the boundary effects of familial monitoring on individual's responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hartos et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stice, Barrera, &amp; Chassin, 1993)</ref>. As proposed at the outset, the process of cognitions generation can be moderated by the extent of familial monitoring-monitoring from family members. Familial monitoring refers to the "familial awareness of the other family members' activities and (communication) to the other family members that the family is concerned about, and aware of, the other family members' activities" <ref type="bibr">(Dishion &amp; McMahon, 1998, p. 65)</ref>. Effective monitoring is based on clearly communicating to the other family members' aspects of both structure (i.e., guidance, support, and limit-setting) and tracking (supervision of whereabouts and activities) <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Vitaro et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hartos et al., 2000)</ref>. In the context of high familial monitoring, family provides both instrumental (e.g., financial supports and skill-related advice) <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Vitaro et al., 2008)</ref> and socio-emotional (e.g., involvement, trust, warmth, and nurturance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Darbyshire, Oster, &amp; Carrig, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jacob et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jacobson &amp; Crockett, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">McGee et al., 2000)</ref> support.</p><p>Familial monitoring is negatively associated with a wide range of individuals' problem cognitive outcomes, such as antisocial personality, tendency to gambling and risky driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hartos et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Vachon et al., 2004)</ref>. In terms of adolescents, low familial monitoring could play a role with regard to adolescents' adjustment problems because adolescents with family members who are not aware of how and with whom their children spend their free time have more opportunities to engage in antisocial activities. Furthermore, poor familial monitoring has been shown to predict affiliation with deviant peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dishion et al., 1991)</ref> which in turn results in both antisocial behavior and depressive feelings. Consistent familial monitoring has also been long implicated in shaping peer-group selection, in part due to fewer opportunities to have negative peer relationships, which in turn lead to fewer externalizing behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Low &amp; Espelage, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li, Fiegelman, &amp; Stanton, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mason et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patterson, De-Baryshe, &amp; Ramsey, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>On the basis of <ref type="bibr">Curry's model (1983)</ref>, personalities affect the creation of cognitions through the link between "cognitive personality style" and "information-processing style", which suggests the process of information seeking, collection and processing. During this period, familial monitoring may serve as an important mechanism "information filtering" <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Low &amp; Espelage, 2014)</ref>. Individuals with high risk propensity are more willing to collect risk-taking related information such as gambling knowledge and skills. With effective familial monitoring which regarded as a "peer-group selecting shaper", they are less likely to be exposed to their accomplices' gambling-related distorted and deceptive verbalizations, which, in turn lead to less cognitive distortions generations. Therefore, according to Curry's theory, we hypothesize that familial monitoring can be regarded as a moderator, affecting the relationship between risk propensity and gambling cognitive distortions during the period of gamble-related information processing. We proposed the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 4: Familial monitoring moderates the relationship between risk propensity and gambling cognition such that the positive relationship is weaker when familial monitoring is high as opposed to low.</p></div>

On the basis of social learning theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandura, 1977)</ref>, susceptibility to peer modeling is thought to encourage individuals' tendency to engage in risky behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner &amp; Steinberg, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jaccard, Blanton, &amp; Dodge, 2005)</ref>. Peer modeling may include direct encouragement of risky behaviors, by instigating individuals to engage in risky activities, or may also be indirect, by encouraging individuals to become involved in risky behaviors because they perceive that the peer group would regard such behaviors as desirable and expected, and then adopt their styles, values and behaviors to match that peer group.</p><p>According to Curry's model, the outset layer is most influenced, referring to "the individual's choice of environment in which to learn" <ref type="bibr">(Curry, 1983, p. 8)</ref>. Individuals with high gambling cognitive distortions are more willing to behave learning process in gamble-related environments. On the basis of social learning theory, in the gamble-related circumstances, peer group with heavy gambling behaviors may directly encourage more risky gambling behavior, through affecting the others with gambling cognitive distortions by positive gambling outcomes, or deceptive verbalizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Smorti, Guarnieri, &amp; Ingoglia, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Caron &amp; Ladouceur, 2003)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Mushquash (2004)</ref> reported that about half of 182 respondents from the general public felt the urge to gamble after learning that someone else had won. Thus, we propose the compensatory role played by peer gambling and suggest that peer gambling will facilitate the positive impacts of gambling cognitive distortions on gambling behaviors. We hypothesized the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Peer gambling moderates the relationship between gambling cognition and gambling behavior such that the positive relationship is stronger when peer gambling is high as opposed to low.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Procedures and Respondents</head><p>Respondents were 250 local residents and tourists in Macau. Questionnaires were administered to local residents and tour group members who were around the casinos. Respondents who were around the casinos were expected to be more frequently involved in gambling than other places. Feedbacks from them should better reflect the features of gamblers. Respondents were informed that the purpose of the survey was to assess gambling behavior and the influencing factors and the responses were anonymous and confidential.</p><p>A total of 207 valid responses were collected, representing a response rate of 82.8%. Of the 207 respondents, 56.5% were male and 43.5% were female, 49.3% were unmarried or divorce and 50.7% were married. Age of the respondents ranged from 18 to 59. With the consideration of the huge amount of tourists from mainland China, we measure the income of respondents by two types of currencies (MOP and RMB) in the questionnaires. The details of the sample characteristics were summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Gambling Behavior</head><p>The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lesieur &amp; Blume, 1987)</ref> includes a measure of severity of gambling behavior. SOGS is an internationally and frequently used instrument to assess pathological gambling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Battersby et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wies &amp; Manos, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Vitaro et al., 2008)</ref> and even further revised for adolescents (SOGS-RA) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Winters, Stinchfield and Fulkerson (1993)</ref>. In our study, six items are selected to assess the frequency with which respondents have engaged in gambling behaviors and experienced gambling consequence over the past 12 months (1-never, 2-rarely, 3-sometimes, 4-usually, 5-always). Sample items include "How often have you participate in games of chance in the past 12 months", "Have you ever hidden betting slips, lottery tickets, gambling money, or other signs of gambling from your family members". Reliability of the scale has been validated and used in many studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Shaffer, Hall, &amp; Vander Bilt, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Volberg &amp; Abbott, 1994</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Gambling Cognition</head><p>Steenbergh et al. ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) developed the Gambling Belief Questionnaire (GBQ) which is a systematic way of assessing gambling-related irrational beliefs. The GBQ has been extensively used in western cultural context <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wohl &amp; Enzle, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Wohl et al., 2007)</ref> while the Chinese version of GBQ was validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wong and Tsang (2012)</ref>. They regarded that GBQ showed adequate psychometric properties with satisfactory high reliabilities and significant correlations with gambling variables. It is a two-factor scale and each item is rated on a Likert 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale. Respondents were asked to 5 items, with higher scores reflecting more cognitive errors. Sample items include "I have more skills and knowledge related to gambling than most people who gamble.", "I should keep track of previous winning bets so that I can figure out how I should bet in the future.". Internal consistency reliability of the scale has been tested by various investigators (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Steenbergh et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wong &amp; Tsang, 2012</ref>). Cronbach's alpha for current study is 0.83.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Risk Propensity</head><p>Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) which was developed by <ref type="bibr">Tellegen (1982)</ref> is used in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Tellegen et al. (2002)</ref> regarded that "the MPQ provides for a fine-grained analysis of personality by measuring a range of discrete trait dispositions at the lower order level. Additionally, it has a higher order dimensional structure that maps onto constructs of emotion and temperament, which have direct psychobiological referents". The MPQ is widely used to measure personality in various fields and has been validated and standardized on normal populations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Seligson et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hwang et al., 2012)</ref>. Risk propensity for current study is consisted of four items which are drawn from negatively keyed items in harm avoidance section of the MPQ (1-strongly disagree, 2-disagree, 3-cannot say, 4-agree, 5-strongly agree). Sample items include "It would be fun to explore an old abandoned house at night." and "I would enjoy trying to cross the ocean in a small but seaworthy sailboat.".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Peer Gambling</head><p>Five items were used to assess perception of peer gambling behavior (1-never, 2-rarely, 3-sometimes, 4-usually, 5-always). The items assessed respondents' perception of the frequency and sample items include "Do any of your close friends have gambled in the past 12 months?" and "I have advised my peers on their gambling problems in the past 12 months.".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">Familial Monitoring</head><p>We referred to the Pittsburgh Youth Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Loeber et al., 1998)</ref> when assessing familial monitoring. Initially the scale was designed to evaluate ineffective parental practices and it is composed of two subscales: coercive disciplinary practices and monitoring. Four items were drawn from the monitoring scale and revised for adults in current study. Sample items are "Do your family members know the friends with whom you hang out during your free time?" and "Do your family members know where you are when you are not home?".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6">Control Variables</head><p>The study reviews previous research focusing on the relationship between gambling behavior and some demographic variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Shaffer, Hall and Vander Bilt (1999)</ref> reported that prevalence rates of problem gambling were higher among adolescents than among older adults. They further provided breakdowns of prevalence rates of disordered gambling by gender and demonstrated that male gender can be a risk factor for gambling problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Volberg (1994)</ref> reported that pathological gambler were less likely to be married than non-gamblers and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ladouceur (1991)</ref> noted that percentage of married problem gamblers were lower than average. In terms of income, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ladouceur (1991)</ref> presented that two lowest income groups had disproportionally high rates of disordered gamblers in his survey and <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Volberg (1988)</ref> reached a similar conclusion that low-income respondents accounted for larger proportion of disordered gamblers.</p><p>Regarding the unique circumstance in Macau, we employed four demographic factors in current study (e.g., age, gender, marital status, monthly income). Age was self-reported in years. Gender and marital status were dummy coded, with male coded as "0" and female coded as "1"; while unmarried or divorce coded as "0" and married coded as "1". Monthly income was coded as "1" for less than 3,000 RMB (or 3,750 MOP), "2" for 3,000-8,000 RMB (or 3,750-10,000MOP), "3" for 8,000-15,000 RMB (or 10,000-18,750 MOP), "4" for 15,000-30,000 RMB (or 18,750-37,500 MOP) and "5" for more than 30,000 RMB (or 37,500 MOP).</p><p>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed to evaluate the validity of the key variables in current study. Firstly, we examined the baseline model including five variables, namely gambling behavior, gambling cognition, risk propensity, familial monitoring and peer gambling. As shown in Note. RMSEA=root mean square error of approximation; CFI=Comparative Fit Index; TLI=Tucker-Lewis Index.</p><p>*p&lt;0.05. ** p&lt;0.01.</p><p>We further tested the discriminant validity of the five constructs by comparing the baseline model with alternative models. The results show that the five-factor model fit the data better than any of the alternative models. The final construct measurement was the average of the items for that construct. Thus, we concluded that gambling behavior, gambling cognition, risk propensity, familial monitoring, and peer gambling in our samples were distinct construct.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the means, standard deviations and zero-order correlation of the variables. As can be seen in the table, gambling cognition is significantly and positively related to risk propensity while gambling behavior is significantly and positively related to gambling cognition and to risk propensity. Hypothesis 1 and 2 are supported. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> presents the results for tests of the hypothesized model. The control variables, independent variable (risk propensity), mediator (gambling cognition), moderators (familial monitoring and peer gambling) and the interaction terms were entered on separate steps. In model 1, tests of the effects of risk propensity on gambling cognition and the results reveal the positive relation between them (β=0.41, p&lt;0.001). In model 2, the effects of risk propensity, and the interactive effects of risk propensity and familial monitoring were examined. The results show that risk propensity is positively related to gambling cognition (β=0.38, p&lt;0.001) while its interaction is negatively related to gambling cognition (β=-0.17, p&lt;0.01). Hypothesis 4 is supported. In model 3, risk propensity is associated with a higher level of gambling behavior (β=0.37, p&lt;0.001), suggesting that people with greater level of risk propensity are more likely to gamble. In model 4, after entering the gambling cognition (the mediator), peer gambling (the moderator) as well as the interaction term of gambling cognition and peer gambling, risk propensity is not significantly related to gambling behavior any more (β=0.08, p&gt;0.05). While gambling cognition, peer gambling and the interaction term are significantly related to gambling behavior (β=0.36, p&lt;0.001; β=0.45, p&lt;0.001; β=0.10, p&lt;0.05). Hypothesis 3 and 5 are supported. We created the interaction graphs applying two-way unstandardized equation and unstandardized predicted scores for the Y-axis. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> plotted the interaction at one standard deviation above and below the mean on risk propensity and gambling cognition. As shown in the figure, risk propensity is positively related to gambling cognition, this relationship is stronger under low familial monitoring than under high familial monitoring. to the significant moderating effect, the direct relationship between risk propensity and gambling behavior is not statistically significant. The slope is much steeper when the level of peer gambling is high rather than low, indicating that the positive relation between gambling cognition and gambling behavior is stronger under high level of peer gambling, which is consistent with our prediction.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Interaction effects of gambling cognition and peer gambling on gambling behavior</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Several major findings resulted from this study. First, the results suggest that risk propensity impacts gambling behavior indirectly through developing gambling cognition. Second, familial monitoring moderated the positive relationship between risk propensity and gambling cognition in such a way that the relationship is stronger under low familial monitoring than under high familial monitoring. Third, Peer gambling moderated the positive relationship between gambling cognition and gambling behavior in such a way that the relationship is stronger when peer gambling is higher. Below, we discuss the theoretical implications, practical implications, and limitation and future direction of our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Theoretical Implications</head><p>Although some studies have examined the relationship between risk propensity and gambling behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Knowles, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eadington &amp; Schwartz, 2012)</ref>, our understanding of the transmission mechanism was limited. In present study, we contributed to the gambling literature by demonstrating the cognition mediates the relationship between risk propensity and gambling behavior. An explanation for why gambling cognition mediates this relationship can be found in "Onion model" proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Curry (1983)</ref>. He argued that personality dimensions fundamentally control learning behavior, transmitting through information-processing dimension, and intertwined by interaction with environmental factors. Thus, focusing on the aspect of risk taking would be inadequate in explaining the outcomes.</p><p>Familial monitoring and peer gambling moderated two distinct paths in the context respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dishion and McMahon (1998)</ref> presented that parental monitoring may serve as a prime protective factor relating to adolescent problem behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hartos et al. (2000)</ref> found that parental behaviors such as setting limits, having expectations, and demanding responsible behavior were associated with a reduction in adolescent participation in risky driving. Our findings are consistent with the research implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Magoon and Ingersoll (2006)</ref>. They presented that increased monitoring and supervision resulted in lower levels of adolescent gambling. Because our sample was composed of adult respondents, we accordingly investigated the moderating role of supervision from all family members rather than just from parents. The empirical results revealed that people are prone to develop gambling cognition when familial monitoring is insufficient.</p><p>Prior empirical research indicated that pathological and at-risk gamblers reported perceiving significantly more family members and peers as having a gambling problem than did non-gamblers and social gamblers (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hardoon et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al., 2004)</ref>. According to Onion Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Curry, 1983)</ref>, the outermost layer is most observable and is labeled "instructional preferences", referring to "the individual's choice of environment in which to learn". And this layer interacts most with the external features of the learning environment. From a gambler's perspective, he or she would be influenced by external environment such as peer's behavior. We built on the previous research and broadened the understanding of impact of peer gambling on gambling behavior by examining the moderating effects of peer gambling in this study. Our findings highlighted a fact that it is not just peer gambling arouses gambling problems, but the complex interaction of internal cognition and peer's contagion does.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Practical Implications</head><p>The increasing popularity of gambling has raised questions about its consequences. This study suggests different ways to help mitigate the severity of gambling behavior. First, the study lends support for the positive relationship between risk propensity and gambling behavior. Gamblers should develop a habit of spending money prudently and rationally. In addition, policy makers need to advocate "responsible gambling" as the proper attitude towards gambling.</p><p>Second, family members' supervision may hinder the procedure of shaping gambling cognition. The findings are especially instructive for parents who educate their offspring. Youths and adolescents should be alerted to the harm of gambling-related cognitive distortion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sylvain and Ladouceur (1992)</ref> applied a cognitive therapy with the assistance of education components, stimulus control, self-monitoring and family intervention. Family members play crucial roles in some treatment for pathological gambler.</p><p>Furthermore, the study empirically confirms the association between exposure to peer gambling and higher level of gambling behavior. Because gambling behavior can be influenced by both internal and external factors, social context such as peer gambling should be integrated in the treatments of disordered gamblers. People whose friends are frequently involved in gambling are more likely to suffer from gambling problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Limitations and Further Research Direction</head><p>Several limitations should be noted in the present investigation. First, the gambling scales were designed for pathological gamblers who represent relatively minor proportion of the population. Pathological gambling may be expected to be infrequent, if not nonexistent, during our time sampling. The generalizability of our findings to pathological gamblers may be restricted.</p><p>Second, another limitation may be found in the current study is the relatively small number of items used to operationalize the constructs. Considering the limited time for each interview, we employed no more than six items for every construct. Nevertheless, the items were validated in previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Steenbergh et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wong &amp; Tsang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Tellegen et al., 2002)</ref> and the re-test results of factor analyses in present study justified our items elimination.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the study provided new insight into the phenomenon of gambling by exploring its mechanism. Future research directions can stem from our study. First, longitudinal research is required to ascertain the causal sequence about how risk propensity would drive gambling cognition. Indeed, a number of studies suggest that gambling cognition may inversely generate risk taking propensity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Toneatto, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Martinez et al., 2011)</ref>. Longitudinal data would enhance our understanding the motive for gambling behavior and the relationship between risk propensity and gambling cognition.</p><p>Another interesting research direction is to categorize the sample according to severity of gambling behavior. Extant literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wiebe &amp; Cox, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Goldstein et al., 2013)</ref> contrasted problem gambler with non-gambler and low risk gambler to distinguish the influencing factors of different types of gamblers.</p><p>It is also worthwhile to continue the investigation of contextual and intermediate variables linking the relationship between gambling behavior and gambling cognition. Aside from peer gambling, numerous research has confirmed that emotions would significantly affect gambling behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tang &amp; Oei, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang et al., 2011)</ref>. Prior studies found that demographic features such as religion and ethnics were associated with gambling in Western culture (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Oei et al., 2008)</ref>. For these reasons, the study can be re-conducted in other regions other than Macau.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
