<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper deals with the examination of insurance consumer behaviour in Lithuania. The purpose of the work is to determine the factors that explain the insurance service purchase decision of the Lithuanian citizens. To this end, a structured 5-point Likert scale questionnaire-based survey is employed to collect data. A research model composed of two main stages (purchase inclination and decision) is proposed. Factor analysis and multiple regression analysis are used to determine how the factors are formed and what their relative weights are. Five factors are identified: the acceptability of insurance conditions (F1), insurance service provider's competence (F2), consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (F3), the positivity of consumers' insurance experience (F4), and the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance (F5). Subsequently, path analysis is applied to further refine the research model by eliminating the less significant relationships between the variables (the relationships between F5 and inclination, between  F3 and decision, and between F4 and decision were eliminated). The refined model provides the revised impact weights of the variables on the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services: Decision = 0,192 F1 + 0,379 F2 + 0,156 F5 + 0,222 Inclination + e2, where e2 represents the possible impact of other variables. The results show that in Lithuania, insurance consumption decision making is still mostly influenced by monetary considerations such as consumers' evaluation of an insurance service in monetary terms and the search for the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance. The results also indicate that the demographical and socioeconomical characteristics of the consumers influence their behaviour. Among the main findings here are the most distinctive ones: men base their insurance decisions mostly on the acceptability of insurance conditions, whereas women do on the insurance service providers' competence; when purchasing insurance services, mature adults only care about the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance, while the youth and young adults mostly rely on the insurance service provider's competence; generally, for the Lithuanians a monthly amount of 800 LTL per person is the income level which enables them not only to form the inclination to purchase insurance services, but also to decide to purchase them actually; the higher degree or education acquired by the individuals, the fewer factors impact their insurance purchase decision: masters and doctors of science evaluate only the insurance service provider's competence, while bachelors, besides the insurer's competence, are also concerned with insurance service conditions and all the monetary issues; Vilnius' citizens evaluate a rather wider range of factors as compared to the individuals living in other places; individuals who are either married or living in a couple are more than singles inclined to purchase insurance services if an opportunity to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance exists; individuals who live alone are mostly concerned with the acceptability of insurance conditions, whereas families composed of two and more members highly focus on the insurer's competence; the decision of families with at least one child is determined by the insurer's competence, whereas families without children take a wider range of factors into account when making the insurance service purchase decision.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Lithuania is a prime example of a country where the insurance market is still maturing. The total amount of insurance premiums has steadily increased from 0,74 in 2002 to 1,95 billion LTL in 2007. Following the worldwide crisis it has decreased to 1,60 billion LTL in 2012. Nevertheless, the insurance consumption per inhabitant is increasing again, e.g. <ref type="bibr">, Swiss Re (2012)</ref> indicates that life insurance has grown by 17 % during 2011. It is forecasted that the Lithuanian insurance market will grow to 2,37 billion LTL in 2017, which corresponds to 735,37 LTL per capita <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(BMI, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>When speaking about insurance service consumption, Lithuania is usually seen as a market that has shared behavioural patterns within the group of Central and Eastern European countries. It is a relatively small market for both life and non-life insurance. However, its current state and development trends indicate the resistant strength and potential of the market. Most of the insurance business, especially in the life insurance sector, is overtaken by large multi-national companies that together with foreign capital bring well-regulated experience. The nurtured corporate links with commercial banks provide the insurance companies shared networks of clients and service distribution channels. The specialty niches such as hail insurance and surety ship gain the valued focus of insurers. Moreover, it is expected that the number of customers will increase thanks to a rather favourable economic environment. In particular first-time customers should receive the full attention of the insurers.</p><p>In order to make the most of this expected growth, it is highly desirable for the insurance industry in Lithuania to gain in-depth knowledge about the behavioural characteristics of the citizens when it comes to evaluate insurance alternatives and to purchase insurance products. To the best of our knowledge, no such study has been published in the scientific literature.</p><p>The novel contribution presented in this paper is an attempt to identify the determinants of insurance service consumption in Lithuania. More specifically, the object of this work is consumer behaviour during two stages of the insurance consumption process, i.e., purchase inclination and purchase decision with a focus on the Lithuanian insurance market. This research examines individual decisions to purchase insurance services.</p><p>Thus the research problem investigated in this work is that of identifying and systematically organising the various sociological, economical and demographical characteristics of the Lithuanians that form and impact their decision making, including inclination and actual purchase decision.</p><p>The goal of the work is to create a model which reflects the interplay between the previously mentioned characteristics and their impact weights on different stages of the insurance purchase decision making.</p><p>The research method used to reach this goal is composed of questionnaire-based survey and statistical analysis, namely factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and path analysis. For statistical data processing and analysis of the results "IBM SPSS Statistics 19" and "IBM SPSS AMOS 19" programs are employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related work</head><p>Despite the fact that consumer behaviour in a broad sense has been widely analysed for more than 50 years and that consumer behaviour in the financial service sector is increasingly getting the focus of researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beckett et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Harrison, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Willis, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Capuano &amp; Ramsay, 2011)</ref>, the attention on the analysis of the particularities of insurance consumer behaviour as a specific object is rather limited. Most often, insurance consumer behaviour researchers concentrate their research on recognising the insurer needs by analysing the insurance consumer behaviour in separate insurance branches, groups or types. In the research of these studies one can find, in some sense, a common unifying patternthe concentration of the conducted research on insurance service consumer demand. A rather new attitude in explaining the particularities of insurance consumer behaviour has been unfolded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kunreuther and Pauly (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Schwarcz (2010a</ref><ref type="bibr">Schwarcz ( , 2010b))</ref>; in particular, these authors have studied the anomalies of consumer demand for insurance.</p><p>In most research papers, the aggregated insurance consumer behaviour as a particular object, on which one would specifically concentrate, is not analysed. The research literature (i.e., theoretical studies and empirical research) shows that there exist some aspects which explain insurance service consumer behaviour fragmentarily. These fragmented aspects can be systematically grouped into following six groups 1.

She emphasises the need for special publications in this domain as well as research relevance for insurance business representatives, who aspire to motivate insurance service consumers and forecast the development of their business. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kindurys (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kindurys ( , 2011))</ref>, highlights the necessity of the creation of strong foundations of theoretical-methodological insurance consumer behaviour research that are needed to conduct the empirical research of insurance consumer behaviour in the insurance market.</p><p>In general most research on insurance decisions focuses on purely monetary decisions. It is usually assumed that both insurance purchase and claim decisions depend on well-specified quantitative factors such as premium, probability of loss and size of compensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hsee &amp; Kunreuther, 2000)</ref>. When making a decision to purchase insurance services as a monetary transaction, consumers tend to guide their decisions on cost-benefit analysis. The goal of such decisions is usually to get fairly regular financial returns rather than the overall goal of protection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Krantz and Kunreuther (2007)</ref> state that the ability to be reimbursed, irregularly but frequently, may be perceived as a dividend stream (this is namely the case for small losses when insurance contracts with low deductibles are made). If the insurance consumers do not collect coverage on their policies (e.g., flood insurance) for a certain number of years, they feel that their premiums have been wasted. Cancelling their insurance policies, the consumers exhibit both their avoidance of financial anxiety and justification of their actions to themselves and others: the absence of occurrence of insured risks may make them think that the probability of event is now lower than before <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kunreuther &amp; Pauly, 2005)</ref>. When the investments to purely-risk based insurance are related to the consumers' expectations of getting some kind of financial return, this possibly also points to the fact that such consumers lack a proper understanding of the insurance concept where "the best return on an insurance policy is no return at all" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Krantz &amp; Kunreuther, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The literature on insurance decision also suggests other views, than monetary, on the determinants of insurance purchase. We identify several groups of insurance decision-making factors.</p><p>Social factors. One reason for purchasing insurance is that other people are doing so: either they know others who have purchased a policy (without knowing detailed information about it) and this creates their fear to see themselves among the few imprudent uninsured disaster victims, either they copy their friends and neighbours who, they believe, have similar preferences and have already gone through the information gathering trouble, so in that sense their information search costs can be reduced, or they become embarrassed that they do not have protection when they learn that others do <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kunreuther &amp; Pauly, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Psychological factors. Consumers agree to purchase a service which is expressed in words as insurance rather than protection, as the first one has a positive ring, implying an investment that offers protection, while the latter one suggests a cost which has a negative connotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kunreuther &amp; Pauly, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, insurance against "named events" (e.g., flight insurance) for consumers is also more attractive than general insurance (e.g., life term insurance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kunreuther &amp; Pauly, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Emotional factors. Consumers are likely to consult their feelings in making insurance decisions. They are inclined to purchase coverage for an object that is treasured (e.g., a painting) rather than for an identical object that is not special, as they expect to deal with their peace of mind and relief of anxiety (i.e., they feel that with the insurance they can sleep much more securely or that they would regret not having the coverage if something bad happened) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kunreuther &amp; Pauly, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hsee and Kunreuther (2000)</ref> call it "the affection effect in insurance decisions". This may also explain why a recent accident or disaster would increase people's willingness to insure against a similar event in the future, since after experiencing a disaster people know what it feels to loose things they love and want to avoid some of the pain by being protected in the future.</p><p>As we have seen, several orthogonal patterns related to insurance purchase decision have been described in the literature; as we will see throughout the remainder of this paper, it seems as though the monetary dimension is the most significant one and the other ones play a less critical role in the formation of the insurance consumer decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey</head><p>The conducted survey is based on a five point Likert scale statement questionnaire. It is composed of 59 statements which reflect the different stages of the insurance purchase decision making process. Since the extreme values of the responses are symmetrically opposed to each other (agree/disagree), it is assumed that the distances between available response options are equal.</p><p>The survey has been completed by 336 respondents, including both existing and potential insurance service consumers. The social, economical and demographical characteristics of the respondents can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">13</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the applied statistical procedure</head><p>The overall data processing is composed of two parts: a) creation of a model by means of three main steps, i.e., factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, and path analysis; and b) exploration of the generated model under demographical and socio-economical characteristics.</p><p>In the first part, factor analysis is used to identify the factors that form the insurance purchase decision making. Then, multiple regression is used to identify the impact load of the individual factors on the purchase decision. In this work we distinguish two main stages: the impact of factors on inclination as a dependent variable and the impact of factors on final decision as a dependent variable. Finally, path analysis is used to refine the research model, i.e. to confirm the order of the elements of the decision chain and to eliminate insignificant relationships between dependent and independent variables.</p><p>In the second part, 22 sub-variations of the model are evaluated in order to identify the potential influence of socio-economical and demographical characteristics of the population on consumers' inclination towards insurance services and their actual insurance service purchase decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor analysis</head><p>Data-fit for factorial analysis. In the anti-image correlation matrix, the KMO measure (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measures of Sampling Adequacy) values of all questionnaire statements are checked; since the KMO values of all statements enter into the interval 0,5-1, none of the statements is eliminated from the analysis. The general KMO measure of sampling adequacy, counted as the mean of KMO of all statements, in this case is equal to 0,803; this shows a rather high data dispersion which can be explained by the factors (the KMO measure can take values from 0,5 to 1; the closer this measure is to 1, the higher the sampling adequacy is). The value of Bartlett's test of Sphericity Sig. is 0,000, which also indicates that the data, most likely, fit to the factor analysis (p&lt;0,05). Nonexisting weak Communalities values between the statements of the questionnaire also confirms that all statements are well-fit for conducting the factor analysis (high dispersion percentage is explained by the identified factors).</p><p>Factor analysis methods. In this work, we apply the Principal Component Analysis factor extraction method together with a factor axis rotation based on Varimax with Kaiser Normalization, and the Bartlett Factor Scores method for calculating the factors.</p><p>Factor extraction. Conducting the factor analysis 19 factors, the Eigenvalues of which are higher than 1, have been extracted. These factors explain 65,379 per cent of the total data dispersion. The obtained results (mostly the relatively large number of extracted factors) indicate that obtaining a more precise understanding of the insurance service purchase behaviour, including consumer considerations when deciding its purchase, requires a more thoughtful selection of the statements used in the questionnaire.</p><p>Reduction of the number of factors. The Component Matrix analysis of correlations between the factors and the statements allows reducing the number of statements in the questionnaire. The reduction of the number of statements in the questionnaire is conducted following these criteria: the statements of which the factor loadings are not higher than 0,4 in any of the factor are eliminated; the statements which have identically high (higher than 0,4) factor loadings in several factors are eliminated; in the absence of the previously mentioned statements, the statements which alone compose single factors are eliminated, starting from those that explain the smallest part of the dispersion. The statements are eliminated one by one and the factor analysis is repeated each time a single statement is removed. While removing the statements, the change (reduction) of the number of factors is noted and the factor analysis data-fit measures are checked. During the process of the questionnaire statement reduction, 39 statements have been eliminated, while the factor analysis has been repeatedly conducted 39 times.</p><p>Factor extraction after factor number reduction. From the remaining 20 questionnaire statements, 5 factors of which the Eigenvalues are higher than 1 have been formed. The extraction of namely 5 factors is shown by the scree plot as well: the line which distinguishes the steep part of the curve from the flatter one indicates the recommended number of factors (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The extracted 5 factors explain 60,623 per cent of the total data dispersion. The kept relatively high measure of data dispersion (previously it was 65,379 per cent) indicates that during the factor analysis the least related statements have been removed. The KMO measure is 0,862 (previously it was 0,803); the relatively high measure shows that the remaining statements of the questionnaire explain the internal data dispersion more accurately. <ref type="bibr">Bartlett's test of Sphericity Sig. (p&lt;0,</ref><ref type="bibr">05)</ref> indicates data fit for the factor analysis. The identified measures of Chronbach alpha of which the values have to be ≈0,7-1 allow stating that the intercorrelation between the statements inside each of the two first factors is relatively high (0,859 and 0,787), while it is average for the third and fourth ones (0,696 and 0,685), and the statements of the fifth one could be refined (0,584) (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identified factors</head><p>Discussion: factor interpretation. The research data show that the largest part of the dispersion is explained by the two first factors: the first one (7 statements) -18,9 per cent, the second one (4 statements) -12,8 per cent. The remaining three factors (each of them is made of 3 statements) explain respectively 10,4, 9,6 and 8,9 per cent of the dispersion. The first identified factor reflects the acceptability (suitability) of insurance conditions, i.e., the acceptability of insurance services and of its providing conditions. In this factor, the largest factor loading belongs to the three statements that express the wish of consumers to shorten the time-period between the insurance accident and the reception of insurance coverage (the largest attention of consumers is focused on the flow of claim regulation and administration, timely paid insurance coverage and financial reliability of an insurance service provider). Another important insurance condition for consumers is the extent of insurance, i.e., the number of insurable risks. In the same first factor, a relatively smaller loading comes from the evaluation of the insurance condition when consumers have the possibility to regulate the size of insurance premiums and coverage by choosing their preferred level of franchise. A similarly small factor loading comes from the employees' behaviour that is related to how the services are provided to the consumers in general (most likely, it is treated as a set of supporting services) and from the ratio between insurance premiums and insurance coverage which indicates that the consumers Table <ref type="table">1</ref> The identified factors, their statements and measures Nr.</p><p>Statements Factors and their measures Chronbach alpha 1 2 3 4 5</p><p>1.</p><p>The flow of claim regulation and administration is a criterion worth of one's attention. 0,777 0,859 2.</p><p>When evaluating an insurance service, I pay attention to the timely paid insurance coverage.</p><p>0,767</p></div>

In this second factor, the largest factor loading indicates that the consumers are largely in need for reliance on the insurer. The other three statements that compose this factor allow understanding that the consumers would like the insurers to help them make the best insurance deal, attentively taking into account their needs. This is the way consumers perceive insurance service quality.</p><p>The statements associated to the third factor reflect consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance. All the statements composing this factor expose the consumers' perceptive attitude towards insurance as a beneficial investment. The factor loadings of the statements indicate that, for consumers, insurance is associated with the definitions of investment and safety, i.e., if their finances would allow them, they would use insurance services.</p><p>The fourth factor reflects the positivity of consumers' insurance experience (both one's and of others) where the aggregated insurance-related opinion is involved. This factor expresses the consumers' wish to share and use different insurance-related information and, before making the final decision to purchase insurance services, to take into account their own experience and the experience of others. It is especially sensitive to the negative responses about insurance services.</p><p>The interrelationships of the fifth factor's statements allow formulating the general title of this factor: the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance. The largest factor loadings indicate that the purchase of insurance services is encouraged by the consented discounts or by the possibility to get back a part of the paid insurance premium amount when declaring one's income. The interest of consumers in insurance services increases if they can either beforehand or after the service has been provided reduce the total amount of insurance premiums.</p><p>The mean values of the single factors (scales) indicate that within the researched group the most significant factors are the following ones: insurance service provider's competence (4,108 points), the positivity of consumers' insurance experience (4,073 points) and the acceptability of insurance conditions (3,986 points); among the least significant factors is consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (2,571 points).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple linear regression analysis</head><p>Regression analysis is conducted in order to identify the impact of the single factors (as of set of variables) on the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services. In this work, two dependent variables are distinguished: consumer inclination to purchase insurance services and consumer decision to purchase insurance services. Thus the analysis is two-folded. First stage: the conduction of multiple regression analysis when the inclination to purchase insurance services is a dependent variable, while the identified factors are independent ones.Second stage: the conduction of multiple regression analysis when the decision to purchase insurance services is a dependent variable, while the identified factors and the inclination to purchase insurance services are independent ones. Performance of these two analysis stages is a constituent part of path analysis which aims at identifying a) which impact-making variables should be included in the research model, b) in which order to place the variables in the chain of the decision-process and c) which relationships (or so called "paths") between the variables are not significant for the model.</p></div>

When testing research hypotheses, insignificant relationships between several pairs of variables have been identified (see hypotheses H5, H8 and H9</head><p>).

The proposed research model (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) allows defining the nature of the relationships between the variables that are included in the model (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">12</ref>): acceptability of insurance conditions (F1) impacts the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services both directly and indirectly where the direct impact of this factor (0,192) is stronger than the indirect one (0,255*0,222=0,056); insurance service provider's competence (F2) impacts the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services both directly and indirectly where the direct impact of this factor (0,379) is stronger than the indirect one (0,152*0,222=0,034); consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (F3) impacts the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services indirectly (0,529*0,222=0,117); positivity of consumers' insurance experience (F4) impacts the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services indirectly (0,147*0,222=0,033); the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance impacts the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services directly (0,156); consumers' inclination to purchase insurance services impacts directly the consumers' decision to purchase insurance services (0,222).</p><p>One should note the nature of the identified relationships between the variables. In all cases they are positive, so the endogenous variables vary in direct ratio with the exogenous ones. The model reveals that insurance service provider's competence (F2) has the largest total impact (0,413) on the Lithuanian consumers' decision to purchase insurance services, where most of the impact is direct (0,379). The second decisive factor is acceptability of insurance conditions (F1) (0,248), the impact of which is mostly direct <ref type="bibr">(0,</ref><ref type="bibr">192)</ref>. The two previous factors are followed by possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance (F5) (0,156), the impact of which on consumers' decision is only direct (0,516).</p><p>The remaining factors such as consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (F3) and positivity of consumers' insurance experience (F4) impact the consumers' decision indirectly, through an intermediary stage by forming the consumers' inclination to purchase insurance services first. The impact of consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (F3) on the consumers' final decision is relatively weak (0,117) and the impact of the positivity of consumers' insurance experience (F4) is almost negligible (0,033). The impact weights of these factors on the intermediary stage are 0,529 and 0,147, respectively. This indicates that the latter two factors form the consumers' inclination rather than their final decision to purchase insurance services.</p><p>The total consumers' inclination to purchase insurance services is under the strong impact of consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (F3) (0,529) and the acceptability of insurance conditions (F1) (0,258) and under the weaker impact of insurance service provider's competence (F2) (0,152) and the positivity of consumers' insurance experience (F4) (0,147), while the impact of the consumers' inclination on their final decision to purchase insurance services is 0,222.</p><p>Discussion of the research model results through the prism of demographical and socio-economical characteristics. The analysis of the research results indicates the diversity of the Lithuanian consumer behaviour in what concerns their decisions to purchase insurance services depending on their income, age, education or degree acquired, living place, civil status, the number of family members and the number of children in their families (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">13</ref>).</p><p>Gender. The conducted research reveals that the process of purchasing insurance services is much more straightforward for Lithuanian men than women: the path Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">12</ref> The dependence of the Lithuanian consumers' decision to purchase insurance services on the identified factors with the calculated values of the factors of their decision making is shorter as it brings them directly to the decision making. Notably, the relationship between the masculine inclination and decision is not statistically significant (p&gt;0,05). It means that the inclination, taken as a whole of certain factors, does not determine the decision. Men's decision to purchase insurance services is determined by the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,295), the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance (0,230) and the insurance service provider's competence (0,220). Meanwhile, men's inclination is formed by their monetary attitude towards insurance (0,545), the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,337) and the positivity of consumers' insurance experience (0,160).</p><p>During both the inclination and decision formation stages, the acceptability of insurance conditions is more significant for men (0,337 and 0,295, respectively) than for women (0,252 and 0,155, respectively). In the feminine decision making, the top role, contrary to the masculine decision making (0,220), is taken by the insurance service provider's competence (0,394). This indicates that women firstly choose an insurance service provider and just afterwards its services, while men directly evaluate insurance service conditions. Even though the insurance service purchase behaviour of Lithuanian women reflects the relationships and the extent of their impact of the general model (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), there exist some exclusively women-typical particularities. Firstly, the whole of insurance experience of women that is formed by their own and others' experience has both direct and indirect impacts on their decisions, where the direct impact is stronger and impacts the insurance decision negatively (-0,144): having one's own and others' insurance experience brings women's decision of purchasing insurance services to a standstill. Meanwhile, the research reveals that there is no statistically significant relationship between the direct masculine decision and the obtained insurance experience (p&gt;0,05). Secondly, the feminine decision to purchase insurance services is rather strongly (0,258) formed through the intermediary stage, i.e., inclination, where the main focus of the women is held on the evaluation of insurance in monetary terms (0,541) and later on the discussion of insurance service conditions (0,252).</p><p>Age. The research reveals that the decision to purchase insurance services in the different consumer age groups depends on different factors. The sharpest contrast of the behaviour of the research participants has shown up when grouping them into three age groups: youths (students), young adults and mature adults.</p><p>It has been identified that the direct decision to purchase insurance services of the youths of 18-24 years is determined by two factors: the insurance service provider's competence (0,393) and the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,187). In the 25-40 years age group of the research participants, besides the two previously mentioned factors (0,382 and 0,201, respectively), the attention is also brought to the additional factor, namely the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance (0,237). In the age group above 41, the latter factor (0,428) becomes to the only one that determines one's insurance decision.</p><p>The results of the research indicate that the process of the decision to purchase insurance services of the mature adults is rather short and clear: their decision is conditioned not by the acceptability of the general insurance conditions or the insurance service provider's competence, but by the existence of favourable possibilities to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance. The inclination of these persons to purchase insurance services is also determined by only factor, namely consumers' attitude towards insurance in monetary terms (0,643), however, the consumers' inclination does not lead to the decision making (there is no statistically significant relationship). The stress on the two latter factors indicates that insurance service purchases of people aged above 41 are exclusively based on their own calculations. It is worth to note that the insurance service evaluation on strictly monetary terms might be typical, not for the mature persons as it is indicated by the research results, but possibly for the generation of those persons (the Lithuanian citizens) who have been living in a certain time period when insurance in some sense has been ignored (or it was not needed at all).</p><p>Meanwhile, the intermediary stage, i.e., consumers' inclination to purchase insurance services forms itself in the first two age groups: in the group of 18-24 years' consumers the inclination (0,250) makes a larger impact on the insurance decision making than in the group of 25-40 years old (0,204). Both these age groups pay most of their attention to the evaluation of insurance in monetary terms (0,558 and 0,464, respectively), followed by the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,250 and 0,249, respectively) and the insurance service provider's competence <ref type="bibr">(0,196 and 0,160, respectively)</ref>. The conducted research allowed identifying that 18-24 years old persons is the only group for which the whole of their own and others' insurance experience is significant: the positivity of their insurance experience impacts their decision to purchase insurance services indirectly, by firstly forming their inclination (0,171).</p><p>Income. The distinction of the insurance service consumer behaviour can be drawn by grouping the research participants according to their monthly income (i.e., income per person) into three groups of consumers: a group of low income (0-800 LTL), a group of average income (801-2000 LTL) and a group of higher than average income (above 2001 LTL). The results of the research reveal that for the persons belonging to the average or higher than average income groups, the process of insurance decision making proceeds in two directions: either it directly brings them to the decision making or it makes them form the insurance inclination that does not bring them to the decision making. The decision to purchase insurance services of the persons who receive higher than average income is determined by the insurance service provider's competence (0,283), the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,243) and consumers' attitude towards insurance in monetary terms (0,235). For the persons with average income, the two first above-mentioned factors are significant (0,391 and 0,289, respectively) under the insurance service purchase's decision making. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">- (-) - (0,140) - (0,140) - (0,095) - (-) - (0,240) - (-) 0,235 (-) - (0,209) 0,213 (-) - (-) F4-Positivity of consumers' insurance experience - (0,033) - (-) -0,144 (0,043) - (0,043) - (-) - (-) - (-) - (-) - (-) - (0,051) - (-) - (-) F5-</formula><p>The possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance 0,156 (-)  It has been identified that the inclination of the persons belonging to 801-2000 LTL or above 2001 LTL income groups (when the inclination is treated as a whole of certain factors) does not determine their final decision (there is no statistically significant relationship), however, the consumers' inclination generally is formed by a number of the same factors: their attitude towards insurance in monetary terms (0,522 and 0,531, respectively) and the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,172 and 0,296, respectively). The inclination of those consumers who have average income at their disposition is also under the impact of the whole of their own and others' insurance experience (0,151). The more distinct difference among the consumer income groups is seen in the one of consumers with less than 800 LTL at their disposition where the decision to purchase insurance services is mostly formed through the intermediary stage of considerations (inclination) (0,421) which itself is formed by the whole of the evaluations of the three first factors (0,256, 0,320 and 0,570, respectively) and strengthened by the direct effect of the insurance service providers' competence (0,366).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">0,230 (-) 0,129 (-) - (-) 0,237 (-) 0,428 (-) - (-) - (-) - (-) - (-) 0,299<label>(</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">-) - (0,286) - (-) - (0,152) - (-) - (0,170) - (-) - (-) - (0,295) - (0,115) - (0,139) F4-Positivity of consumers' insurance experience - (0,033) - (-) - (-) - (-) - (0,052) - (-) - (0,071) - (-) - (-) - (-) - (0,034) - (-)<label>(</label></formula><p>Education or acquired degree.

The absence of a statistically significant relationship between the consumers' inclination and their decision means that for these educated people the intermediary stage of the decision making does not exist, i.e., an insurance service is purchased or not purchased without one's long-lasting considerations.</p><p>Several-stage considerations are neither typical for the Lithuanian citizens that have a bachelor degree, however, their decision making is directly impacted by a larger number of factors: the evaluation of an insurance service provider (0,301), the possibility to save (to reduce the amount of premiums) (0,299), the attitude towards insurance as a certain type investment (0,213) and the general evaluation of insurance service conditions (0,212). Among the bachelors there exists a more distinct significance of the attitude towards insurance in monetary terms.</p><p>The decision of the consumers with a secondary education to purchase insurance services proceeds through the inclination formation (0,364) which is mostly determined by their attitude to insurance in monetary terms (whether they evaluate insurance as savings and an investment) (0,575). The decision of these persons is directly determined by the insurance service provider's competence (0,387) and the insurance conditions (0,173). The persons who have a secondary education are the only ones who pay attention to the whole of their own and others' insurance experience (0,141) when taking a decision; the experience is also an additional factor that in general forms their inclination for insurance.</p><p>Living place. The decision to purchase insurance services of Vilnius' citizens is under the impact of the insurer's competence (0,439), the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,280) and monetary issues (the evaluation of insurance in monetary terms (0,280) and the premium reduction possibility (0,132). The insurance service consumption decision of Kaunas' citizens is exclusively formed through an intermediary stage which is determined by one factor only, namely the consumers' attitude towards insurance in monetary terms (0,450). In the other geographical areas of Lithuania (i.e. excluding Vilnius' and Kaunas' cities), the decision to purchase insurance services depends on the insurer's competence (0,558) and the possibility to reduce the amount of premiums payable for insurance (0,370).</p><p>Civil status. Classifying consumers according to their civil status also reveals different behaviour when they are taking decision to purchase insurance. First, singles are more inclined to manifold considerations: their decision to purchase insurance services, which is mostly under the direct impact of the insurer's competence (0,418), is formed extensively through the intermediary stage (inclination) (0,303). This stage is determined by all five factors that are included into the research model: the strongest effects are made by the attitude towards insurance in monetary terms (0,500) and the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,310). Meanwhile, the path of insurance decision making for married couples or couples that live together is shorter and straightforwardly directed towards a combination of the following three factors: the service provider's competence (0,399), the possibility to reduce the amount of money payable for insurance (0,288) and the acceptability of insurance conditions (0,172). The inclination of the persons living in families to purchase insurance services is essentially impacted by the attitude towards insurance in monetary terms (0,515), however, even the positive attitude is not a decisive stimulus to purchase insurance services.</p><p>Number of family members. The decision of the persons who live alone to purchase insurance services is under the impact of their inclination towards insurance (0,343) and of the insurance service conditions (0,321). Most likely, when considering an insurance decision, these persons may appoint more time than those living in families, and therefore, to form their inclination to purchase insurance services, all factors that are involved into the model, except the insurance service provider's competence, are contributors. This indicates that this group of consumers essentially rely on the insurers that act in the market.</p><p>The decision of families with two family members is determined by the insurance service provider's competence (0,303) and the insurance conditions (0,534). For the consumers from 3-4 person families, the most important contributor is also the insurer's competence (0,496). The individuals who live in families with 5 or more persons pay most of their attention to the service provider's competence (0,553) as well, however, the other part of their decision making is formed indirectly, through inclination (0,463), which is itself formed by the rather strong consumers' monetary attitude towards insurance (0,637) and their satisfaction with the insurance conditions (0,323).</p><p>Number of children in a family. The decision of the persons who have at least one child to purchase insurance services is simpler than that of those whose families or households are without children. The insurance decision of consumers with children in families is determined by several factors: directly by the service provider's competence (0,335) and indirectly by the consumers' attitude towards insurance in monetary terms and the acceptability of insurance conditions (the total effect is 0,139 and 0,124, respectively). The decision to purchase insurance services of the persons who live without children include both directly and indirectly all the factors involved into the model; it means that when taking insurance service purchase decision, these consumers take all aspects into consideration and might reconsider their decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The results of the factor analysis suggest that five factors form the insurance service purchase decision making of the Lithuanians citizens. The results of subsequent multiple regression and path analysis indicate that the largest impact on the Lithuanian consumers' decision to purchase insurance services is essentially composed of the competence of the insurance service provider (0,413, of which 0,379 is the direct impact) and the acceptability of an insurance service and its provision conditions (0,248, of which 0,192 is the direct impact). A smaller impact on insurance decision making is related to such factors as the possibility to decrease the total amount of payable insurance premiums (0,156, direct impact only) and the consumers' attitude towards insurance in monetary terms (0,117, indirect impact only, through consumer intentions). The impact of the positivism of insurance experience (of one self and of others) on the consumers' decision making is weak (0,033, indirect impact only, through consumer intentions).</p><p>Moreover, the results of the socio-demographic analysis show that insurance service purchase decision making is typically an extended (multifactorial) discussion and evaluation of insurance conditions and possibilities, composed of several stages. This is especially true for women, persons under 40 years of age, persons who do not receive large income (up to about 800 Lt/month), persons who have secondary education, persons who live in families with five and more members, singles, persons who live alone, and those who do not have children in their families or households. Furthermore, the analysis results show that the decision to purchase an insurance service when evaluating the service exclusively through a monetary point of view, is made by mature (above 41 years of age) persons and Kaunas' citizens. The competence of the insurance service provider is the most significant factor when making insurance decision for 18-40 years of age persons, women, those who are married or living together, those who have at least one child, those whose families are made of two or more persons, those who have acquired a master or a doctoral degree, and finally those who earn more than 800 Lt/month.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future research</head><p>Certain statements (especially those related to one's attitude to risk) which we originally expected to emerge in certain factors did not. One possible future work would be to refine the formulations of those statements, followed by the evaluation of their potential impacts on the decision making process model (factors and their relations).</p><p>Furthermore, the research model could be expanded so as to reflect insurance service repurchase; we envision that this would require a new dependent variable in addition to the existing inclination and decision stages (the latter would then model the initial purchase decision).</p><p>The refined research model should be applied over time to identify possible emergence and disappearance of factors, their relationships, and changes in the consumers' behaviour.</p><p>Another aspect that could be investigated is that of applying the research model for juridical persons (instead of individuals) as of a consumer group, dependently on their industry type.</p><p>Finally, the research methodology for the evaluation of insurance consumer behaviour could be applied to other countries and the results compared to that of the Lithuanian insurance consumer behaviour.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

		<title level="m" type="main">Analizė taikoma siekiant patobulinti tyrimo modelį, eliminuojant nereikšmingus ryšius tarp kintamųjų. Tyrimo metu eliminuoti ryšiai tarp faktoriaus F5 ir vartotojų polinkio įsigyti draudimo paslaugas, tarp faktoriaus F3 ir vartotojų galutinio sprendimo įsigyti draudimo paslaugas, tarp faktoriaus F4 ir vartotojų galutinio sprendimo įsigyti draudimo paslaugas. Po nereikšmingų ryšių tarp kintamųjų pašalinimo, modelis įgauna tikslesnes, kintamųjų įtakos vartotojų sprendimui įsigyti draudimo paslaugas reikšmes: Sprendimas = 0,192 F1 + 0,379 F2 + 0,156 F5 + 0,222 Polinkis + e2, kur e2 atspindi galimą kitų (į modelį neįtrauktų) kintamųjų įtaką. Tyrimo rezultatai rodo, kad Lietuvoje sprendimą draustis vis dar lemia piniginis aspektas. Vartotojai vertina draudimo paslaugas pirmiausia atkreipdami dėmesį į kainą bei ieško galimybių sumažinti draudimo paslaugoms mokėtinų pinigų sumą. Tyrimo rezultatai taip pat atskleidžia, kad vartotojų elgseną veikia vartotojų demografinės ir socio-ekonominės charakteristikos. Išskirtinos šios pagrindinės tyrimo išvados: vyrai pagrindžia savo draudimo sprendimus daugiausia dėl tinkamų draudimo sąlygų, o moterysdraudimo paslaugų teikėjo kompetencija. Įsigydami draudimo paslaugas brandūs asmenys, išimtinai rūpinasi draudimui mokėtinų įmokų sumos sumažinimo galimybe, o jaunuoliams (studentams) bei jauniems suaugusiesiems reikalingiausias pasitikėjimas draudimo paslaugų teikėjo kompetencija. Iš esmės lietuviams, 800 Lt mėnesinė pinigų suma asmeniui -tai pajamų lygis, kuris leidžia jiems ne tik turėti savo nuomonę į draudimo paslaugas, bet ir priimti galutinį sprendimą dėl jų pasinaudojimo. Kuo aukštesnis asmens išsilavinimas ar įgytas mokslo laipsnis, tuo mažiau veiksnių sąlygoja jų sprendimą įsigyti draudimo paslaugas: magistrai ir mokslų daktarai vertina vien draudimo paslaugų teikėjo kompetenciją, o bakalaurai, be draudiko kompetencijos įvertinimo, taip pat apsvarsto draudimo paslaugos ir jos teikimo sąlygas bei visus galimus piniginius aspektus. Vilniaus gyventojai, palyginti su asmenimis, gyvenančiais kitose vietose, įvertina kur kas platesnį veiksnių spektrą. Susituokę arba poroje gyvenantys asmenys, yra dažniau, nei vieniši asmenys linkę įsigyti draudimo paslaugas, jeigu egzistuoja galimybė sumažinti draudimo paslaugoms mokėtinų įmokų sumos dalį. Asmenys, kurie gyvena vieni, labiausiai apsvarsto draudimo sąlygų tinkamumą</title>

	<note>Identifikuoti penki faktoriai: draudimo sąlygų (draudimo paslaugos ir jos teikimo) priimtinumas /tinkamumas (faktorius F1); draudimo paslaugų teikėjo kompetencija (faktorius F2); vartotojų požiūris į draudimą pinigine prasme (faktorius F3); vartotojų (savo ir kitų) draudimo patirties pozityvumas (faktorius F4) ir draudimui mokamų įmokų sumos sumažinimo galimybė (faktorius F5). o asmenys dviejų ar daugiau asmenų šeimos, priimdami sprendimą draustis atkreipia dėmesį į draudiko kompetenciją. Šeimų, turinčių bent vieną vaiką, sprendimus sąlygoja draudiko kompetencija, o šeimos, kuriose nėra vaikų, priimdamios draudimo paslaugų įsigijimo sprendimus, atsižvelgia į didesnį faktorių spektrą</note>
