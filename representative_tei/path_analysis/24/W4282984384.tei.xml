<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The success of education is largely determined by the readiness of teachers in preparing students through the learning process. The strategic position of teachers to improve the quality of educational outcomes is strongly influenced by the performance of teachers in carrying out their duties so that teacher performance becomes an important demand for achieving educational success. In general, the quality of good education is a benchmark for the success of the performance shown by the teacher <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mulyasa, 2011)</ref>. Given the importance of teacher performance in schools, teachers must carry out their duties and responsibilities as educators, so teacher performance must be built professionally through mastery of competencies that are actually treated in completing work. These competencies are used as a motivator for teachers in carrying out their performance as educators to the fullest. Professionalization of education personnel is something that is considered controversial, but it must be interpreted as a way to improve teacher performance <ref type="bibr">(Hakim, 2015)</ref>. Teacher performance for schools is an important thing as it can show the success of schools in achieving goals. Teacher performance shows how far the things the teacher has done can fulfill and satisfy the community as service users <ref type="bibr">(Wirawan, 2010)</ref>. Teacher performance is one of the facts that determine the success of any educational effort. That is why every educational motivation especially in improving the human resources produced by teachers is very important. The teacher has a main task of educating, teaching, directing and guiding, assessing, training and evaluating students so that they can be said to be professional educators or educators who perform. In addition, the task of professional teachers is to plan lessons, run a quality learning process, and assess and evaluate learning outcomes. This is similar what has been confirmed by Priansa's opinion (2018: 78) that the main task of a teacher is to plan lessons, assess learning outcomes, guide and train students. Teacher performance can be shown as a condition that shows the ability of teachers to carry out their duties at school and describes the existence of a learning activity so as to be able to guide students in achieving optimal learning achievement. <ref type="bibr">Supardi (2016: 54)</ref> states that teacher performance is the ability of a teacher to carry out learning tasks at school and is responsible for the students under his guidance by improving the achievement or learning outcomes of his students.</p><p>Teacher performance can be proven by his responsibility for the completion of the work carried out by a teacher based on the ability to manage teaching and learning activities, which include lesson planning, learning implementation, learning evaluation and fostering interpersonal relationships (interpersonal) with students. Susanto (2012) said that performance refers to the degree of completion of tasks that complement one's work. This reflects how well a person is in carrying out the demands of a job. Performance is the result of work in quality and quantity achieved by an employee who carries out his duties in accordance with the responsibilities given to him <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mangkunegara, 2015)</ref>. Suharsaputra (2013) stated organizational commitment is a form of one's willingness in the form of binding oneself with the school organization which is described by the amount of effort that includes energy, time, thoughts or the spirit of continuous learning to achieve a shared vision. Efforts to improve teacher performance must involve improving the quality of knowledge as well as attitudes and one of the factors that affect performance in the organization is the leadership style of the principal. Yukl (2010) states that leadership reflects the assumption that it involves a process in which there is a deliberate influence exerted by one person on another which aims to guide, structure oversight, and facilitate activities and relationships within a group or organization. Through transformational leadership, school principals are able to influence, move, and direct subordinates so that they are willing and able to carry out the tasks assigned to them to achieve goals. This is in line with Taufik's research study study <ref type="bibr">(2019)</ref> stating that efforts to optimize teacher performance can be carried out by school principals through example, motivation, democratic policies, giving rewards, making good personal relationships and approaches and creating a sense of security and comfort at work. The success of the principal in carrying out his duties will not be separated from the ability of the principal as a school leader in carrying out the functions and roles as principals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Maris, 2016)</ref>. Teachers in carrying out the task of learning and guiding students are required to carry out a pattern of teacher-student interaction that is very decisive in the success of the study. Suciati (2015) claimed that human life cannot be separated from communication, both verbal and non-verbal. Communication can take place in various contexts, both interpersonal communication and mass communication. In communicating the message giver/ deliverer not only considers what message will be conveyed but also how it is delivered (Harapan, 2014). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rahawarin and Arikunto (2015)</ref> in their research study study stated that effective and open communication between teachers and teachers, teachers and principals, teachers and students, as well as among every school member can direct organizational members to carry out their duties properly so that it can have a positive impact on the performance of school residents in this case the teachers. The importance of interpersonal communication as a form of stimulation in this life; (1) Assisting intellectual and social development; (2) Finding identity/self-identity; (3) Understanding the reality around us; (4) Developing mental health, Devito (Suranto, 2011). Furthermore, according to Adriani (2013), teacher performance can be improved by making interpersonal communication effective. As a result, teachers can display the best performance, and it is necessary to create good interpersonal communication. This statement is in line with research study by Ritonga (2020) which states that interpersonal communication is a key to the success of good teacher performance. Diana, Syarwani and Wahidi's research study results (2020) showed that interpersonal communication is one of the factors in the process of improving teacher performanc and achieving maximum teacher performance. Rodiah's research study <ref type="bibr">(2020)</ref> shows that there is a positive and significant influence of interpersonal communication on performance both partially and simultaneously. When interpersonal communication increases, performance will also increase. Teacher performance is needed to achieve school success. It is closely related to several factors that have been stated above, such as leadership, communication, and teacher work commitment because without good leadership, communication from existing teachers and high work commitment from teachers will be difficult. achieved the expected teacher performance. Inayatilah research results (2016) show that transformational leadership is better than visionary leadership in terms of teacher performance. While Adzkiya (2020) stated that principal leadership with a transformational leadership style, school climate and professional commitment of teachers affect the performance of MTs Ma'arif NU teachers in Banyumas Regency. Irawan and Venus research study results (2016) appointed that if the communication in the organization that is built is getting better, it will create better work results as well. This current research study in the form of a non-experimental research study using a descriptive method with correlational techniques. It aims to determine the extent of the influence or contribution of transformational leadership that can be applied by school principals and interpersonal influences on the level of interpersonal communication and teacher organizational commitment shows loyalty and high discipline on teacher performance in the form of planning, implementation and assessment of learning carried out by teachers in learning. the indirect relationship of the principal's transformational leadership through organizational commitment to teacher performance; interpersonal communication through organizational commitment with teacher performance. The population of this study were all teachers in SD Negeri Paringin District as many as 176 teachers. The technique used is proportional random sampling. The number of samples was determined by the cronbach alpha formula with a total of 122 teachers. Data collection was carried out using instruments consisting of transformational leadership (idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized considerations); interpersonal communication (openness, empathy, supportiveness, positiviness, and equality); organizational commitment (affective component, continuous component, normative component); and teacher performance (lesson planning, learning implementation, learning assessment). The data is compiled using a Likert scale that has been tested with validity and reliability tests with correlations. The data obtained using path analysis to see the direct and indirect relationship between variables, by first doing normality test, linearity test and multicollinearity. The conceptual relationship model between the variables of principal transformational leadership, interpersonal communication, organizational commitment and teacher performance can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Conceptual Relationship Model among variables</head><p>Based on the conceptual model, the hypotheses that will be proposed in this study are as follows: H1 : there is a direct relationship between the principal's transformational leadership and teacher performance; H2 : there is a direct relationship between interpersonal communication and teacher performance; H3: there is a direct relationship of organizational commitment with teacher performance; H4 : there is a direct relationship between the principal's transformational leadership and organizational commitment; H5 : there is a direct relationship of communication interpersonal with organizational commitment; H6 : there is an indirect relationship with the principal's transformational leadership through commitment to teacher performance; H7 : there is an indirect relationship of communication interpersonal through organizational commitment with teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Based on the results of the findings of data assisted by SPSS, the coefficients of direct and indirect influence were found as described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The relationship among variables can be formulated into a path analysis as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2 Results of analysis between variables</head><p>Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the rejection and acceptance of the hypothesis in this study can be seen in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The results of the path analysis as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> are used to answer the seven research study hypotheses that have been formulated whose decisions are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> is a summary of the decisions of H 1 , H 2 , H 3 , H 4 , and H 5 with the criterion of significance value is less than 0.05, then the hypothesis is accepted. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> is a summary of the decisions on hypothesis testing H 6 and H 7 with the provision that if the Sobel T coefficient is greater than the indirect relationship coefficient, then the hypothesis is accepted. Based on the results of this study, the seven hypotheses put forward have been tested for their significance, so that these results can be interpreted as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct Relationship of Principal Transformational Leadership with Teacher Performance</head><p>The results of this study found that there was a relationship between the principal's transformational leadership and teacher performance of 0.587, this indicates that the better the principal's transformational leadership, the better the teacher's performance at the school. Through transformational leadership, school principals are able to influence, move, and direct subordinates so that they are willing and able to carry out the tasks assigned to them to achieve goals. Transformational leadership has a positive effect on the effectiveness, performance of leaders and subordinates <ref type="bibr">(Sadeghi &amp; Pihie, 2012: 189)</ref>. Leadership is the ability and directing skill which is an important factor for the effectiveness of a leader's performance, as revealed by Veithzal (2011) that leadership is defined as the ability and skill of a person who occupies a position as the leader of a work unit to influence the behavior of others,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Taufik (2019)</ref> all of these studies state that there is a significant relationship between principals' transformational leadership and teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct Relationship of Interpersonal Communication with Teacher Performance</head><p>This study found that teacher interpersonal communication has a relationship with teacher performance of 0.692, the higher the interpersonal communication, the higher the teacher's performance at the school. Teacher performance can be improved by making interpersonal communication effective (Adriani: 2013), so that teachers can display the best performance, it is necessary to create good interpersonal communication.</p><p>Performance is the ability of teachers in planning, implementing and assessing learning to achieve learning objectives. For the smooth achievement of these goals, communication is needed, because communication activities within an institution are always in line with the goals of achievement in groups and in the Ngalimun community, (2017)</p><p>The results of the analysis of this study indicate that interpersonal communication has a significant influence on teacher performance. This illustrates that the higher the level of significance, the higher the teacher's performance. These results strengthen the research study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rahawarin, Arikunto (2015)</ref>; Ritonga (2020) and Rodiah (2020), which state that interpersonal communication is a key to the success of good teacher performance or in other words interpersonal communication is one of the factors that influence teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Organizational Commitment and Teacher Performance</head><p>The results of this study found that organizational commitment has a relationship with teacher performance of 0.702. This shows that strong organizational commitment will make it easier for school principals to mobilize teachers in achieving organizational goals. Organizational commitment has an important power in moving individuals to work and improve their performance. Robbins in Juwita (2020) explains that the work commitment of teachers to school organizations is a continuous process and is an individual experience when joining a school organization. Organizational commitment arises gradually in the teacher's personality starting from a personal need for the organization and then moving into a shared need and sense of belonging from the teachers to improve performance. The results of this study strengthen and support the research study of Juwita (2020); Hayati, Arapat, and Sari, (2020); <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zein and Hadijah (2018)</ref>. The results of this study indicate that there is a positive and significant influence between organizational commitment and teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principal Transformational Leadership Relationship with Organizational Commitment</head><p>This study found that the principal's transformational leadership has a relationship with organizational commitment of 0.737, this means that organizational commitment will increase along with the condition of a healthy relationship between school components including the principal. Principals who apply transformational leadership styles can inspire by providing motivation so that employees are more accomplished in their work, so that it strengthens organizational commitment Faharani (2011).</p><p>Nelda (2016) states that teachers will have a commitment to the organization in doing their work if it is supported by good principal leadership, namely the leadership of principals who are able to influence, motivate and treat teachers professionally and are able to inspire teachers, so that teachers in carrying out their duties their duties are more responsible, are willing to do the best for the organization, and in the end can foster a high commitment among teachers. The results of this study strengthen and support the research study of Yang (2012); Tuna, Ghazzawi and Catir, (2011); Dunn, Dastoor, and Sims (2012) stated that transformational leadership has a positive and significant effect on organizational commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Interpersonal Communication and Organizational Commitment</head><p>This study found that the principal's interpersonal communication has a relationship with organizational commitment of 0.770, this shows that teachers who have high interpersonal communication will be successful in carrying out their performance because they will also have high organizational commitment. Two-way communication in interpersonal communication comprehensively requires mutual trust to build one's commitment. That trust will emerge when two people's communication is even more capable of going well. Affective commitment that exists in interpersonal communication is an emotional and psychological attachment of a person identified through the desire to be involved in the organization <ref type="bibr">(Devito, 1997)</ref>. The results of this study strengthen and support Ayuningtyas' research study. N (2017); Sirait, J (2016); <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Herlambang and Fuadi (2018)</ref> all of these studies produce the same findings that there is a positive and significant relationship between interpersonal communication and organizational commitment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This study aims to analyze the direct relationship between variables: the principal's transformational leadership and teacher performance; interpersonal communication with teacher performance; organizational commitment with teacher performance; and Correlation among Principal Transformational Leadership, Interpersonal Communication and Organizational Commitment on Teacher Performance in Public Elementary Schools in Paringin District, Balangan Regency</figDesc></figure>
