<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Performance is a work achievement or a person's work based on the quality achieved in carrying out the responsibilities received. Teacher performance is a determining factor in achieving educational goals. Factors that affect performance include: teacher competence, teacher work discipline and teacher work motivation. This study aims to determine and analyze the effect of teacher competence, teacher work discipline and teacher work motivation on performance. This research approach is quantitative. The population of this study was 180 people from 18 elementary schools. The sampling technique used is Proportional Random Sampling. The number of samples was determined based on the Sloving formula with 150 respondents. collecting data using a questionnaire consisting of teacher competence (14 items), work discipline (15 items), work motivation (8 items), teacher performance (16 items). This research instrument tested the level of validity and reliability using the product moment person correlation test. The research data were analyzed using path analysis to see the direct and indirect effects between variables, by first testing normality, linearity, and homogeneity. The results showed that there was a direct and indirect influence between the influence of teacher competence, work discipline and work motivation on teacher performance. The analysis of the research results used descriptive statistics, simple regression, path analysis and multiple regression using SPSS Window Version 25. The results showed that there was an influence between: (1) teacher competence on teacher performance of 0.871, (2) work discipline on teacher performance of 0.871. 0.991, (3) work motivation on teacher performance of 0.892, (4) teacher competence on work discipline of 0.882, (5) teacher competence on work motivation of 0.884, (6) teacher competency on teacher performance through work discipline of 0.874 ( 7) teacher competence on teacher performance through work motivation of 0.868. Based on the findings of this study, it can be suggested several things such as: (1) Teachers as educators should be more active in an effort to improve teacher performance, (2) Teachers in schools should increase discipline and motivation at work, (3) educational institutions should provide opportunities for teachers to develop themselves, (4) this research should be used as a reference and a reference for conducting research that is still related.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Teacher performance in schools has an important role in achieving school goals. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Rusman (2011)</ref>, performance is an effort made from the results of work that can be achieved by a person or group of people in an organization in accordance with their respective authorities and responsibilities in order to achieve the goals of the organization concerned legally, not violating the law and in accordance with morals and ethics. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barnawi and Mohammad (2014)</ref>, teacher performance can be interpreted as "a level of success of a teacher in carrying out educational tasks in accordance with responsibilities based on work standards that have been set to achieve educational goals". The results of the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kardata (2018)</ref> mentioned problems that often occur regarding teacher performance, where teachers still have not mastered the progress of science and technology. There are still many teachers who only continue the habit of implementing the educational curriculum so that teachers lack creativity in innovating learning activities and exploring learning methods and strategies, teaching materials and new patterns of learning relationships in accordance with the progress of the times and the characteristics of today's students. The performance of teachers so far seems less than optimal. Teachers carry out their duties only as routine activities, lacking creativity. Innovation for teachers is relatively closed and creativity is not part of achievement. Things related to teacher performance are in the spotlight of various parties, because teacher performance will be felt by students and parents, so teachers are always required to improve their performance in order to realize a better educational process. Based on temporary observations made to elementary school teachers throughout Paringin District, there are indications that teacher competence is not maximized due to low mastery in the use of information technology, marked by the number of teachers who cannot use computers. With low work discipline, teachers feel that there is no example that can be imitated from leaders related to discipline. For example, the leadership's indecisiveness towards teachers who rarely attend, makes teachers who are diligent become lazy as well. The work motivation of teachers is low, because according to them there is no satisfactory award for their work performance either from the school or from the local education office, this makes them not enthusiastic at work. The competence of a teacher, disciplined attitude both in terms of time to go to school and time discipline in teaching or educating and motivation is a potential strength that exists within a teacher which greatly impacts teacher performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Daryanto (2015)</ref> in more detail explains the personal competence of a teacher, one of which is about the implementation of guidance and counseling, such as guiding students who have learning difficulties and guiding students who have problems, so when viewed from the personal competence, a teacher must take part in the student management process. Thus it will greatly affect the performance of a teacher. Teacher performance has an impact on a person's work appearance in carrying out their roles and functions in a certain environment, including in the organization. In reality, there are many factors that influence a person's behavior, so when applied to the teacher, how he works will be the basis for analyzing the background that influences him. Performance is something complex and influenced by many factors, both internal and external <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Madjid (2016)</ref> says that performance is influenced by ability and motivation. Furthermore, it is said that performance is influenced by knowledge and skills. Knowledge is influenced by education, experience, practice and interests. Skills are influenced by nature (talent) and personality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II.
