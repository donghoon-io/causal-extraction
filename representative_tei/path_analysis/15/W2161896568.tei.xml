<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The importance of genetic and environmental variation in condition in shaping evolutionary trade-offs have recently been subject to much theoretical discussion, but is very difficult to investigate empirically in most field-based systems. We present the results from mechanistic experimental manipulations of reproductive investment and condition in two female colour morphs ('orange' and 'yellow') of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana). We investigated the interactions between throat colour morphs, condition, local social environment and female survival using path-analysis. Using folliceablation experiments, we show that large clutch size has a negative effect on field survival among yellow females, and that this effect is partly mediated by immunosuppressive effects of large clutches. In orange females these effects were less pronounced, and there was a negative survival effect of strong antibody responses. Hence, we experimentally confirmed our previous findings of correlational selection between female morphotype and immunocompetence, an important condition trait. Manipulation of corticosterone revealed multiple ('pleiotropic') direct and indirect effects of this hormone on both condition and reproductive traits. We argue that interaction effects (e.g. between local environments and genotypes) could explain a substantial fraction of variation in condition and reproduction in natural populations. Increased attention to such interaction effects and their fitness consequences will provide novel insights in field studies of selection and reproductive allocation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Evolutionists have recently directed their attention to the physiological mechanisms and developmental basis of important phenotypic traits and fitness components <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Nijhout &amp; Emlen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Schlichting &amp; Pigluicci, 1998)</ref>. Although traditional quantitative genetic approaches and ecological analyses of fitness variation continue to be important, workers are now also focusing much on the relationship between physiological (or functional) and genetic architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zera et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ketterson &amp; Nolan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sinervo, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Recent models suggest that large variation in condition can mask trade-offs between fitness components <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(van Noordwijk &amp; de Jong, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Price et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Houle, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rowe &amp; Houle, 1996)</ref>. It is therefore necessary to measure important condition traits and incorporate such information in field studies of natural selection. Similarly, when individuals in a population reside in environments of different quality, micro-environmental heterogeneity will confound global estimates of selection from a larger population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brandon, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wade &amp; Kalisz, 1990)</ref>. One solution to these problems can be to incorporate measurements of local environments into path-analytical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kingsolver &amp; Schemske, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sinervo &amp; DeNardo, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a)</ref>. Of particular interest are local social environments, such as the number of neighbours or phenotype frequencydistributions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sinervo &amp; Lively, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson &amp; Sinervo, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a)</ref>. Path analysis is a flexible statistical tool to analyse such situations, because both direct and indirect effects of local environments can be estimated through the method of path coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kingsolver &amp; Schemske, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lynch &amp; Walsh, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, evolutionary ecologists have developed several sophisticated experimental techniques that allow them to manipulate physiological mechanisms (e.g. hormones) behind trade-offs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ketterson &amp; Nolan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sinervo, 1999)</ref>. Such manipulations give a more realistic picture of trade-offs than traditional manipulations of single traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Sinervo &amp; Basolo, 1996)</ref>. Physiological manipulations may also elucidate important issues in evolutionary biology such as pleiotropy (multiple effects of a gene on several traits) and physiological epistasis (interactions between different genes in phenotype formation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ketterson &amp; Nolan, 1999)</ref>. Just like the external environment may affect condition traits in both direct and indirect ways, hormonal manipulations of the internal physiological milieu could affect condition through several different pathways.</p><p>In this paper, we merge such experimental physiological techniques with measurements of condition and path-analysis of local social environments. We present data from an experimental study of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), an animal characterized by a heritable and conspicuous throat colour polymorphism <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sinervo &amp; Lively, 1996)</ref>. Throat colour can be viewed as a 'genetic marker' and is genetically correlated with several disparate behavioural, physiological and reproductive traits <ref type="bibr">(Sinervo et al., 2000a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a, b)</ref>. Trait differences between morphs presumably arise from a combination of pleiotropic effects of steroid hormones, epistatic interactions between different loci and correlational selection that refines and shapes morphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sinervo &amp; Svensson, 2002)</ref>. We manipulated clutch size, egg size, condition and survival in the field using a series of previously developed techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sinervo &amp; Licht, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sinervo &amp; DeNardo, 1996)</ref> and studied both direct and indirect effects of these experimental manipulations on two condition traits; postlaying mass and immunocompetence.</p><p>The main question in this study concerns how variation in condition is strongly affected by the local environment, by genetic background and by the interaction between the local environment and genotype. Furthermore, if variation in condition has different fitness consequences for different genotypes, it is possible that different optimal character combinations within a population and correlational selection occurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study organism, field work and general methods</head><p>We studied a free-living population of side-blotched lizards, U. stansburiana, at Los Banos, Merced County in the inner coast range of California, during 1998 and 1999 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sinervo, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sinervo, , 1999</ref> for natural history details). At our main study site, survivors from previous years (mainly hatchlings from our maternal field pedigrees) are recorded and new individuals (immigrants) are marked (toe-clips) for future identification. Captured animals are weighed to the nearest 0.1 g and their snoutvent length (SVL) is measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. Animals receive paintmarks on their backs for future identification in the field during mapping of territories. The mean number of days (±SE) that a female was observed during the reproductive season was 8.68 (±0.46). After biometric measurements and individual markings, all animals are released in the field again at their capture sites. Animals were later re-captured to record reproductive development and subsequently brought into our oviposition laboratory (see below). On average, each female was captured 4.19 (SE ¼ 0.12) times per season. For further details about general field work, see <ref type="bibr">Svensson et al. (2001a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetics and natural history of throat colour morphs</head><p>As in several other lizard species, males and females in our population occur in discrete and heritable throat colour morphs that also differ in behaviour, life-history traits and physiology, including hormone levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sinervo &amp; Lively, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sinervo et al., 2000a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a, b)</ref>. When females start to ovulate, the two female throat colour morphs appear: 'orange' and 'yellow'. The onset of throat colouration is governed by circulating hormone levels in adults, including hormonal secretion (progesterone and testosterone) of the growing follicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cooper &amp; Greenberg, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Moore et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">T. Comendant, B. Sinervo, J. Wingfield &amp; E. Svensson, unpublished data)</ref>. Parent-offspring regressions have revealed that both male (h 2 ¼ 0.87-0.96) and female (h 2 ¼ 0.48) throat colour morphs are heritable, and maternal effects do not seem to have inflated these high heritabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sinervo &amp; Lively, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zamudio &amp; Sinervo, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sinervo et al., 2001)</ref>. Furthermore, throat colour is genetically correlated with several other behavioural, physiological and reproductive traits <ref type="bibr">(Sinervo et al., 2000a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Sinervo et al., , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oviposition and incubation routines</head><p>Near-term gravid females that were about to lay were captured and brought into the laboratory to oviposit their eggs. Reproductive state was determined by abdominal palpation every week during the first 14 days of the vitellogenic cycle (24 days) and every 2-4 days during the last 10 days after ovulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sinervo &amp; Licht, 1991)</ref>. For details about lizard husbandry, laboratory conditions and general routines see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sinervo &amp; Doughty (1996)</ref>. After females had laid eggs, they were released in the field at their capture sites within 1-3 days. The average number of days (±SE) between the last field capture prior to oviposition in the laboratory and release in the field again was 15.52 (±0.61) days. During daily visits to the study area, we captured all females that survived to produce second, third and later clutches and we were thereby able to record survival between the completion of the first clutch and production of the second. Mean female survival (±SE's) between the first and second clutch was 0.588 (±0.086) in 1998 and 0.527 (±0.068) in 1999.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental manipulations</head><p>During both 1998 and 1999 we performed follicle ablation experiments according to the protocol developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sinervo &amp; Licht (1991)</ref>. Although experimental females produce larger eggs following follicle ablation, this compensatory follicle growth is not complete, resulting in lower total clutch mass compared with control females <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sinervo &amp; Licht, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sinervo &amp; DeNardo, 1996)</ref>. We ablated females in the field during late March or early April in 1998 and 1999. Manipulations were performed on average 17.5 (±1.4) days prior to bringing females into the lab to obtain their eggs. In addition, we performed sham-manipulation in some females by only subjecting them to surgery but not ablating the follicles (these females have similar survival as unmanipulated control females; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sinervo &amp; DeNardo, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>We also performed corticosterone manipulations <ref type="bibr">(DeNardo &amp; Sinervo, 1994a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sinervo &amp; DeNardo, 1996)</ref> in both 1998 and 1999. Exogenous corticosterone (B-implants) was delivered in silastic implants, and doses were adjusted to increase cortiocosterone in plasma to levels near the upper physiological levels that have been detected in previous field studies of <ref type="bibr">U. stansburiana (DeNardo &amp; Sinervo, 1994a,b)</ref>. Our preliminary data indicate that the average corticosterone-titres increased by approximately 20% in the B-implanted females, compared with controls (least square means: controls: 49.07 ± 2.97 ng mL )1 ; B-impanted: 60.03 ± 2.97 ng mL )1 ; T. Comendant, B. Sinervo, J. <ref type="bibr">Wingfield &amp; E. Svensson, unpublished data)</ref>. Sham-manipulated females were implanted with empty silastic implants soaked in saline. Both sham-manipulations and B-manipulations were performed in late February or early March on average 59.5 (±1.8) days prior to last capture in the field prior to oviposition of the first clutch.</p><p>As both our experimental manipulations may affect one or several steroid hormones that are also important in governing the development of throat colouration <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Moore et al., 1998)</ref>, the proportion of orange and yellow females in the different experimental categories could be affected. This would lead to an inbalanced data set and would affect our conclusions. However, the proportion of orange females did not differ significantly between the experimental categories (Controls: 35%; follicle-ablations: 34%; B-implanted: 30%; v 2 j2j ¼ 0.52, n.s.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunization procedures and assessment of antibody responses</head><p>In both 1998 and 1999, we performed immunizations of female lizards to measure immunological condition. By stimulating an animal's immune system with a novel antigen (protein) an antibody response is elicited. The strength of this antibody response is routinely used as a measure of humoral immunocompetence ('antibody responsiveness') by workers in veterinary medicine and ecological immunology (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cheng et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Luster et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Svensson et al., 1998)</ref>. Most vertebrates, including lizards <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Saad et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a)</ref>, can mount antibody responses against a wide diversity of antigens that have previously not been encountered by the individual. Strength of immune responses reflects both genetic and environmental variation due to nutritional state or incidence of diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cheng et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001b)</ref>. A stronger immune response indicates stronger defence against novel infections, and antibody responses are therefore typically and positively correlated with general resistance to diseases and parasites (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Luster et al., 1993)</ref>. Although no single specific immunocompetence measure can capture all the complexities of the vertebrate immune system, experimental challenge studies like ours are more informative than are correlative approaches based on leucocyte counts or parasite loads <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Svensson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Claus Koch, personal communication)</ref>. Details about antigens, immunization procedures, analyses of antibody responses and ELISA-protocol have been presented elsewhere (see <ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample sizes, statistics and general approach</head><p>We incorporate data from unmanipulated females ('controls'; <ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a)</ref> as a benchmark to compare the data from our two experiments. We first investigate the experimental effects on clutch size, egg mass and immunocompetence using data from control females, follicle-ablated and B-implanted females and shammanipulated females. As the experimental females differed significantly from both the sham-and the control-females in almost all cases, we proceed by more detailed investigations of the experimental effects using data only from the experimental and the control females (excluding the shams). The reasons for this is that for some of the sham-females we did not have a complete data set on the social environment and we also wanted to describe our experimental manipulations using dichotomized dummy variables (control: 0; experiment: 1), rather than a more complicated three-state variable (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Figs 7 &amp; 8)</ref>. The total, complete data set, in this study was 147 females, consisting of 63 control (unmanipulated) females, 29 follicle-ablated females, 28 corticosteroneimplanted females and 29 sham-manipulated females (consisting of 13 from the follicle-ablation experiment and 16 from the corticosterone-experiment). We analysed experimental and survival effects using general linear models with type-III sums-of-squares in the VGLM module in STATISTICA <ref type="bibr">(Statsoft, 2000)</ref>. We constructed models with three independent variables and all two-way interactions to investigate both main and interaction effects of the variables of interest (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref><ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref>). Of particular interest in this study are the interaction effects, because these may indicate differential responses to the social environment of the morphs, or when survival is the dependent variable: fitness epistasis and ⁄ or correlational selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Whitlock et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001b)</ref>. As the assumptions of parametric regression analysis may become violated when one is dealing with dichotomized variables like survival (nonnormally distributed residuals), we analysed the survival effects using a binomial linear model with a probit link in the VGLZ module of STATISTICA (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). We also analysed our experimental results using path analysis, a complementary approach suitable for data that is structured in causal chains like in our study system <ref type="bibr">(Svensson et al., 2001a</ref>; see next section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis of natural and experimental variation</head><p>We have previously used path analysis to reveal links between social environment, condition and survival for unmanipulated females <ref type="bibr">(Svensson et al., 2001a)</ref>. Here we include data on experimentally induced reproductive variation, taking our previous basic model <ref type="bibr">(Svensson et al. 2001a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 1)</ref> as our point of departure.</p><p>We estimated path coefficients and model fit using the SEPATH module in STATISTICA. Statistical fit of a particular path model was evaluated by comparing the observed covariance among variables to the expected covariance if the model was true. A significant difference between the observed and the expected covariance matrices indicates that a model has a poor fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mitchell, 1993)</ref>. Following standard procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gomez &amp; Zamora, 2000)</ref>, we first evaluated a full (complete) path model, and subsequently tested simpler models that were 'nested' within this basic model. These nested models were identical in causal structure and contained all the original variables, except that some (weak) paths were constrained to zero compared with the original (complete) model. We only present the 'best' models, that is, models with the lowest v 2 -value, largest P-value and greatest number of degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mitchell, 1993)</ref>. We incorporated experimental treatment as a dummy variable (control subject ¼ 0; experimental ¼ 1). We Table <ref type="table">3</ref> Binomial linear model (probit link) for how field survival from the first to the second clutch (dependent variable) of female lizards is influenced by variation in antibody responsiveness, female morphotype (yellow ¼ 0, orange ¼ 1), experimental category (control ¼ 0, follicle-ablation ¼ 1) and all two-way interactions. Sample sizes: 47 control females and 30 follicle-ablated females. Note the statistically significant interaction term between female morphotype and antibody responsiveness; this reflects the morphspecific differences in slopes of the fitness functions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). Dependent variable: antibody responsiveness.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> Model of how postlaying mass (dependent variable) of female lizards is influenced by the number clutch size, female morphotype (yellow ¼ 0, orange ¼ 1), experimental category (control ¼ 0, follicle-ablation ¼ 1) and all two-way interactions. Sample sizes: 43 control females and 28 follicle-ablated females. Clutch size was corrected for year, snout-vent length (SVL) and egg mass and postlaying mass for year and SVL prior to analysis. Note the statistically significant interaction term between female morphotype and clutch size; this reflects the morph-specific differences in slopes in the regressions of postlaying mass vs. clutch size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>Postlaying mass and clutch size were corrected for year and snoutvent length (SVL) prior to analysis. analysed the two experimental treatments, follicle ablation and B-implantation, in separate path models and compared differences in effects between the female morphs. We incorporated the number of orange and yellow neighbours as a measure of the local social environment a female encounters during the production of her clutch.</p><p>For the B-implanted females, territory information was not available and hence was not incorporated in the analyses. Instead we incorporated laying date as a variable in the B-experiment, because we knew from previous experimental studies that this type of manipulation delays laying date of the first clutch <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sinervo &amp; DeNardo, 1996)</ref>. In contrast, laying date was not incorporated in the path model for the follicle ablation experiment, as such this experimental manipulation has no effect on laying date <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sinervo &amp; DeNardo, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, to compare the overall differences between yellow and orange females in their responses to our experimental manipulations and to variation in the social environment, we calculated the correlation matrices of traits, environmental variables and experimental treatments between the two morphs. We tested for equality of these matrices using a maximum-likelihood test in STATISTICA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jennrich, 1970)</ref>. A significant difference (high v 2 -value), would indicate that the matrices differ between the two morphs, and hence yellow and orange females respond differently to variation in social environment and to our experimental manipulations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General effects of follicle-ablation experiment</head><p>As in our previous studies using the follicle-ablation experimental procedure, experimental females laid significantly smaller clutches of larger eggs (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The effects were most pronounced among the yellow females, but similar, albeit weaker, trends were found in the orange females (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of the social environment</head><p>The social environment had a strong impact on immunocompetence in the two morphs. Immunocompetence was significantly reduced with increasing number of orange neighbours among orange females whereas there was no such effect in yellow females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Thus, the immunocompetence reaction norms towards the social environment differed between the two morphs, as revealed by a statistically significant interaction term between female morphotype and number of orange neighbours (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The experimental treatment did not confound these results, as indicated by the absence of a significant experiment • orange neighbour interaction (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of follicle-ablation experiment on condition</head><p>As a result of the experimentally reduced clutch sizes, the phenotypic variance for this trait increased (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We utilized this increased variation to investigate the impact of clutch size and egg mass on the two condition traits. As clutch size and egg mass are strongly correlated, we removed the effects of egg mass from clutch size and the effects of clutch size from egg mass using residuals from linear regressions. These analyses revealed that immunocompetence was significantly reduced with increasing clutch size (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The data from both orange and yellow females were combined in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> as there was no indication that the relationship differed between the two female morphs (morph: F 1,68 ¼ 1.728, n.s.; throat • clutch size: F 1,68 ¼ 0.493, n.s.). There was no evidence that surgical manipulation per se had any impact on immunocompetence when the effects of clutch size, experimental treatment and number of orange neighbours were included in a common analysis (clutch size: F 1,63 ¼ 4.346, P &lt; 0.05; experiment: F 2,63 ¼ 1.359, P ¼ 1.965, n.s.; orange neighbours: F 1,63 ¼ 4.319, P &lt; 0.05; all two-way interactions: P &gt; 0.05). Egg mass did not have any significant effect on immunocompetence in yellow (F 1,45 ¼ 1.134, n.s.) or orange females (F 1,23 ¼ 0.452, n.s.), and there was no evidence that the relationship differed between the two morphs (morph • egg mass: F 1,68 ¼ 1.174, n.s.).</p><p>Clutch size had strong and negative effect on postlaying mass in yellow females, compared with the absence of such a relationship among orange females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Thus, reproductive investment reduced postlaying mass to a greater extent in yellow than orange females. This is revealed by the statistically significant interaction term between female morphotype and clutch size which shows that the slopes relating postlaying mass to clutch size was steeper for yellow than orange females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>. b; Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p></div>

In yellow females, there was a significant positive relationship between antibody responsiveness and survival (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>), whereas in orange females there was a more complicated relationship, as shown by 'hump' at low antibody response values and declining survival at higher values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>). The difference in slope of the two morph-specific fitness functions was significant, and the effect was not confounded by survival effects mediated via the experimental manipulation per se (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corticosterone-experiment</head><p>We present the results of our B-implant experiment in morph-specific path diagrams in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>.

Again, we present the best models, starting from a basic ('complete') path model that was subsequently simplified by constraining weak paths to zero. The fit of the models illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> were good, both for yellow females (v 2 j9j ¼ 5.04, n.s.) and for orange females (v 2 j12j ¼ 11.46, n.s.).</p><p>Strong and positive effects of corticosterone on immunocompetence in both yellow and orange females were present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). These effects contradict the traditional view of this hormone as being primarily immunosuppressive (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sapolsky, 1992</ref> for discussion). To check if the immunoenhancing effects we observed were due to the effects of corticosterone and not because of the surgical manipulation per se, we investigated how antibody responsiveness was influenced by year, experimental category (controls, shams and B-implants) and clutch size. This analysis revealed that experimental category had a strong and significant effect on antibody responsiveness, whereas the other factors did not (year: F 1,80 ¼ 1.597, n.s.; experimental category: F 2,80 ¼ 11.560, P &lt; 0.001; clutch size: F 1,80 ¼ 0.445, n.s.). The B-implants had higher antibody titres than sham-manipulated and control females [LS means (±SE): B-implants: 23.11 ± 2.94; shams: 9.79 ± 3.83; controls: 5.80 ± 2.10]. Post-hoc tests revealed that the differences between both B-implants and shams and B-implants and controls were both significant, whereas there was no significant difference between shams and controls (Fisher's LSD: B-implants vs. controls: P &lt; 0.001; B-implants vs. shams: P &lt; 0.01; controls vs. shams: n.s.).</p><p>In addition to the effects of the B-implant on immunocompetence, there were multiple, 'pleiotropic' effects of this manipulation on lay date, egg mass and postlaying mass (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). Note especially that in the orange females, B-implantation had two opposite effects on postlaying mass: another via a direct and one via an indirect pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>). The manipulation had a direct and positive effect on postlaying mass, and one negative, indirect effect via delayed lay date, which in turn reduced postlaying mass (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>). Thus, orange females gained in postlaying mass from the B-manipulation, but this effect was partly cancelled out by the later start of egg laying There is no significant relationship between clutch size and postlaying mass, but a significant effect of the manipulation (clutch size: F 1,22 ¼ 0.259, n.s.; experiment: F 1,22 ¼ 4.524; P &lt; 0.05). Equation for the regression line: Y ¼ )0.031 ) 0.024X, n.s. (n ¼ 24). The slopes differ significantly between the two morphs (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>among these females which in turn reduced postlaying mass (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schluter &amp; Gustafsson, 1993</ref> their Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested if the correlation matrices between yellow and orange females differed also in the corticosterone-experiment, as found in the follicle-ablation experiment. This was indeed the case, although the discrepancy between the matrices of orange and yellow females was not as large as in the follicle-ablation experiment, as judged by higher probability value in the significance test (v 2 j21j ¼ 38.09, P &lt; 0.05). This indicates that the corticosterone-experiment had a more similar effect on the two morphs than the follicle-ablation experiment. Alternatively, omission of information about the social environment, may have reduced some of the differences between the two morphs (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of interaction effects</head><p>Particularly striking results in this study are the interaction effects between female morphotype, traits, social environments and survival <ref type="bibr">(Figs 3,</ref><ref type="bibr">5 &amp; 6</ref>; Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref><ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref>). These interaction effects reveal the existence of different adaptive character combinations between morphotype and other fitness-related traits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>) and that morphs respond differently to local social environments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Morphs occupy different 'adaptive peaks' <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wright, 1932)</ref>, and the existence of several different optimal character combinations allow them to solve similar ecological problems in different ways (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Whitlock et al., 1995)</ref>. Fitness functions (means ± SE's) were calculated using nonparametric cubic spline regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Schluter, 1988)</ref> Experimental perturbations of the different morphs displace them from their adaptive peaks and can hence reveal both the physiological mechanisms underlying the coadapted trait complexes in the morphs and the correlational selection pressures that operate to maintain and refine the integrity of the different phenotypes. The epistatic fitness effects of female morphotype and immunocompetence should lead to a buildup of linkage disequilibrium between the alleles for morphotype and those for immune function, even if these traits are governed by separate sets of loci <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lynch &amp; Walsh, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sinervo &amp; Svensson, 2002)</ref>. If correlational selection is strong relative to recombination, and aided by physical linkage of the loci and ⁄ or close inbreeding in the population, a genetic correlation can then be formed between the interacting fitness-traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Lande, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lande, , 1984))</ref>. We have evidence for such a genetic correlation because orange females produced daughters with low antibody responses and yellow females daughters with high antibody responses <ref type="bibr">(Svensson et al., 2001b)</ref>. negative path coefficients. All variables were corrected for year and standardized to mean zero and unit variance prior to analysis. Unmanipulated females: 0. B-implanted females: 1. Clutch size, egg size and postlaying mass were also corrected for snout-vent length (SVL) prior to analysis. Notice that these path diagrams differ from those in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> in that we have not incorporated measurements of the social environment here (not available) and clutch size and egg mass have not been corrected for each other (as evident by double-headed arrows showing correlations between these two traits). For the purpose of clarity, we have omitted correlations (double-headed arrows) between immunocompetence and postlaying mass, as well as residual terms (U's). (a) Yellow females: Note especially the strong positive effect of the corticosterone-treatment on immunocompetence (positive) and the negative treatment effect on egg size. (b) Orange females: Note especially the positive corticosterone-effect on laying date, the negative path from laying date to postlaying mass and the positive direct path from treatment to postlaying mass.

The multilocus polymorphism in throat colour and immunocompetence is in turn likely to be maintained by frequency-dependent selection driven by continually evolving and changing social environments, parasites and infectious diseases <ref type="bibr">(Sinervo et al., 2000a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001b)</ref>. Strong genetic correlations between throat colour and reproductive traits (r A -estimates ranging from )0.84 to 1.09) further point to an important role for correlational selection in the buildup and maintenance of multitrait differences between these morphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sinervo &amp; Svensson, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physiological manipulations and their consequences</head><p>If morphs are occupying different adaptive peaks, as we have argued above, and the different optimal trait combinations partly result from pleiotropic effects of steroid hormones such as progesterone or corticosterone <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Moore et al., 1998)</ref>, one should ideally manipulate the levels of these hormones and investigate the different effects on condition in the different morphs. One should also investigate how variation in condition affects morph-specific survival. As the two female colour morphs are selected towards different clutch size, egg mass and immunocompetence optima <ref type="bibr">(Sinervo et al., 2000a)</ref>, manipulations of clutch size and egg mass should have different fitness consequences in orange and yellow females, as we have indeed found <ref type="bibr">(Figs 6 &amp; 7)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, manipulations of clutch size using follicle-ablations had opposing effects on immunological condition in orange and yellow females, and immunological condition in turn had different fitness effects in the two morphs <ref type="bibr">(Figs 6 &amp; 7)</ref>. These data suggest that the two female morphs are functionally integrated phenotypes that are selected towards different optimal trait combinations of morphology, physiology and behaviour (see also <ref type="bibr">Sinervo et al., 2000a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Svensson et al., 2001a)</ref>. We suggest that differences in habitat selection and thermal conditions may select for different optimal investment in immune function in orange and yellow females. Orange females tend to occupy hotter, drier habitats than yellow females (B. Sinervo, E. Svensson &amp; T. Comendant, unpublished observations) and the relative mortality rates caused by parasitic infections may differ between such environments, which in turn may drive correlational selection between morphotype and immunological condition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</p><p>Our findings of how experimentally increased corticosterone enhanced immunocompetence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>) are surprising and may at first sight contradict the conventional view of corticosterone as being immuno-suppressive <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sapolsky, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wedekind &amp; Folstad, 1994)</ref>. However, corticosterone has many effects on physiology apart from the effects on immune function <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wingfield et al., 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wingfield et al. (1998)</ref> argued that corticosterone is a major life-history hormone that mediates trade-offs between the conflicting demands of current reproduction, condition and future survival. Corticosterone enhances blood glucose levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sapolsky, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wingfield et al., 1998)</ref>, and this may improve several aspects of condition, including immunocompetence. Corticosterone also interacts antagonistically with both testosterone (T) and progesterone (P), both of which are hormones that may cause immunosuppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cooper &amp; Greenberg, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Folstad &amp; Karter, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">DeNardo &amp; Sinervo, 1994a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Moore et al., 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis, experiments and interaction effects</head><p>We have already discussed the morph-differences in the signs of the paths between the clutch size, immunological condition and future survival (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). Paths that have different signs in different path diagrams is another way of demonstrating interaction effects in more conventional analysis of variance (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref><ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref>). Two other important pieces of information can be inferred from the path diagrams. First, when there are both direct and indirect effects of an experimental manipulation, it is quite possible that these effects can have opposite signs and hence counteract each other. An example of this may be the positive direct path following B-manipulation on orange female's postlaying mass, which is counteracted by a negative, indirect path on postlaying mass via its effect in delaying lay date (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>). Secondly, from our path diagrams we can also quantify the strength of both direct and indirect experimental effects. In yellow females, there are strong and significant paths from experimental manipulation to clutch size, from clutch size to immunocompetence and from immunocompetence to survival (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>). By reducing cluch size using follicle-ablations we enhanced immunocompetence, and this in turn had a positive effect on the yellow female's field survival. The experimental effect on survival from the follicle-ablation experiment can be quantified by multiplying the successive path coefficients in the chain: ()0.451) • ()0.363) • (0.625) ¼ 0.102.</p><p>Interestingly, our findings for orange females are quite different than those for yellow females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7b</ref>). Although there was no significant effect of follicle-ablation on clutch size ()0.006), there were significant effects of clutch size on immunocompetence (+1.008) and from immunocompetence on survival ()0.620) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7b</ref>). Note that these paths are opposite in sign compared with the same paths in yellow females (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Again, this illustrates interaction effects and the multifarious differences in physiology and reproductive traits between the two phenotypes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Results of follicle ablation experiment on clutch size (residuals) in female lizards.

Solid lines: positive path coefficients. Dashed lines: negative path coefficients. All variables were corrected for year and standardized to mean zero and unit variance prior to analysis. Unmanipulated females: 0. B-implanted females: 1. Clutch size, egg size and postlaying mass were also corrected for snout-vent length (SVL) prior to analysis. Notice that these path diagrams differ from those in Fig.7in that we have not incorporated measurements of the social environment here (not available) and clutch size and egg mass have not been corrected for each other (as evident by double-headed arrows showing correlations between these two traits). For the purpose of clarity, we have omitted correlations (double-headed arrows) between immunocompetence and postlaying mass, as well as residual terms (U's). (a) Yellow females: Note especially the strong positive effect of the corticosterone-treatment on immunocompetence (positive) and the negative treatment effect on egg size. (b) Orange females: Note especially the positive corticosterone-effect on laying date, the negative path from laying date to postlaying mass and the positive direct path from treatment to postlaying mass.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The results in this study have several general implications that are likely to be important in other study systems. First, different genotypes (e.g. morphs) may respond differently to local (social) environments. Secondly, the fitness consequences of variation in condition traits may often differ between genotypes, leading to correlational selection. Thirdly, variation in reproductive allocation between genotypes and its adaptive significance can be fruitfully investigated by the use of physiological manipulations that should lead to different fitness consequences in different genetic backgrounds. Understanding the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors influencing condition and in turn the adaptive significance of variation in condition is a major challenge for evolutionary biologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Houle, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rowe &amp; Houle, 1996)</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
