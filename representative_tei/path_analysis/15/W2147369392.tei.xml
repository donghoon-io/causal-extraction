<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Albatrosses exhibit extremely low reproductive rates, each pair brooding only one egg and subsequent chick at a time. Furthermore, in several of the species, the majority of successful pairs breed only once every second year (termed 'biennial' breeding). Thus, on average, these latter species have an annual fecundity of about half an offspring per year, while other albatrosses produce an egg and chick every year. Using our 40-year bank of demographic data, we compared 12 species of albatrosses according to these two breeding strategies to examine potential causes of biennial breeding. Biennial breeding could be due to physiological constraints, larger animals breeding more slowly, or ecological constraints, more distant pelagic feeding trips being energetically costly, or both. We tested these hypotheses by looking for predicted associations between the duration of the rearing period, the distance to the oceanic feeding zone and breeding frequency. We also looked for associations of these variables with other life-history traits. Body size had a strong in uence on the duration of the rearing period, but not on the distance that birds travelled to the feeding zone. Both the duration of the rearing period and distance to the feeding zone appeared to have direct in uences on breeding frequency, as revealed by a path analysis, and thus both hypotheses to explain biennial breeding were supported. Finally, breeding frequency exhibited a strong trade-off with adult survival and age at maturity, indicating that slower breeders live through more breeding seasons, perhaps mitigating their lower annual reproductive output.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Albatrosses (family Diomedeidae, order Procellariiformes) are textbook examples of species with low reproductive rates and long lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Stearns 1992)</ref>. Albatrosses are unusual because pairs care for only one egg or chick during a breeding season, without laying a replacement egg if they fail <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Tickell 2000)</ref>. Also, albatrosses are very large birds, with body mass of species ranging from ca. 2 to 9 kg <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( Jouventin &amp; Mougin 1981)</ref>. All albatross species are pelagic, although their offshore foraging zones vary in distance from the breeding colony. These species also have extremely long lifespans: up to at least 51 years in Buller's albatross, Thalassarche bulleri; and 64 years for a female Royal albatross, Diomedea epomophora (64 years of breeding, and because the mean age at maturity is 10 years, she was probably 74! <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Del Hoyo et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sagar &amp; Warham 1993)</ref>. In addition, in some species, most pairs brood an egg and chick only every other year, and thus are biennial breeders <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Tickell 2000)</ref>. Reproductive failure can be followed by a one-year period, while a pair waits to breed again. Because some adult pairs fail to breed, a scale of average annual fecundity occurs, varying from about half an egg per year in biennial breeders to almost an egg per year in some annual breeders.</p><p>Biennial breeding is unusual among animal species, but not in albatrosses. Thus, albatrosses provide a good opportunity for studying extreme life histories in species that are similar in their lifestyles. There are ve species of albatross in which pairs, on average, breed every other year. A good example is the wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans, the largest seabird and one of the best-studied biennial breeders <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tickell 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weimerskirch &amp; Jouventin 1987)</ref>. Another species, the grey-headed albatross, Thalassarche chrysostoma, has some pairs that breed biennially, while others breed annually <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Tickell &amp; Pinder 1967)</ref>. Finally, there are about eight species in which most pairs breed every year. We estimated the frequency of reproduction for 12 of the albatross species, including all of the biennial breeders, and compared annual and biennial species with respect to ecological and life-history characteristics, in order to test two hypotheses that might explain the evolutionary shift to biennial breeding.</p><p>The rst hypothesis to explain biennial breeding is that because albatrosses are extremely large birds, development of chicks from incubation to brooding to edging may take longer, because growth to a larger size can require more time. In addition to the length of the rearing period, adults have to spend further time and energy molting before the next breeding bout can take place. Biennial breeding would be mandated if rearing, molting and recovery of body condition needed for breeding takes more than a year. Thus, we expect larger species to have a longer rearing period, and a longer rearing period should be associated with biennial breeding. This idea was previously suggested as a partial explanation of biennial breeding in albatrosses, but sampled species were too few for statistical comparisons <ref type="bibr">( Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1988)</ref>. The second hypothesis is that birds that have to travel further to forage might have relatively slower cycles of reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lack 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jouventin &amp; Mougin 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1988)</ref>. This could occur due to the direct effect of slowed or poor resource accumulation by birds that have to travel further to forage, and/or indirectly due to an in uence of the foraging distance on the duration of the rearing period. Of course, we might also expect larger species to be able to forage at greater distances from the breeding grounds. Thus, there is considerable overlap between the hypotheses. Nonetheless, opportunities to reject one or both of the alternatives could occur in an interspeci c comparison of the albatross species.</p><p>We examined an extensive dataset on 12 of the 14 (16) albatross species. Many of the data were collected over a period of up to 40 years of eld observations, and we added literature sources to our unpublished data. For the 12 species, we looked for evidence that would allow us to con rm or reject either or both of our two alternative hypotheses. In addition, we looked for any potential in uence of biennial breeding on the exceptionally high adult survival rate exhibited by all albatross species. While we realize that, theoretically, reproduction and survival should have a negative association, and thus are likely to coevolve, we also recognize that any constraints on reproduction could have associated in uences on patterns of survival. Our general expectation was that slower breeders should have longer lifespans relative to species in which breeding is primarily annual. Because a phylogeny was available for the species <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nunn et al. 1996)</ref>, we performed our analyses both with and without adjusting the data for phylogeny <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Price 1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head><p>Several populations of albatrosses were banded annually for estimates of reproduction and survival, with some species monitored for up to 40 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Serventy &amp; Curry 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jouventin et al. 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Croxall &amp; Rothery 1991)</ref>. We collected the results of such studies from the literature, and from our 40-year bank of data on several of the species (see Appendix A). The following data were collected for each species: body mass of adult females, average annual adult survival, age at rst breeding, duration of incubation shift (males and female take turns incubating, and this is the mean time that each sits before being relieved by the partner), the average number of feeding visits per day during the period before edging (both parents feed the chick on the nest during this time), duration of incubation and rearing (added together to produce the duration of the rearing period), average edging success, a class variable for the distance of the foraging zone from the breeding colony (1, 'coastal' (foraging range less than 200 km offshore); 2, 'pelagic' (foraging range more than 200 km and less than 1000 km); or 3, 'highly pelagic' (foraging range more than 1000 km)) and frequency of breeding (annual rate of production of an egg). The pelagic range of several species is not still known, but we combined measurements obtained by satellite tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">( Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1990</ref>) and observations at sea of banded birds into a class variable. Because pairs lay only one egg, the mean frequency of breeding was the best measure of reproductive rate for interspeci c comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allaine et al. 1987)</ref>.</p><p>In each of the reviewed studies, the different parameters were not always collected and summarized in the same way. In addition, some variables, such as the duration of brooding turns that partners take, change as the reproductive season progresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Weimerskirch et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Weimerskirch 1995)</ref>. In these cases, we took the conservative approach of deleting any questionable data. We examined natural-log transformations of variables measured in grams, days, years, and number of young, and arcsine-and natural-log-transformed frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gaillard et al. 1989)</ref>. Transformations, however, did not improve normality of the variables, as the t to a normal distribution was much poorer in some cases, and both sets of analyses were identical in pattern. Thus, we conducted analyses on untransformed data.</p><p>We rst examined differences between annual and biennial breeding species (six species in each group) with ANOVA. For the analyses, we considered grey-headed albatrosses as exhibiting biennial breeding, although some pairs breed annually. We then examined correlations among variables that differed between these two groups of species. We constructed a ' ow' diagram of how the two hypotheses might interact and how they might in uence breeding frequency (after <ref type="bibr">Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1988)</ref>. As part of this diagram, we conducted a standardized partial regression analysis (viz., path analysis) to evaluate direct and indirect in uences of the duration of the rearing period and distance to the feeding zone on breeding frequency.</p><p>We used a phylogeny for the albatrosses' family (Diomedeidae) that was derived from cytochrome-b data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nunn et al. 1996)</ref>. In the absence of reliable branch lengths for the species, we assumed equal amounts of time between adjacent nodes on the tree. Phylogenetic in uences on variation in lifehistory traits among albatross species were estimated by network autocorrelation (after <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheverud et al. 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dunham &amp; Miles 1992)</ref>. Values of r 2 from network autocorrelation analyses were used to indicate whether there was 'phylogenetic signal' in our variables. We further examined phylogenetically independent contrasts (after Felsenstein 1985), using the PDAP software <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Garland et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Garland &amp; Ives 2000)</ref>. Statistical analyses were preformed using SAS (SAS Institute, <ref type="bibr">Inc. 1990</ref>) and Microsoft Excel, v. 5.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>We rst looked for differences between species that exhibit primarily annual breeding versus those that exhibit biennial breeding. Biennial breeders were not quite signi cantly larger than annual breeders (table 1), primarily because the two species of sooty albatrosses are biennial breeders, but are among the smallest albatrosses <ref type="bibr">( Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1988)</ref>. Biennial breeders survived better than annual breeders, although only by ca. 2%. Biennial breeders also had a later age at maturity, shorter shifts of partners during incubation, a longer rearing period (de ned as the period from laying to edging) and more distant feeding zones than annual breeders. There was no difference, however, between annual and biennial breeders in the frequency of feeding of chicks during brooding or in edging success.</p><p>Network autocorrelation revealed that among the lifehistory variables of albatrosses, phylogeny explained more than 10% of the variation in only body mass (r 2 = 0.25) and the length of the rearing period (r 2 = 0.37). Although perhaps substantial, these autocorrelations were not signi cant (all z-scores less than 1.33, p . 0.18). We performed correlation analyses of our variables both with unadjusted data and data adjusted for phylogeny by inde-  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Because the direction of correlations among variables and the general magnitude of correlations were similar, we concluded that phylogenetic in uences were not substantial. In such circumstances, making adjustments for phylogeny might be as likely to obscure patterns as reveal them <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Price 1997</ref>), so we chose to conduct further analyses on unadjusted data. We examined correlations among variables that differed between annual and biennial breeding albatrosses. Body mass was most strongly associated with the length of the rearing period ( gure 1), and secondarily and negatively with mean breeding frequency (table 2). Mean breeding frequency exhibited negative associations with traits associated with longevity (adult survival and age at maturity), positively with incubation shift, and negatively with the duration of the rearing period and the rank distance to the feeding zone.</p><p>We examined these associations within the context of a diagram that re ected our expectations of associations of life-history traits under our two hypotheses to explain biennial breeding. Following our expectation from the rst hypothesis, body mass was positively correlated with the length of the rearing period, but body mass had little association with the distance to the feeding zone ( gure 2). Because the length of the rearing period, distance to the feeding zone and breeding frequency all exhibited strong associations, we conducted a path analysis of these three variables.</p><p>Multiple regression indicated that the length of the rearing period and distance to the feeding zone could account for the majority of variation in the frequency of reproduction (r 2 = 0.613, d.f. = 2,9, F = 7.12, p = 0.01). As expected under the rst hypothesis, rearing period appeared to have a signi cant negative path to breeding frequency ( gure 1; p = 20.505, t = 22.127, one-tailed p = 0.03). As expected under the second hypothesis, the feeding zone had a negative path to breeding frequency that approached signi cance ( p = 20.401, t = 21.691, one-tailed p = 0.06). The length of the rearing period and , that it is slowed by lengthy rearing periods and that it is slowed for species with feeding zones far from the breeding colonies). Path coef cients ( p-values) for a path analysis (viz., a standardized partial regression analysis) are given for the regression of breeding frequency on rearing period and feeding zone. All other associations (r-values) are measured by correlation. (Single asterisk, signi cance at the a = 0.05 level; and double asterisk, signi cance at the a = 0.01 level.) feeding zone, however, were positively associated, so bias may have occurred due to collinearity. Collinearity causes two problems: in ation of the path coef cients and in ation of the variance about these coef cients. Our maximum condition index of 11.3 indicated that some in ation of the path coef cients probably occurred, although some authors indicate that the index must be over 30 to indicate a serious problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Petraitis et al. 1996)</ref>. Thus, we present both the path coef cients ( gure 2) and correlations among the variables (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Variance in ation factors for our path coef cients were both 1.31, well below the recommended cut-off value of 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Myers 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we considered whether the life histories of albatrosses re ected an expected trade-off between reproduction and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Reznick 1985)</ref>. Because edging success did not vary between annual and biennial breeders (table 1), albatrosses lay only one egg per breeding season (see § 1), and breeding frequency exhibited strong associations with other life-history traits, we chose to examine the latter variable for comparison with variables that re ected longevity. Breeding frequency was signi cantly negatively associated with adult survival and with age at maturity ( gure 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Our purpose was to test two hypotheses about possible causes of biennial breeding. We examined this in albatrosses because they comprise a sample of both annual and biennial breeding species in a single family of birds that exhibit similar lifestyles. In particular, albatrosses, like all Procellariiform species, lay only one egg per breeding attempt <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Warham 1990)</ref>. Thus, breeding success should be closely allied to breeding frequency in these species, especially as edging success was not signi cantly different between annual and biennial breeders (table 1).</p><p>Our rst hypothesis was that the length of the rearing period for large albatrosses is simply too long for adults to recover body condition in time to breed in successive years. As expected, the length of the rearing period was strongly in uenced by body mass, with the largest albatrosses having the longest rearing periods ( gure 1). However, large size alone was not suf cient to explain biennial breeding, because the two sooty albatross species are biennial breeders (Appendix A; see also <ref type="bibr">Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1988)</ref>. Sooty albatrosses are among the smallest species in this group. However, the rearing period lasted on average almost 10 weeks longer in biennial breeders (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Path analysis revealed a signi cant in uence of rearing period on breeding frequency ( gure 2), so this hypothesis was supported in albatrosses.</p><p>Our second hypothesis was that the distance to the feeding zone would limit breeding frequency, either directly or by in uencing a longer rearing period. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lack (1968)</ref> rst suggested the idea that long trips to distant foraging zones should reduce reproductive rates in pelagic feeding birds, although his prediction was for seabirds in general, rather than for a closely related group like albatrosses. Nonetheless, we examined this second hypothesis. We expected that body size might have an in uence on how far birds foraged from the breeding colony, because larger birds might more easily cover thousands of kilometres of ocean. But body mass had little association with the distance to the feeding zone (table 1). However, there appeared to be a direct in uence of the distance to the feeding zone on breeding frequency in albatrosses ( gure 2). Also, because the distance to the feeding zone and the duration of the rearing period were correlated, an indirect in uence was possible: of the feeding zone on breeding frequency through lengthened rearing periods for biennial breeders. The duration of incubation shifts was actually shorter in biennial breeders, but feeding rates of parents during brooding were very similar for annual versus biennial breeders. An indirect in uence of feeding zone on the rearing period and then breeding frequency was not evident. The potential strength of an indirect effect can be estimated by the product of the correlation between the feeding zone and the rearing period multiplied by the path coef cient between the rearing period and breeding frequency. This estimate (r ´p = 20.245) was low, indicating that any indirect effect was slight, although the total effect of the feeding zone on breeding frequency was substantial (direct effect 1 indirect effect: 20.401 1 20.245 = 20.646).</p><p>Until recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">( Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1990)</ref>, it was impossible to know where and how far pelagic birds travelled to feed at sea. Several satellite tracking studies of albatrosses have now been carried out, and allow measurement of the foraging range of an increasing number of species. Even though direct measurements of foraging range have not been made for all albatross species, we found a relationship between the foraging range (through our classi cation of feeding 'zones') and breeding frequency. Albatrosses make remarkable foraging trips of thousands of kilometres. These long foraging trips may be due to necrophagous dietary habits, as in vultures and condors. Distant foraging trips may incur high costs in energy or time, and prevent parents from rearing several chicks. In biennial breeders, the cost of distant foraging trips may substantially lower the body condition of parents after rearing, explaining why the small biennial albatrosses like sooties have to wait more than one year to breed again, even though the rearing period is only about eight months (Appendix A; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Weimerskirch 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Weimerskirch et al. 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Reproduction and survival are expected to trade-off in life histories, although phenotypic evidence of such tradeoffs cannot be used to test this hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Reznick 1985)</ref>. Nonetheless, breeding frequency had a strong trade-off with adult survival and age at maturity ( gure 2) as previously found in terrestrial birds (data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Saether (1988)</ref>, reanalysed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bennet &amp; Harvey (1988)</ref>). Biennial breeders survived ca. 2% better than annual breeders. Because survival rates are extremely high for albatrosses, a 2% advantage can translate into many more years of life and thus many more years of breeding, perhaps mitigating slower reproductive rates <ref type="bibr">(Weimerskirch et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1991)</ref>. Albatrosses may be an especially good group to show such trade-offs, because of their limited reproductive effort (viz., production of a sin- gle egg that occurs each year or every other year, and without replacement if the egg is lost). In summary, both our hypotheses are compatible and complementary explanations of biennial breeding in albatrosses. Albatrosses breed biennially in part due to their large size but also because of their pelagic way of life. Great albatrosses are necessarily biennial due to their size and associated long rearing periods, and due to their impressive feeding trips <ref type="bibr">( Jouventin &amp; Weimerskirch 1988</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1990)</ref>. But sooty albatrosses probably breed every two years primarily due to their distant foraging trips for such relatively small albatrosses. Finally, production of young and adult survival appear closely linked in albatrosses, and further studies of albatrosses and petrels may yield important insights for life-history theory.</p><p>Logistical and nancial support for our long-term demographic studies was provided by the Institut Franc ¸ais pour la Recherche et la Technologie Polaires.
