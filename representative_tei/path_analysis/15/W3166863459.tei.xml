<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>In recent decades, the incidence and prevalence of kidney stones have increased worldwide. Urolithiasis is a common cause of morbidity with a life time risk of 5-12% in Europe and the USA <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2)</ref>. Since kidney stones are a potential risk factor for irreversible renal function loss with a high disease burden, many studies have been conducted to explore kidney stone formation's pathophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>The most common component of nearly 80% of kidney stones is made of calcium in the form of calcium oxalate and, to a lesser extent, calcium phosphate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Therefore, controlling excess calcium excretion in the urine (hypercalciuria) is very important for kidney stone prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Hypercalciuria is one of the most common urine metabolic abnormalities among calcium stone formers, with a prevalence of 35-65%. Excess calcium excretion in the urine could be responsible for the supersaturated status of urinary calcium salts and lead to crystallization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><p>Urine calcium excretion is affected directly or indirectly by various factors (such as demographic or metabolic) that are not entirely known.</p><p>Calcium homeostasis in the body is mainly regulated via complex interactions between various organs, including the intestines, kidney, and bones (6). According to the regulatory mechanisms, hypercalciuria is classi ed as intestinal absorptive, renal leak, or parathyroid resorptive hypercalciuria <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Hypercalciuria with no identi able metabolic cause was de ned as idiopathic, which is the cause for at least 50% of the calcium stones (6).</p><p>Two important hormones, which play a crucial role in calcium homeostasis, are parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. Active form of vitamin D or calcitriol stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and bone resorption and decreases renal calcium excretion. PTH is secreted in response to extracellular calcium level alterations and provides minute-by-minute regulation of serum calcium through stimulation of renal reabsorption, bone resorption, and on a more chronic basis, stimulation of intestinal absorption by promoting the conversion of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) to calcitriol (8, 9). Thus, inadequate or excessive levels of PTH or calcitriol could dysregulate these mechanisms and cause hypercalciuria.</p><p>In addition to the PTH and calcitriol, urinary parameters such as urinary sodium, citrate, and demographic factors can affect urinary calcium levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. An in-depth understanding of this complex interaction between different variables that regulate calcium homeostasis could help to understand the pathophysiology of idiopathic hypercalciuria and improve its management. However, population-based data on this area is scarce, and the complex direct and indirect effects of serum and urinary metabolites on urine calcium have surprisingly not been fully explored. Thus, this study aims are to assess the interrelationship between serum, urinary and demographic factors that may affect urine calcium in a population of calcium stone formers. Using pathway analysis, we hypothesize and test how urine metabolites and serum variables may, directly and indirectly, in uence urine calcium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>This study was a secondary data analysis using the baseline data of our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. This retrospective study included data from kidney stone patients referred to the Labba nejad kidney stone prevention clinic from March 2015 to May 2019. Patients who were ≥18 years old and had undergone serum assessment for 25(OH)D were included in the previous study. The current study considered serum, urinary, and demographic factors of those patients to evaluate their effect on 24-hour urine calcium (24-U Ca) using path analysis. Patients who had a known history of primary hyperparathyroidism or any chronic diseases that could affect urine calcium (such as sarcoidosis), had a history of chronic kidney disease, consuming any medication interfering with calcium hemostasis three months before the assessment (such as thiazides, steroids, or calcium supplements), were pregnant or lactating, or had urinary tract infection at the time of assessment were excluded. Details regarding participant recruitment were presented elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. In addition to age and weight, the twenty-four-hour urine metabolites in terms of creatinine, urea, citrate, sodium, as well as serum variables including phosphorus (P), PTH, calcium (Ca), 25(OH)D, and creatinine (Cr) were considered to investigate their effect on 24-U Ca.</p><p>Path Analysis, an extension of the regression model, is a statistical technique used to examine causal relationships between two or more variables, and its pathways represent the hypotheses of researchers. This analysis provides a comprehensive picture of the associations between the predictors and dependent variable. Here, path analysis was used to determine the pathways by which urine metabolites and serum variables interact to in uence the primary outcome variable, 24-U Ca. The path model, presented in gure 1, was developed by review the articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, textbooks (4) and the consensus of experts who specialize in various aspects of kidney stone prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>In this model, the direct effect represents the direct impact of one predictor on the outcome while not transmitted through a third variable. The indirect effect is the impact of a predictor on the outcome transmitted by a third variable. The total effect of a predictor on the response is obtained by summing direct and indirect effects related to different pathways. The size of the effects is reported both in standardized and unstandardized terms. Unstandardized coe cients used the original variables' measurement scale and indicated the strength of the relationship between variables. Standardized coe cients were values transformed into the same unit and used to compare the effects of variables on the response. The study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration (Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p>Descriptive statistics including frequency and percentage for qualitative variables and means with standard deviations for quantitative ones were used. The mean of quantitative variables between patients with 24-U Ca less than 200 mg and 24-U Ca more than 200 mg was compared using independent samples t-test. Pearson correlation was calculated to determine the relationship between urine metabolites and serum variables. The main analytic plan, path analysis, involved the primary outcome variable, 24-U Ca, and the predictor variables of interest, including age, weight, 24-urine metabolites and serum variable. The adequacy of the path model was tested using the Relative Chi-Square (CMIN/DF), and the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The RMSEA&lt;0.1, and CMIN/DF of 1-5, indicate an acceptable t to the data. Path analyses were conducted using the Amos 24.0.0, an IBM SPSS Statistics module. Other statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 25.0. The signi cance level was set at 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Of the 1021 evaluated individuals, 593 (58%) had complete data and were included in the analyses. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the characteristics of the study participants, and compares patients with 24-U Ca less than 200 mg/day and 24-U Ca more than 200 mg/day. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis result</head><p>The path analysis model is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which presents hypotheses about the relationships between variables. This model had a good t with a CMIN/DF = 187.807/44 = 4.26, RMSEA = 0.086 (CI: 0.076, 0.097). The parameter estimates derived from the path analysis model are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Furthermore, the total, direct and indirect effects of variables on the main outcome (24-U Ca) are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The results showed that age and weight had an indirect effect on 24-U Ca (β= -0.394 and β = 0.780, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). The negative coe cient suggested that 24-U Ca is lowered with an increase in age. Furthermore, the increasing weight will indirectly increase 24-U Ca.</p><p>Regarding serum variables, 25(OH)D did not signi cantly affect 24-U Ca. However, it had an indirect effect on 24-U Ca with serum PTH participation (β = 0.028, P &lt; 0.05). Conversely, serum PTH directly affected 24-U Ca (β= -0.254, P = 0.023) without an indirect effect. Serum Ca did not have any direct or indirect effect; however, Serum P appeared to in uence 24-U Ca indirectly (β = 1.907, P &lt; 0.05). Serum Cr had a signi cant direct effect on 24-U Ca (β= -34.065, P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Regarding 24-hour urine metabolites, it was shown that 24-U Na, 24-U Urea, and 24-U Cit had a signi cant direct effect on 24-U Ca (β = 0.220, β = 1.817, β = 0.066, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). 24-U Cr has a signi cant direct and indirect effect on 24-U Ca with participation of 24-U Cit and 24-U Urea as mediating variables (β = 27.616 for direct effect and β = 30.256 for indirect effect, P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>According to standardized coe cients Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, 24-U Cit had the most effect on 24-U Ca, following 24-U Cr, 24-U Urea, 24-U Na, serum Cr, and weight. Serum Ca had the lowest effect on 24-U Ca.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>According to the studies, several risk factors could contribute to calcium kidney stones. Among them, hypercalciuria is one of the most common urine metabolic abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The excretion of calcium in the urine might be affected by serum variables, demographics, and other urinary metabolites. Our study revealed that 24-U Ca excretion decreases with increasing age, serum PTH and serum Cr. Conversely, 24-U Ca increases with weight gain, increasing 24-U Na, 24-U Cit, 24-U Urea, and 24-U Cr.</p><p>Among demographic factors, we included age and weight in our analysis. Previously, two large-sample studies found no association between age and hypercalciuria <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. However, Taylor et al. reported an inverse association between age and 24-U Ca; every ve-year increase in age was associated with a 6 mg (95% CI 4 to 9 mg/d) decrease in 24-U Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Our analyses showed that age indirectly affected urine calcium through serum 25(OH)D, serum Cr and 24-U Cr.</p><p>Previous studies showed that higher weight is associated with higher urinary calcium excretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Our ndings showed that body weight indirectly affects 24-U Ca through 24-U Na, 24-U Urea, and 24-U Cr. These results suggest that the effect of weight on urinary calcium excretion may be in part due to higher protein and salt intake in patients with higher weight. More studies regarding this nding are warranted.</p><p>Vitamin D causes a positive balance of calcium in the body through stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption. However, since different studies' results are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, the relationship between serum vitamin D and 24-U calcium excretion is under debate. A recent meta-analysis, including twenty-two observational studies (3510 kidney stone formers and 19,718 controls), revealed that 25(OH)D was similar in both groups. Conversely, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) was signi cantly higher in stone formers than controls. More detailed studies on kidney stone formers indicated that hypercalciuric patients had signi cantly higher 1,25(OH)2D and 25(OH)D compared with normocalciuric stone patients and non-stone forming controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Two population-based studies, InChianti Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> and Swiss Survey on Salt Intake Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, showed that the level of serum 25(OH)D was positively associated with urinary calcium excretion in men but not in women. Other studies failed to observe any correlations between 25(OH)D and urinary calcium excretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. The results of our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> showed that the 24-U Ca increased in vitamin D supplemented patients, which was not associated with serum 25(OH)D or PTH Other results of that study suggested that the increase 24-U Ca might be due to other factors such as dietary sodium and protein intake. In line with our previous ndings, the current study results showed that serum 25(OH)D did not have a direct effect on 24-U Ca, and the indirect effect was through serum PTH. This effect is negligible; therefore, the treatment of hypovitaminosis D could be safe in kidney stone formers, in case other variables, such as sodium intake, are controlled. Further randomized clinical trials are needed in this regard.</p><p>PTH is responsible for minute-by-minute regulation of serum ionized calcium, through stimulation of renal calcium reabsorption and bone resorption. Furthermore, PTH stimulates the conversion of 25(OH)D to its active hormonal form (1,25(OH)2D) in the kidney, thereby promoting absorption of calcium in the small intestine (8, 9). A negative correlation between serum PTH and urinary calcium excretion is shown in previous studies, which is considered as the normal process of serum calcium balance. Similarly, our current results showed that PTH had a signi cant inverse effect on 24-U Ca directly. However, excessive PTH secretion from a parathyroid adenoma (primary hyperparathyroidism) leads to excessive bone resorption and increased renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D, which in turn enhances intestinal absorption of calcium.</p><p>Therefore, the net effect is elevated serum calcium levels, which leads to higher urine calcium. Conversely, the level of urine calcium is decreased in secondary hyperparathyroidism, due to increased calcium resorption from kidney tubules. One of the common causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism are vitamin D de ciency, therefore the level of serum PTH is decreased after vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>The previous observational ndings of the association between serum Ca and excretion of Ca in 24-h urine are inconsistent. The study, which was conducted on 1293 participants (624 men and 669 women), found a positive association between serum Ca and 24-U Ca in women but not men <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, while the InChianti study (595 subjects including 302 men and 293 women) observed this association in men but not women <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. In an interventional small-sized study by Peacock et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> on 72 individuals, a positive association was observed between serum and urinary Ca in both men and women. Our results revealed that there is no signi cant direct or indirect association between serum Ca and 24-U Ca. Normally, serum calcium is tightly controlled in a narrow range during calcium hemostasis. Since we excluded patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or any other diseases affecting serum Ca, total serum Ca was in a narrow range in all patients, and we could not nd any association between serum and urine Ca. However, serum P appears to in uence 24-U Ca indirectly. It seems that the effect of serum P on urinary Ca levels may be more prominent, and further studies are needed in this eld.</p><p>In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>, our results indicated that higher excretion of Na was positively correlated with 24-U Ca. The positive effect of Na intake, measured through 24-U Na, on urinary Ca excretion has been demonstrated in previous studies (26, 27). Because sodium and Ca are reabsorbed at common sites in the renal tubules, the direct correlation of sodium and Ca in the urine is expected (28).</p><p>The relationship between urinary citrate and Ca may be challenging to discuss. Taylor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> discussed that since acid load could increase urinary Ca and decrease urinary citrate, it would be reasonable to expect an inverse association between urinary citrate and Ca. Moreover, some studies reported that potassium citrate consumption could reduce urinary Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. However, we observed a marked direct effect of 24-U Cit on urinary Ca excretion, which was reported by other studies too <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>. Other factors such as dietary Ca intake may play a part in such association. Further studies are needed to elucidate the topic.</p><p>Data about the relationship between 24-U Ca and other factors included in our analysis are limited. Taylor et al. did not nd any associations between urinary Cr and Ca after multivariate adjustment. However, we observed a positive effect of both serum and urinary Cr on 24-U Ca. Besides, our study revealed a direct effect of 24-U Urea on 24-U Ca. Since 24-U Urea is a substitute for dietary protein intake, our results suggested an increase in 24-U Ca with high protein intake. This nding is in line with existing studies. However, since we did not evaluate the 24-U sulfate or dietary intake, we could not evaluate the effect of animal and vegetable protein intake on 24-U Ca separately.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, we could not assess the effect of calcium on PTH since we did not test ionized calcium. Second, the dietary intake was not available in our study. Third, additional factors affecting 24-U Ca may not be considered in our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, urinary calcium excretion is higher in younger obese patients with normal kidney function. Except for serum calcium, all other predictors had direct and/or indirect effect on 24-U calcium. Serum 25(OH)D had a negligible indirect effect on 24-U calcium. Controlling dietary intake of protein and sodium and body weight seems very important in kidney stone formers with hypercalciuria.</p><p>Declarations Figures</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="11,28.00,36.00,397.46,391.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
