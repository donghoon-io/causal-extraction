<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The causal/effect of seven salient beliefs and an individual's attitude and norms, all of which lead to form a person's Behavioural Intention (BI), are not well documented in the context of Internet Banking (IB).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The consumers' adoption of Internet banking (IB) has received wide attention from researchers in different contexts such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Black et al. (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Polatoglu &amp; Ekin (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tan &amp; Teo (2000)</ref> among others. Also, incorporating the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory is a new research practice. Therefore, this study examines the determinants of IB in light of both <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers' (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein's (1980)</ref> theories in an integrated model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers (1995)</ref> suggested five important characteristics of an innovation that influences its adoption. These are relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, observability and trialability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Taylor and Todd (1995)</ref> utilized these attributes as indicators of attitude in TPB. More to the point, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers (1995)</ref> suggested two types of interaction channels that accelerate the diffusion of innovation. These are word-of-mouth (WOM) and mass media (MM) interaction. Previous adoption studies that utilized the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) used the word-of-mouth referent but not that of mass media <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Taylor and Todd, 1995)</ref>. This study has expanded upon the types of referent describing the normative belief of an innovation, which may be assumed to affect its adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>Internet banking can be defined as the provision of banking services by a bank to its customers over the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Daniel, 1999)</ref>. In recent years, IB has been one of the major developments in the financial service sector. <ref type="bibr">Floh and Treiblmaiera (2006)</ref> reported that over the last five years IB was the fastest growing Internet activity in the U.S. and in Germany the number of online accounts increased almost tenfold, with 40% of all accounts now being online. IB's literature shows that several scholars have used several theoretical models to study IB adoption. This study has two key objectives; firstly, to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of IB and, secondly, to propose an incorporated theoretical method that can be used as a reference for future studies of innovation diffusion in the field of MIS. This study commenced with a revision of the main theoretical frameworks commonly used for analyzing the adoption of innovations in MIS. These are Innovation Diffusion Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rogers, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore &amp; Benbasat, 1991)</ref>, Theory of Reasoned Action <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, Technology Acceptance Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Davis, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000)</ref>, Theory of Planned Behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, and Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995)</ref>. A comprehensive review of the IS literature on Internet banking (IB) adoption was conducted and research found an absence of studies exploring the adoption of IB in light of Rogers' diffusion of innovation (DOI). In addition, none of the previous studies attempted to identify the prominent predictors utilizing an integrated framework based on human psychology behaviour and innovation characteristics. This study fills this gap by introducing a conceptual framework merging the TRA into Rogers' DOI.</p><p>2.1 The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) <ref type="bibr">Ajzen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Fishbein developed the TRA in 1967 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">1980.</ref> It is designed to explain human behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980)</ref> and consists of two factors that affect behavioural intentions; attitude towards behaviour and subjective norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Behavioural Intention (BI)</head><p>Behavioural intentions are regarded according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Armitage and Christian (2003)</ref> as an individual's decision to follow a course of action, as well as an index of how hard people are willing to try and perform the behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. Theoretically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein (1980)</ref>, proposed in the TRA that attitudes and subjective norms (SN) affect BI. Accordingly, the influence of attitude on behaviour is mediated through behavioural intentions. Many researchers like <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Armitage and Christian (2003)</ref> use a BI construct as a dependent variable, assuming that intentions are sufficiently predictive of behaviour and consistently lead to behaviour. For instance, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) hypothesizes that the actual use of technology is affected by the BI which is itself affected by the attitude towards use. Similarly, in the TRA, the effects of attitude and SN on behaviour are thus mediated by BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Attitude</head><p>Attitude had been assumed to be predictive of behaviour in many psychological studies, for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Armitage and Christian (2003)</ref> who defined it as "the individual's overall positive or negative evaluations of behaviour". It is an important determinant in the information system studies which influence the intention to adopt the system. It was proposed by multiple theories including TRA, TPB and also was utilized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis' (1993)</ref> TAM to examine user acceptance of computer technology. Furthermore <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Taylor and Todd (1995)</ref> employed attitude to understand the usage of information technology which was found to be an influential element for intention behaviour. Hence, attitude seems to be a person's evaluation or general feeling of favourableness or unfavourableness to use Internet banking services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Subjective Norms</head><p>The influence of social environment on BI is the second normative component in the TRA which according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen and Fishbein, (1980)</ref> concern a persons' perception that most people who are important to him think he should or should not use Internet banking services. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pavlou and Chai (2002)</ref> related the issue of social influence to Hofstede's dimension of collectivism in which individuals are integrated into groups and form their judgments based on group norms. The normative influence, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bearden et al., (1986)</ref> occurs when individuals conform to the expectations of others. Similarly, the informational-based normative influence, according to <ref type="bibr">Rogers (1995, p.199)</ref> occurs when potential adopters are aware of an innovation and are motivated to try it. Empirically in this study, normative beliefs are determined by indicating, "The extent to which a referent would expect a potential adopter to adopt internet banking. In fact, the TRA built on that specific salient belief influences behavioural perceptions and subsequent actual behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980)</ref>. There are two types of belief in the TRA that affect two perceptual constructs: behavioural beliefs that influence attitudes, and normative beliefs that affect subjective norm. In turn, these two perceptual constructs determine behavioural intentions and actual behaviour. These salient beliefs are discussed in section 2.2 in the light of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers (1995)</ref> theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers (1995)</ref> theory, introduces four main elements in the diffusion of innovations. They are; innovation attributes, communicated channels, time and social system. The first elements asserted that the rate of adoption of innovations is impacted by five factors: relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, observability, and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rogers, 1995)</ref>. Working in an IS context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref> examined the influence of these attributes on attitude. All factors except for complexity are generally positively correlated with the rate of adoption. The second element asserting two communication channels, which according to Rogers' (1995) theory will affect the dissemination of the innovation to others, are the interpersonal influence (word-of-mouth) and the mass media that the individual possesses within the 'innovation decision process'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Factors of Innovation Attributes</head><p>In terms of innovation attributes, an individual's perception about the innovation attributes according to <ref type="bibr">Rogers (995)</ref> review is the first main element in the diffusion of innovation. In line with <ref type="bibr">Rogers (995)</ref> concepts, Internet banking should show attractive characteristics to customers which in turn lead to maximize the rate of adoption by them. Rogers (995) recommended some characteristics like; (1) Relative advantage, (2) Compatibility, (3) Complexity, (4) Trialability and (5) Observability. Thus, researchers have to evaluate IB characteristics as seen by those people within the social system of the banking industry to understand the trend of adoption and also the adoption rate. Innovation Attributes were utilized by many authors of IS including <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Taylor &amp; Todd (1995a, b)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sarel and Marmorstein (2003)</ref> to study innovations diffusion in the IS context. Some authors like <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Black et al. (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Polatoglu &amp; Ekin (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tan &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Teo (2000), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Al-Sabbag &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mola (2004)</ref> have applied Rogers' variables to IB where different models were discussed. To digress, Rogers' (1995) literature proposed that innovations which are perceived by individuals as having greater relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, observability, and less complexity will have a greater adoption rate than other innovations. To look more closely, this study will elaborate and discuss the issue of these attributes in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Relative Advantage (RA)</head><p>In light of Rogers' (1995) review, the RA of IB is defined here as to what extent an individual perceives IB as being better than the idea it supersedes. Advantages of IB is often expressed as effectiveness, time and effort savings, immediacy of the reward or as decrease of discomfort and social prestige. The construct of relative advantage according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mattila et al., (2003)</ref> can be seen differently in the context of different innovations and different consumers. The value of IB arises and is formed from lowering the transaction costs for both customer (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lichtenstein and Williamson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Floh and Treiblmaier, 2006)</ref> and banks. It is also derived from the globularity of the medium, i.e. individuals can freely transact and get access to their local bank current account when they are overseas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lichtenstein and Williamson, (2006)</ref> reported that the consumer also considers whether the perceived relative advantages of Internet banking, when compared with other forms of banking, outweigh the perceived risks and costs. In this line, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mattila et al., (2003)</ref> reported that the relative advantage gained, compatibility of services with adopters existing values, turned out to be the most significant predictors of adoption in IB. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sarel and Marmorstein (2003)</ref> pointed out that when both relative advantage and felt need are low, marketers must make efforts to increase the perceived value of the benefits and issues. Perceived usefulness according to the TAM introduced by Davis' (1989) has a direct affect on attitudes. In some research both relative advantage and compatibility compound together and form constructs grouping all the relevant items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Ease of Use vs. Complexity (EOU)</head><p>This attribute has many Synonyms like Usability or Complexity and ease of use. It was frequently cited in literature MIS and found closely linked to an individual's perception on the complexity of practicing the introduced innovation. In this line, Complexity, defined by Rogers' (1995) as "how difficult or easy an innovation appears to an individual. Accordingly, some innovations are easy to understand, communicate and use at first glimpse, others are more complicated and require a long time to diffuse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Davis (1989)</ref> in his TAM model demonstrated that the perceived ease of use directly affects attitudes. A low level of complexity or a high level of ease of use lead to higher adoption rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rogers, 1995)</ref>. In other words, complexity increases rejection rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rogers, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sarel and Marmorstein, 2003)</ref>. Rogers illustrated a negative relationship between complexity and adoption rates. Additional diffusion studies confirm the relationships posited by Rogers. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tan and Teo's (2000)</ref> study demonstrated a negative and insignificant relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Compatibility (COM)</head><p>Compatibility concerns whether or not IB, as an innovative channel, is compatible with the individual's values and experiences. In this line, innovation is more likely to be adopted when it is compatible with individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rogers, 1995)</ref>. This argument was supported by the meta-analysis of innovation adoption conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tornatzky and Klein (1982)</ref>. In previous studies, compatibility appears to have a significant impact on willingness to adopt (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sarel and Marmorstein, 2003)</ref>. In this study, respondents were asked about three IB values addressing the assumption of whether IB fits their work; style, mechanism and preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Observability (OBS)</head><p>Observability of an innovation like IB according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers (1995)</ref> describes the extent to which IB is visible for others to observe and communicate the benefits. However, this definition, in the context of IB, will be considered cautiously because observability of IB might turn to privacy and security issues. Of course, some banking innovations like ATMs which can be seen on the street, or in hyper markets and stores may make this technology more observable than Internet banking which is conducted (indoors) inside one's office or home. In the USA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kolodinsky and Hogarth (2001)</ref> examined the adoption of four electronic banking methods, by which they found observability is only associated with an increased probability of adopting phone banking. In our case observability also describes the degree to which the service can be observed being successfully used <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lichtenstein and Williamson, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>V. Trialability (TR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers (1995)</ref> argues that potential adopters who are allowed to experiment with an innovation will feel more comfortable with it and are more likely to adopt it. Sometimes, trialability according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kolodinsky and Hogarth (2001)</ref> provides customers the ability to evaluate innovation benefits. Consequently, if consumers are given the opportunity to try the innovation certain fears of the unknown and the inability to use can be reduced. In respect to IB, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tan and Teo's (2000)</ref> study of Internet users also supported the importance of trialability. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chung and Paynter (2002)</ref> found that lack of prior use of IB inhibited consumer adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Factors of Rogers' Communication of Diffusion</head><p>The second main element in the diffusion of innovation is the communication channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rogers, 1995)</ref>. A communication channel is the means by which individuals learn about Internet Banking. A second area of research involved how norms affect diffusion. In previous studies, mass media channels were more effective in creating knowledge of innovations, whereas word-of-mouth channels were more effective in forming and changing attitudes toward a new idea, and thereby influencing the decision to adopt or reject a new idea. Most individuals evaluate an innovation, not on the basis of scientific research by experts, but through the subjective evaluations of near-peers who have adopted the innovation. This study will examine the potency of the mass media and the word-of-mouth communication in encouraging the diffusion of an innovation by affecting a persons' subjective norms <ref type="bibr">(Zolait &amp; Ainin, 2008)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I. Word-of-Mouth (WOM)</formula><p>It was argued that in word-of-mouth learning, not only do people learn from a small number of people but that these people also tend to be closer to them (in some sense) than the average person in the population. This is what is called "learning from neighbours <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Banerjee and Fudenberg 2004)</ref>. In this study learning by word-of-mouth communication stands for the logic that, online banking will not be viewed by most respondents as an exciting innovation. Therefore; word-of-mouth learning and communicating IB is assumed to increase the adoption rate of IB. In a previous study on marketing online banking services conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sarel and Marmorstein, (2003)</ref> they highlighted that poor word-of-mouth communication contributed to the weak adoption rate. This area presents one of the most critical obstacles to adoption. This study looks into the word-of-mouth by addressing the influence of peer, family, friend and bank's staff on an individual's overall Subjective Norm. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rogers (2003)</ref> highlighted that interpersonal communications (word-of-mouth) provide a more effective means of persuading individuals of the benefits of a new innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Mass Media (MM)</head><p>Mass Media is referred to here as a means of public communication which reaches a large audience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kreps and Thornton (1992)</ref> pointed that media extends people's ability to communicate, to speak to others far away, to hear messages, and to see images that would be unavailable without media. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rogers (2003)</ref> reported that, "mass media channels are usually the most rapid and efficient means of informing potential adopters about the existence of an innovation -that is, to create awareness-knowledge". In other words, mass media's most powerful effect on diffusion is that it spreads knowledge of innovations to a large audience rapidly <ref type="bibr">(Rogers, 1995 p.285)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Khalifa &amp; Cheng (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Zolait &amp; Ainin (2008)</ref> argued that the media, as a source of social influence, can play an important role in the individual's intention formation and it also contributes to exposure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In terms of Conceptual Framework, adoption can be conceptualized as behavioural responses of individuals to two motivated forces of attitudinal and normative beliefs. As such, the TRA by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen (1991)</ref> suggests that BI can be predicted from the individual attitude and subjective norms. In turn, attitude can be predicted from Rogers' (1995) five attributes of innovation as found in the literature of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Taylor (1995)</ref>. These are relative advantage (RA), Ease of Use (EOU), Observability (OBS), Compatibility (Com), and Trialability (TR). In addition, SN can be predicted using the type of communication channel by which individuals interact with the introduced innovation, identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers (1995)</ref> as word-of-mouth and mass media. The particular theoretical perspective adopted here is from TRA and DOI <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rogers, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Taylor, 1995 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Benbasat, 1991)</ref>. The conceptual framework is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 below</ref>;</p><p>Study Design, In order to operationalize and test the proposed conceptual framework a multi-phase research design was adopted. First, literature was reviewed and the data relevant to potentially significant variables was collected. Second, an exploratory factor analysis (FA) was performed on the underlying factor structure of variables. Then the content of factors and items loading was analysed to ensure content, construct, and criterion validity and reliability of factors extracted. Third, the proposed framework was operationalized into a testable model and hypotheses pertaining to the relationships in model variables were developed and tested using regression. Finally, procedures of path analysis approached the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) were performed to assess the overall fit of the model. Research Hypotheses, the behavioural intention (BI) to use IB is determined by two theoretical constructs following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen's (1991)</ref> TRA which are individuals' attitude and subjective norm. This is in the direct relationship of causal and effect. In addition, the indirect causal and effect relationships link both IB characteristics as behavioural belief and the two types of normative belief of communication channel to the BI construct. Therefore, it is expected that attitude is influenced positively by IB characteristics as well as the subjective Norm by referents' channel. The relationships aforementioned in the conceptual framework are summarized in the following hypotheses: G) Individual's interaction about IB through mass media increases; H) Individual's interaction about IB through word-of-mouth increases; H 2 : Individual's attitude towards using Internet banking increases as I) Individual's perception on relative advantage/compatibility of IB increases; J) Individual's perception on the ease of use of IB increases; K) Individual's perception on IB trialability increases; L) Individual's perception on IB observability increases; H 3 : Individual's subjective Norm on using Internet banking increases as M) Individual's interaction through mass media increases; N) Individual's word-of-mouth interaction increases</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Sample Plan and Sample Profile</head><p>Customers of banks in Yemen are the population of this study, although it is not possible to clearly identify the total population in the banking field. Also because of time and convenience, the 369 respondents are selected randomly as the research sample. The sample in this study targeted customers who are categorized as holders of bank accounts. 1000 questionnaires were issued and self-administrated to 17 bank headquarters in Sana'a city. There were 369 valid questionnaires returned and the response rate was 52 %. The sample profile of the respondents is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Data Analysis</head><p>An explanatory factor analysis with Factor Axis and varimax rotation was performed to ensure the discriminant convergent validity. The Table displayed variables belonging to the same factor grouped together to form the operational factor aforementioned in the framework. Particularly, each factor items were examined cautiously; only items with consistent meaning were retained for measuring the factor while other items deemed not reliable were excluded from further analysis. Because of this overriding concern with the interpretability of the factors, the analysis suggested that some factors must be purified accordingly.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Factor Analysis</head><p>To test factorability and reliability of research constructs, the purification procedures of Factor Analysis (FA), item to total correlation and Cronbach's Alpha analysis were performed in this study. Two groups of FA were conducted and the results displayed in Tables <ref type="table">4</ref> and<ref type="table">5</ref>. Factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1.0 were retained and the cut-off value of factor loading was greater than 0.5. Accordingly, the set of items comprising IB attributes (Behavioural Belief) construct were subjected to Principal Factor Analysis (PFA) and the solution was rotated using Varimax criterion. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> showing the result of PFA, reveals five distinctive factors underlying an individuals' behavioural belief with respect to the use of IB.</p><p>Group (c) Rotation Method: Varimax with Kaiser Normalization. Items RA01, RA02, RA03, RA04, RA05, COM01, COM02 and COM03 loaded on what were named as "advantageous". It is obvious from the loading that the aforementioned items are highly correlated with this factor. This solution is in agreement with previous studies conducted by authors including <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moore &amp; Benbasat, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taylor &amp; Todd, (1995 a,b);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mattila, (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tornatzky &amp; Klein (1982)</ref>. Item OBS03 did not appear in the rotated matrix as it is not related to any construct. Similarly, the set of items comprising Normative Belief construct were subjected to PFA and the solution was rotated using Varimax criterion. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows the result of FA, which reveals three distinctive factors underlying an individual's normative belief.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen (1985)</ref> named as the "subjective norm". It is obvious from the loading that the aforementioned items are highly correlated with this factor. Items MCPER1, MCPER2, MCLEDR3, MCLEDR4, MCEMPLY5, and MCEMPLY6 discriminate themselves and converged in what was named as "word-of-mouth referents". It is obvious from the loading that items are highly correlated with this factor. Lastly, items MCMEDIA1, MCMEDIA2, MCPRFS3, and MCMEDIA3 were loaded on the study named "mass media referents".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Path Analysis</head><p>A path analytical approach using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) technique was utilized to test the proposed model as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cohen &amp; Cohen (1983)</ref> and is shown in Figure (2). Furthermore, to test for mediation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> proposed a four step approach in which several regression analyses were conducted and significance of the coefficients was examined at each step. A series of multiple regression and correlation operations (see Appendix A) were performed due to the specification of the operational model shown in figure (1). The regression beta weights being used as the estimate of the path coefficients. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Findings &amp; Discussion</head><p>The path coefficient reveals that different factors also exert indirect influences on behavioural intention through either attitude or subjective norm. First, Rogers <ref type="bibr">' (1995)</ref> attributes in Internet banking is viewed as a salient behavioural belief that RAC, EOU, OBS and TR directly influences a customer's attitude, and indirectly with exception of TR affects a customer's behavioural intentions to use IB services. Secondly, Rogers' (1995) diffusion channel in IB viewed as a salient normative belief that WOM and MM directly influences a customer's subjective norm. Also the mass media channel exerted a positive effect on an individual's intention at P &lt; .10 while the word-of-mouth showed an insignificant effect on BI. Thirdly, an individual's Subjective Norm of IB is related strongly to the individual's mass media based-interaction compared to the individual's word-of-mouth interaction.</p><p>Can IB attributes from Rogers' theory of innovation be linked empirically to an individual's intention to adopt IB? This study of 369 bank customers provides a positive answer to this research question, when the intention is considered as a dependent variable and the behavioural and normative beliefs derived from Rogers' adoption variables as independent variables for attitude and subjective norms as in the Theory of Reasoned Action. Therefore; the results also support the proposed conceptual framework that intention can be explained clearly by behavioural and normative beliefs variables. All the paths proposed by the integrated model were supported with the exception of insignificant links of both TR and WOM to the BI. Also, all the hypotheses were supported except for the hypotheses linking TR and WOM to the BI. Therefore; Determinants of Individuals' Intention to Use IB, seem to be the research variables of attitude and subjective which have a direct influence on intention to use IB. This key finding supports the argument. In contrary to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tan and Teo's (2000)</ref> study, the relationship between perceived EOU of using Internet banking services and both attitude and intentions to adopt such services was supported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tan and Teo's (2000)</ref> claimed that the insignificant result is due more to the sample's characteristics of Singapore Internet users rather than the inappropriateness of the measure. The Determinant of Individuals' Attitude to use IB, Result that was not expected is the moderate and inverse relationship between the individual's attitude and IB observability as well as IB trialability. This finding points to the existence of a more complex relationship. Findings show that, enabling the observability attribute for innovations like IB is not desirable if the intention is to increase the adoption rate. One explanation could be due to the sensitive nature of banking and specifically IB. The second explanation is that when potential adopters are given the chance to observe IB functions, they become inverse thinking on whether IB is secure or not. They may also be concerned with privacy issues. Determinants of Individuals' SN to use IB, Research has shown that the concrete person's Subjective Norm is developed through communication exchanges about the innovation with through word-of-mouth (i.e. peers, staff and opinion leaders more than through Mass Media. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sarel and Marmorstein's (2003)</ref> study, banks need to examine current communication tactics and identify more effective ways to communicate benefits of IB. New approaches to address these problems need to be considered.</p></div>

Conceptual Framework of Behavioural Intention DeterminantsInstrument, this study utilized previous studies of adoption in developing the appropriate instrument for the data collection. The aim was to ensure the face validity of the scales intended to measure these variables. The final, refined instrument consists of two groups of variables. The first group addressed Rogers' variables with seven variables intended to measure an individual's attitudinal belief and normative beliefs formed by an individual's perception on IB attributes and interaction via both the WOM and MM diffusion channel. The second group deals with the TRA main variables intended to measure, intention, attitude, and subjective norms. Both measures used a 7-point Likert scale. Face and construct validity were established during the adaptation and factorability procedures. To mitigate the responses bias pre-tested questionnaires were not included in the final instrument.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,138.54,64.14,285.00,190.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
