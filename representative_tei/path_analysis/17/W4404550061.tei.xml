<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Patient safety is an important issue in the healthcare eld <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Many countries are strengthening patient safety through regulatory frameworks, such as mandatory licensing systems for healthcare facilities, to ensure compliance with established safety standards and promote quality healthcare delivery <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. However, it is estimated that 1 in 10 patients receiving medical services experience damage from patient safety incidents (PSIs) <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>PSIs impact not only patients but also healthcare providers (HPs), termed 'second victims' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. HPs involved in PSIs often experience emotional and mental distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. The documented adverse repercussions of PSIs include the need for assistance from colleagues, supervisors, institutions, and family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, along with potential decisions to leave the organization <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>. The second victim experiences (SVEs) have been subdivided into second victim distress (SVD), demand for support (DS), and negative work-related outcomes (NWO). However, previous studies have presented a fragmented view of SVEs, using only some attributes of the second victim <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. Therefore, an integrated approach is required to understand the causal relationships between SVD, DS, and NWO.</p><p>Studies have found that the second victim experience is not limited to adverse events or sentinel events that cause serious harm to patients. It can also occur when a patient experiences a near miss that does not directly harm the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref>. Therefore, active support and prevention activities at the institutional level have been emphasized to prevent medical staff from second victim experience after a PSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Clinical nurses are particularly vulnerable to SVEs compared to other healthcare workers. Because they are directly involved in patient care, including medication administration, clinical nurses are also at the greatest risk of being blamed for a PSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. In previous studies, 50%-69% of clinical nurses reported symptoms of distress due to SVEs and more than 25% of them reported absenteeism and turnover intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. However, only 5.6% of nurses reported to have received organizational support, indicating that nurse's SVEs are often neglected <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. The concept of second victim was rst introduced in 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Since then, studies have explored the phenomenon of second victim and its outcome factors, including current status of second victim <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, the process of overcoming second victim experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, psychological and physical symptoms of second victim <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, changes in nursing practice <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, and effects on the quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Nevertheless, only a few studies have explored antecedents of the second victim among nurses <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>. The degree of SVE of an individual after PSI may vary depending on the culture of the organization or department <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>. To mitigate the phenomenon of second victim among nurses, it is imperative to identify individual and organizational antecedents that might affect SVEs and to help healthcare organizations develop and implement various support strategies based on this information.</p><p>In this context, the signi cance of fostering a just culture (JC) within healthcare organizations has gained prominence. A JC promotes reporting of PSIs without assigning blame to individuals, as it perceives such incidents as outcomes of shortcomings within organizational systems and structures rather than individual errors <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Furthermore, it embodies a culture of trust wherein nurses and managers engage in open communication regarding PSIs, seek and provide feedback, and engage in unfettered discussions concerning improvement strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Nevertheless, by holding individuals responsible for incidents that involve intentional violations of explicit institutional rules or guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, it upholds a culture that adopts a balanced approach to cultivating trust among its members <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Hence, the concept of a JC distinguishes itself from patient safety culture which primarily centers on preempting patient safety events. This philosophy can be quanti ed through a speci c subscale in established patient safety culture assessment tools -namely, the non-punitive response to errors. Studies have indicated that a non-punitive response to errors can help diminish the distress experienced by nurses as second victims <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Consequently, it is anticipated that a JC can help mitigate SVEs among nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Identi cation of the in uence of a JC on SVEs is important to enlighten healthcare organizations about the e cacy of implementing such a culture to mitigate nurses' experiences as second victims following PSIs. To date, studies have been conducted to gauge the level of JC, including examinations of its essence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and assessments of how nursing students and professors perceive it <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Additionally, studies have explored the impact of the nursing work environment on JC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> and the effects of JC on activities related to patient safety management <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the relationship between JC and SVEs has not been empirically demonstrated; moreover, no studies have investigated the repercussions of JC on such experiences.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to perform an in-depth examination of the relationship between JC of healthcare organizations and SVEs of clinical nurses (i.e., SVD, DS, and NWO) through path analysis. Path analysis offers the advantage of delineating both the direct and indirect impact of variables that exhibit a causal relationship between exogenous and endogenous factors based on the research model <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. Based on the previous studies, the following hypothesis was proposed: JC relates directly to SVD, DS; SVD relates directly to NWO, DS; DS relates directly to NWO; JC relates indirectly to NWO via SVD; JC relates indirectly to NWO via DS; JC relates indirectly to NWO via SVD and, in turn, DS (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The ndings of this study may help inform interventions for mitigating SVEs of nurses and fostering the establishment of a JC within healthcare organizations. To further explore these relationships, this study will address the following research questions:</p><p>1. How does Just Culture in uence second victim distress among clinical nurses? 2. How does Just Culture affect the demand for support after patient safety incidents? 3. How does Just Culture indirectly impact negative work-related outcomes through second victim distress and demand for support?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>This was a cross-sectional correlational study to determine the effect of healthcare organization's JC on the SVEs perceived by clinical nurses involved in PSIs. This study constructed a hypothetical model, tested the model t and hypotheses, and analyzed direct and indirect pathways of factors affecting SVEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting and samples</head><p>The study participants were clinical nurses working in the ward or intensive care unit, a nursing unit that provides direct nursing care to inpatients in tertiary general hospitals in Korea. Nurses with at least one year of clinical experience who had experienced at least one PSI (near miss, adverse event, or sentinel event) within the last six months were eligible for inclusion. In this study, we selected nurses with more than 1 year of clinical experience because they take at least 8 to 12 months to adapt to their role <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. We also excluded managers, head nurses, educational nurses, and physician assistant nurses who were not directly involved in patient care.</p><p>It is recommended to have a minimum sample size of 100-150 for the maximum likelihood method in path analysis and at least 10 times the number of participants per observation <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. This study had a total of 17 variables which required a minimum sample size of 170. Factoring a dropout rate of 15%, 200 nurses were enrolled in this study. Out of the 200 questionnaires collected through an online survey, 183 (91.5%) were used for analysis after excluding 17 questionnaires due to response errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>The permission to use tools in this study was obtained from original authors or translators. JC JC was measured using the JC Assessment Tool (JCAT) developed by Petschonek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and translated by Han et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> with proven validity and reliability. The tool consists of 27 questions encompassing six factors, including three questions on feedback and communication, ve questions on the openness of communication, ve questions on balance, ve questions on the quality of event reporting process, four questions on continuous improvement, and ve questions on trust. Each question is answered on a Likert scale ranging from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 7 ("strongly agree"), with a higher score indicating a higher perception that the organization had a JC. The Cronbach's α for internal consistency of JCAT in this study was .91.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SVEs</head><p>Korea-Second Victim Experience and Support Tool (K-SVEST) developed by Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> was used to quantify SVEs. This tool consists of three domains with a total of 28 questions to simultaneously measure SVD, DS, and NWO due to experience of PSIs.</p><p>(1) SVD SVD is one of the subscales of the K-SVEST. It consists of 12 items: 4 items on psychological distress, 4 items on physical distress, and 4 items on decreased professional self-e cacy. Each question is answered on a Likert scale ranging from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree"), with a higher mean score indicating more severe distress from the second victim experience. The Cronbach's α of this subscale in this study was .87.</p><p>(2) DS DS is one of the subscales of the K-SVEST. It consists of 13 items, including 4 items on colleague support, 4 items on supervisor support, 3 items on institutional support, and 2 items on nonwork-related support. Each item is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree"), with a higher mean score indicating a higher support need as clinical nurses perceive insu cient support resources after experiencing PSIs. The Cronbach's α of this subscale in this study was .79.</p><p>(3) NWO NWO is one of the subscales of K-SVEST. It consists of three questions: two questions on turnover intentions and one question on absenteeism. Each question is answered on a Likert scale ranging from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree"), with a higher mean score indicating more negative work outcomes due to second victim experience. The Cronbach's α of this subscale in this study was .86.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic characteristics</head><p>The demographic characteristics of the study population included age, gender, marital status, religion, and education level. Job-related characteristics included total clinical career, weekly working hours, position, working type, employment type, work unit, annual income, and patient safety event experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>This study included sensitive questions about nurses' experiences of second victim from PSIs, which might make them reluctant to respond to direct data collection requests. Thus, we conducted an online survey to maintain the anonymity of nurses and enhance their participation. Data collection was conducted from December 28, 2022 to January 14, 2023. The participant recruitment document was publicized in the nursing departments of tertiary general hospitals nationwide. To prevent under-representation, we used a 'half-open interval' or 'multiplicity sampling' strategy by asking respondents to introduce or recommend other research participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Data analyses were performed using SPSS WIN 23.0 and AMOS 23.0 programs (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). The statistical signi cance level for this study was set at p &lt; .05 with a 95% con dence interval (CI). The normality of the sample was tested using skewness and kurtosis. Descriptive statistics were generated for the general characteristics of participants. The internal consistency of the survey instrument was determined by calculating Cronbach's α. Pearson correlation coe cients, tolerance, and variance in ation factors (VIF) were calculated to rule out multicollinearity among independent variables. Autocorrelation of dependent variable was assessed using the Durbin-Watson value <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. For goodness-of-t and hypothesis testing of the path model, the parameters of the model were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The goodness of t of the hypothesized model was checked with absolute goodness of t indices such as normed χ2 (DF, CMIN) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and intermediate goodness of t indices such as comparative t index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), normed t index (NFI), and adjusted goodness of t index (AGFI) <ref type="bibr">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>. To determine the in uence of JC on SVEs, path analysis was conducted to analyze signi cant path coe cients and direct, indirect, and total effects between variables. Statistical signi cance test was set to 2,000 iterations using the bootstrapping approach. The explanatory power of exogenous variables on endogenous variables was calculated by squared multiple correlations (SMC). The signi cance of indirect effects was tested using the phantom variable modeling method <ref type="bibr">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical consideration</head><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Jeonbuk National University prior to data collection (IRB NO. JBNU 2022-11-001). The consent form in the online survey informed participants about the voluntary nature of participation in the study, about their right to withdraw at any time, that their responses would not be used for any purpose other than this study, and the con dentiality of the responses. After completion of the survey, each individual's responses were stored and analyzed using a unique identi cation number to protect participant privacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General characteristics</head><p>In terms of PSI experience, 51.9% (n = 95) had experienced only near misses without causing harm to patients, 6.6% (n = 12) had experienced adverse or sentinel events without near misses, and 41.5% (n = 76) had experienced both near misses and adverse or sentinel events (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptions and correlations of study variables</head><p>The overall mean score of participants' perceived JC was out of 7. scores of SVD, DS, and NWO were 3.21 (SD = 0.63), 2.69 (SD = 0.48), and 3.28 (SD = 0.97) out of 5, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Participants' perceived JC showed a signi cant negative correlation with SVD (r = - .29, p &lt; .001), DS (r = - .69, p &lt; .001), and NWO (r = - .37, p &lt; .001). SVD showed a signi cant positive correlation with DS (r = .33, p &lt; .001) and NWO (r = .72, p &lt; .001). DS showed a signi cant positive correlation with NWO (r = .40, p &lt; .001) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesized model t Normality and multicollinearity</head><p>The absolute values the skewness and kurtosis (-0.55-0.79) of the study variables met their respective normality criteria. The VIF ranged from 1.13 to 1.99, all less than 10. Tolerance ranged from .50 to .88, all greater than 0.1. Inter-variable correlation coe cient ranged from - .69 to .33, all less than 0.8, indicating no multicollinearity among the measured independent variables. In addition, the Durbin-Watson index was 1.98 (dU = 1.79 &lt; d &lt; 4-dU = 2.21), con rming that dependent variables were independent without autocorrelation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. Thus, the model ful lled the assumption of path analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goodness of t test</head><p>The maximum likelihood method was used to test the t of the hypothesized model. The results of goodness-of-t indices of the model were: normed χ2 (1, 2.53) = 2.53 (p = 0.112), RMSEA = .09, CFI = .99, TLI = .97, NFI = .99, and AGFI = .93. These results indicated the appropriateness of the model for this study <ref type="bibr">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Analysis: Testing Hypotheses and Variable Effects</head><p>In this study, path analysis conducted to test the hypothesized model of the impact of a healthcare organization's JC perceived clinical nurses who experienced PSIs on their SVEs. The results are as follows (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).  All ve direct effect paths in the hypothesized model were statistically signi cant. JC had a statistically signi cant effect on SVD (β = -0.29, p = .001, 95% CI [-0.44, -0.14]) and DS (β = -0.65, p = .001, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.54]). SVD had a statistically signi cant effect on DS (β = 0.14, p = .025, 95% CI [0.01, 0.27]) and NWO (β = 0.66, p = .001, 95% CI [0.56, 0.75]). DS had a statistically signi cant effect on NWO (β = 0.18, p = .010, 95% CI [0.05, 0.31]) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>In addition, all three indirect effect paths in the model were statistically signi cant. The indirect effect of JC on DS through SVD was statistically signi cant (β = -0.04, p = .016, 95% CI [-0.09, -0.01]). The indirect effect of JC on NWO through SVD and DS was also statistically signi cant (β = -0.32, p = .001, 95% CI [-0.44, -0.17]). In addition, the indirect effect of SVD on NWO through DS was statistically signi cant (β = 0.03, p = .018, 95% CI [0.00, 0.07]).</p><p>Using phantom variable modeling to test the statistical signi cance of the indirect effect of JC on NWO, the path of "JC → SVD → NWO" was represented by phantom variable "P1" → "P12". The indirect effect of JC on NWO was statistically signi cant (B = -0.24, p = .001, 95% CI [-0.37, -0.12]). This indicates that fair culture can affect NWO through SVD, with SVD having a mediating effect. In addition, the path of "JC → DS → NWO" was represented by the phantom variable "P2" → "P22". The indirect effect of JC on NWO was also statistically signi cant (B = -0.15, p = .010, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.04]). This indicates that fair culture affects NWO through DS, with DS having a mediating effect. The path of "JC → SVD → DS → NWO" was represented by phantom variables "P1" → "P13" → "P14". The indirect effect of JC on NWO was statistically signi cant (B = -0.01, p = .013, 95% CI [-0.03, -0.01]). This indicates that JC affects NWO through SVD and DS, indicating a dual mediation effect of SVD and DS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study to establish a hypothetical model, test the model t, and identify the direct and indirect effects of factors affecting second victim's perceived JC of healthcare organizations and experiences of clinical nurses as second victims of PSIs. Five direct effect paths and three indirect effect paths were supported among the eight paths proposed in the hypothesized model. In other words, JC was found to affect SVD and DS. In addition, pathways through which these mediators can directly or indirectly affect NWO were identi ed.</p><p>A JC was identi ed as a variable that could directly in uence SVD and DS, with perception of a JC being associated with lower levels of SVD and DS among nurses who experienced a PSI. This is similar to previous ndings that the higher the perceived level of "non-punitive response to errors", which has similar attributes to a JC, the lower the level of SVD and the higher the level of second victim support provided to nurses [8-10]. A JC not only focuses on systemic improvements in the work environment rather than punishing individuals for PSIs but also holds individuals accountable for institutional compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Because of this balancing act, an organization's JC is necessary to provide a support system to reduce SVD experienced after a PSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Reducing punitive responses to PSIs and providing support through interactions with colleagues, supervisors, and the organization can help mitigate SVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. In a study comparing the perception of JC among international nurses, it was found that nurses who received support after SVEs had a higher perception of JC than nurses who did not have experience as second victims <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Our ndings suggest that implementing proactive measures to establish a JC in medical institutions is a key imperative to reduce SVD and DS among nurses.</p><p>SVD was found to have the most substantial direct in uence on NWO. It also had a direct impact on DS. Our ndings are consistent with those of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref> showing that the more severe the SVD of nurses who experienced a PSI, the higher the NWO and DS. NWO such as nurse turnover or absenteeism not only entail signi cant costs for healthcare organizations but also have adverse implications for patient safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Therefore, it is imperative to prevent secondary victimization of nurses involved in a PSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. For nurses experiencing SVD, empathetic support from colleagues and active support from institutions through work assignments or work adjustments, counseling support, and improvement of the working environment will be helpful <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. A previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> has found that the support needed varies depending on the degree of SVD. Therefore, it is important to provide individualized support to nurses involved in a PSI based on the assessment of SVD.</p><p>In addition, there was a signi cant indirect effect of JC on NWO mediated via SVD. This suggests that a more robust implementation of a JC within an organization may help reduce SVD, consequently leading to diminished NWO. This study provides empirical evidence that SVD, a factor having the most signi cant in uence on NWO, can be mitigated by establishing a JC in healthcare organizations. This necessitates a systematic approach grounded on a JC rather than focusing on assigning individual responsibility when such incidents occur.</p><p>DS was identi ed as a variable that could directly affect NWO. The higher the DS among nurses who experienced PSIs, the higher the NWO. Our results were similar to those of previous studies, which found that second victim support was a signi cant predictor of reducing NWO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. High DS among nurses may indicate a lack of adequate support from colleagues, supervisors, organizations, family, or friends following a PSI, which can lead to NWO such as turnover or absenteeism. A previous study of international nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> found a direct effect of organizational support on nurses' absenteeism, but not on their turnover intentions. Future research should aim to identify the types of support systems that are effective in reducing NWO, including absenteeism and turnover intentions, in nurses.</p><p>In addition, the indirect effect of JC on NWO mediated via DS was signi cant. This implies that a more robust implementation of a JC within the organization can lead to a decreased DS among nurses by enhancing 'feedback and communication', 'openness of communication', 'continuous improvement' et al, ultimately resulting in fewer NWOs. It is evident that a healthcare organization with a JC already has an organizational framework to address PSIs in a systemic manner rather than on an individual basis. This entails open communication regarding incidents, the provision of feedback, and the execution of ongoing improvement initiatives. Empirical evidence from this study suggests that this alleviates the nurses' DS and reduces NWO.</p><p>The indirect effect of JC on NWO was signi cant through the dual mediation of SVD and DS. This suggests that the perception of a JC in an organization reduces SVD and DS, which in turn can reduce NWO. While previous studies have reported a mediating effect of second victim support on the relationship between SVD and NWO <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, the present study analyzed the causal relationship between JC, SVD, DS, and NWO, thus providing a scienti c basis for the positive in uence of JC in healthcare organizations on SVEs of nurses involved in PSIs.</p><p>Collectively, the ndings suggest that JC can reduce SVD and DS to improve the negative outcomes of SVE while maintaining a long-term nurse's tenure and further promote a culture of trust and responsibility that helps patients' treatment outcomes. Currently, many countries are promoting the establishment of a JC in pursuit of high credibility <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. However, the actual effects of JC on patient safety, quality in healthcare, and healthcare personnel involved in PSIs are not clear. In this context, this study holds signi cance in that it empirically illustrates the positive impacts of a JC. Moreover, this is the rst study to demonstrate the direct and indirect effects of JC in diminishing SVEs of clinical nurses following PSIs. Our ndings underline the need for concerted efforts to establish a JC in healthcare organizations through the active participation of the employees. In addition, clinical nurses should work together to establish a balanced and trustworthy organizational culture that pursues a JC by ful lling their individual responsibilities.</p><p>This study adds to existing evidence that the SVEs of nurses who experience PSIs can negatively impact healthcare organizations and patient safety. It is hoped that medical institutions will adopt established practices such as an organizational-level patient safety event response process <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> or establish a secondary victim support team [38], both of which have been shown to be effective internationally. Moreover, active engagement and support from both the government and medical institutions are required to facilitate the development and implementation of such programs.</p><p>Some limitations of this study be acknowledged. First, the study design did not allow for an isolated assessment of the individual impacts of each of the six sub-attributes of JC on SVEs, speci cally SVD, DS, and NWO. Second, this was a cross-sectional study that did not capture longitudinal variations in study variables over time. Despite these limitations, our study is signi cant as it represents the initial empirical exploration of linkages between JC and SVEs within the context of clinical nursing practice.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study demonstrated the impact of a healthcare organization's JC on SVEs perceived by clinical nurses involved in PSIs, with JC being the main factor having a direct effect on SVD and DS. JC had an indirect effect on NWO via SVD and DS. PSIs are inevitable in healthcare settings. To prevent SVD and NWO, medical organizations should establish a JC through a systematic approach to improvement rather than blaming individuals. In addition, strategies should be implemented to monitor nurses who have experienced PSIs as second victims and develop a support system to assist nurses who experience SVD.</p><p>In light of the study ndings, the following recommendations are proposed. First, it is recommended to assess the SVD of nurses who have experienced PSIs and to develop and support customized interventions to reduce NWO in clinical settings. Second, a team dedicated to second victim support needs to be established in clinical settings to reduce SVD and NWO of nurses and other healthcare workers. Third, a longitudinal study needs to be conducted to assess enduring NWO experienced by nurses with SVEs. ). The consent form in the online survey informed participants about the voluntary nature of participation in the study, about their right to withdraw at any time, that their responses would not be used for any purpose other than this study, and the con dentiality of the responses. After completion of the survey, each individual's responses were stored and analyzed using a unique identi cation number to protect participant privacy.</p></div>
