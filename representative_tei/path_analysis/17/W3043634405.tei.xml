<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Expansion of the maize growing area was central for food security in temperate regions. In addition to the suppression of the short-day requirement for floral induction, it required breeding for a large range of flowering time that compensates the effect of South-North gradients of temperatures. Here we show the role of a novel florigen gene, ZCN12, in the latter adaptation in cooperation with ZCN8. Strong eQTLs of ZCN8 and ZCN12, measured in 327 maize lines, accounted for most of the genetic variance of flowering time in platform and field experiments. ZCN12 had a strong effect on flowering time of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants; a path analysis showed that it directly affected maize flowering time together with ZCN8. The allelic composition at ZCN QTLs showed clear signs of selection by breeders. This suggests that florigens played a central role in ensuring a large range of flowering time, necessary for adaptation to temperate areas.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Maize was domesticated 9000 years ago in central Mexico from teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis), a tropical plant that only flowers under short days <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In contrast to its wild ancestor, modern maize shows a large geographic distribution from 0 to 50˚N. Adaptation to temperate latitudes, with long days during summer, required breeders to first suppress the short-day requirement for floral induction, but a second adaptation was also required. Because the time to flowering strongly depends on temperature, it is shorter for a given non-photoperiodic genotype at lower than at higher latitudes of the temperate area. A long intrinsic cycle duration is necessary to counteract this effect in warmest areas, thereby avoiding decreases in cumulated photosynthesis and biomass. Conversely, a short intrinsic duration is needed in the coolest areas to avoid grain filling to occur in Autumn with low light and temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Accordingly, the range of time to flowering in current germplasm typically ranges from 35 to 90 days after sowing in a given site <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>About ninety quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the maize genome account for the natural diversity in flowering time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and most of them explain a small proportion of the phenotypic variance, with prevalently additive effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The molecular characterization of a few large-effect alleles helped uncover key events underpinning the flowering adaptation of maize from tropical to temperate climates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. These alleles were found to regulate the expression of florigens, i.e. floral genes expressed in the leaf vasculature. Florigen proteins are members of the Phosphatidyl Ethanolamine Binding Proteins (PEBPs) family that include FLOWERING LOCUS T in Arabidopsis and Heading date 3a in rice that move systemically to promote flowering at the shoot apex <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The maize genome encodes several florigen genes, including ZEA CENTRORADIALIS 8 (ZCN8) that acts as major florigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Its expression only occurs under short-day conditions in tropically adapted maize, but not in long days <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The uncoupling of ZCN8 expression from short day-dependent activation occurred in a stepwise manner through the selection of mutations in the ZCN8 expression regulatory processes. For example, independent transposon insertions at two related ZmCCT genes (9 and 10) reduce maize flowering photoperiod sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The active (expressed) alleles of ZmCCT9 and 10 of tropical maize delay flowering under long days by repressing ZCN8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The gradual northbound expansion of maize was also driven by variations at cis-regulatory sequences of the ZCN8 promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which modify the binding landscape for different transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Another ZCN8 regulatory node involves ZmMADS69, which in turn represses the ZCN8 negative regulator Related to apetala2.7 (Rap2.7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Both ZmMADS69 and Rap2.7 map within well-characterized QTLs of flowering time suggesting that allelic variations at these genes control part of the diversity of flowering time of temperate maize <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Classic mutagenesis screens also identified major genes that affect flowering time, thereby helping to refine the ZCN8 regulatory pathway with additional components. These include Indeterminate1 (Id1) and delayed flowering 1 (dlf1) that encode, respectively, an upstream regulator required for ZCN8 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> and a bZIP transcription factor presumably required for ZCN8 protein signalling at the shoot apex <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLUES of gene expression and phenotypes as well</head><p>as the description of the lines used are publicly available at this site: <ref type="url" target="https://data.inra.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15454/XTHN7I">https://data.inra.fr/dataset. xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15454/XTHN7I</ref> Additional relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p><p>Although the above studies reveal a prominent role for ZCN8 activation in the control of flowering time in short vs long days, its contribution to the genetic variability of flowering time in non-photoperiodic temperate maize varieties is less clear. Indeed, it has been argued that the variability in flowering time in temperate maize is controlled by other pathways that act in parallel to or downstream of ZCN8 transcriptional activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Two elements challenge this view: (i) the downregulation of ZCN8 in temperate maize leads to a significant delay in flowering time (albeit less prominent compared to id1 or dlf1 mutants) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, (ii) QTL mapping shows that flowering time is linked to allelic variations at a genomic region that harbours ZCN8 (also known as the Vgt2 QTL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>A genome-wide study of temperate maize germplasm was necessary to reconcile these views on the potential role of florigen expression in the control of flowering time of temperate maize. Here we address this question by jointly measuring flowering time and the expression of ZCN8, and of two related genes with unknown variability, ZCN7 and ZCN12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, in a panel of 327 maize temperate lines. Our study revealed large variations in ZCN8 and ZCN12 transcript levels, which closely correlate to flowering time. Regulatory regions for ZCN8 and ZCN12 coincided with flowering time QTLs and we detected signatures of selection for some of these regions. Collectively, these results suggest that the adaptation of maize within temperate regions derives from the control of florigen pathways.  ). We then measured florigen expression of the same lines, in samples collected from fully expanded leaves of plants grown in the phenotyping platform. Samples were collected in the early morning at two dates, when leaves 4 and 7 reached ligulation, representing bona fide pre and post floral transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Care was taken to precisely record the harvest time of each individual sample and to record the developmental stage of every sampled plant, which slightly differed between plants because of the genetic variability of the phyllochron <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Mixed models including a fixed effect of sampling date and time of day (both of them small, S2A-S2D Fig) , 
together with spatial effects in the greenhouse, were used to extract genotypic values for each line (S3C and S3D Fig).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ZCN8 levels highly correlate with flowering time in temperate maize</head><p>The ZCN8 expression displayed large genetic variability. The four biological replicates, analysed at two sampling dates, provided highly correlated expression levels (up to r = 0.88) when values were normalised by those of the housekeeping genes UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2 (UCe) and ELONGATION FACTOR 1 ALPHA (EF1a) (S3A and S3B Fig) . ZCN8 accumulation significantly increased between the two sampling dates (S4B Fig), consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, with higher heritability in the second than in the first date (h 2 = 0.64 and 0.58, respectively). Still, we could detect a significant correlation in ZCN8 accumulation between the two sampling dates (r = 0.53, S4A Fig) . We thus focused on ZCN8 expression detected at the second sampling date (leaf 7 stage).</p><p>Anthesis time was significantly correlated with the BLUEs of ZCN8 (r = -0. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ZCN12 is a novel regulator of maize flowering and it is co-expressed with ZCN8</head><p>Although ZCN12 levels have not been documented so far for their role in flowering time, they showed high heritability (narrow-sense h 2 = 0.67, S1  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and shared biochemical functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. ZCN7 and ZCN8 expressions were also weakly correlated (S6C Fig) . The accumulation of ZmCONZ1, a putative upstream regulator of the florigen genes in maize <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, was not linked to ZCN8 or ZCN7 expressions, nor with flowering time (S6D Fig).</p><p>In order to demonstrate the role of ZCN12 on flowering time, we cloned the ZCN12 gene for over-expression studies in Arabidopsis thaliana. This demonstrated a strong florigenic activity for the ZCN12 protein. Transgenic lines overexpressing ZCN12 flowered significantly earlier compared with control plants (Fig 2C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">-2E</ref>). Sixteen of the 40 transgenic plants showed an extremely early flowering phenotype characterised by the conversion of the shoot apical meristem in a terminal flower, with no observable vegetative leaves. The same transformation for the ZCN8 gene also caused significantly earlier flowering, but with only two cases of extreme early flowering. The latter models displayed good indices of fit (RMSEA &lt; 0.05, comparative fit index &gt; 0.95). They were considered as equally plausible, thereby supporting the existence of a two-tier florigen system in maize in which ZCN12 acts in parallel with ZCN8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ZCN8 and ZCN12 regulators map to region controlling maize flowering time</head><p>We then analysed to which extent genomic regions controlling florigens expression co-localised with regions controlling flowering time. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 570 QTLs which largely overlapped between field and greenhouse experiments (S2 and S3 Tables), resulting in 214 meta-QTLs that harboured at least one QTL (Fig 4A ) of flowering time, in either field or greenhouse experiments. An eQTL GWAS detected 52 meta-QTLs for ZCN8, among which half co-localised with flowering time QTLs. We also detected 85 meta-(p &lt; 0.01, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD test). Horizontal bars, mean values of rosette leaves number. n = 37, 38 and 14 for, respectively, 35S:HA:ZCN8 35S:HA:ZCN12 and wild type (empty vector). (E) RT-PCR analysis on ZCN8/12 transcripts derived from independent T2 transgenic plants of the indicated genotypes. Amplification of vectors (Vect) harbouring genomic versions of ZCN8 and ZCN12 afforded a positive control whereas untransformed wild type and no DNA reactions (-) were used as negative controls. Actin expression was used for normalization (lower panel). Numbers on the left are kb based on DNA ladder (Mk) migration. Amplifications were conducted for 25 cycles. <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008882.g002">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008882.g002</ref>    ). ZCN eQTLs had a high contribution to the genetic variance of flowering time as shown by mixed-models applied to individual experiments (S5 Table ). Indeed, in the platform experiment of 2014, the 19 ZCN eQTLs that co-localised with anthesis QTLs accounted for 57% of the genetic variance of anthesis in the platform experiment (vs 75% for all 43 QTLs of anthesis). Similar results were found when considering anthesis in the field, or total leaf number in each experiment (S5 Table ).</p><p>We inspected the ZCN eQTLs for the presence of candidate genes or QTLs already known to control flowering time. In the Bin 3.05 hotspot region known for flowering time regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, we identified five ZCN-related eQTLs which co-localised with at least one QTL of flowering time (S3 Table ). An eQTL of ZCN8/12 (158. ) was located at a genomic position compatible with the newly described transcriptional regulator ZmMADS69 (GRMZM 2G171650) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> (Fig 4B <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4C</ref>). Another eQTL region (Bin 8.05) comprised the gene GRMZM2G700665 (also known as Rap2.7) (S8B Fig and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4</ref> Table ), encoding a floral repressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and negative regulator of ZCN8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Analysis of published whole-genome expression datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> was used to check if transcripts whose expression correlated with ZCN8 were over-represented at ZCN eQTLs positions. We confirmed significant correlations between anthesis and ZCN8/12/7 expression (n = 181 lines, r = up to -0.54) (S9A-S9C Fig) . Furthermore, these datasets revealed strong patterns of co-regulation not only between ZCN8 and ZCN12 but also between ZCN8 and ZCN7 (n = 204 lines, r = up to 0.76) (S9D-S9F Fig) . Additional 549 transcripts showed a significant correlation with ZCN8 expression levels (S6 Table ). These were parsed in two clusters composed of genes with opposite trends to ZCN8 gene expression and correspondingly opposite association with anthesis (S9G Fig) . Neither ZmMADS69 nor Rap2.7 nor any other gene in the eQTLs regions within Bin 3.05 were co-expressed with ZCN8, and co-expressed transcripts were not particularly enriched in eQTLs regions (S4 Table ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Signs of selection at ZCN8 and ZCN12 eQTLs to control maize flowering time</head><p>The genetic groups in the studied panel showed markedly different values of ZCNs expression levels and anthesis dates (S10A,S10B, S10D and S10E Fig) , and clear co-expression of ZCN8 and ZCN12 within each group (S10C and S10F Fig). The observed differences in flowering time between admixture groups may be due to selection by past breeding of temperate maize lines. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found significant differences, between the seven genetic groups, in allelic distribution at QTLs showing co-location between ZCN8/12 expression and flowering time (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5A</ref>). Alleles for increased expression of ZCN8 and ZCN12 were more frequent in genetic groups bred for early maturity (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5A</ref>). Hence, a pool of early maturity alleles was represented within all genetic groups, but in different proportions, suggesting that some combinations were preferentially selected in different groups.</p><p>Regional association plot for one meta-QTL on chromosome 3. Distribution of the -log 10 (pval) for all variants in the region. The dotted grey line corresponds to-log 10 (pval) = 4.5 for anthesis-related traits evaluated in the field (purple) and platform (orange) and 4 for the expression traits evaluated in the platform (green).

F st outliers approach using BayeScan highlighted SNPs under selection in the ZCN-related QTLs and other regions that might contribute to flowering time <ref type="bibr">(Fig 5B and S7 Table)</ref>. When comparing all six populations (excluding the admixture group 'diverse dent'), the BayeScan revealed SNPs under selection ranging from a log 10 (PO)posterior odds-of 0.5 to 1 (substantially significant) to higher than 1 (highly significant). Most importantly, this analysis revealed SNPs under selection comprised in the ZCN-related QTLs regions, further indicating the contribution of ZCN8/12 regulation to flowering variability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ZCN12 and ZCN8 are co-regulated by trans-acting factors to control temperate maize flowering</head><p>Our study provides an example for how shifts in reproductive development that enable local adaptation can emerge through different florigen levels. Besides confirming the role of ZCN8 in flowering time regulation we also uncover the role of ZCN12 in this process. Interestingly ZCN12 is more distantly related to ZCN8 than ZCN7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and located in a region which is not syntenic to ZCN8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, yet it underwent a similar regulatory trajectory to ZCN8 as shown by the strong co-variation across different lines and experiments.</p><p>GWAS approaches support the major contribution of trans-acting factors in driving the expression of ZCN8 and ZCN12 in temperate maize. We also detected a SNP associated with anthesis and silking located approximately 1.7 kbp upstream of ZCN8 (i.e. AX-91100620, S2 Table ). However, this and eight other SNPs located in this putative regulatory region were not associated with ZCN8 transcript levels. It is unlikely that the absence of cis-type eQTLs for ZCN8 could depend on insufficient coverage of the genetic diversity, since they were discovered on a large set of diverse inbred lines: 32,758 accessions for 6 GBS markers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and 30 accessions for 3 Affymetrix Axiom markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Multiple trans-acting genes and complex longrange regulatory interactions are thus more likely responsible for the accumulation of ZCN8/ ZCN12. Supporting this hypothesis, we detected trans-eQTLs for ZCN8/ZCN12 that colocalize with two genomic regions-Vgt1 and Vgt3-carrying genes involved in flowering time variation <ref type="bibr">(Fig 4B,</ref><ref type="bibr">S8B Fig)</ref>. These regions include transcriptional regulators known to be under selection in maize latitudinal adaptation, namely ZmMADS69/Vgt3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> and Rap2.7/Vgt1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. We did not detect any obvious candidate genes associated with photoperiodic signalling (e.g. ZmCCT10), suggesting its small contribution in ZCN8/12 regulation in our panel.</p><p>ZmMADS69 and Rap2.7 did not show significant trends of co-expression with their transregulated targets ZCN8/12. It is thus possible that that there are many more genes of smaller effect contributing to ZCN variations which were not captured in our GWAS. These loci could affect the activity or accumulation of some of the abovementioned transcription factors. For example, microRNA172s are known to interfere with the translation of APETALA2 genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (such as Rap2.7), indicating that transcript accumulation of Rap2.7 may not reflect its gene product levels. Another not mutually exclusive explanation may be that regulatory networks that impact on ZCNs levels are transient or highly tissue-specific, which would make it difficult to compare independent expression datasets. experiment in 2014, and ZCN transcript accumulations. At each locus the orange colour corresponds to the 'late allele' (i.e. conferring delayed anthesis), which is for all 8 SNPs the B73 allele. Genetic groups are listed according to the flowering time phenology (late to early, top to bottom). (B) Genome-wide distribution of FST Bayescan (FST BS ) along chromosome 3 and 8. SNPs under selection are highlighted in different colors to reflect the different level of confidence for selection (Black: low confidence, Orange: substantial, Red: strong).

These included a putative RNA binding protein GRMZM2G107491 (underlying a ZCN12-specific eQTL), and two chloroplast-associated proteins (underlying different ZCN8 eQTLs), implying carbon metabolism in ZCN8 regulation. Carbon status is linked to the transcriptional regulation of the Arabidopsis florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> independent of photoperiod conditions. Moreover, recent studies indicate that temperate maize flowering is associated with expression of genes involved in carbon partitioning (which provides a different molecular signature from photoperiodic flowering induction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We note that patterns of co-variations may not necessarily define causal, but also indirect relationships. Also, since ZCN8 levels are linked to flowering, our list of ZCN8 co-expressed genes would lead to overemphasizing the association between gene expression and flowering. Thus, coexpressed genes might also be associated with a different, more biologically distal phenotype. Overall, our data support the contribution of carbon metabolism upstream of ZCN8 and provide an initial framework for the identification of photoperiod independent mechanisms that shape ZCN8 levels across temperate maize varieties.</p></div>

Rap2.7 and many other loci were under selection during the adaptation to high latitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and general patterns of differentiation for flowering time precocity closely followed the proportion of early alleles found in northern flints (earliest), corn belt dents (intermediate) and tropical maize genomes (late maturity).</p><p>Besides revealing that at least some of these loci exert their effects on flowering time by affecting ZCNs levels, our study indicates that diversification in flowering can be imposed by combinatorial allelic effects in a relatively small number of ZCN-related eQTLs regions. While flowering time may represent the main trait under selection, these alleles (through their effect on florigen levels) may also affect other phenotypic outputs, for example florigen levels have been related to inflorescence development in other grasses <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. We finally provide evidence for different signatures of selection in the main regions previously mapped in the genetic control of flowering time, thus confirming their potential contribution in the adaptation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We show that florigen genes play an essential role in the genetic variability of flowering time in those lines in which breeding suppressed photoperiodism. We reveal the role of a novel florigen, ZCN12, a non-syntenic paralog of ZCN8, whereas other related candidates had no clear role. Our study points to combinations of trans-type regulatory mechanisms underpinning selection for flowering time in different genetic groups through florigen levels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant material</head><p>A maize collection of 354 lines was assembled in the frame of the DROPS (European project FP7-244374) and Amaizing projects (French National Agency ANR-10-BTBR-01). It consists of historical and breeding American and European dent lines from the main founder group of modern hybrids <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Lines were genotyped using 50K Infinium HD Illumina array <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, a 600K Axiom Affymetrix array <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and a set of 500K markers obtained by Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Genotyping data were filtered and missing data were imputed using Beagle V3.3.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> after assembling three sub-matrices and removing duplicate loci based on their physical position. After quality control, 758,863 polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were retained for GWAS analyses. All physical positions referred to hereafter are based on the B73 reference genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> RefGen_V2. Based on the 50K <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, seven genetic groups were identified using the ADMIXTURE software. These groups were constituted by: (i) 53 lines in the Non Stiff Stalk (Iodent) family traced by PH207, (ii) 18 European dent in the one traced by D06, (iii) 38 lines in the Lancaster family traced by Mo17, (iv) 17 in the one traced by Oh43, (v) 39 lines in the stiff stalk family traced by B73, (vi) 43 lines in the one traced by B14a, and (vii) 146 lines that did not fit into the six primary heterotic groups, such as W117, NC358, and F252 (referred to as "diverse dent"). B73 was considered as the reference line <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of flowering related traits in the field</head><p>The panel was assessed in two consecutive field experiments for flowering related traits. Experiments were conducted at Saint Martin de Hinx (INRA experimental station, 43˚N, 1.3˚W, France) in spring-summer 2015 and 2016, using alpha-lattice designs with two replicates under well-watered conditions piloted by soil sensors. Male (anthesis) and female (silking) flowering dates, as well as the total number of leaves (including the ones lost) produced were measured for all the lines. Air temperature was measured every hour in each experiment at 2m height over a reference grass canopy, and the progression of the crop cycle site was characterized via thermal time after emergence, expressed in equivalent days at 20˚C (d 20 ˚C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flowering-related traits measurements in the platform</head><p>Two subpanels of 327 lines and 276 lines were grown in the Phenoarch platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> (<ref type="url" target="https://www6.montpellier.inrae.fr/lepse_eng/M3P">https:// www6.montpellier.inrae.fr/lepse_eng/M3P</ref>) respectively in autumn 2014 and spring 2015 under natural fluctuating daylength conditions (with a minimum daylength of 14 hours). The two subpanels were optimized using the algorithm described in Rincent et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> that allows to maximise genetic information by discarding individuals that might be more easily predictable. Five plants per line were grown under well-watered conditions and daily assessed for developmental traits. The number of visible and ligulated leaves of every plant was scored twice a week. Anthesis, silking (in d 20 ˚C) and the total number of leaves produced (including the ones lost) were assessed for all the lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tissue sampling for transcripts expression analysis</head><p>Maize leaves were sampled at two developmental stages, ligulated leaf 4 and 7 (L4 and L7, respectively) from plants growing in the platform. The sampling day was decided based on B73 stage, which was used as a morphological reference. Four plants were sampled for each line. Samples deprived of the midvein were collected in the distal portion of fully expanded leaves (with clearly visible ligule) of each plant at approximately the same time of the day (within 90 minutes from sunrise). Sampling was conducted over three consecutive days for each sampling stage, and the fourth sampling was done soon after the third one. The collected material was kept in liquid nitrogen and the tubes were stored at -80˚C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis</head><p>The frozen samples were ground at high speed with glass beads in a TissueLyser II apparatus (Qiagen). Qiazol reagent (Qiagen) was added to individual tubes and total RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol™-96 kit (Zymo Research); on-column DNase I digestion was performed following the kit protocol. Total RNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop One instrument (ThermoFisher) and 1000 ng of each RNA sample were used for retrotranscription with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA samples were diluted 1:5 with water before proceeding to qPCR experiments.</p></div>

Probe design was done by Bio-Rad specialists and PrimePCR Probe Custom Assay (Bio-Rad) were synthesized accordingly; the main features of probes and primers are listed in S8 Table . qPCR experiments were carried out in a CFX96 Real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad) using SsoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad) and following manufacturer's specifications. Amplification curves were evaluated using the instrument's software (Vs 3.1) and relative gene expression was calculated by applying the ΔCt method <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Gene expression was estimated by averaging the ΔCt values computed against either GRMZM2G102471, GRMZM2G153541 or the mean of both as references. Expression in the 2015 experiment was evaluated using solely GRMZM2G153541 as a reference. ZCN12 expression levels derived from 173 of the 327 lines studied, because the detection assay was impaired by a three-nucleotide deletion in the 5'UTR of ZCN12 coinciding with the forward primer annealing site (S11 Fig) . Nevertheless, these 173 lines distributed across the genetic groups of our panel in similar proportions as the initial 327 lines. This small deletion had no effects on ZCN12 transcript accumulation as further assayed by qPCR using the QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) on a subpopulation of lines characterised by the presence/absence of the deletion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed-models, BLUEs and heritability calculation</head><p>Analyses were performed using the R software version 3.4.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Preliminary data exploration (ANOVA) was conducted to assess the effects of sampling day and time, as well as the actual developmental stage at sampling, on transcripts accumulation (S2 Fig) . For all traits measured in the field and platform experiments (flowering-related traits and transcript accumulation), models were selected among several mixed-models to calculate genotypic means. Models were fitted with ASReml-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> (version 3), including the line and replicate effects as fixed, random spatial effects, spatially correlated errors, and other fixed effects (year for the field experiments; sampling date or sampling period for transcript accumulation in the platform). For each trait measured in the field and platform experiments (flowering-related traits and transcript accumulation), the best mixed-model was selected to estimate the best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs) of the genotypic means, which were then used in the rest of the analyses. The same model, but considering the line effects as random, was used to estimate variance components, which were used to calculate broad-sense heritability. Narrow-sense heritability was estimated with a model assuming additive SNP effects using the R-package Heritability <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> (version 1.2) and a relatedness matrix as in Millet et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modelling</head><p>Structural equation modelling is a generalized method for the analysis of covariance relationships and is used to evaluate the fit of data to a priori causal hypotheses about the functioning of a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. These multivariate hypotheses are represented as graphical path models. Structural equation modelling then allows the assessment of the degree of fit between the observed and expected covariances structures, which is expressed as a goodness-of-fit χ 2 . Here, the aim was to impose a theoretical structure relating the direct and indirect relationships between ZCN8, ZCN12 and ZCN7 transcripts accumulation and flowering taking into account the results of bivariate correlations. BLUEs from the platform experiment (2014) were used and the assumption of univariate as well as multivariate normality were verified. Network structures tested were constructed as follow: (i) anthesis was placed downstream of genes expression based on previous knowledge (flowering is a consequence of florigens expression), (ii) then testing for all possible network structures between the 3 florigens acting upstream of anthesis. Models tested are detailed in the results section. Structural equation models were tested in R using the lavaan structural equation modelling package <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> (version 0.6-5), which uses the standard maximum likelihood estimator. A significant goodness-of-fit χ 2 statistic indicates that the model does not fit the data. Once a model has not been rejected and considered biologically plausible, parameter estimates can be used to study direct, as well as indirect, effects of the variables. Standardized path coefficients quantify the strength of a relationship, whereas the effects of the other variables are held constant. Parameter estimates are tested for significance using z statistics. Root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) and comparative fit index (CFI) indices are used to assess the closeness of fit. Good models have a RMSEA &lt; 0.05 and CFI &gt; 0.95.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GWAS analysis</head><p>GWAS was performed on individual traits for each experiment as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Briefly, we used the single locus mixed model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y ¼ m þ Xb þ G þ E</formula><p>where Y is the vector of phenotypic values, μ the overall mean, X is the vector of SNP scores, β is the additive effect, and G and E represent random polygenic and residual effects. As in Rincent et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, the variance-covariance matrix of G was determined by a genetic relatedness (or kinship) matrix, derived from all SNPs except those on the chromosome containing the SNP being tested. The SNP effects β were estimated by generalized least squares, and their significance (H 0 : β = 0) tested with an F-statistic. This model accounting for relatedness was found the best to control for confounding factors as compared to models accounting for structure or relatedness plus structure. Analyses were performed with FaST-LMM v2.07 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Physical positions of significant SNPs were projected on the consensus genetic map for Dent genetic material <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Candidate SNPs distant less than 0.1 cM were considered as belonging to a common QTL, described via the most significant SNP in the QTL and the interval between all SNPs belonging to the QTL. Co-localizations between QTLs (across traits and experiments) were identified using the same 0.1cM window.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regional plot definition</head><p>Annotated genes located within QTLs were identified according to maize annotation version 2 (MaizeGDB).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploration of selective pressure for flowering-related traits and transcripts accumulation</head><p>Allelic distributions within the population were explored at SNPs representative of the core-set of QTLs and revealed strong contrasts across genetic groups. An F ST study was then undertaken for identifying outlier loci that would differentiate the genetic groups more than the average genomic background. Bayescan version 2.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> decomposes the Locus-population F ST into a component specific for the population shared by all loci (beta) and a component specific for the locus shared by all the populations (alpha). Departure from neutrality at any given locus is assumed when alpha is significantly different from zero. Decisions about the chance of each locus being under selection are made based on posterior odds (PO) comparing the models with and without alpha component. We used as evidence of SNPs under selection markers with log 10 (PO) &gt; 0.5 which corresponds to markers considered substantially significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>

We used data for post-sexual maturity leaves during the day (LMAD) because expression counts for ZCN7/8/12 at earlier stages (e.g. leaf 3) were extremely low and not available for all lines. We included transcripts accumulation dataset for 204 dent lines (with no biological replicates), of which 182 had also data available for anthesis (BLUPs). We discarded extreme outliers (respectively ZCN8 &gt; 400, ZCN12 &gt; 350 and ZCN7 &gt; 150 expression counts). We thus obtained correlations between the expression counts of each annotated gene in the maize genome and ZCN8 was calculated (correlation coefficient (r) and associated pvalue). The same method was applied to establish the relationship between the expression of each gene and anthesis data.

Anthesis was recorded in the platform in 2014 and ZCN8/ 7/12 levels were measured in the platform, in 2014 and 2015 at different leaf stages. GWAS was conducted for every trait/experiment, and significant SNPs were grouped according to genetic distances, with a threshold at 0.1 cM to define QTLs. The number of these QTLs is italicised within brackets outside of VENN diagram. The number of common QTLs between traits is italicised within brackets inside each VENN area. QTLs detected were then gathered into 'meta-QTLs' regions containing overlapping individual QTLs. The number of common 'meta-QTLs' is shown in plain text outside and inside the circles, and a common 'meta-QTL' is defined as regions containing at least one QTL of each trait considered.

Statistical indicators of the genotypic variability for flowering related traits and florigens transcripts accumulation in individual experiments.</head><p>Genotypic and residual variance components were estimated with the mixed-model fitted per experiment accounting for fixed replicate effect, random variety and spatial effects and spatially correlated errors. They were used to estimate an interval of broad-sense heritability such as H 2 low = varG/(varG + varRes/n) and H 2 high = varG/(varG + varRes/n + varSpatial), with varG the genotypic variance, varRes the residual variance and varSpatial the spatial variance. Mean values were calculated using BLUEs estimated with the same mixed model but with variety in fixed effect. The same BLUEs were used to estimate narrow sense heritability with a model assuming additive SNP-effects. Units are as follow: anthesis and silking in thermal time (days at 20˚C), transcript accumulation in -ΔCt. (XLSX) S2 Table . Complete set of QTLs for flowering related traits and florigens transcript accumulation. GWAS was performed on individual traits and significant SNPs were grouped according to genetic distances, with a threshold at 0.1 cM to define QTLs. Each line contains the information of one QTL with its chromosome (Chr), bin and region (in physical and genetic position), the SNP with the highest P-value (SNP Name), its position (SNP Position), -log10(p) and the allelic effect of the allele of the reference line B73. Physical positions are based on the B73 reference genome RefGen_v2 and were projected on the consensus genetic map for Dent genetic material to obtain the genetic position. (XLSX) S3 Table . Set of 'meta-QTLs' for flowering-related traits and florigen transcript accumulation. 346 main regions containing overlapping individual QTLs were identified from S2 Table and defined as 'meta-QTLs'. Each meta-QTL is defined by its Bin, start position in Mbp, end position in Mbp. (XLSX) S4 Table . Core set of QTLs for flowering related traits and florigens transcript accumulation. List of QTLs for anthesis, silking and total leaf number that colocalize with eQTLs for ZCN8 and/or ZCN7 and/or ZCN12 accumulation. Each QTL is described by flowering trait, name of the peak SNP, chromosome, bin, coordinate of the peak SNP, physical coordinates (start and end), genetic coordinates (start and end), florigen accumulation trait. For these QTLs, putative candidate genes are proposed, selected among the list of ZCN8-coexpressed genes (in red) and of known flowering time genes (in green). The established function according to MaizeGDB or a tentative description inferred from the function of the rice/sorghum/ Arabidopsis orthologs are also shown. Overlaps with flowering time regions detected in Li et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> are listed. DA = days to anthesis, DS = days to silking (DS), ASI = anthesis-silking interval (ASI), DACV = coefficient of variation of DA, DSCV = coefficient of variation of DS as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.

Variance components were estimated with a mixed model with random effects for genotype (G), spatial effects, spatially correlated errors and residual error variances (Res) and a fixed effect for replicate (model M1). In model M2, the complete set of QTLs of the considered flowering trait (e.g. 43 for anthesis in the platform (A)) was added to the fixed terms. In model M3 (respectively M4 and M5), only those QTLs, among the set of the flowering QTLs, which co-localized with eQTLs for ZCN8 accumulation (respectively ZCN12 and ZCN7) were added to the fixed terms. In model M6, only those QTLs, among the set of anthesis QTLs, which colocalized with ZCN8 and/or ZCN12 and/or ZCN7 accumulation were added to the fixed terms. The proportion of variance retained by the candidate QTLs was estimated by comparing respectively models M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 to model M1.  </p></div>
