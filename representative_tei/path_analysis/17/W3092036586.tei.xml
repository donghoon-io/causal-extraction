<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The connection between personality traits, entrepreneurship curriculum and entrepreneurial intention has received inadequate research consideration among students in Africa to inform policies and curriculum development. An explanatory cross-sectional survey of 324 Ghanaian university students was assessed in a path analysis to model entrepreneurial intention as a function of personality characteristics, mediated by entrepreneurship curriculum and moderated by teaching methods, while controlling for age, gender and program of study. There were direct significant effects of entrepreneurial attitude, need for achievement and locus of control on entrepreneurial intention. The conditional effect of teaching method on entrepreneurial attitude was also significant. We found evidence of mediated-moderation for entrepreneurial attitude and intention, with no evidence found for locus of control and need for achievement. We have provided empirical evidence to support the ongoing discussion on the effect of personality traits on entrepreneurial intention to guide the development of policy and curriculum on entrepreneurship education. Implications of our study for extant literature on personality traits-entrepreneurship intention nexus, aspiring student entrepreneurs, university managers, entrepreneurship educators and policy decision makers are accentuated.</p></div>

Extant research on entrepreneurship-based education, which focused on the relationship between entrepreneurship education, personality characteristics and entrepreneurial intention in both developed and developing countries, have showed mixed, inconsistent and evolving results (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bae et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caliendo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hien &amp; Cho, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jena, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vodă &amp; Florea, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Zhao et al., 2010)</ref>. However, studies on the synergy between personality traits, entrepreneurship curriculum and pedagogical approach, and entrepreneurial intention have attracted little attention, particularly in Africa (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adekiya &amp; Ibrahim, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Byabashaija &amp; Katono, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gerba, 2012)</ref>. Our study provides significant information on how personality traits affect entrepreneurial intention through the mediation mechanism of entrepreneurship curriculum and the moderation effect of teaching methods.

Personality-based studies have identified several personality characteristics (e.g., locus of control, creativity, risk-taking behavior, innovativeness, and need for achievement) that influence entrepreneurial intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Biraglia &amp; Kadile, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brockhaus &amp; Horwitz, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Okhomina, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Zhao et al., 2010)</ref>. The extent to which need for achievement and locus of control positively correlate and significantly influence entrepreneurial intention and activities in several empirical studies in different context have been contradictory, inconsistent and inconclusive (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ang &amp; Hong, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hansemark, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hmieleski &amp; Corbett, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Matlay et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nasip et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ndofirepi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vodă &amp; Florea, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Fundamentally, individual and contextual factors (e.g. social, cultural, economic, political, demographic, institutional and technological perceived support or barriers) commonly underpin and account for variations in empirical results of several studies on the relationship amongst personality characteristics, entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial intention and behavior in different settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hueso et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lüthje &amp; Franke, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ozaralli &amp; Rivenburgh, 2016)</ref>. Thus, the degree to which individualistic or collectivistic value dimensions are accentuated have the proclivity of affecting how personality characteristics or entrepreneurship education relates to the magnitude of entrepreneurial intention and behavior.</p><p>For instance, a study of 413 university students from the United Kingdom and Spain showed that collectivistic personal values had an indirect but negative influence on entrepreneurial intention through personal attitude and perceive behavior control but had an indirect positive effect via subjective norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hueso et al., 2020)</ref>. So, differences in individual and contextual insights may be the basis for differences in factors with the tendency to influence entrepreneurial intentions in different settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Koe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ozaralli &amp; Rivenburgh, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sharma &amp; Madan, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, extant literature has shown that much has been written about the direct link between personality traits and entrepreneurial intention. However, no studies have delved into understanding the mediation role of entrepreneurship curriculum in the relationship between personality characteristics and entrepreneurial intention, and how this relationship is moderated by teaching methods in Africa. Moreover, stakeholders' efforts to influence students' entrepreneurship spirit, intents and behavior for socioeconomic development have not yielded significant reduction in unemployment and poverty in Ghana (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Asitik &amp; Nunfam, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Baah-Boateng, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Zakaria et al., 2014)</ref>.

As a theory-driven and processoriented approach, intention-based models epitomize direct analysis of the relationship between entrepreneurship intention and entrepreneurial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Carsrud &amp; Brännback. 2011)</ref>. Intention-based models provide insights into the decision-making process of venture creation, explain the antecedents of business start-ups, predict individual planned behavior, and offer explanations on appropriate factors that influence the intentions of individuals to start a business <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Krueger et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shepherd &amp; Krueger, 2002)</ref>. Based on extant literature on intention-related theoretical frameworks, Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB) was deemed appropriate in providing conceptual direction for this study. The tenets of TPB suggest that entrepreneurial intention is determined by personal attitude (i.e., the extent to which an individual perceives an action as favorable or unfavorable), perceived behavior control (i.e., the degree to which an individual perceives the performance of an intended behavior as easy or difficult) and subjective social norms (i.e. the degree to which an individual assesses that their behavior reasonably resonates with the ambitions and thoughts of significant others in their sociocultural environment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr">(Ajzen, , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen, , 2005;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Shirokova et al., 2016)</ref>. We adapted TPB to explain the direct relationship between students' personality traits and their planned entrepreneurship behavior and proffer understanding on how individual (e.g., age and gender) and situational (e. g., entrepreneurship program and teaching methods) factors affect this linear relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Krueger et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shepherd &amp; Krueger, 2002)</ref>. TPB has gained theoretical significance and has been widely used in various empirical intention-based studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Esfandiar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gieure et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lavelle, 2019)</ref>, but as a conceptually linear model it may not efficiently explain entrepreneurship which is a nonlinear process <ref type="bibr">(Neck &amp; Green, 2011</ref>). An adaptaption is commonly required to adequately address the conditions of conceptual models which require the measurements of indirect, reciprocal, mediating, and/or moderating relationship analysis among constructs <ref type="bibr">(Brännback et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we modified TPB model to satisfy the direct relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial intention, and how this linkage is indirectly influenced by entrepreneurship curriculum and teaching methods. Our model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>) operates on the assumption that entrepreneurship curriculum mediates the nexus between personality traits (IVs) and entrepreneurship intention (DV) with teaching methods moderating this relationship. The adaptation focused on the conceptual reasoning of TPB in determining the antecedents of entrepreneurship intention but not evaluating the efficacy of TPB as originally espoused by Ajzen to predict entrepreneurial intention. Therefore, the constructs (perceived behavior control and subjective social norms) which do not directly depict personality characteristics were replaced with need for achievement and locus of control to assess the intervening effects of entrepreneurial curriculum and teaching methods in the relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial intention.</p><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> about here</p></div>

Need for achievement is conceptualized as an individual's desire for significant goal fulfilment. Individuals with such desires tend to persevere with chosen activities, which they perceive to have a moderate chance of success or ultimate prospect for personal gratification <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(McClelland, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">1987)</ref>. The concept of locus of control refers to people's belief that life's outcome (e.g., success and failure) are the results of their own action or influenced by external factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Rotter, 1966)</ref>.</p><p>However, the nature of association between students' need for achievement, locus of control and entrepreneurship intention in the context of Ghana is unclear.</p></div>

For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Keat et al. (2011)</ref> found that entrepreneurship curriculum and content had a significant positive influence on the likelihood of expressing interest in entrepreneurship among some public university students.

In summary, entrepreneurship education based on the curriculum and teaching approach serves as a significant underlying mechanism in shaping the three components of students' entrepreneurship attitude identified as cognitive, affective and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Pickens, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>To appropriately situate the model in context, we recognized and controlled for age, gender and area of study which have the potential to extraneously impact students' entrepreneurship intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bernerth &amp; Aguinis, 2016)</ref>. We controlled for these individual characteristics to eliminate them as alternatives in accounting for variation in the student's entrepreneurship intention <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Maula &amp; Stam, 2019)</ref>. Prior empirical studies suggest a relationship between these control variables (age, gender and area of study) and entrepreneurial intention (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Álvarez-Herranz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Franco et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hulsink &amp; Koek, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Joensuu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Shirokova et al., 2016)</ref>. Given the conceptual reasoning and empirical support for the relationship between the study variables, we hypothesized that: H1.

The estimated target population (1717) comprised students of TTU (1217) and UDS (500).

Correlational and discriminate validity scores were used to assess the construct validity of the latent variables and a path analysis was conducted to describe the nature of the relationship between the constructs of interest. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM Amos version 25.</p></div>

In terms of gender, there were more males (64.2%) in both universities as compared to their female (35.8%) counterparts. Majority of respondents (55.9%) pursued business studies (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Internal consistency and construct validity assessment</head><p>The sample adequacy was established using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) = 0.926. The Bartlett's test of sphericity produced a p-value &lt; 0.001, indicating that the dataset diverges significantly from the identity matrix, making the data set suitable for data reduction. The Cronbach's α for the reliability of the instrument was 0.949. The internal consistency of the extracted domains was good with Cronbach's α statistics lying between 0.7 ≤ 𝛼𝛼 &lt; 0.9. The Cronbach's α and the item-delete Cronbach's α for the six domains are presented in the supplementary material. Based on the item-delete Cronbach's α internal reliability assessment, 6 items were deleted. The assessment indexes indicated that an appropriate level was achieved by the measuring instrument in terms of reliability and construct validity. In addition to the procedural remedies for common methods bias, Herman's single factor test revealed that the maximum variance explained by a single factor was 27.85% (&lt; 50%). This goes to emphasize that common variance bias is not associated with the dataset used.</p></div>

The recommended cut-offs for popular fit statistics that indicate a good fit were met. For instance, the difference between the residuals of the sample covariance matrix and the hypothesized model indicates a good fit (SRMR = 0.025 &lt; 0.080). Also, the proportion of variance accounted for by the estimated covariance matrices supported the excellent fit of the model (GFI = 0.989 &gt; 0.95, AGFI = 0.966 &gt; 0.90). Additionally, the parsimony-adjusted index supported the excellent fit of the model (RMSEA &lt; 0.001, 95% CI; [0, 0.037], PCLOSE =0.993). We tested for the significance or otherwise of the hypotheses formulated at 0.05 level of significance (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>): a significant direct effect of entrepreneurial attitude on entrepreneurial intention (CR =3.739, p &lt; 0.001) was observed; the direct effect of need for achievement on entrepreneurial intention was significant (CR =4.208, p &lt; 0.001); locus of control had a significant direct effect on entrepreneurial intention (CR = 5.773, p &lt; 0.001); the mediated effect of entrepreneurship curriculum on entrepreneurial intention was not significant (CR = 0.994, p = 0.320). Teaching methods had a significant direct effect on entrepreneurship curriculum (CR = 13.591, p &lt; 0.001). Entrepreneurial attitude, need for achievement, and locus of control (moderated by TM, mediated through EC and controlled for age, gender and program of study) explained 50.0% (R 2 = 0.500) of the variance of entrepreneurial intention. Except for age and program of study (p &gt; 0.05), significant covariances were observed among the exogenous variables (p &lt; 0.001; age and gender -p =0.031) (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> for the estimates).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Based on the conceptual model, this study empirically assessed entrepreneurship curriculum as a mediating mechanism in the relationship between personality characteristics and entrepreneurial intention, and how entrepreneurship teaching methods moderate this relationship while controlling for age, gender and course of study. The moderated mediation path analysis showed a moderate positive association between the constructs (TM, EA and EC). In addition to its significant direct effect on entrepreneurship curriculum, the moderation effect (TM) on the relationship between the personality characteristics (EA, NA and LC) through the mediation mechanism (EC) accounts for 50% of the total variance in entrepreneurial intention. The conceptualized mediated-moderation model also showed evidence of an excellent goodness-of-fit indices. Thus, the extent to which personality characteristics (e.g., EA) affects entrepreneurial intention through the mediation mechanism (EC) depends on the moderation effect of teaching methods (e.g., active-based or passivedriven pedagogy). Aside from the direct and indirect significant effect of entrepreneurial attitude on entrepreneurial intention, there was evidence of mediated moderation for EA based on the significant moderated mediation effect by teaching methods on the relationship between entrepreneurial attitude and entrepreneurial intention through entrepreneurship curriculum.</p><p>Several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Asitik &amp; Nunfam, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mwasalwiba, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Varamäki et al., 2015)</ref> notes that an interactive and learner-centered approach to teaching and learning entrepreneurship stimulate students' entrepreneurial intention and behavior. Hence, policy decisions on entrepreneurship education and training ought to take cognizance of varying teaching methods.</p><p>Similarly, the moderating effect (TM) on (EA, NA, and LC) and the mediating role (EC) which accounts for the variance in entrepreneurial intention should inform entrepreneurship educators, trainers, researchers and policy decision actions geared toward entrepreneurship education, training and development of university students to bolster entrepreneurial intention and behavior.</p><p>The concept of intention is multifaceted, as several empirical studies exemplify the efficacy of intention-based models to explain the determinants of student's behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Esfandiar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gieure et al., 2020)</ref>. In assessing the role of personality traits and intention, the path analysis revealed a significant direct effect (EA, NA and LC) on entrepreneurial intention. Specifically, evidence from this study demonstrates that entrepreneurial attitude has a significant and direct positive influence on entrepreneurial intention as shown by the support for H1 and the moderate positive correlation between the two constructs. There was also a significant indirect conditional effect of entrepreneurial attitude on entrepreneurial intention based on moderated mediation (TM and EC). Similarly, several empirical and theoretical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Esfandiar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nguyen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schwarz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Varamäki et al., 2015)</ref> accentuate the extent to which entrepreneurial attitude positively relates and significantly influences entrepreneurial intention from the perspectives of differences in individual, sociocultural and geographical context in both developed and developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Asitik, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hueso et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lüthje &amp; Franke, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ozaralli &amp; Rivenburgh, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, university students with high degree of optimistic attitude toward entrepreneurship and motivated by the want for financial freedom and opportunity for business autonomy were more predisposed to a high degree of entrepreneurial intention and behavior.</p><p>Furthermore, the results provide adequate evidence in support of H2 as need for achievement accounted for a significant and direct positive effect on changes in entrepreneurial intention. This shows that entrepreneurship pedagogical programs and contents directed at providing individuals with the desire for significant accomplishments in life increases one's entrepreneurial intention. Thus, the more students were exposed to entrepreneurship knowledge, skills and attitude for a higher need for success, the higher the tendency for such students to develop the intention to participate in entrepreneurship activities, especially in this era of high youth unemployment situation in Ghana. Notably, our findings on the significant positive effect of the need for achievement on entrepreneurial intention mirrors those observed in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Franke &amp; Lüthje, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nasip et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ndofirepi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vodă &amp; Florea, 2019)</ref>. Although, earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hansemark, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hmieleski &amp; Corbett, 2006</ref>) yielded results of no significant relationship between need for achievement and entrepreneurial intention, which contradicts our findings due to differences in individual and contextual factors, need for achievement remains a key factor in determining university students' entrepreneurship prospects, choice of self-employment and entrepreneurial intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Caliendo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Do Paço et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Espiritu-Olmos &amp; Sastre-Castillo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Zeffane, 2013)</ref>. Probably, an important issue to consider in such contradictions is the sociocultural differences that account for the non-universality of behavior, hence the divergence in results (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Asitik, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Peterson, 1988)</ref>. The acquisition of entrepreneurship education based on the need for independence, money, being one's own boss and employer, not an employee as part of the measures of high achievement for entrepreneurial activities may be the explanation of the results. Therefore, entrepreneurship training and development programs and teaching methods grounded in stimulating risk-taking ability, creativity and the need for greater success among students has the inclination to increase their entrepreneurial intention.</p><p>The results further showed that entrepreneurial intention is significantly and positively influenced by locus of control as shown by the empirical evidence in support of H3. Empirical research on the implications of locus of control for entrepreneurship activities has yielded contradictory results. Generally, aside from differences in individual and contextual perspectives (e.g., demographic, social, institutional and environmental), the scope of cultural value systems tend to influence and account for disparities in the relationship between personality characteristics (e.g., LC) and entrepreneurial intention and behavior in various settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hueso et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lüthje &amp; Franke, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ozaralli &amp; Rivenburgh, 2016)</ref>. Although, our results corroborate the previous research findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ang &amp; Hong, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vodă &amp; Florea, 2019)</ref>, and substantiate the positive association between locus of control and entrepreneurial intention; other studies do not support the significant and positive effect of locus of control on entrepreneurial intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Matlay et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nasip et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ndofirepi, 2020)</ref>. Our findings suggest that individuals characterized by adequate level of locus of control based on their will power, were more likely to have an increased aspiration for entrepreneurship activity. We argued that the significant implication is that the entrepreneurship training and development programs and curricula of the universities in Ghana with a student-centered pedagogical approach aimed at stimulating strong internal locus of control characterized by individual responsibility for their actions may increase student's entrepreneurial goal intention (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Santokhie &amp; Lipps, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Controlling for gender, age and program of study has contextualized the model to guide interpretation and implications. Several studies have shown that the extent to which entrepreneurial intention is actualized in the entrepreneurial process depends on an individual's background characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and course of study) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Álvarez-Herranz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jain &amp; Ali, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Joensuu et al., 2013)</ref>. The dominance of students within the youthful age suggests an emerging crop of dynamic and energetic young people faced with rising unemployment situation will be inclined to develop positive entrepreneurial career intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Álvarez-Herranz et al., 2011)</ref>. Notably, young persons characterized by lower opportunity cost of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Levesque &amp; Minniti, 2006)</ref> were more likely to risk entrepreneurial initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hulsink &amp; Koek, 2014)</ref>. As substantiated in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gupta et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hulsink &amp; Koek, 2014)</ref>, other findings show that males were more likely to venture into entrepreneurial oriented careers as men were more predisposed to engage in entrepreneurial action than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gupta et al., 2009)</ref>. In a longitudinal study of students, women had lower intentions of starting business, and this intention decreased further as their studies progressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Joensuu et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>As demonstrated in similar studies, students who pursue business-related courses were more likely to prefer and nurture entrepreneurial intentions and self-employment than other disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Franco et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and implications</head><p>In applying the TPB to explain the determinants of entrepreneurial intention from the developing world perspectives, all the personality characteristics significantly influenced entrepreneurial intention as teaching methods significantly influenced entrepreneurship curriculum. Our insights into the conceptualized moderation mediation path analysis model also showed empirical evidence of an excellent goodness-of-fit indices as there was a significant direct and indirect effect of entrepreneurial attitude on entrepreneurial intention based on the moderation effect (TM) through the mediation mechanism (EC).</p><p>The outcome of our study has implications for the literature on entrepreneurship intention, aspiring student entrepreneurs, university managers, entrepreneurship educators and policy decision makers. Firstly, we contribute to providing adequate support for extant entrepreneurship literature on personality traits-intention correlation discourse from the TPB context. Empirical evidence from our study have demonstrated the significance of personality characteristics, entrepreneurship pedagogy and curriculum in accounting for entrepreneurship intention from the perspective of the TPB. Secondly, the implication of our study for aspiring student entrepreneurs relates to optimizing their positive entrepreneurial personality, which tends to develop their entrepreneurial intentions and behavior. Thus, there is an urgent need to focus entrepreneurship education and training on exposing students to productive entrepreneurial curriculum moderated by practical oriented student-centered teaching methods. This approach should be aimed at producing students with hands-on experiences, optimistic entrepreneurial attitudes, high need for accomplishments and strong locus of control. In doing so, our entrepreneurship education efforts would have the potential of, and constructive ramifications of increasing students' entrepreneurial goal intention and behavior. Thirdly    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>entrepreneurial intention is moderated by teaching methods and mediated by entrepreneurship curriculum. In cognizance of this snag, the unanswered question is that to what extent does entrepreneurial curriculum (EC) (mediator) and teaching methods (TM) (moderator) influence the relationship between locus of control (LC), need for achievement (NA), entrepreneurial attitude (EA) (independent variables [IVs]), and the entrepreneurial intention (EI) (dependent variable [DV]) of university students in Ghana. We assess this gap by proposing a conceptual mediation moderation model with the potential to open a new door in entrepreneurship education studies for understanding the influence of entrepreneurship curriculum and teaching methods in the relationship between personality and entrepreneurship intention.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, our study profiles the influence of personality characteristics of students and how university education culture regarding the mechanism by which entrepreneurship teaching methods and curriculum determines entrepreneurship intention. The enthusiasm of our policy decision makers, university managers and entrepreneurship educators to incentivize aspiring student entrepreneurs into start-up activities, and direct entrepreneurship education policies based on student-centered pedagogy and entrepreneurial curriculum, and shaping the positive attitudes of students towards entrepreneurship intention is imperative. The utmost potential to nurture students' intention for new venture formation, resulting in job and wealth creation to stimulate growth and development, depends on practical actions of entrepreneurship education. Hence, policy makers in collaboration with university managers should modify entrepreneurship teaching methods and course contents to mirror the need to produce students with positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship.</figDesc></figure>
