<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Competency on Performance</head><p>Competency is a characteristic inherent in a person that causes a person to be able to predict his surroundings in a job or situation. Competence can be measured from a variety of indicators, namely knowledge, understanding, values, attitudes, and interests. While Performance is the result of work both in quality and quantity on the basis of the work standard established. Several indicators in performance can be measured: quality, quantity, timeliness, effectiveness, and independence.</p><p>Employees who have high competence that is good in terms of knowledge, understanding, value, attitude, and interest will produce a good performance. This is because employees can predict their surroundings either in a job or in different situations and can read the opportunities that exist to get a good job. Therefore, the better the competence of employees will be, the better the performance of employees.</p><p>Based on the first hypothesis test results, it was concluded that there is a positive and significant influence of Competence on performance. The higher the competence of employees of state-owned public bodies will result in better performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How Workloads Affect Performance</head><p>Work loads represent a difference between workers' ability or skills and the work requirements that must be met. Indicators for measuring workload are factors of demand for tasks, efforts or personnel, and performance. Workload is one of the factors that affect performance. As employees have little time to do many jobs, the number of tasks and duties they give to their employees results are smaller than maximum. If this happens often it will have an impact on the performance of employees who are decreasing.</p><p>The results of the second hypothesis test, the conclusion was that the performance workload had an important and negative influence. The higher the workload of employees of state-owned public bodies will result in decreased performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Motivation on Performance</head><p>Motivation is a condition that encourages or moves a person to do a job or activity that is done so that the person can achieve his or her goals. Indicators for measuring motivation are responsibilities in doing work, achievements achieved, self-development, and self-reliance in acting. Employees who are highly motivated in their work will produce a good performance. Motivation will positively impact yourself to build a sense of responsibility for his work, a great desire to develop himself, the desire to get high achievements and have a spirit of self-reliance. A strong sense of responsibility and desire to develop oneself and desired achievements will greatly influence one's work. The improved work shows that the performance of the karayawan is high. Employees will always try to learn to solve problems and develop their potential to create high motivation and provide good performance results in their work. Therefore, the higher the motivation, the higher the performance of employees.</p><p>Based on the third hypothesis test results, it was concluded that there is a positive and significant influence of motivation on performance. The higher the motivation of employees of state-owned public bodies companies can produce better performance. 1532-5806-24-S1-60 Citation Information: Aliyyah, N., Prasetyo, I., Rusdiyanto, Endarti, E.W., Mardiana, F., Winarko, R., … &amp; Tjaraka, H.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Competence on Motivation</head><p>The competence of employees of state-owned public bodies is good so that employees will have the knowledge, understanding, skills, values, attitudes, and good interests as well. Because the level of knowledge and understanding and good skills will provide good motivation in carrying out their duties and obligations responsibly, an employee who has good knowledge and skills will try to develop his own potential to get the desired achievement. This shows that the greater the competence, the greater the motivation.</p><p>Based on the fourth hypothesis test results, it was concluded that there is a positive and significant influence of Competence on Motivation. The higher the competence of employees will result in higher motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Workload on Motivation</head><p>Work loads represent a difference between workers' ability or skills and the work requirements that must be met. Indicators for measuring workload are factors of demand for tasks, efforts or personnel, and performance. If the workload of employees of state-owned public bodies is increasing, it will affect the work's performance due to the increasing workload without considering the capacity or capabilities of employees. Decreased job performance will decrease work quality accompanied by greater job demands resulting in decreased employee work motivation. The growing workload makes employees less accountable for work, such as work that cannot be completed by the deadline and lack of self-development to improve performance. This indicates that the greater the workload, the lower the motivation of employees.</p><p>Based on the results of the fifth hypothesis test, the conclusion was that the motivation workload was affected negatively and significantly. The higher the workload, the lower the Motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Competence on Performance through Motivation</head><p>The higher the competence of an employee, the higher the motivation. High motivation will affect high performance. An employee who has high competence in terms of knowledge, understanding, skills, and interest in work will increase motivation in terms of self-development and independence in acting. Competence in values and attitudes will make an employee more responsible in his or her work. Self-development and responsibility in work make an employee have good quality in completing his work. The burden of work given is carried out in accordance with the burden given with a predetermined time. This means that employees' performance is getting better. This shows that the higher the competence, the better the performance will be through high motivation.</p><p>Based on the results of the sixth hypothesis test, it concluded that the effect of competence on performance by motivation was significant indirect. Which can be interpreted as getting higher motivation caused by the increase in competence, it tends to improve the performance of state-owned public agency companies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Influence of Workload on Performance through Motivation</head><p>The increasing workload due to the increasing demand for tasks with all the pressure to do all the tasks charged with the work's capacity that exceeds the ability will cause the motivation of work to decrease. This is because an employee will be exhausted, causing a lack of focus in carrying out the work. The time limit is given causes less maximum results in his work, resulting in a decreased quality of work. The declining quality of work due to the responsibility of completing the work is low. This indicates that the greater the workload will have an impact on the decrease in employee performance due to decreased motivation. 1532-5806-24-S1-60 Citation Information: Aliyyah, N., Prasetyo, I., Rusdiyanto, Endarti, E.W., Mardiana, F., Winarko, R., … &amp; Tjaraka, H. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>). What affects employee performance through work motivation? Journal of Management Information and Decision Sciences, 24(1), 1-14.</p><p>Based on the results of the seventh hypothesis test, The conclusion was that there was indirectly negative and significant impact on performance by motivation. Which can be interpreted as the lower the motivation caused by the increase in workload, it tends to decrease employees' performance of the Company's public-owned state-owned bodies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Competence has a positive and significant effect on Employee Performance in state-owned public bodies.
