<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Replacing nurses has become more difficult and their training and retention has become a critical concern for healthcare management. Replacement costs are high and turnover negatively affects patient outcomes as well as morale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> There are acknowledged shortages of nurses in many countries, with other countries such as China and Philippines becoming 'donor' countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Accordingly, healthcare management leadership needs to ensure that the retention of qualified and valued nurses is a priority, while training and retraining is foundational to achieving effective organisational and patient outcomes. Previous research identified the crucial role of nurses' wellbeing in commitment, and has examined the important role of nurse-supervisor relationships to wellbeing and commitment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Further, there is an identified link between the supervisor-nurse relationship and nurses' satisfaction with training and development and affective commitment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> However, the flattening of hierarchical management structures in healthcare has been associated with heavier scopes of responsibility and greater numbers of direct reports for managers and supervisors which may constrain the ability of supervisors to support staff. Importantly, commitment to the organisation -affective commitment -is a predictor of turnover. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> So, the links between the supervisor's role, wellbeing, training and commitment are important to understand, yet they remain a void in the literature. Moreover, there are currently four generations of nurses at work and little has been examined about influences on their organisational commitment. While there is previous research about the different generations of nurses at work, there is no consensus about whether each generation shares the same values and beliefs or behaves in similar ways at work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Information about what could entice the different generations of nurses to remain in the workplace is limited, and therefore this study will add knowledge to assist those who manage healthcare to develop targeted retention strategies. This research has important consequences for healthcare researchers and managers because, as is typical of numerous Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries such as the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom (UK), Australia too has an aging population.</p><p>Nurses aged 45 and over currently comprise over 60 per cent of the Australia nursing workforce. By 2025, the growth in the aged population has been projected to result in an increased demand for hospital bed days of about 40%, at the same time as the population aged less than 30 years (when nursing students typically commence study) is only projected to grow by 8%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The consequences for the nursing workforce means that healthcare management needs to better understand the needs and preferences of the different nurse generations to better retain them. This article investigates a specific component of the quality of management: the supervisor-nurse relationship, and specifically supervisor communication, in relation to important nurse outcomes. Further, it examines this relationship for its impact upon the different generations of nurses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generational cohorts</head><p>In today's workforce, there are four major and distinct generations: 'Mature', 'Baby Boomer', 'Generation X' and 'Generation Y'. This study focuses on the three largest groups in Australia's nursing workforce and adopts the dates as Baby Boomers (BB, born between 1946 and 1965), Generation X (Gen-X, born between 1966 and 1980) and Generation Y (Gen Y, born 1980-2000).</p><p>The generational cohort literature suggests that each generation has different values and beliefs from the others, and therefore their behaviours and practices may differ because of their generational-specific experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . For example, BBs tend to have a strong work ethic, and value promotion, position and personal growth, whereas Gen Xs are better educated, demand a better work-life balance, place lower value on work itself, are unwilling to sacrifice their personal lives for a career and are less hierarchical. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Gen Ys are the most computer-literate and technology-ready, are more likely to pursue training and development opportunities and are more prepared to move from one organisation to take advantage of those opportunities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> They are more achievement-and career-oriented and more optimistic in their outlook about life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Notably, Gen Ys dislike hierarchy and are therefore more likely to experience difficulty relating to superiors and less likely to accept the leadership of the nurse supervisor, particularly when that supervisor is older. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Further, significant differences in leadership characteristics between generations of business students were identified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> However, some argue that there is insufficient empirical evidence to validate generational differences, suggesting that more research is required to either confirm or refute the generational cohort lens perspective. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> For example, similarities in work involvement, job involvement, work group attachment and affective commitment were revealed for BB and GenX IT professionals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> In one study, BB nurses were found to have lower levels of turnover and higher levels of affective commitment than other generations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> In contrast, in an Australian organisation, other research found no significant differences in levels of trust and affective 4 commitment between Gen X and BB, but found that Gen X displayed lower continuance commitment and exhibited higher intentions to turnover. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Similarly, Stuenkel et al. found no statistically significant differences between BB and Gen X nurses in the USA in terms of peer cohesion, work pressure, clarity, control and physical comfort, although Gen X nurses did report a higher level of job involvement compared to BBs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> In summary, there is uncertainty as to the credibility of differences between nurses being based upon their generations. Based on this literature, the following hypothesis is proposed: H1: Compared with Generations X and Y nurses, BB nurses will have higher levels of satisfaction with supervisors-nurse communication relationships, lower levels of satisfaction with training and development, higher perceptions of wellbeing and higher levels of commitment to their hospitals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supervisor-Subordinate Communication Relationship</head><p>The supervisor-subordinate communication relationship comprises four communication constructs capturing the frequency, mode, content and flow of communication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> The theory about frequency of communication is that the quantity of interactions between supervisors and subordinates determines the quality of the relationship that develops. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> The mode of communication concerns the development of an effective supervisor-subordinate relationship, which depends on whether formal or informal modes of communication are used. Formal communication processes refer to hierarchical means of communications such as organisational documents and manuals, or addresses by the CEO or manager. In contrast, informal communications that involve a two-way communication process, such as conversations in the office or informal meetings that permit two-way conversations, more quickly builds effective workplace relationships between supervisors and subordinates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> The third communication construct refers to the direct or indirect nature of communication. Indirect communication strategies refer to supervisor practices that empower employees by sharing responsibility and decision-making and involve open communication channels so that employees' ideas can be heard and discussed. Direct means of communication involve supervisors using their hierarchical power to ensure a command style of communication, which are likely to suppress the development of an effective supervisor-subordinate relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> The fourth communication construct is the quality of the communication flow embedded within the supervisor-subordinate relationship. Relationships between supervisors (Nurse Unit Managers or NUMs) and subordinates (nurses) build when there are embedded bi-communication mechanisms, so that employees are able to ask questions, make suggestions and generally interact in the workplace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Based on this literature, using all four constructs, quality relationships can be expected to build when the workplace is characterised by frequent and informal communication, using indirect means that facilitate bidirectional communication between supervisors and their subordinates. Moreover, the generational cohort literature suggests that Gens X and Y prefer supervisor-subordinate relationships characterised by that sort of communication, creating an empowering non-hierarchical workplace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> If this is a second hypothesis then separate it like you did the previous one OR just change the previous one to an expectation statement as you have here. If you do that then you can move the actual hypotheses to the findings section. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a difference between BBs compared with Gens X and Y in satisfaction with their supervisorsubordinate relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfaction with Training and Development</head><p>Workplaces are changing in terms of the ways things are done and therefore most new workplaces need to continually update their employees' knowledge and skills to add value to employees and achieve greater flexibility and creativity. Whereas developmental training is associated more with a broad range of skills including improved critical thinking and decision-making, effective team performance and values/mindset changing, training is defined as a planned activity where job-related competencies are learnt by employees. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Training and development are important for developing organisational human capital and because of the positive impact upon affective commitment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> For nurses, Curtin identified that training and development is an important ingredient in ensuring their longer term career prospects, while McBride argued that lifelong learning is necessary for professional development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> However, Eisner argued that Gen Ys are more concerned with training and development opportunities than BBs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Consequently, Gen Ys are less committed to staying with one organisation compared with BBs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Previous research identified the importance of supervisor support in affecting satisfaction with training and development opportunities, and that the supervisor-subordinate relationship is less important to Gen Ys compared with BBs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> However, it is unclear whether there is a difference in the impact of the quality of the supervisor-subordinate relationship upon BB, Gen X and Gen Ys' satisfaction with training and development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employees' perceptions of wellbeing 6</head><p>Employees' perceptions of wellbeing significantly affect their outcomes, however, the term has multiple definitions, conceptualisations and measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Three categories of conceptualisations of wellbeing are psychological wellbeing, physical wellbeing and social wellbeing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> While there are numerous conceptualisations of psychological wellbeing, previous conceptualisations failed to capture all components. , <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> According to Grant et al., wellbeing comprises two components: the hedonic section (employees' perceptions of pleasure invoking either negative or positive thoughts or feelings, usually measured by employees' levels of job satisfaction), and the eudaimonic section (employees' perceptions of whether they have reached their potential, measured by employees' feelings of fulfilment in reaching their goals). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> In addition, previous measures have been criticised because they focused on job characteristics, but largely ignored the impact of job situation itself; more occupation-specific measurements are called for. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> However, minimal research has measured similarities and differences of factors affecting wellbeing across generational cohorts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affective commitment</head><p>Allen and Meyer defined affective commitment as the emotional attachment to, and identification with, an organisation -making employees loyal and attached to the organisation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> This is an important factor because Hartmann and Bambacas found a significant link between commitment and intention to quit for casual academic staff in an Australian tertiary institution, supporting earlier research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Previous research also suggests that communication practices and the quality of the supervisor-subordinate relationship affect commitment, as do organisational policies (about pay and appraisal methods), management practices and poor levels of workplace relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> While there is minimal previous research linking wellbeing and affective commitment, there is research that links wellbeing with job satisfaction (and job satisfaction is significantly related to affective commitment) and supervisor-subordinate relationships with wellbeing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> However, there has been limited research examining the differences across generational cohorts, and hence the following hypothesis is proposed: H2: For all three generational cohorts, there is a positive relationship between supervisor-nurse communication relationship, nurses' satisfaction with training and development, perceptions of wellbeing and levels of affective commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design, setting sample</head><p>In Australia, 40% of hospital beds are provided by the private sector and non-profit organisations and 60% is provided by the public sector. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> However, the situation is far more complex than it first appears because of public-private partnerships. This means that public patients are contracted to the private system and vice versa.</p><p>While there are some differences in the values and subsequent management practices of non-public hospitals, in practice there is substantial similarity in the type of clinical work undertaken and the patient case-mix across both public and private hospitals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> To capture nurses from different sized hospitals, the sample includes nurses from urban and regional hospitals, big (metropolitan), medium and smaller hospitals, across four states of Australia. In Australia, a large hospital is generally described as one having more than 500 beds, a medium hospital is described as one having between 300 and 500 beds and a small hospital is described as one with less than 300 beds. All of the hospitals handled acute care cases and the two large hospitals were teaching hospitals while the others were not. Sizes of the hospitals ranged from 160 to 760 beds, their locations were spread across New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria including 3 metropolitan hospitals and 6 rural hospitals.</p><p>This study used a survey-based, self-report strategy to gather data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> Surveys, including the survey rationale, were sent to seven private hospitals by internal mail, supported by a cover note explaining the research, plus anonymity was confirmed and informed consent was gained from respondents. Ethics committees at both university and hospital levels approved the study. Respondents sealed their completed survey in an envelope which was returned to the researchers. Completed surveys were received from 900 of the 4500 sent out, a response rate of 20%. The majority of respondents was female (96.3%), Baby Boomers (54%; Gen Xs were 37.8%), registered nurses (57.3%), and with postgraduate qualifications (51.8%) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We omitted the "Matures" generation (aged 62+ years) from the analysis because few are working nurses and the sample size was too small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Table 1 here]</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement</head><p>The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections taken from 4 established surveys, plus demographic information (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for details). All item statements were rated using a 6-point Likert-type scale, with 1 = strongly disagree, ranging to 6 = strongly agree (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for details). Satisfaction with supervisor-subordinate communication relationship (Chronbach's alpha = .803) is defined as employees' level of satisfaction with the communication between themselves and their supervisor and was it was operationalised by developing one combined measure using 10 items from the subscales measuring employees' satisfaction with the frequency of communication (number of contacts), the mode of communication (formal means such as manuals or informal means such as conversations in the hallway), the direction of communication (direct means such as hierarchical autocratic communication or indirect communication which empowers employees) and the flow of communication (which is either two-way with feedback loops or mostly one-way from supervisor to employee). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Training and development (Chronbach's alpha = .85) , which asked about nurses' satisfaction with training and options for career and skill development was measured using 6 items taken from Meyer and Smith's validated test bank <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Perception of wellbeing (Chronbach's alpha = .88) was developed to examine the psychological wellbeing of nurses and is defined as employees' attitudes and feelings about the work context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> It is operationalised using a four-item validated test bank, developed to address criticisms raised by van der Doef and Maes that more occupation-specific measurements are needed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> This measure of psychological wellbeing is specifically suited to nursing and is operationalised as a function of the hedonic part (focusing on nurses' perceptions of pleasure invoking either negative or positive thoughts or feelings) in addition to the eudaimonic part (focusing on nurses' perceptions of fulfilment in achieving their goals). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Affective commitment, (Chronbach's alpha = .87) is defined as an employee's emotional commitment to an organisation and it was measured using 7 items from Allen and Meyer's commitment instrument. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> In this study, supervisor-subordinate communication, training and development and wellbeing were independent variables and affective commitment was the dependent variable.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Path analysis was used to test the impact of supervisor-nurse communication relationships on 1), nurses' satisfaction with training and development and 2) nurses' perceptions of wellbeing, and 3) their levels of affective commitment. Specifically, path analysis using an ordinary least square (OLS) approach was used to test the second hypothesis. OLS provides an explanation of variance (which is the extent to which one variable can account for another variable) as well as the overall 'goodness of fit 'of the proposed model (which is the extent to which the independent variables in total account for the dependent variable ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> The advantage of path analysis is that it permits more than one path to predict the dependent variable (i.e. affective commitment) and therefore it includes the indirect impact of the other variables into the bigger equation (supervisor-nurse communication relationships, training and development as well as wellbeing). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Additionally, a MANOVA was used to examine the impact of generational cohort on four dependent variables (supervisor-nurse communication relationships, training and development, wellbeing and affective commitment).</p><p>If the multivariate F value is significant, then it means that there is a significant difference in the means for supervisor-nurse communication relationships, training and development, wellbeing and affective commitment for the Gen Y, Gen X and BBs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Correlation coefficients are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> to show the strength of the linear relationships between the variables. The Cronbach Alpha scores measuring reliability for the 4 scales ranged from 0.803 to 0.88.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> here] H1: To test the first hypothesis (Compared with Generations X and Y nurses, BB nurses will have higher levels of satisfaction with supervisor-nurse communication relationships, lower levels of satisfaction with training and development, higher perceptions of wellbeing and higher levels of commitment to their hospitals), a MANOVA was used to examine the impact of generational cohort on four dependent variables (supervisor-nurse communication relationships, training and development, wellbeing and affective commitment). The findings evident in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> indicate that there are significant differences in the means for wellbeing and affective commitment. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the means for supervisor-nurse communication relationships or training and development for Gen Y, Gen X and BBs. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> indicates the differences in the mean for Gen Y, Gen X and BB nurses' perceptions of supervisor-nurse communication relationships, training and development, psychological wellbeing and affective commitment. H1 is partially accepted because BBs do have higher levels of satisfaction with communication with supervisors (although not significantly higher) as well as higher perceptions of wellbeing and higher levels of commitment to their hospitals. Further, BBs had higher levels of satisfaction with training and development compared with Gen X and Gen Y, although, it was not a significant difference. Additionally, each cohort reported being only 'slightly' satisfied with their supervisor-nurse communication relationships and satisfaction with training and development, plus their levels of affective commitment were reported as even lower. However, Gen Y, Gen X and BBs were on average, more satisfied with their perception of wellbeing, yet these were also reported as only 'slightly' satisfied (see Table 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2:</head><p>To test the second hypothesis (For all three generational cohorts, there is a positive relationship between supervisor-nurse communication relationship, nurses' satisfaction with training and development, perceptions of wellbeing and levels of affective commitment) path analysis using ordinary least square (OLS) approach was used and the results support the hypothesis proposed. This involved testing for a statistically significant linear relationship between each of the variables and these are evident in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> as Pearson Correlation coefficients.</p><p>Additionally, path analysis involves the calculating of the "Goodness of Fit" (r 2 ) value. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This paper had two foci. The first was to examine the impact of supervisor-nurse communication relationships, nurses' satisfaction with training and development and perceptions of wellbeing on their levels of affective commitment. The second was to examine similarities and differences in impacts across different nurse generations. Some of the findings from this study support previous research, while others do not, particularly in relation to generational cohorts. Remaining findings present new information for the discipline of healthcare management.</p><p>First, using the OLS procedure, the 'goodness of fit' identified that these three factors (supervisor-subordinate communication relationship, training and development and wellbeing) accounted for over forty percent of the variance of all nurses' level of affective commitment. That is, these three variables are important in determining nurses' commitment to a hospital and since affective commitment is a predictor of turnover, such information is important for healthcare managers to consider.</p><p>Second, this paper adds new information about the similarities and differences across three generations. There was no significant difference in the levels of satisfaction with the supervisor-nurse relationship and training and development across generational cohorts; however, all three cohorts were either slightly dissatisfied or barely slightly satisfied with training and development which must be a concern for management. On the other hand, there were statistically significant differences in perceptions of wellbeing and affective commitment across the generational cohorts with BBs having higher perceptions of wellbeing and affective commitment. One interpretation of this outcome is that BBs experienced a significantly different perception of the same workplace processes, compared with Gens X and Y. Nevertheless, this new information adds weight to the validity of a generational cohort explanation.</p><p>In terms of individual variables, the findings identify important issues compromising nurses' commitment to their hospital. For example, in terms of the supervisor-nurse communication relationship, the findings suggest that across the three generations, nurses were not even 'slightly satisfied' with the quality of their communication relationships. Based on the communication management literature, such findings suggest a workplace lacking in the frequent informal conversations that are more likely to build social capital in the workplace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The generational cohort findings support previous research that Gens X and Y preferred a less hierarchal work environment compared with BBs (suggesting a preference for informal communication processes). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> However, the findings challenge past research that suggested that BBs were comfortable with hierarchical means and modes of communication. Instead, these findings indicate that BBs were as dissatisfied with their supervisor-nurse communication relationship as were Gen Xs and Gen Ys. Additionally, the low levels of satisfaction for training and development suggest that no generational cohort were satisfied with management's provision of training and development and previous research by Meyer and Smith plus McGunnigle and Jameson had already identified the relationship between training and development , and affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . This study confirms that relationship for nurses. Further, the findings do not identify a difference in the importance of training and development across the generational cohorts as had previously been argued by Eisner and therefore more research across generational cohorts in different countries is required to clarify when there are generational cohort differences in training and development attitudes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> These findings build on previous research about nurses by providing new knowledge about how three different nurse generations' satisfaction with supervisor-subordinate communication relationships, training and development, perceptions of wellbeing impacts on organisational commitment. Because past research has already established a positive relationship between the quality of supervisor-subordinate communication relationships and organisational effectiveness, it is argued that the present conditions are not ideal for optimising organisational effectiveness in these hospitals, nor is it ideal for retaining nurses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Nurse retention is a major issue for the many countries who, like Australia, face shortages of nurses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> More alarmingly, Australia has one of the lowest retention rates of older workers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> Hence, without significant changes in supervisor-nurse communication relationships, as well as the provision of training and development, nurses BBs will remain only slightly committed to their hospitals, while Gens X and Y will remain slightly uncommitted. Since nurses who report dissatisfaction with management policies and practices have a 65% higher probability of intending to quit than those reporting to be satisfied and affective commitment is a predictor of turnover, these conditions appear less than optimum for retaining any generation of nurses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study has a number of limitations. The main limitation is the use of self-report surveys causing common methods bias. However, self-reporting methods are legitimate for gathering data about employees' perceptions, as long as the instrument reflects an extensive literature review and pattern-matching is used to support interpretations of the data and triangulation is used to support research findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> Another limitation is that the demographic variables were not measured in this study and could impact the results. Additionally, we did not use type or size of hospital in our analysis and this could have an effect on the results. Further research is necessary to examine potential effects absent from in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Using a generational cohorts lens provided an insightful framework for examining similarities and differences in the relationship between supervisor-subordinate communication relationships, nurses' satisfaction with training and development, perceptions of wellbeing and in turn, affective commitment. The findings suggest that even when there are no significant differences in satisfaction levels (with supervisor-nurse communication relationships or training and development) across the nurses, the impact of other factors (perceptions of wellbeing or affective commitment) was significantly different for BBs compared with Gens X and Y. One explanation for these findings is that nurses' generational cohort provides a rational account of the differences in their attitudes and perceptions. This explanation suggests the need for generation-tailored supervision strategies to increase retention of these valued employees. Moreover, this study found that present supervision practices are not ideal for promoting effective supervisor-nurse relationships, which appear to be crucial to organisational commitment for all nurse generations.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>shows the overall goodness of fit of the model as .414, suggesting that the independent variables (supervisor-nurse communication relationship, nurses' satisfaction with training and development, perceptions of wellbeing) in combination explained approximately 41.4% of the variance of nurses' levels of affective commitment (F= 215.599, p&lt;.001, β for SSCR=.174, p&lt;.001; β for T &amp; D=.279, p&lt;.001; β for WB=.364, p&lt;.001). The β scores are standardized regression coefficients that capture the change in terms of the standard deviation in affective commitment resulting from a change in one standard deviation in the independent variables (supervisor-nurse communication relationship, nurses' satisfaction with training and development, perceptions of wellbeing).
