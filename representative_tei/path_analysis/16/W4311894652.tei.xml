<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence has increased recently. Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), which removes squandering and extra uid from the blood while maintaining electrolyte balance, is a commonly used treatment for people with ESRD. MHD decreases the likelihood of ESRD complications while enhancing the quality of life. Therefore, MHD is an important treatment option for patients with ESRD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The study aimed to investigate the correlation between the in uencing factors and quality of life in patients receiving MHD and to provide a theoretical basis for clinical medical workers to carry out targeted treatment and nursing of patients receiving MHD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and Methods</head><p>Participants were recruited from the Blood Puri cation Center of a tertiary hospital in Wuhu City, a total of 147 samples received MHD treatment since 2015. Standardized interviews were conducted with 147 patients. The EQ-5D-5L, Kessler10, SRSS, and FRAIL scales, measure various aspects of life quality, mental health, sleep quality, and debilitating status, respectively. And structural equation model of in uencing factors related to the quality of life was constructed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The UI (Mean = 0.82) for 147 participants was lower than normal (Mean = 0.98). There were signi cant differences in UI effect values in patients receiving MHD of different ages, education levels, exercise habits, sleep duration, primary disease, and comorbidity (all P &lt; 0.05), and CVAS effect values between patients receiving MHD with different family locations, primary diseases, comorbidity and erythromycinstimulating frequency (all P &lt; 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the degree of frailty and the quality of life of patients receiving MHD (P = 0.034). There was a negative correlation between mental state and quality of life (P &lt; 0.001) and a negative correlation between sleep quality and mental state (P &lt; 0.001). Psychological status played a mediating role between sleep quality and quality of life in patients with MHD (Effect value is 0.005, P = 0.001 &lt; 0.05).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Patients on maintenance hemodialysis have a poor quality of life. The quality of life is in uenced by a variety of factors. To lessen the burden of symptoms and enhance patients' quality of life, customized nursing interventions should be developed following the individual conditions of each patient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The symptomatic decline in renal function lasting longer than three months is referred to as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and calls for renal replacement therapy (RRT) <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Globally, the incidence of ESRD is increasing, in part because of longer life expectancies in many nations and worse health habits related to Western diets and lifestyles. The prevalence of chronic renal disease was 10.8% from 2007 to 2010, according to a survey of 47, 204 Chinese individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. China had 579 cases of ESRD per million people in 2013, and the annual mortality rate was 6.4% <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. There are large geographical differences in China, probably due to the different levels and rates of economic development in different regions.</p><p>Nevertheless, ESRD remains a major public health problem in China <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. MHD has the best treatment outcome for renal failure. Several studies have reported that the frequency of MHD is associated with patient survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Although dialysis treatment extends life years, the quality of survival of patients is not high. With the shift in the biomedical paradigm, extending life years and reducing mortality are not the only goals pursued, but also many aspects of psychological and social functioning. Therefore, the present research explores, for the rst time, the physical, psychological, and social adaptation of patients receiving MHD and analyzes the various factors affecting the quality of life of patients receiving MHD. In order, it has important clinical signi cance to improve patients' quality of life and prognosis of patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material And Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics Statement</head><p>The survey obtained informed consent from the patient. The anonymity of the survey was assured by not asking questions that could be used to identify the respondent. The data obtained characterized the person in a statistical manner (eg, education, marital status). Therefore, the information necessary for the analysis, not the identi cation of the survey, was acquired.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The study was conducted in the Blood Puri cation Center of the First A liated Hospital of Wannan Medical College in Wuhu City from 2015 to the present among 147 patients receiving MHD who received MHD treatment. And the nal effective questionnaire recovery rate was 100%. Primary inclusion criteria for the 147 participants were age &gt; 18 years old, diagnosed with ESRD requiring MHD treatment, regular MHD treatment 2-3 times a week for more than 3 months, ability to complete interviews independently, participation in this study is permitted and voluntary. Exclude patients with a history of major mental illness (dementia, schizophrenia, etc.), severe disability, major surgery, acute infection, acute heart failure, severe cerebrovascular sequelae, and other acute and critical diseases, taking anti-depressants (except diazepam) for more than 1 week, taking anti-anxiety drugs for more than 1 week, long-term use of compound anti-hypertensive tablets, reserpine, sibyllin and other drugs that can cause depression, hearing impairment, slurred speech or communication disorders. The study was conducted by Standardized interviews method with the use of a questionnaire technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>The study used standardized interview methods, conducted using questionnaire techniques. The questions asked participants to rate how strongly they agreed with each statement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p>Demographic information Including name, gender, age, place of residence, education, marital status, occupation, etc. The medical history questionnaire collected the patient's primary disease diagnosis, haemodialysis years, disease history, drug use, etc. The investigator himself counted the number of comorbidities per person based on the records in the patient's medical record.</p><p>Physiological functions: The FRAIL scale recommended in the "Chinese Expert Consensus on assessment and intervention of Frailty in Elderly Patients" was used, which contained a total of 5 items: fatigue, increased resistance/decreased endurance, decreased free movement, disease status, and weight loss; 3-5 items are diagnosed as frailty, 1-2 are pre-frailty, and 0 are non-frail health <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Quality of life: The European ve-dimensional quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was adopted, the rst part of the scale included ve dimensions of Mobility (MO), Self-Care (SC), Usual Activities (UA), Pain/Discomfort (PD) and Anxiety/Depression (AD), each dimension was divided into 5 levels; The second part is visual analogue scaling (EQ-VAS), the value is 0-100 points of vertical visual scale, by the patient according to their health status of the day, the higher the score represents the better the health. The EQ-VAS score can be obtained directly from the questionnaire, and the utility index value (UI) needs to be converted according to the utility point system suitable for the Chinese group. Formula: UI = 1-MOn-SCn-UAn-PDn-AP,(n = 1,2,3,4,5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Mental health: The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used, which contains 10 items on the frequency of symptoms associated with speci c mental health conditions, such as anxiety and stress levels, experienced in the past four weeks. All survey questions utilized a 5-point Likert scale, Points are calculated using the truncated score scoring method, The minimum possible score was 10, while the maximum score was 50. The mental health was interpreted in the following ranges: 10-15 points indicated a healthy mental state,16-21 points indicated a relatively good mental state, 22-29 points indicated a poor mental state and 30-50 points indicated extremely poor mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Statistical analysis was conducted with the use of SPSS 26.0. Results for variables in qualitative scales are presented using percentage distributions. In the case of results expressed in quantitative scales, basic descriptive statistics were calculated: mean (Mean) and standard deviation (SD). Independent samples were used for t-test between groups, one-way ANOVA was used between groups, and linear regression was used to test the in uencing factors of quality of life of patients receiving hemodialysis. The structural equation model was established by Amos17.0 software to analyze the in uencing factors of the quality of life of patients receiving MHD, and the parameter estimation method adopted the maximum likelihood method, and the model goodness-of-t index &gt; 7 was goodness-of-t. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically signi cant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-evaluation of quality of life</head><p>It can be seen from the data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> that the patients receiving hemodialysis reported signi cantly more at the First level (no di culties). These results con rm the strong ceiling effect of the EQ-5D scale. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respondents' Characteristics</head><p>Characteristics of patients receiving hemodialysis have presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Statistical analysis showed that age, primary disease, education level, whether there was exercise habits, comorbidities, and sleep duration were statistically correlated with the quality of life of the participants (except for sleep duration P = 0.009, the rest various are P &lt; 0.01). There was a statistically signi cant association with VAS scores in patients with MHD by family location(P &lt; 0.01), primary disease (P = 0.01), remaining disease types(P = 0.011), and frequency of erythromycin-stimulating use(P = 0.027). The results of the correlational analysis shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. Taking the EQ-5D effect value of patients receiving MHD as the dependent variable, and the degree of frailty, psychological state, and sleep quality as the independent variables, the equations were obtained by multiple linear regression analysis: =1.572-0.095X 1 -0.169X 2 -0.259X 3 , the results of the regression model analysis are set out: F = 26.539, R 2 = 0.358, and the adjusted R 2 = 0.344, and the results showed that frailty (t=-3.917, P &lt; 0.01), psychological state (t=-4.592, P &lt; 0.01), and sleep quality (t=-4.212, P &lt; 0.01) were risk factors for quality of life in patients receiving MHD. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Of Structural Equations</head><p>Based on relevant literature review and data analysis, Amos 24.0 analyzes the structural equation model of the relationship between quality of life, degree of frailty, mental state, and sleep quality. The latent variable quality of life was estimated by ve observable variables: MO, SC, UA, PD, and AD, respectively;</p><p>The latent variable sleep quality is estimated by 10 observable variables; The frailty latent variable was measured by ve observational variables (Fatigue, Upstairs, Walking, Sickness, Weight, respectively); The latent variable mental health is divided into four observable variables, which are Negativity, Tiredness, Agitation, and Nervous. Using the maximum likelihood method, the nal structural equation model was formed after repeated corrections. The model was tted and evaluated, and the simulation results of structural equations are good, / RMR = 0.068, GFI = 0.741, AGFI = 0.880, IFI = 0.808, and TLI = 0.800. (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>)</p><p>As can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>, quality of life and frailty (β = 0.29), sleep quality (β = 0.06), and psychological state (β=-0.51). Pathway analysis showed associations between sleep quality and mental state (P &lt; 0.001), between mental state and quality of life (P &lt; 0.001), and between frailty and quality of life (P = 0.034). Both standardized and non-standardized bootstrap results showed that sleep quality indirectly mediated the quality of life through the psychological state (P &lt; 0.05). (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>) function and quality of life will be signi cantly reduced. Due to low education level, and family and social burdens, some patients have psychological resistance to this chronic disease that requires long-term treatment, poor self-regulation ability, fear of disease, and unwillingness to take the initiative to improve nutritional status, resulting in a decline in quality of life. Combined aerobic and anaerobic exercise training during dialysis is effective in terms of physical health, dialysis hypotension, and mental health.</p><p>According to the results of Hong Wen's research, more than 50% of Haemodialysis patients with chronic renal failure are currently malnourished <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18]</ref>. Malnutrition is one of the common complications of patients receiving MHD who have protein-energy malnutrition, which not only affects the patient's prognosis, and physical and psychological health but also its case fatality rate is close to 20%, malnutrition is a strong predictor of patient mortality. Age, primary disease, sleep, and exercise can lead to a low quality of life for haemodialysis patients, which requires medical workers to take on the important task of improving the quality of life of patients while prolonging their survival time of patients.</p><p>Under the guidance of the new disease-health model, quality of life will become the same important medical evaluation basis as traditional biological indicators. A positive correlation was found between frailty and quality of life in patients receiving MHD. Mobility, mental state, physical condition, and illness all re ect the degree of weakness of the patient. The prevalence of frailty in patients with MHD has been reported to be 43.11% <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. It shows that the current degree of weakness of patients receiving MHD is more serious. In the debilitating phenotype, the incidence of low grip strength, fatigue, and low physical activity is highest. It should be of great concern to healthcare workers.</p><p>The psychological state of patients receiving MHD is positively correlated with quality of life. The lower a patient's UI score, the lower the patient's quality of life. Anxiety and depression affect the quality of life of patients, and long-term haemodialysis treatment brings various complications such as insomnia, skin itching, heart failure, and repeated conditions, and patients are prone to mental disorders, which is con rmed by the results of studies conducted by Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The structural equation model of results of our studies indicated that the sleep quality of Patients receiving MHD directly affects their psychological state, and sleep quality also affects the quality of life of patients receiving MHD through the mediating effect of their psychological state. Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> observed that maintenance haemodialysis patients have more severe and numerous symptoms, sleep quality and quality of life are generally low, and symptom distress is associated with sleep quality and quality of life. Sleep problems such as early awakening, insomnia, easy awakening, and nightmares can cause psychological problems such as fatigue, tiredness, and loss of interest in life in patients receiving MHD, thereby affecting the quality of life of patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the late stage of debilitation, poor sleep quality, and psychological problems are the most important in uencing factors affecting the quality of life of patients receiving MHD. Improving the quality of life is the higher pursuit of the new medical model, and we can start early detection, early intervention, and early treatment from the patient's family, hospital, and society level to improve the quality of life of patients receiving MHD.</p></div>
