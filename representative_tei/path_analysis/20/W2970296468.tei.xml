<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>We used a hexagonal grid to map SR and PD of mammals and four environmental factors (temperature, productivity, elevation and climate-change velocity since the Last Glacial Maximum). We related those variables through direct and indirect pathways using a novel combination of Path Analysis and Geographically Weighted Regression to account for spatial non-stationarity of path coefficients.</p><p>Results SR, PD and environmental factors relate differently across the geographic space, with most relationships varying in both, magnitude and direction. Species richness is associated with lower phylogenetic diversity in much of the tropics and in the Americas, which reflects the tropical origin and the recent diversification of some mammalian clades in these regions. Environmental effects on PD are predominantly mediated by their effects on SR. But once richness is controlled for, the relationships between environmental factors and PD (i.e. PDSR) highlight environmentally driven changes in species composition. Environmental-PDSR relationships suggest that the relative importance of different mechanisms driving biodiversity shifts spatially. Across most of the globe, temperature and productivity are the strongest predictors of richness, while PDSR is best predicted by temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main conclusions</head><p>Richness explains most spatial variation in PD, but both dimensions of biodiversity respond differently to environmental conditions across the globe, as indicated by the spatial mismatches in the relationships between environmental factors and these two types of diversity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Biodiversity encompasses multiple dimensions, such as phylogenetic and functional diversity, and species richness, which have varying degrees of spatial co-variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Stevens &amp; Tello, 2018)</ref>. Environmental factors correlate differently with each dimension of biodiversity and this variation offers opportunities to explore the multiple mechanisms that underlie different biodiversity dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Safi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. However, most studies exploring environmental correlates of diversity have assumed that relationships are consistent across regions (e.g., a single regression is run), when they actually might vary considerable <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cassemiro et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gouveia et al., 2013)</ref>. The standard assumption of spatial stationarity may lead to erroneous conclusions about the magnitude of different relationships. For example, spatial stationary analyses may deem a variable of little or nil effect if its direction shifts regionally from positive to negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fotheringham et al., 2002)</ref>. Here we relaxed the stationarity assumption to explore the spatial variation of the relationships between environment, species richness and phylogenetic diversity of terrestrial mammals.</p><p>Mammals have a clear latitudinal gradient of higher species richness (SR) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) in the tropics, but the spatial patterns of each dimension are not always congruent, with some areas having more, or less, PD than expected based on richness alone <ref type="bibr">(Davies &amp; Buckley, 2011)</ref>. Spatially structured differences between SR and PD reflects differences in species composition, which are likely influenced by environmentally-driven ecological and evolutionary processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Safi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Penone et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, comparing how SR and PD relate to each other and to environmental factors offers clues about the underlying mechanisms behind diversity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007)</ref>. Path analysis (or Structural Equation Modeling in general) offers a way to explore the complex interactions between assemblage's richness, phylogenetic diversity and environment, as it can disentangle the direct and indirect effects on a variable while controlling for covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grace et al., 2010)</ref>. We designed a path model that is not only able to relate SR and PD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path i) and to identify environmental factors responsible for promoting higher or lower PD and SR, but also to separate how much of the total environmental effect on phylogenetic diversity is due to (1) changes in species richness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, paths a-d mediated by path i) and (2) changes in species composition (i.e., PD controlled for richness; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, paths eh). The relationship between environmental factors and PD controlled for richness (hereafter, PDSR) should offer insights on the relative influence of speciation and extinction in the generation of biodiversity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p>In assemblages composed of closely related species, such as those resulting from rapid speciation, selective extinction of older lineages, or reduced lineages interchange, individual species contribute to a small fraction of the phylogenetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cardillo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tucker &amp; Cadotte, 2013)</ref>. In contrast, in assemblages composed of distantly related species, such as those with lower diversification rates and frequent interchange of distantly related species, each additional species yields a greater relative increase in phylogenetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cardillo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tucker &amp; Cadotte, 2013)</ref>. In the tropics, phylogenetic diversity (PD) should be lower than expected for the species richness (SR) because diversification rate seems to be higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rolland et al., 2014)</ref> and mammals species tend to conserve tropical niches <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cooper et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Olalla-Tárraga et al., 2011)</ref>. Conversely, the relationship between PD-SR should be stronger (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path i) in regions that harbor high diversity of early diverging mammalian lineages, such as in Africa when compared to the Neotropics <ref type="bibr">(Davies &amp; Buckley, 2012)</ref>. Thus, mapping the strength of the PD-SR relationship highlights ecological and evolutionary processes that influence phylogenetic composition of assemblages.</p><p>Mammalian richness is strongly and positively related to productivity <ref type="bibr">(Davies et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>, and this relationship has been maintained for millions of years <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fritz et al., 2016)</ref>. Areas of higher productivity support larger population sizes, potentially reducing extinction and increasing speciation rates, which culminates in higher species richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Coelho et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Storch et al., 2018)</ref>. Thus, productivity should relate positively to richness across the entire globe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path a), but the magnitude of such relationship might vary across the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gouveia et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alves et al., 2018)</ref>. The relationship between AET and phylogenetic diversity when holding richness constant (i.e., PDSR; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path e) will vary in direction depending on the relative importance of AET in reducing extinction and increasing speciation rates. A humped relationship between PDSR and AET observed in global parrots was interpreted as a result of decreasing extinction when AET is low and increasing speciation when AET is high <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007)</ref>. Therefore, we expect the AET-PDSR relationship to vary in both magnitude and direction across the globe, being positive where AET it is low and negative where it is high.</p><p>Mammalian richness also positively relates to temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Belmaker &amp; Jetz, 2015)</ref>, which is hypothesized to be the result of an acceleration in metabolic, mutation and speciation rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rohde, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al., 2004)</ref> or of most lineages having a tropical origin and conserved niches <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wiens &amp; Donoghue, 2004)</ref>. In both cases, the association between temperature and richness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path b) should be consistently positive across the globe and any shifts in the magnitude of the relationship might follow a latitudinal gradient similar to that of temperature itself. However, the relationship between PDSR and temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path f) will vary depending on the mechanism at play, and there is no clear expectation of which mechanisms predominate in a particular region. If acceleration in speciation rates predominates, then PDSR should relate negatively with temperature. On the contrary, a positive relationship between temperature and PDSR is expected when the main effect of temperature on diversity is associated with constrained thermal tolerance to colder environments and traits are conserved, as has being noticed in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olalla-Tárraga et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Spatially structured environmental relationships with SR and PDSR are also expected in mountainous regions and in areas of past climatic instability. Mountains are cradles of biodiversity because they promote higher speciation rates by range fragmentation and lower extinction rates by acting as climatic refugia <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fjeldså et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rangel et al., 2018)</ref>. Rapid speciation adds short terminal branches to the phylogenetic tree, and therefore, it is expected that spatial analysis will detect a clear pattern of positive relationship between elevation and richness in mountainous regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1,</ref><ref type="figure">path d</ref>). However, the relationship between elevation and PDSR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path h) should be negative if mountains are acting more as species cradles and positive if their main effect is on offering refugia and buffering extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Voskamp et al., 2017)</ref>. Climatic instability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is also expected to have left imprints on SR and PDSR given that it triggered extinction and range contractions, leading to reductions in species richness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path c) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sandel et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Svenning et al., 2015)</ref>. The effect of climate-change velocity on PDSR depends on which lineages persisted and recolonized the region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, path g). Thus, climate-change velocity should relate positively with PDSR where more distantly related species persisted and/or recolonized the region, but negatively where these species are more closely related (e.g. phylogenetic conservatism of traits that enable species to survive or recolonize) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Svenning et al., 2015)</ref>. A spatially explicit analysis may capture these different imprints of past climatic change on biodiversity, especially where changes were more extreme, such as in the formerly glaciated areas in North America and Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hortal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gouveia et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial grid</head><p>We built a geodesic dome from an icosahedron, triangulating its faces to compose a global hexagonal grid. Our grid is suitable for spatial analyses of global datasets because it minimizes geographic distortions in distances, shapes and areas caused by map projection <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sahr et al., 2003)</ref>. The 20,163 quasi equal-area cells in our hexagonal grid span on average 6,917.84 (± 858.62 s.d.) km 2 . Most importantly, variation in grid cell area does not correlate with latitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diversity measures</head><p>We mapped the geographic distribution of terrestrial mammals by recording their presence in each grid cell. We used SAM (Spatial Analysis in Macroecology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rangel et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rangel et al., , 2010) )</ref> to calculate the overlap between species range polygons <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(IUCN, 2017)</ref> and grid cells. Species richness map was estimated by the total count of species recorded in each grid cell. We removed 392 cells from analysis because they had less than 5 species.</p><p>We used mammal phylogenetic trees provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kuhn et al. (2011)</ref>, which solved the polytomies that comprise approximately 50% of the most complete mammal super-tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fritz et al., 2009)</ref>. We used public databases of taxonomic synonyms to match the 5,020 species on the phylogenetic trees to the species in the IUCN's geographic distribution database, resulting in a final dataset of 4,751 mammal species with phylogenetic and geographic data. We mapped phylogenetic diversity by summing the branch lengths connecting all species present in each cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Faith, 1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental predictors</head><p>To incorporate environmental productivity, temperature, elevation and climatic stability into our analyses we compiled, respectively, the following variables: (1) mean actual evapotranspiration (AET; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Trabucco &amp; Zomer, 2010)</ref>, (2) mean annual temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fick &amp; Hijmans, 2017)</ref>, (3) mean elevation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(USGS, 1996)</ref>, and (4) climate-change velocity since the Last Glacial Maximum, which is a proxy of the speed at which species must shift their ranges to track a given changing climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sandel et al., 2011)</ref>. Mean elevation was chosen instead of a measure of elevation heterogeneity to increase the chances of detecting the effect of mountains on biodiversity when using a spatial analysis based on circular kernels (see the statistical analysis subsection). We rescaled these four environmental variables to our hexagonal grid using the "raster" package in R software <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hijmans, 2016)</ref>, and excluded from the final dataset the cells missing environmental information, resulting in a final dataset of 17,151 cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>We designed a path model according to a hypothesis of how the environmental factors likely influence richness and phylogenetic diversity, as well as how PD is influenced by SR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The path model can assess (1) the direct effect of each variable on richness and PD, while controlling for the effect of the remaining variables (paths a-i), (2) the indirect effect of the environment on PD given its influence on richness (paths a-d multiplied by path i), and (3) the total environmental effect on PD (i.e., sum of all direct and indirect path coefficients connecting environmental factors to PD). We Ztransformed all variables to allow direct comparison among estimated path coefficients, as in partial regression coefficients.</p><p>Standard path analysis (and Structural Equation Modeling -SEM) of spatially distributed samples assumes that the relationship among variables is the same across space, which is unrealistic for very complex historical phenomena at large spatial scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hortal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gouveia et al., 2013)</ref>. To relax this assumption, we developed a Geographically Weighed Path Analysis (GWPath), which allows path coefficients to vary regionally (code available in the supplementary material). Contrary to the traditional path analysis that uses ordinary least square regression, GWPath uses Geographically Weighted Regressions (GWR) to fit the regressions that compose the path model. Thus, the path analysis was repeated for each grid cell, around which a distance-based Gaussian weighting function (kernel) was set, to assign greater weight to nearby cells than distant ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fotheringham et al., 2002</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). We implemented GWPath by using the "gwr" function of "spgwr" R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bivand &amp; Yu, 2017)</ref> within the framework of a path analysis.</p><p>The challenge of Geographically Weighted methods is to parameterize the bandwidth (radius) of the spatial kernel function. On one hand, if the bandwidth is too large, the analysis converges back to the spatial stationarity assumption, preventing variation of estimated coefficients. On the other hand, if the bandwidth is too narrow, the model overfits residual variation and the coefficients shift drastically even among nearby cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fotheringham et al., 2002)</ref>, leading to the formation of islands of coefficients that are easily detectable by visual inspection. We evaluated bandwidths ranging from 500 to 3,000 km, at 100 km intervals, visually inspecting spatial patterns in estimated coefficients for signs of artifacts caused by overfitting. We found the bandwidth of 1,000 km to be ideal for capturing large-scale patterns in coefficient variation while avoiding overfitting, as found in other studies using GWR on environmental drivers of large-scale biodiversity data <ref type="bibr">(Davies et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ficetola et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phylogenetic uncertainty</head><p>To account for uncertainty in the evolutionary history of mammals we replicated the GWPath analyses 1,000 times, each time using the phylogenetic diversity calculated from a differently randomly sampled phylogeny from a posterior distribution of 10,000 fully resolved trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kuhn et al., 2011)</ref>. We calculated mean and standard deviation of each path coefficient among replicates, which capture, respectively, the average effect and uncertainty in coefficient estimates due to phylogenetic uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rangel et al., 2015)</ref>. The ratio between the mean and standard error of estimated coefficients follows Student's t-distribution, so that t &gt; |1.96| have statistically large effects relative to the magnitude of phylogenetic uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Phylogenetic diversity of mammal assemblages is largely determined by the number of species it contains (SR), but the magnitude of the relationship between these two dimensions of biodiversity shifts across the geographic space (standardized path coefficients averaged across space 0.95±0.17, path i in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) because of how phylogenetically related the species are. As predicted, changes in SR are associated with smaller changes on phylogenetic diversity (PD) in the tropics, ranging from 0.69 in South America, Central Africa and eastern Asia to 1.59 in the Sahara Desert, Arabian Peninsula and northern Eurasia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Central North America is an exception to the latitudinal pattern, as its SR explains less of its PD. Unsurprisingly, much of how the environment relates to PD (i.e., total effects) is a consequence of how it relates to richness (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2-S4</ref>), because the PD of an assemblage is largely determined by the number of species it contains (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>However, when richness is held constant, there are considerable differences in the way the environment relates to PD (i.e., PDSR; paths e to h in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and to SR (paths a to d in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), highlighting environmentally driven changes in species composition. Our results are robust to phylogenetic uncertainty, as most of the uncertainty in estimated path coefficients (i.e., cells with high standard errors) are in regions of small effect sizes (grey regions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and white regions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The way environment relates to richness and to PDSR vary greatly over space, not only in magnitude but also in direction (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Less variation in the direction of the relationships is found for how richness relates to AET (+) and climatechange velocity (-), and for PDSR and temperature (+) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In general, PDSR has more spatially varying relationships with environmental factors than does richness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), suggesting that environmental influences on diversification might have a more complex spatial pattern than previously anticipated based solely on richness patterns.</p><p>Temperature and AET are mostly positively associated with richness, but unlike our prediction, there are regions where both measures of energy relate negatively with richness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> and<ref type="figure">b</ref>). A notable exception to the positive relationships between temperature and richness is in the Rift Valley region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), just where mammalian richness peaks. As expected, the relationships between AET and temperature with PDSR shifts in direction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref> and<ref type="figure">f</ref>). But contrary to our prediction, there is no clear pattern of how AET relates to PDSR given the amount of AET, as there are positive and negative relationships in highly productive areas, such as the tropical region of Africa and South America, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>). The strongest effects of AET are concentrated in the energy-limited Sahara Desert, where it is associated with an increase in richness and decrease in PDSR, whereas the strongest effects of temperature are concentrated in South America for richness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>) and on sub-Sharan regions for PDSR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</p><p>Mountainous areas do not present a marked difference in coefficients of the relationship between elevation, richness and PDSR as we predicted. The closest to our expectations are the negative coefficients between elevation and PDSR in the Himalayan region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h</ref>), consistent with the hypothesis that mountains trigger rapid speciation events. However, contrary to our expectations, elevation relates negatively with richness in this area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>). Climate-change velocity is associated with decreases in mammalian richness across most of the globe, except in Madagascar and parts of North America and Europe where climate-change velocity was greatest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). In these areas, climate-change velocity correlates positively with PDSR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>). However, in general, the PDSR-climate change velocity relationships vary considerably in direction across the globe without a clear pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>).</p><p>Among the environmental factors being considered, mammalian richness is most strongly influenced by AET and temperature across most of the globe, with temperature playing a more important role in most of the New World and AET being more important in the Old World (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). Temperature is the environmental factor that explains most spatial variation of PDSR over the globe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>). Small differences on total environmental effects on phylogenetic diversity and on richness arise where SR is a weaker predictor of PD -much of the tropics and North America (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) -and where environmental effects on PDSR are strong (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Thus, when considering total environmental effects on PD, temperature becomes more important in South America and in central Africa, while climate-change velocity is more important in parts of Asia, Madagascar and central Africa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our spatial path analysis confirmed that while much of the relationship between environmental factors and phylogenetic diversity (PD) can be explained by species richness (SR), once SR is held constant, the environmental-PDSR relationships offer insights on the relative importance of speciation and extinction on the phylogenetic composition of the assemblages. All the relationships tested in our path model shift across the geographic space in a more complex pattern that has been revealed by regional analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Safi et al., 2011)</ref>, and suggests that there are spatial changes in the relative importance of the different mechanisms driving mammalian diversity. Models may fail to identify relevant environmental effects on biodiversity if they have a strong effect in only a specific region or only via indirect paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hortal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Calatayud et al., 2016)</ref> and if the direction of the relationship (and potentially, the mechanism) changes across the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fotheringham et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gouveia et al., 2013)</ref>. Our analytical framework, which combines the path analysis and GWR, provides a new approach for exploring spatially complex phenomena. And because path analysis is a special case of Structured Equation Modeling, the framework can be further expanded to include geographically structured latent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species richness, phylogenetic diversity and their relationship</head><p>Phylogenetic diversity (PD) of an assemblage is strongly determined by species richness (SR), but the relative change in PD between two regions is not always consistent with the relative change in richness between the same two regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Tucker &amp; Cadotte, 2013</ref>).</p><p>Here we found that, at the regional scale, after controlling for environmental factors, tropical regions harbor relatively less mammalian PD than expected for SR. This "deficit" of tropical PD indicates that tropical regions host more closely related species than temperate regions. A notable exception is North America, which also has less PD than expected. The relatively smaller coefficient values of the PD-SR relationship in the tropics is consistent with the proposition that a substantial proportion of tropical mammalian biota has originated in situ <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rolland et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marin &amp; Hedges, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our results also support the hypothesis that diversification is faster in the tropics, which might be a consequence of multiple non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, such as area effects, time for speciation, stronger biotic interactions or increased mutation rates (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mittelbach et al., 2007)</ref>. However, there is still much controversy about latitudinal variation in the rates of diversification. Studies of mammals have found all possible results: greater diversification in the tropics <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Purvis et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rolland et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Machac &amp; Graham, 2017)</ref>, absence of latitudinal differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Soria-Carrasco &amp; Castresana, 2012)</ref> and lower diversification in the tropics <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Weir &amp; Schluter, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The smaller PD-SR coefficients we observe in the tropics may also be related to species richness because adding a random species to a species-rich assemblage should promote a smaller increment to the assemblage's PD than adding the same species to a species-poor assemblage. In essence, there is a higher probability that the new species is more closely related to one of the species in the rich assemblage than to one of the species in the poor assemblage often resulting in a non-linear and asymptotic relationship between PD and SR at large spatial scales. However, the non-linearity problem is reduced in our spatial analysis because the regressions are performed at the regional scale, where there is limited variation in species richness (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, some non-linearity could persist, and the PD-SR coefficients should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Richness accounts for less PD in the New World than in the Old World, in line with our expectations, which reflects the fact that the American mammalian fauna was strongly impacted by more recent events, such as the megafaunal extinction during the Quaternary and the Great American Biotic Interchange that followed the formation of the Isthmus of Panama 2.7 Ma ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Webb, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnosky &amp; Lindsey, 2010)</ref>. The faunal interchange between North and South America triggered the explosive radiation of Canidae, Cervidae, Mustelidae and Muridae families <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Webb, 2006</ref>) that may explain why richness is associated with lower phylogenetic diversity in the Americas than in the Old World, where many lineages, especially those in the African continent, are the result of early and gradual diversification <ref type="bibr">(Davies &amp; Buckley, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marin &amp; Hedges, 2016)</ref>. The highest coefficients of the PD-SR relationship were found in the Sahara and Arabian deserts and in high-latitude Eurasia, suggesting the occurrence of species with more dissimilar evolutionary histories, consistent with the observation that mammalian species tend to co-occur with phylogenetically distantly related species in these areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Villalobos et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental correlates of species richness and phylogenetic diversity</head><p>Environmental conditions relate differently to assemblages' richness and phylogenetic diversity controlled by richness (PDSR) across the space, varying in direction and magnitude, and supporting the idea that spatial mismatches between SR and PD are at least partially governed by environmentally-driven ecological and evolutionary processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Voskamp et al., 2017)</ref>. We found that AET and temperature relate positively with mammalian richness in most places, consistent with the hypotheses that energy contributes to the generation and maintenance of species <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Evans et al., 2005)</ref>. The species-energy relationship is one of the strongest associations known in ecology and there are many possible mechanisms proposed to explain it, such as tolerance limits, available niches, metabolic rates and amount of energy flowing through food webs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Evans et al., 2005)</ref>; disentangling the importance of these mechanisms remains a challenge. We found higher temperatures to be associated with less phylogenetically diverse assemblages in some tropical areas, as would be expected if the main effect of temperature was an acceleration in metabolic and mutation rates that culminates in faster rates of speciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rohde, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al., 2004)</ref>. However, in most of the globe we found that higher temperatures are mainly associated with assemblages that are phylogenetically more diverse. Recent studies have found a conflicting effect of temperature on the diversification rates of mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Belmaker &amp; Jetz, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marin et al., 2018)</ref>, suggesting that either temperature is not the best measure of ambient energy and other measures -such as solar radiation -should be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Clarke &amp; Gaston, 2006)</ref>, or that other mechanism may connect temperature to high richness. One possible alternative is that most clades originated in the tropics and only a few groups were able to adapt to colder environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wiens &amp; Donoghue, 2004)</ref>, thus explaining why lower temperatures are associated with less phylogenetic diverse assemblages. These results are supported by the evidence of tropical niche conservatism in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cooper et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Olalla-Tárraga et al., 2011)</ref> and the positive association between temperature and clade age <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Marin et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Productive energy, here measured as AET, is considered to drive mammalian richness by supporting more resources and individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wright, 1983)</ref>, instead of by offering greater diversity of ecological niches <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. The greater number of individuals potentially reduces extinction and accelerates speciation rates, leading to higher diversification rates and ultimately, higher species richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brown, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coelho et al., 2018)</ref>, as we found to be the case across most of the globe. The relative importance of productivity on speciation and extinction rates seems to change across the geographic space, given that the relationship between AET and PDSR shift in direction across the geographic space, as found for parrots <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007)</ref>. In much of North America and Eurasia, higher AET is associated with more phylogenetically diverse assemblages, suggesting that the main role of productivity in these regions is associated with the reduction in extinction rates. On the contrary, negative AET-PDSR relationships were found in regions with limited productivity, such as the Sahara Desert and Saudi Arabia, and in highly productive areas, such as tropical South America, suggesting a higher relative importance of productivity in driving faster speciation rates. Thus, the relative importance of AET in driving rates of speciation and extinction does not seem to be linked to the amount of AET on the region, as previously hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007)</ref>. Instead, spatially structured relationships between AET and diversity may reflect historical differences associated with pool-specific or clade-specific adaptations to environmental gradients, given that the effect of AET on mammalian diversification rates varies depending on the taxa and on age of the lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Oliveira et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Machac et al., 2017)</ref>, both of which are spatially structured <ref type="bibr">(Davies &amp; Buckley, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hawkins et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Climate-change velocity has left considerable imprints on mammalian richness and PDSR, as expected giving that past climatic instability is associated with local extinctions and range shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Davies et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hortal et al., 2011)</ref>. Species richness decreases with climate-change velocity across most of the globe, consistent with what has been observed for multiple taxonomic groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Svenning et al., 2015)</ref>. In northern North America and Europe, where change since the LGM has been strongest, higher velocity of climate-change is associated with increases in both, species richness and PDSR, suggesting that phylogenetically distant lineages are recolonizing areas that were covered with ice during the last glaciation. This finding contrasts with the pattern observed with Scarabaeinae dung beetles <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hortal et al., 2011)</ref> and to what would be expected given that cold tolerance is phylogenetically conserved in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olalla-Tárraga et al., 2011)</ref>. Increases in phylogenetically distant mammal species where climate-change velocity was greatest might be associated with the colonization by highly vagile species belonging to different clades <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Torres-Romero et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Unexpectedly, climate-change velocity left strong imprints in the geographical patterns of SR and PDSR in areas that have not experienced strong climatic changes since the</p><p>LGM, as previously found to be the case for amphibian richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gouveia et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, our spatial analysis shows that climate-change velocity is the strongest environmental variable explaining PDSR in Madagascar, consistent with a previous study that noticed that climate-change velocity is a strong predictor of the richness of some mammalian groups on the island <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Descombes et al., 2018)</ref>. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find marked shifts in the slopes of the relationship between elevation and diversity in mountainous regions. The higher elevation in the Himalayas is directly linked to less PDSR, consistent with the higher diversification rates of mammals in the region <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref> and the fact that mountains are important centres of speciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rangel et al., 2018)</ref>. However, as elevation is associated with a decrease in richness in the area, its association with less phylogenetic diversified communities may result from environmental filtering as the main mechanism driving diversity in mountains. In addition, we also note that the relative importance of mountains may be underestimated in our analysis, because (1) the poor spatial resolution of species ranges causes inaccurate description of global biodiversity patterns along slopes of mountains, (2) the size of grid cells used in the analysis is unable to capture fine-scale biodiversity patterns and their environmental correlates <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hortal et al., 2008)</ref>, and (3) the isotropic assumption of our model (i.e., circular kernel function) precludes accurate analysis of spatial patterns that are long and narrow, such as those generated by the Andes and Himalayas.</p><p>Among the advantages of using a spatially explicit approach is the identification of which predictor has the greatest effect on a response variable in each region. From the set of predictors used here, we noticed an east-west geographical change in the primary factor determining mammalian richness, being temperature most important in much of the New World and AET in the Old World. The limiting factor to species richness is expected to shift latitudinally in response to limitations in water and energy from the tropics to northern latitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hawkins et al., 2003)</ref>, but as AET is a measure of the balance between water and energy, we cannot directly test this hypothesis. In contrast to the effects on species richness, in much of the globe, temperature is the most important environmental factor for phylogenetic diversity once richness is controlled for (PDSR). This is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Davies' et al. (2007)</ref> findings for parrots that while SR is strongly linked to productive energy, PDSR is mostly associated with ambient energy. This suggests that mammal diversification seems to be more associated with temperature than productivity, supporting the claim that it is linked to warmer, but not necessarily more productive areas <ref type="bibr">(Davies &amp; Buckley, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Safi et al., 2011)</ref>. Nonstationary spatial patterns, such as the ones we found, may arise because particular clades in each region might relate differently to the environment as a consequence of their ecology and biogeographical and diversification histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buckley et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Machac et al., 2017)</ref>. Indeed, different diversity-environmental relationships are known to occur among mammalian groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buckley et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>Previous studies have shown that even though species richness (SR) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) are strongly correlated, the spatial patterns in mammalian SR does not account for the variation in PD and such mismatches provide insights into ecological and evolutionary processes <ref type="bibr">(Davies &amp; Buckley, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Safi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Penone et al., 2016)</ref>. Here we demonstrate that regionally structured mismatches between richness and phylogenetic diversity of terrestrial mammals are associated with the group biogeographical history and with the different ways that both dimensions of biodiversity relate to current and past environmental factors. We found more complex spatial patterns than previously anticipated based on per-realm analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gouveia et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Voskamp et al., 2017)</ref>, supporting our claim that Geographically Weighted Path Analysis and other GWR-based methods are promising tools to explore complex systems with varying relationships over the space, overcoming the need to arbitrarily split the data into geographical sub-regions. We argue that spatial variation in environmental-diversity relationships might emerge from either different mechanisms being at play or from different species pools having specific adaptations to environmental gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ricklefs, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hawkins et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fergnani &amp; Ruggiero, 2017)</ref>. Such spatial variation in the relative importance of different environmental factors may explain why results differ among studies and why a theory might receive more, or less support, depending on where the study was conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cassemiro et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Path model of hypothesized relationships among environmental factors,</figDesc><graphic coords="5,85.10,374.40,392.14,218.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
