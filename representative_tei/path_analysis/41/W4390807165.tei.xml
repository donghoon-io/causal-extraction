Family-to-work spillover and work-family culture were significant mediators in the relationship between employee CSR and well-being.</p><p>Research limitation/implications CSR strategies targeted at improving employee well-being do not necessarily do so in a direct approach. They, therefore, may not serve the desired performance outcomes of organisations. Boundary conditions of applying the crossover model of COR theory were observed.</p><p>Originality/value This research contributes to the limited knowledge of the effectiveness of employee-related CSR strategies on HRM and well-being outcomes from an employees' perspective. Employee-related CSR strategies are unlikely to improve employee well-being if the interindividual level of analysis, i.e. interchange between work, family, and culture, is not considered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Businesses are transitioning through substantial turbulence, among these labour shortages and strikes, pandemics, and political tensions. Derived through these challenges, organisations face the intricate task of harmonising the interests of various stakeholders. One stakeholder group particularly affected by the challenges are employees-the focus of this study. Employee contributions to organisations exhibit a dual nature, they not only contribute to organisational performance but also incentivise organisations to engage in socially responsible behaviour for the greater societal benefit by virtue of their bargaining power <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Donaghey et al., 2022)</ref>. The challenges businesses are facing require more than government intervention alone; the active involvement of businesses and their employees in formulating and executing strategies to address these issues is imperative, underscoring the essential importance of employee wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Guest, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Research argues that the benefits of CSR to employees have severely been understudied <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hsieh et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Homer and Gill, 2022)</ref>, arguably due to a focus in research on the impact of traditional CSR-organisations satisfying financial stakeholders. Such research typically emphasises corporate financial growth as an outcome of CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wang et al., 2016)</ref>. While macro-level perspectives are valuable, it is employees who experience and deliver CSR strategies. Therefore, an organisation is more likely to experience desired workplace outcomes of CSR strategies, such as positive employee attitudes and behaviours at work, when such strategies align with employee life values and priorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Singhapakdi et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, more recent CSR literature highlights the importance of designing CSR strategies specific to employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Haski-Leventhal, 2022)</ref> and includes employees in the core meaning of CSR, defining CSR as a "connection between the firm's socially responsible identity and behaviour and employees' identity and behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Haski-Leventhal et al., 2017, p. 184)</ref>.</p><p>The few studies on the impact of CSR on well-being hint at a favourable impact. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim et al. (2018)</ref> found evidence of an indirect positive influence of philanthropic and economic CSR to employee quality of life through quality of work life. <ref type="bibr">Ahmed et al. (2020)</ref> found a significant direct effect between CSR and employee well-being and a significant mediating effect of employee well-being between CSR and employee green behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Elorza et al. (2022)</ref> analysed the effect of employee-perceived high-involvement work practices (HIWP) to employee well-being, proxied as job satisfaction and positive and negative affect, in the SME context. They found a significant positive effect of HIWP to job satisfaction and positive affect, and a significant negative effect on negative affect. While these results are promising, the findings either represent non-Western perspectives or apply to specific business contexts (SMEs). Also, the CSR dimensions investigated in these studies were not specifically tailored as employee-CSR strategies and well-being was measured as proxies using job satisfaction and affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Elorza et al., 2022)</ref> and overall quality in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kim et al., 2018)</ref> instead of employee well-being related to overall health. Taken together, these aspects represent several gaps, also previously mentioned in the review of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Frynas and Yamahaki (2016)</ref>, which this research aims to address. This research examines the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Human Resource Management (HRM) and employee well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Voegtlin and Greenwood, 2013)</ref>. HRM involves managing employees within extensive networks influenced by public and private actors and stakeholders at the micro and macro levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Voegtlin and Greenwood, 2013)</ref>. This study assesses the micro-level impact by examining the influence of CSR on an employees' family domain and vice versa, as well as the presence of a work-family culture, and the subsequent influence on employee well-being. Following the well-being classifications of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Van De Voorde et al. (2012)</ref>, this study considers health well-being-the psychological and mental well-being of an employee-included in this research as general mental well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heun et al., 1999)</ref> and lifestyle and habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Dinzeo et al., 2014)</ref>. Lifestyle and habits as a parallel outcome to employee well-being is considered as lifestyle and habits are not necessarily direct precedents of employee well-being due to their complex causation, potential mediating roles, measurement challenges, and varying relevance across individuals.</p><p>Taking the theoretical position of the conservation of resources (COR) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref> and specifically considering resource gain and loss, this research considers several HRM practices as mediating variables between ECSR and employee well-being. The first aspects considered in this research are work-family spillover (WFS) and family-work spillover (FWS), and the second aspect is the presence of a work-family culture (WFC). WFS is the degree to which experiences from work are transferred into and affect the quality of the family domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kim, 2017)</ref>, while FWS is the influence family has on the work domain <ref type="bibr">(Carlson et al., 2019)</ref>. WFC comprises "mutual assumptions, beliefs, and values on whether an organisation supports and values the interchange of employees' work and family" <ref type="bibr">(Thompson et al., 1999, p. 394)</ref>.</p><p>While there is ongoing debate as to what practices form part of HRM due to a 'plurality of understandings' <ref type="bibr">(Voegtlin and Greenwood, 2016, p. 182)</ref>, we believe these aspects are part of HRM. First, these practices are concerned with employees, i.e., the 'independent agents <ref type="bibr">' (p. 6)</ref> in the organisation and acknowledge that these independent agents have responsibilities and interests to the organisation and 'out-of-work activities' (p. 7), such as family responsibilities <ref type="bibr">(Boxall and Purcell, 2022)</ref>. Balancing family responsibilities with work is one of the key issues in contemporary HRM <ref type="bibr">(Boxall and Purcell, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Taken together, this research aims to assess the relationship between Employee CSR (ECSR) strategies and well-being, and considers HRM aspects as mediating variables, while taking COR theory as the explaining mechanism, thereby making an important contribution to the CSR, HR and well-being literature. Two research questions guide this research: do CSR strategies targeted at employees directly influence employee well-being? Second, do WFS, FWS, and FWC mediate this relationship?</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Conservation of resources theory and crossover model</head><p>COR theory's central premise is that human beings "strive to obtain, retain, foster, and protect those things they centrally value" <ref type="bibr">(Hobfoll, 2018, p.104)</ref>, and work and family are indicated as centrally valued resources to people. This study adopts the reasoning of the extended crossover model <ref type="bibr">(Bolger et al., 1989)</ref> which emphasises the possibility of transmission of people's states and resources to explain the relationship between valued resources and well-being outcomes.</p><p>Crossover entails an interpersonal process that occurs when the experiences of one individual, such as strain or excitement, affect the experiences of another individual in the same social environment, e.g., their family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hobfoll, 2018)</ref>. While the extended crossover model only discussed the transmission of negative states <ref type="bibr">(Bolger et al., 1989</ref><ref type="bibr">), Westman (2001)</ref> proposed that positive experiences and states can also be transmitted between individuals.</p><p>Hence, we propose that the crossover process in this study follows a direct crossover path in which positive experiences are transmitted between employees and their families.</p><p>We anticipate that ECSR strategies provide employees with valued resources to cope with specific work challenges, such as WFS, FWS and WFC. For instance, employees struggling to balance their work and family responsibilities, such as caring for ageing or underage dependents, can benefit from ECSR strategies such as flexible work arrangements or childcare support. Similarly, Employee Assistance Programs, offering mental health support, can prove invaluable for employees facing work-related stressors that affect their family life.</p><p>Fostering a supportive family-friendly work culture can aid employees in managing the tensions between their family and work responsibilities. Following the reasoning of the crossover model, we propose that when the employee values resources, they can transmit these resources positively to their family through crossover and spillover, in return transmitting to their well-being. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Schulze et al. (2018)</ref> identify four CSR aspects: employee-related CSR, environmental CSR, philanthropy, and customer-related CSR. This study focuses on ECSR, denoting organizational practices aimed at enhancing employees' physiological and psychological well-being <ref type="bibr">(Hawn and Ionnou, 2016)</ref>. ECSR is important as how employees interpret and construct judgements surrounding their organisation's CSR affects work attitudes and behaviours <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">ECSR</head><p>ECSR is perceived by employees through the organisation's signals with which employees feel proud of their association and membership <ref type="bibr">(Lewin et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">ECSR and employee well-being</head><p>Employee well-being is a core research subject given its impact on an organisation's competitive advantage and performance <ref type="bibr">(Kowalski and Loretto, 2017)</ref>. Previous research found several organisational factors that positively influence employee well-being, such as high-involvement work systems <ref type="bibr">(Cafferkey et al., 2019)</ref>. While much research has been conducted on job attitudes conflated with well-being, such as turnover <ref type="bibr">(Bolt et al., 2022)</ref>, an employee's lifestyle and habits as forms of well-being have generally been neglected in research. ECSR is an integral aspect of one's work, and while well-being encompasses an individual's overall health, research indicates that a healthy lifestyle has a positive impact on an individual's overall life satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Kvintova et al., 2016)</ref>. Both elements are widely recognized as valuable resources in the context of human well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. Previous research found a positive relationship between CSR strategies targeted at the employee and employee behaviours reflecting well-being, such as employee performance and helping behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shen and Benson, 2016)</ref>, and employee life satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Zhang and Tu, 2016</ref>). An employee's lifestyle and habits should be considered a dependent variable, where an employee's lifestyle and habits could spillover into other domains, such as personal life satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Ampofo et al., 2017)</ref>, off-the-job embeddedness and leisure experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Deng and Gao, 2017)</ref>. From these arguments, the following hypotheses are derived: H1a There is a significant positive relationship between ECSR and well-being.</p><p>H1b There is a significant positive relationship between ECSR and lifestyle and habits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">ECSR and positive WFS, positive FWS and FWC</head><p>Work and family life domains influence one another so that they can complement or detract from each other <ref type="bibr">(Cho and Tay, 2016)</ref>. In this research, the expansionist hypothesis is followed <ref type="bibr">(Barnett and Hyde, 2001</ref>) by focusing on positive spillover, meaning that the advantages of having multiple roles outweigh the disadvantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Greenhaus and Powell, 2006)</ref>. This research examines positive spillover in both directions of work and family, suggesting that positive experiences at work could positively influence family life.</p><p>Numerous factors contribute to positive WFS, including empowering leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kim and Beehr, 2022)</ref> and working conditions <ref type="bibr">(Lawson et al., 2013)</ref>. This study concentrates on the impact of ECSR. ECSR allows employees to enhance their work by gaining CSR skills that can be applied in their personal and family lives through behavioural transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hanson et al., 2006)</ref>. This reasoning aligns with the crossover model of COR theory, suggesting that people strive to retain, protect and build resources. ECSR offers employees a sense of meaning and fulfilment beyond work, potentially boosting job satisfaction, pride, and overall work satisfaction when employees believe their efforts benefit society or the environment. This heightened happiness and job satisfaction can, in turn, enhance family connections and the home environment through the spillover effect. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H2a There is a significant positive relationship between ECSR and positive WFS. Some CSR activities are family-oriented, such as voluntary salary-based charitable contributions and salary-based payments for childcare. Such involvement can improve family life, mitigating the effects of family stress on work. Therefore, we propose: H2b There is a significant positive relationship between ECSR and FWS.</p><p>WFC may benefit from ECSR involvement. CSR-friendly companies value employees as human beings with their own values and responsibilities outside work, such as family. Thus, CSR-engaged employees may view their company as more supportive of their family and work-life balance. Therefore, it is hypothesized: H2c There is a significant positive relationship between ECSR and WFC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">WFS to employee well-being and lifestyle and habits</head><p>Family-friendly HRM helps employees manage their work and family demands and is commonly implemented to ensure viability <ref type="bibr">(Agarwala et al., 2020)</ref>. It is argued that the existence of formal policies alone, such as written CSR and HR policies, does not necessarily lead to an improved family-friendly climate <ref type="bibr">(Brummelhuis and Lippe, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the informal practices and intangible spillover role of the family on work.</p><p>In practice, the spillover effect means that aspects affecting an employee's family life, such as a bad mood, can influence their work behaviour.</p><p>Research shows that WFS and FWS significantly relate to employee life satisfaction and career goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kim, 2017)</ref>. Research investigating the effect of positive WFS found several positive effects, such as reduced burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Innstrand et al., 2008)</ref> and improved work engagement and satisfaction with marriage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hakanen et al., 2011)</ref>. Therefore, following the expansionist hypothesis and crossover model propositions, we expect that positive WFS and FWS positively relate to employee well-being, lifestyle and habits.</p><p>H3a There is a significant positive relationship between positive WFS and well-being.</p><p>H3b There is a significant positive relationship between positive WFS and lifestyle and habits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">FWS to employee well-being and lifestyle and habits</head><p>FWS is "a form of inter-role conflict in which the role pressures from the work and family domains are mutually incompatible in some respect" <ref type="bibr">(Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985, p. 77</ref>) and entails employees 'bringing home' aspects of the family to work <ref type="bibr">(Carlson et al., 2019)</ref>. Positive family experiences or emotions could spill over into the work domain, enhancing an individual's work-related attitudes and behaviours. Consider a scenario where an individual enjoys a nurturing and supportive family environment. In such cases, the positive emotions, contentment, and emotional support experienced within the family sphere could seamlessly spill over into their work. In line with this, we hypothesise: H4a There is a significant positive relationship between FWS and well-being.</p><p>H4b There is a significant positive relationship between FWS and lifestyle and habits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">WFC to employee well-being and lifestyle and habits</head><p>A WFC emerges informally as a result of the work-family practices adopted by an organization.</p><p>Research <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heikkinen et al., 2021)</ref> suggests that these practices embody socially responsible HRM, indicating the extent to which organizations assume responsibility for employee wellbeing. This involves recognising the instrumental value of employees to organizations while also addressing their personal and social expectations, such as the need to create a culture in which employees can integrate work and family life to support their overall well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heikkinen et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, a WFC signifies the organization's commitment to providing employees with a sustainable working and family life. WFC consists of managerial support, organisational time, and perceived negative career consequences <ref type="bibr">(Agarwala et al., 2020)</ref>. The existence of an informal WFC has reduced conflicts arising from competing work and family pressures and enhanced employee commitment <ref type="bibr">(Chang et al., 2014)</ref>. In organisations with an informal WFC, family demands do not hinder an employee's work.</p><p>Subsequently, employees are more likely to demonstrate positive workplace attitudes, such as commitment and career expectations <ref type="bibr">(Chang et al., 2014)</ref>. Following this, we hypothesise: H5a There is a significant positive relationship between WFC and well-being.</p><p>H5b There is a significant positive relationship between WFC and lifestyle and habits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Mediating effects</head><p>Besides the direct relationships between CSR and employee outcomes, Bhattacharya et al.</p><p>(2011) argue that CSR programs must fulfil key stakeholder needs to trigger favourable reactions. Such needs can be achieved by implementing strategies to help CSR optimise employee outcomes. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Du et al. (2008)</ref> investigated the link between CSR and customer loyalty, finding that functional and psychosocial benefits provided to customers help to optimise customer loyalty. We propose a mediating effect that implies the impact of ECSR on well-being and lifestyle and habits is not direct but occurs through the mediating variables of positive WFS, positive FWS, and WFC. For positive WFS, we postulate that if employees are engaged in CSR activities at work and have positive experiences there, it may spill over into their family life, enhancing their overall well-being and lifestyle and habits. Conversely, for FWS, positive experiences or support in the family domain can improve an employee's well-being, lifestyle and habits. These mediating effects have been tested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goodman et al. (2009)</ref> but in the context of negative WFS mediating the relationship between maternal work stress and depressive symptoms. For FWS, a mediating effect of negative FWS has been found to exist between family hassles and job resources and employees flourishing at work in the afternoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Du et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>For WFC, it is argued that theories of institutional and organisational culture may be complementary due to their multiple points of connection <ref type="bibr">(Zilber, 2012)</ref>. WFC has been assessed as an antecedent <ref type="bibr">(Mauno et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Perrigino et al., 2019)</ref> as well as a moderator <ref type="bibr">(Marescaux et al., 2020)</ref> in numerous studies. The complementary nature of cultural theories may allow WFC to adopt a dynamic position. Therefore, by taking the expansionist hypothesis and similar to previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goñi et al., 2021)</ref>, we argue a mediating effect of WFC exists between ECSR and well-being outcomes because ECSR practices encourage employees to undertake voluntary activities that align with employees' desires and are also concerned with adequate work-life balance. Subsequent positive experiences of ECSR could spill over to their family as work and family responsibilities are managed more effectively, elevating both employee well-being and lifestyle and habits. More specifically, an organization that promotes a positive WFC can enhance employee well-being and lifestyle and habits by supporting employees in managing their work and family responsibilities effectively, as is done through ECSR. Hence, we hypothesise: H6 There is a significant mediating effect of positive WFS (H6a), FWS (H6b), and WFC (H6c) between ECSR and well-being. H7 There is a significant mediating effect of positive WFS (H7a), FWS (H7b), and WFC (H7c) between ECSR and lifestyle and habits.</p><p>[Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>]</p></div>

A survey was conducted among 403 full-time working adults in the UK. The UK was considered a relevant context with its long history of valuing the well-being of employees in organizations <ref type="bibr">(CIPD, 2023)</ref>. Also, the UK government advocates businesses to practice CSR and demonstrate involvement in these (UK Government, 2018).

To ensure the target audience was reached, pre-screening criteria were set to UK citizens, married and in full time employment. The survey was sent to a total of 3,069 potential respondents. 419 completed surveys were received and 16 were excluded for reasons including incompleteness. The average completion time was just over 7 minutes, with a maximum of just over 45 minutes.</p><p>Respondents represented private companies (N=241), government (N=79), institutions (N=35), state-owned companies (N=28), charities (N=7) and other sectors (N=13). Most respondents were male, held undergraduate degrees, and had two children. Most respondents did not hold a managerial role in the organization, had an average organizational tenure of 10.4 years and earned £2555 per month on average.

The mediation effect of work-family spillover, family-work spillover, and family culture on the relationship between ECSR and employee well-being, lifestyle and habits has been tested using the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hair et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Measurement Model</head><p>All constructs were evaluated in mode A (reflective constructs). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the descriptive statistics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hair et al. (2016)</ref> proposed indicator individual reliability, latent variable internal consistency, construct convergent validity and latent variables' discriminant validity as essential elements for evaluation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the first three elements with indicator reliability following the criterion of outer loadings being above 0.69 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hair et al., 2016)</ref>. Two items were removed for loadings below 0.500 (work-family culture question 11 and employee lifestyle and habits question 6). Whilst other items loaded below 0.69, these were retained as loadings above 0.600 can be acceptable within exploratory analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hulland, 1999)</ref>. Construct reliability was evaluated using the composite reliability index and additionally the rho_A construct reliability. All constructs in the model meet the minimum requirement of Cronbach alpha above 0.600 and composite reliability higher than 0.7 <ref type="bibr">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> demonstrates that all the latent variables confirm their convergent validity, with their Average Variance Extracted (AVE) being above the minimum of 0.5.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2 here]</ref> [Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3 here]</ref> Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>  [Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> here] [Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5 here]</ref> Since the data of this study was cross-sectional, there is a vulnerability to common method bias (CMB) within the data that could impact the study's results <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>.

Hence, the study conducted Hartman's single-factor analysis for CMB, wherein the total variance should be less than 50%. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> shows only the components with Eigenvalues above one from a total of 57 components; the highest variance reported by a single factor was 35.425; therefore, CMB issues did not surface.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6 here]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Structural model</head><p>The inexistence of collinearity between model constructs has been confirmed by calculating the VIF values between the model constructs. Values ranged from a minimum of 1.000 to a maximum of 2.406 and thus are below the cut-off criterion of 5 proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hair et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>Following this, the model's path coefficients' size, sign and significance were calculated using R 2 values. Table <ref type="table">7</ref> presents the path coefficient values (direct effects), the t-statistic and the corresponding confidence intervals, as well as the R 2 values. The confidence intervals and the t-statistics were obtained using bootstrapping with 5,000 samples.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table">7 here]</ref> Bootstrapping was conducted using the SmartPLS 3 using 5,000 subsamples based upon percentile bootstrapping with a two-tailed test type and a significance level of 0.05. These results can be seen in Table <ref type="table">8</ref> with significant P values in bold. Four of the eleven paths were insignificant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Table 8 here]</head><p>To test for the mediating effects of positive WFS, positive FWS and WFC, the specific indirect effects from the bootstrapping were evaluated as seen in Table <ref type="table">9</ref>.

Results indicate an indirect-only full mediation between positive FWS and WFC, and positive WFS had no mediating effect.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table">9 here]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>This research investigated the role of ECSR as a determinant of positive WFS, positive FWS, and WFC and the mediating role of positive WFS and FWS, and WFC on well-being and lifestyle and habits. Concerning the first research question, whether ECSR strategies directly and positively influence employee well-being, the results indicate that ECSR strategies do not directly influence employee well-being, lifestyle and habits. These findings suggest that organisations must have intervening strategies in place for ECSR to affect well-being, presenting an important nuance to the debate on the importance of ECSR strategies in achieving well-being outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Haski-leventhal, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the second research question, whether WFS, FWS, and FWC mediate the relationship between ECSR and well-being outcomes, our analysis demonstrates that only FWS and FWC were significant mediators. While previous research found several positive effects of WFS on individual outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hakanen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Innstrand et al., 2008)</ref>, the findings of this study suggest that such benefits are not universal. Furthermore, these findings challenge Cho and Tay's (2016) suggestions that workplace experiences transfer into the family domain.</p><p>Our research found that family experiences can spill over to work, corroborating the suggestions of <ref type="bibr">Carlson et al., (2018)</ref> that employees do bring aspects of family experiences to work.</p><p>For WFC, and similar to <ref type="bibr">Chang et al., (2014)</ref> who found improved commitment of working mothers as a result of an informal WFC, we found that an informal WFC plays a significant and important role in improving employee well-being. So, organizations aiming to achieve the benefits of ECSR strategies could benefit from developing a strong presence of an informal WFC to achieve such benefits. Altogether, these findings introduce new understandings and refine the relationship between ECSR and employee well-being.</p><p>Furthermore, our study contributes to the diversity in types of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Van De Voorde et al., 2012)</ref> by having considered two types of health well-being-overall well-being and lifestyle and habits-of which the latter has rarely been taken as a well-being variable in the CSR, HRM and well-being literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Theoretical contributions</head><p>The findings indicate mediating effects of FWS and WFC between the relationship of ECSR strategies and well-being outcomes. These findings show the utility of COR theory and the crossover model in understanding the relationship between ECSR and well-being. ECSR did have an indirect positive effect on employee well-being through positive FWS. This finding confirms the propositions of COR theory's crossover model that it is possible for positive family experiences to spill over to work. However, the findings demonstrate that the reverse is invalid, there was no significant mediating effect of WFS. Restating <ref type="bibr">Hobfoll (2018, p. 104)</ref>, "COR theory is a motivation theory that explains much of human behaviour based on the evolutionary need to acquire and conserve resources for survival", our findings demonstrate that employees do transfer aspects from their family to their work, but not the other way around.</p><p>This could indicate an invisible barrier where employees are hesitant to bring work aspects to the family to keep these resources secure, distanced and separated. The family is seemingly a higher valued resource than work resources for human survival. The fact that WFS did not have a significant mediating role also presents a necessary boundary condition of the generalizability of COR theory. Our research contributes to an enhanced understanding of how COR theory and the crossover model interact with CSR, HRM, and well-being variables. The application of COR theory and the crossover model also contribute to more theoretical diversity in the CSR literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Frynas and Yamahaki, 2016)</ref>. More importantly, the findings indicate an important boundary condition for generalising in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Practical implications</head><p>This study found no direct relationship between ECSR and employee well-being. This leads us to conclude that managers have to pay attention to the role of intervening strategies, in our study the presence of a positive FWS and WFC. Therefore, CSR initiatives targeted at families should be implemented. Examples of such strategies include flexible working hours, locations and days, leave policies for parental leave and dependent care leave, family health insurance policies, and monetary budgets for employees with caring responsibilities. Having such policies can lead to more affective and behavioural spillover from employees towards the company, while simultaneously improving lifestyle, habits, and well-being, which in return translates into improved organisational performance. Organisations must take the lead in bringing business and society back together by focusing on the connections between societal and economic progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Haski-Leventhal, 2022)</ref>. The findings of this study would support this; by encouraging family dynamics as a societal benefit, the organisation can also realise economic progress in return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations and suggestions for further research</head><p>There is potential for moderators to influence the relationships in the model, specifically related to the insignificant mediating effect observed in this study on WFS. Such moderators could include, occupation, identity traits, gender, age, socio-economic status and family support.</p><p>Actual perceptions of family members were not considered in this research due to accessibility restrictions, so we encourage future research to include family members' perceptions to understand better how work influences family life. The study was conducted in the UK, so it has a spatial limitation as the results only represent a single country. A cross-country analysis is recommended to test whether the findings of this study are comparable to other countries.</p><p>The study included individuals from several different industries and while this contributes to the generalisability of the findings, an industry tailored approach to investigating CSR strategies would result in recommendations to a specific industry. Also, although this study included two variables to measure employee well-being but well-being is a multidimensional concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Van De Voorde et al., 2012)</ref>. Hence, future research should investigate other aspects of well-being and could potentially evaluate other constructs of the Lifestyle and Habits questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Dinzeo et al., 2014)</ref>, such as including psychological well-being, social wellbeing, and financial well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Businesses are increasingly implementing CSR strategies in response to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This research found that ECSR is only effective when positive FWS and WFC are present. ECSR strategies were also found to have a spillover effect on work, family, and culture, indicating that such strategies could positively influence other aspects beyond work life. Therefore, if organisations present the right set of resources to employees, implementing ECSR strategies will benefit organisations and individuals.</p></div>
