<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Another factor that is also predicted to determine teacher performance is job satisfaction. Robbins, Stephen &amp; Coulter (2012) states, "An increasing body of evidence shows impressive correlations between charismatic leadership and satisfaction to high performance among followers". There has been a lot of evidence to suggest an impressive correlation between charismatic leadership and satisfaction to high performance among subordinates. The results of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afriani, 2020)</ref> revealed that: there is a significant effect between job satisfaction on teacher performance in PAUD Sintang District. The job satisfaction factor is able to improve teacher performance. The results of the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Priyanto, 2016</ref>) also showed, Job satisfaction has a positive effect on performance. This shows that a teacher who has high job satisfaction tends to have a good performance. Job satisfaction has a positive effect on performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHOD</head><p>The research method used in this study was a quantitative research method. The research design used to obtain data and information in this study is to test the effect between independent variables on dependents. This test involves testing the strength of effect between variables in one direction which is viewed with different paths, namely analyzing the effect of professional attitudes, welfare and job satisfaction on the performance of ECCE teachers in Paringin District, Balangan Regency. The population in this study was all ECCE teachers consisting of kindergarten teachers and Playgroup teachers in Paringin District, Balangan Regency who had the status of Non-Permanent Teachers (Guru Tidak Tetap) with a work period of more than 5 years with a total of 17 schools. The total population is 141 teachers. Taking into account the characteristics that exist in a population that does not have strata and can be said to be homogeneous, then each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected as a sample. The type of data to be collected in this study was a quantitative data. Quantitative data was data based on the results of observations or measurements expressed in the form of numbers. The data was obtained based on the results of measurements of four variables, namely: professional attitudes, welfare, job satisfaction and teacher performance. The type of data measurement scale used in this study uses an interval scale, which is a scale where objects / categories can be sorted based on a certain attribute, where the distance/ interval between each object/ category is the same. The data collection technique used in this study was a questionnaire. Tests of the validity and reliability of the instrument are carried out before carrying out the actual research. The instrument validity test was conducted on 30 respondents. The data analysis technique used to test research hypotheses was to use path analysis. The steps taken in the data analysis activities in this study were as follows: grouping data based on variables and types of respondents, tabulating data based on variables from all respondents, presenting data from each variable studied, conducting analysis requirements tests, performing calculations to test hypotheses that have been proposed.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table">4</ref> is a summary of the decisions of H 1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 with a criterion of significance values less than 0.05, then the hypothesis is accepted. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> is a summary of the decisions of testing the H6 and H7 hypotheses provided that if the coefficient of direct effect is smaller than the coefficient of indirect effect, then the hypothesis is rejected. Based on the results of the analysis in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, and 3, in this study, the effects among variables were successfully found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Direct effect of professional attitudes on job satisfaction of ECCE teachers in Paringin District, Balangan Regency</head><p>The results of this study showed that the sig value for the professional attitude variable obtained a sig value of 0.033. This sig value is less than the significance level of 0.05, or the value of 0.033&lt;0.05. The Professional attitude variable obtained a calculated t of 2.163 greater than that of the table t at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (104 -1) of 1.983, so Ho was rejected and Ha was accepted. This means that there is a direct effect of the attitude of the profession to the job satisfaction of teachers. A positive t-value indicates that the professional attitude variable has a correlation that is in the same direction as the teacher's job satisfaction. The findings in this study are in line with research conducted by (Sudanta &amp; I Wayan, 2013) which found that teachers' attitudes towards the profession have a significant effect on the job satisfaction of elementary school teachers. Teachers who have a positive attitude towards their profession can work well, thus allowing teachers to feel comfortable, calm, full of familiarity and mutual respect among teachers and with the principal. Teachers will also work together in carrying out school goals, because teachers have satisfaction in working. The results of this study are also in line with the opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Sutrisno, 2013</ref>) that: factors that affect job satisfaction include psychological factors, namely factors related to employee psychology including interest, peace of mind at work, attitudes towards work, talents and skills. The existence of this effect is because every teacher has a good response to all the work he faces, loves his profession, has a sincere heart at work and has a strong belief in the duties of his profession, so that teachers with high awareness are willing to carry out tasks according to the provisions and expectations of the school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Direct effect of teacher welfare on job satisfaction of ECCE teachers in Paringin Subdistrict, Balangan Regency The results of this study showed that the sig value for the teacher welfare variable obtained a sig value of 0.008. This sig value is less than the significance level of 0.05, or the value of 0.008&lt;0.05. The teacher welfare variable obtained at count of 2.686 greater than the table t at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (104 -1) of 1.983, so Ho was rejected and Ha was accepted. This means that there is a direct effect of well-being on teacher job satisfaction. A positive t-value indicates that the teacher welfare variable has a similar correlation with the teacher's job satisfaction. The findings in this study support research conducted by (Tabansa &amp; Reifly Zan, 2019) which found that job empowerment and well-being both simultaneously and partially have a positive and significant effect on job satisfaction. The study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Sholihah, 2020</ref>) also found that welfare variables have a significant effect on job satisfaction. The effect of the findings in this study is because teachers who obtain welfare will have a strong desire to excel, feel recognized, strive to increase potential, have great responsibility, like their work in order to organize various activities that are their duties and fulfill obligations in achieving specified goals. This means that teachers already have satisfaction in working. The findings in this study are also in line with the opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Sutrisno, 2013)</ref> which states that, factors that affect job satisfaction include financial factors which are factors related to employee guarantees and welfare.</p></div>

This sig value is less than the significance level of 0.05, or the value of 0.046&lt;0.05. The job satisfaction variable obtained a calculated t of 2.018 greater than the table t at a significance level of 0.05 with a df (104 -1) of 1.983, so Ho was rejected and Ha was accepted. This means that there is a direct effect of job satisfaction on teacher performance. A positive t-value indicates that the teacher's job satisfaction variable has a similar correlation with teacher performance. The findings in this study are in line with research conducted by (Afriani, 2020) revealed that: there is a significant effect between job satisfaction on teacher performance in PAUD Sintang District.
