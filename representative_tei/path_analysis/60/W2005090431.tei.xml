<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper deals with the primary causes of informal housing in Greece as well as the observed differentiations in informal housing patterns across space� The spatial level of analysis is the prefectural administrative level� The results of the multinomial logistic regression analysis indicate that Greek prefectures differ in the way they experience the informal housing phenomenon� An explanation for the observed differences may be the separate development paths followed and the diverse range of economic activities in each prefecture� The Greek state has not made provisions for creating the necessary 'urban land stock' in each prefecture, so that everyone interested can find land parcels at an affordable price� On the contrary, the state encourages the informal housing activity by legalizing large areas of such activity sporadically and by introducing legislative initiatives of limited success in dealing with the problem�</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In several countries worldwide, informal settlements represent a growing part of many metropolitan areas. Factors influencing informal housing growth and settlement formation vary amongst locations� In the literature, the investigations dealing with informal housing activity could be classified into two general categories.</p><p>The first category comprises numerous enquires that examine illegal housing phenomenon in less developed or poor countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Linden et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Sethuraman, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Kumar, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Roy, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smart, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kapoor and Blanc 2008</ref>)� In the second category, the attempts on approaching informal housing activity concern developed nations� These studies have been mainly focussed on the role of the state and on policy responses to housing affordability issues <ref type="bibr">(Susser, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Waterson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ward and Peters, 2007</ref>)� Here, informal housing is often considered as 'hidden homelessness', which is admittedly little understood, or systematically studied, though acknowledged as a critical research priority and gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tanasescu et al., 2010)</ref>� This tendency to separately examine illegal housing in developing and developed countries by using distinct approaches is mainly due to the large differences observed in economic, social, political and environmental conditions associated with the countries of each category� Consequently, the proximate and underlying causes of illegal housing phenomenon might be fundamentally different amongst countries� This consideration has impeded our capacity for comparative and more holistic understandings of the processes that give rise to housing illegality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Tanasescu et al., 2010)</ref>�</p><p>The type and quality of buildings may vary considerably between countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Kombe, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Kombe, , 2005))</ref>� Estimates based on current trends in the developing regions of the world indicate that such settlements will increase considerably providing shelter for as many as 50% of the total urban population over the next ten-twenty years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">UN-Habitat, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2005)</ref>� In most countries facing this problem, there is little strategic thinking about the integration of these housing clusters into the city as a whole <ref type="bibr">(Abbott and Douglas, 2003)</ref>� Therefore, the problem remains unresolved generating serious adverse impacts on almost all aspects of urban life (e�g� transportation, safety, social security etc�)� For Greece, informal housing constitutes a phenomenon with complex and interacting economic, social and political dimensions� It is tightly connected to the kind of management applied by the state upon urban and non-urban land� Past and current housing policies in Greece have introduced specific instruments to address informal settlements. The first targeted informal housing policy, which was launched in 1983, set up two important mechanisms to deal with the problem� However, the illegal housing phenomenon proceeded at a high pace, with about 3,000 unlicensed buildings (almost the size of a small town) being legalized and integrated into the existing urban system each year� moreover, it is believed that the number of illegal buildings that escape the legalizing process annually is much higher <ref type="bibr">(minetos et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Polyzos and minetos, 2007)</ref>� This situation tends to become an acute problem with serious economic, social and environmental implications. Its significant and pressing impacts include deterioration of landscape aesthetics, biodiversity loss, desertification, forest and open space loss, increased vulnerability of human settlements, local water contamination� It is vital to understand the informal housing process in order to design and implement effective policy responses�</p><p>The present empirical research primarily aims at revealing the major underlying causes of informal housing in Greece performing a spatial analysis of the phenomenon at the prefectural administrative level (NUTS III)� The focus of the study is on how certain regional economic, social and environmental characteristics influence the magnitude of informal housing across space. In doing so, we adopt a quantitative approach and construct a logistic regression model of likely explanatory variables� The choice of the variables relays on well-known theoretical perspectives on the fields land economics and housing. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a framework for the empirical analysis by dealing with the theoretical perspectives that either directly or indirectly refer to the process of informal housing� Section 3 presents the methodological approach of the study� It also gives a detailed description of the explanatory variables used in the model and comments on the merits of using multinomial logistic regression as a tool for investigating informal housing phenomenon� The overall performance of the model is discussed and the results are presented and interpreted� Finally, Section 4 formulates the conclusions drawn from the precedent investigation�</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">UnDerstanDInG InForMaL HoUsInG Patterns</head><p>A plethora of theoretical schemata have been developed to explain various land allocation processes� In regards to informal housing, the pertinent literature reports two major categories of theories, which offer a means of conceptualizing reality <ref type="bibr">(Hall and Hay, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Leontidou et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sietchiping, 2004)</ref>. The main classification criterion of these theories is the level of economic development of the country under question. The first category encompasses theories which apply to the developed countries, whereas the second category comprises theories which can better explain illegal housing patterns in the developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sietchiping, 2004)</ref>�</p><p>In regards to the developed countries, three general theoretical schemata are frequently discussed in the international literature� 1� The Chicago School perspective which was formulated mainly by Burgess in the late 1920s� He considered illegal housing the result of income level differences among various ethnic groups who competed for urban land <ref type="bibr">(Burgess 1925</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">in: UN-Habitat, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sietchiping, 2004)</ref>� In an updated version of this perspective, Davis (1992) introduces the concept of 'the ecology of fear' which will probably become the natural order of the 21st-century city� 2� The neo-liberal theory of slums of Alonso� This theory suggests that illegal housing is a reaction to the housing needs of the people who cannot afford to pay for a formal housing unit due to discriminatory urban regulations and public spending <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Smith, 1980</ref>)� However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Leontidou et al. (2002)</ref> argue that this approach as well as the urban life cycle model (according to which there is a cyclical process of urban changes encompassing the stages of urbanization, suburbanization, disurbanization or counterurbanization and reurbanization), distort the characteristics of Euro-mediterranean urban development� Therefore, they are inappropriate for analyzing urban patterns in many mediterranean cities� 3� Two contemporary perspectives on globalization� (a) The post-modern theory of urban landscape, which can be regarded as a continuation of the theory of factorial ecology� In the post-modern theory, informal settlements are perceived as the product of skills segregation within urban spaces and according to this approach, urban dwellers settle in regards to their profession and social status <ref type="bibr">(Flood, 2000)</ref>� (b) The 'global cities' concept by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sassen (1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sassen ( , 2003))</ref>, which refers to cities with resources that enable firms and markets to be global. This author proposed the term 'global city' to describe the impacts of globalization on city structure through the movement of labour and capital, new technologies and firm location decisions.</p><p>With regard to Greece, the building forms and driving forces of informal housing have been extraordinarily different depending on the historical context� Informal settlements in Greece are unlike such settlements in poorer countries, where the very poor people have established settlements with whatever materials may be available� The most common housing informality in Greece includes construction mainly of houses without building licenses on small, legally-owned land parcels, in areas having no formal urban plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Potsiou and Ioannidis, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dimopoulou and zentelis, 2008)</ref>� We can roughly distinguish two periods regarding the evolution of the phenomenon, the areas mainly occurred and the causes which affect its appearance. The first period started in decade of 1950s, after the Second World War and the Civil War in Greece and ended in 1983�</p><p>In this period, the 'first generation of informal settlements' grew, while informal housing activity was associated with significant rural -urban migration movements as well as with the failure of the state to meet the widespread demand for shelter by the incoming population� Urbanization and net increases in the country's population created pressing needs for new housing units� In addition, the level of income of the newly-arrived population was relatively low at most major cities and so did their ability of acquiring a proper shelter� Increases in urban population usually fuel the demand for housing in the real estate market rising, in its turn, urban land and property prices� High land prices are a serious obstacle for acquiring a house� Increases in the available developable land through the extension of existing urban plans are a time-consuming process� Therefore, keeping urban land prices at an affordable level is difficult and requires effective monitoring procedures and adequate land use planning mechanisms� So, people coming from rural to cities did not have access to housing financing and they could not afford to buy apartments in the city� It was affordable for them to buy land parcels mainly in the periphery of major cities or close to industrial areas, and also within the coastal zone, in areas that had no formal urban planning regulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Potsiou and Ioannidis, 2006</ref>)�</p><p>In the past, under the prevailing tight economic conditions, neither the government nor the private sector could provide the urban poor with basic shelter� Hence, informal housing activity was, in some respects, the direct result of the failure of government housing and spatial planning policies� The main reasons for this failure were: (a) the regional and economic policy pursued which fuelled rural-urban migration movements, (b) failure to design and implement urban land policy that could have provided land plots of affordable prices for the low income groups and (c) the inability of the public sector to plan strategically and to forecast urban land demand <ref type="bibr">(Dimopoulou and zentelis, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">ECE 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">UN-Habitat, 2010)</ref>�</p><p>The second period of the phenomenon began in 1983 and continues by our days. In 1983, a significant piece of legislation was introduced dealing with wider urban land planning and management issues as well as with the phenomenon of informal housing in Greece <ref type="bibr">(Law, 1337</ref><ref type="bibr">(Law, , 1983</ref>)� The law contained provisions for integrating informal settlements into the existing system of urban areas and for lowering the pace of urban sprawl through the introduction of urban land use zones� By this document, the state attempted to integrate these informal settlements into a legal status by extending the formal urban plans� In particular, the Law 1337 gave priority to the extension of existing town plans in areas on the urban fringe with unauthorized development, lacking basic urban infrastructure and implementing zones of Urban Development Control <ref type="bibr">(Giannakourou and Balla, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dimopoulou and zentelis, 2008</ref>)� As a result, a great effort was made to survey and organize unregistered urban units that had emerged since the post-war period (especially after 1955 when the Greek state introduced the building license requirement)� These legislative measures so far did not solve the problem of informal housing in Greece. By 1995, most of the 'first generation of informal settlements' had been legalized, but the 'second informal settlement generation' process had already start-ed� Remarkable changes have also occurred in the spatial distribution of informal housing units� Whereas in the past most of the informal settlements were located in suburban areas of the great metropolitan concentrations, nowadays the majority of informal settlements are developed in distant areas of great environmental value, close to the coastal zone or in the islands� Rising living standards in large cities increased the demand for second or holiday home without a equal increase of land parcels' supply, resulting in the phenomenon of illegal housing to be transferred to areas where a wonderful natural environment was ensured� Thus, a reversal of direction for initiating the phenomenon from 'rural -urban' to 'urban -rural' is observed, but it is not eliminated from the urban areas, while in the same time the standard of living in the urban areas was improved� We can classify the factors that have led and kept the phenomenon of illegal housing in Greece in three basic categories that concern social, economic and environmental causes� One schematic presentation, the individual factors and the interaction between them we can see in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In this scheme a conceptual framework to guide the exploration of the contemporary driving forces of informal housing in Greece is proposed, the content of which will be analyzed below� All categories influence both the supply and the demand of buildable land. In turn, the importance of the interaction between supply and demand determines the individual and collective land development strategies as well as residential land use patterns. Where the supply of land, in terms of quantity and quality, is insufficient in meeting the existing demand, a likely result may be informal housing� In the following, the most important factors that influence both demand and supply of buildable land are presented and the significance of their influence on the magnitude of informal housing in Greece is assessed�</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ECONOMIC FACTORS PUBLIC POLICY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ECONOMIC FACTORS SOCIAL FACTORS D E M A N D F O R B U I L D A B L E L A N D S U P P L Y O F B U I L D A B L E L A N D I N F O R M A L H O U S I N G</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Methodology</head><p>The quantitative analysis that follows has been based on a number of socio-economic and environmental explanatory variables that draw on the conceptual framework presented before� These are described shortly� This analysis involves evaluating a stock of informal housing units in Greece that entered into the legalization process during the period from 1997 to 2006 against selective economic, social and environmental factor� 1. Τhe total population potential of each prefecture (pot)� The concept of population potential must be understood as the force or attraction which the region r would exert on region s in geographical space and shows the influence each region exerts on all other regions or in this sense, it measures the proximity of a region to other regions. For estimating the influence of population on informal housing, we use both the 'direct' or 'self' population potential (dpot) and the 'indirect' population potential (ipot)� The total population potential is a function of a prefecture's permanent population and the distances between the prefecture under investigation and the remaining prefectures and it is provided by the following formula <ref type="bibr">(Clark et al�, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr">Keeble et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Polyzos and Arampatzis, 2006</ref>): (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i n in i i i i n in i i i X X X X X X</formula><p>e e e e e class j prob class i prob</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">                    ��� 2 2 1 1 0 2 2 1 1 0 ��� � � ) ( ) ( (2) i n in i i i X X X class j prob class i prob                    ... ) ( ) ( ln 2 2 1 1 0 , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">) Med Med Med Med X X Low ILLEGAL prob Medium ILLEGAL prob LogitA                   10 10 1 1 0 ... ) ( ) ( ln , (4) High High High High X X Low ILLEGAL prob High ILLEGAL prob LogitB                   10 10 1 1 0 ... ) ( ) ( ln (5) (1)</formula><p>where: M r -a measure of the volume of population 'mass' of prefecture r; M s -a measure of the volume of population 'mass' of prefecture s, s = 1, 2…, n; d rr -the mean intra-prefectural distance of prefecture r (either in time or length units); d rs -the distance between region r and the other regions s; b -an exponent which shows the 'friction of distance' between prefecture r and prefectures� 2� Population (pop) changes in each prefecture� Increases in the local population create new demand for housing and, therefore, influence both legal and informal housing activity in each prefecture� The statistical data used for this variable derive from the NSSG (2004)� 3� The share of tertiary (ter) sector of the economy in the total production in each prefecture� Prefectures whose economy is based on the tertiary sector are expected to have higher economic growth rates compared to the remaining prefectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Polyzos and Sofios, 2008)</ref>; therefore, they would experience increased demand for housing units, because economic growth in Greece is strongly connected with building activity (Dimopoulou and zentelis, 2008)� 4� The urban population variable represents the change in urban population in each prefecture� It is the ratio of urban population in 1991 to the urban population in 2001 <ref type="bibr">(NSSG, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr">(NSSG, , 2001</ref>)� According to zelinsky's (1971) rural-urban migration theoretical suggestion, there are certain stages in migration depending on the state that a society is� One of his suggested stages involves the emergence of considerable rural-urban migration, mostly in countries with strong economic development. In this stage, the migrant flows increase considerably the demand for urban space at the expense of other uses� This may have been the case in Greece for the period shortly after the Second World War which was characterized by massive rural-urban migration movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Leontidou, 1989</ref>)� As the country gets into the developed stage, we might have the opposite phenomenon of rural-rebound where people seek dwelling in peri-urban or even rural location despite the fact that they work in cities� 5� The length of sandy beaches (sbeach) in each prefecture is a measure of the total length of the coastline and to some extent indicates the existence of suitable areas in each prefecture for building vacation and holiday houses� This factor may represent better the potential in each prefecture for tourism development� The existence of extensive scenic coastal locations is a factor of attraction for tourism investments because of the economic benefits traditionally associated with tourism. Data for this variable come from the NSSG ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>)� 6� The total area (area) added to the existing urban plans (legalized area) in each prefecture for the period 1985-2003. It is hypothesized that if the new areas that are added to the urban plans are equal to or exceed the demand for urban space, urban land in the real estate market will be of an affordable price� This is because there is a direct relationship between city growth boundaries and affordable housing� Therefore, given the availability of developable land in reasonable prices, there would hardly be scope for informal settlement construction if land price is an important determining factor of informal housing� Despite the fact that in Greece considerable experience has been possessed in applying spatial planning regulations or building permits and the existing regulations, records and registration systems offer the necessary tools to prevent informal building activity, the authorities have not been successful in keeping a balance between the demand and supply for buildable land (Dimopoulou and zentelis, 2008)� The statistical data for this factor are taken from the ministry for Environment, Planning and Public Works (YPEHODE, 2006)� 7� Legal housing per capita 1990-2000. Legal housing per capita is a measure of housing activity in each prefecture� This variable seeks to investigate whether the informal housing activity has an analogous relationship with the legal (licensed) housing activity or if they are uncorrelated� The data for this variable are taken from the NSSG (2005)� 8� Urban sprawl� The data for this variable come from the <ref type="bibr">NSSG (1990</ref><ref type="bibr">NSSG ( , 2000) )</ref> and refer to the percentage of urban land outside the existing urban plans in each prefecture for the year 2000� The indicator is the ratio of the number of buildings constructed outside the existing urban plans in a prefecture multiplied by 100 to the total number of buildings in that prefecture� This is a proxy variable for total urban sprawl in each prefecture (minetos and Polyzos, 2010)� 9� The nights spent by foreigner tourists in each prefecture (ftour) is a proxy variable to capture foreign tourism attractiveness of each prefecture� In turn, this may affect the total demand for accommodation� An additional variable is the nights spent by domestic tourists in each prefecture (dtour)� This is an indicator of domestic tourism attractiveness of each prefecture as well as of secondary and vacation housing attractiveness <ref type="bibr">(NSSG, 2001)</ref>�</p><p>In order to study the impacts of the aforementioned variables on informal housing activity, multinomial (or polytomous) logistic regression is used which is appropriate when the dependent variable is categorical and the explanatory variables are continuous, or categorical <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Norusis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lesschen et al., 2005)</ref>� multinomial Logistic Regression is useful for situations in which we want to be able to classify subjects based on values of a set of predictor variables� This type of regression is similar to logistic regression, but it is more general because the dependent variable is not restricted to two categories� The logistic regression directly estimates the probability of a certain prefecture experiencing low, medium or high illegal housing activity under the influence of a set of socio-economic and environmental factors� Thus, the technique can be used to present data of illegal housing activity and calculate the coefficients of the mathematical formula.</p><p>In this study, legalized housing units per 1,000 residents per prefecture for the period from 1997 to 2006 is taken as dependent variable in the model, using it as a proxy variable for the total illegal housing activity at the prefectural level� For a number of pragmatic reasons, actual illegal housing activity is extremely difficult to observe and count precisely� Therefore, we need an observable variable that can be safely considered as indicative of the magnitude of illegal housing activity� We set up a regression model in which one of the observed variables is a proxy for some unobserved 'true' variable� Therefore, this paper follows the alternative approach of modelling illegal housing as an unobservable variable� In order for the results to be valid, the proxy variable must have a close correlation with the inferred value� Because the legalized housing unit indicator is relatively crude, we choose the multinomial logistic model that performs well when fed with medium or even low quality data� After transforming the continuous dependent variable into categorical with three classes, two logits are formed� The model is based on the maximum likelihood estimation and not on the least-squares method as in multiple linear regression analysis� The characteristic of multinomial logistic model is that it does not assume a linear relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Norusis, 2004</ref>)� Furthermore, it does not assume homoscedasticity nor that the dependent and independent variables or the error terms are distributed normally�</p><p>The only assumptions of the model are that the observations are independent and that the independent variables are linearly related to the logits of the dependent� The benefit of using a multinomial logistic model is that it models the odds of each subcategory relative to a baseline category as a function of covariates� It can test the equality of coefficients even if confounders are different unlike in the case of pair-wise logistics where testing equality of coefficients requires assumptions about confounder effects� Several studies in land use change literature adopted this methodology� many other scientists <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(morita et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Newburn et al�, 2006)</ref> used a multinomial logit model to assess changes in land use by type in various different countries� multinomial logistic regression is also called 'baseline category', because it compares each class y with a reference category, often the first one (category i), in order to regress to the binary case� Instead of using the legalized housing units per prefecture data as a continuous variable we transform it into a categorical variable in order to account for errors, such as undetected informal housing activity in each region and other errors involved in recording the process <ref type="bibr">(Kaimowitz and Angelsen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">mahapatra and Kant, 2005)</ref>� The magnitude of legalized housing units per prefecture is used as a dependent variable� Therefore, the following categories of informal housing activities are distinguished in the dependent variable:</p><p>Low: prefectures where the value of legalized housing units per 1,000 residents ranges from zero to 2 (0 ≤ legalized housing units per 1,000 residents ≤ 2).</p><p>Medium: prefectures where the value of legalized housing units per 1,000 residents ranges 2 to 5 (2 &lt; legalized housing units per 1,000 residents &lt; 5)� High: prefectures where the value of legalized housing units per 1,000 residents is from 5 to the maximum value observed (5 ≤ legalized housing units per 1,000 residents ≤ 14.2).</p><p>The low category is the reference category� The empirical model with j categories of dependent variable can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(pot) r = (dpot) r + (ipot) r = rr r d M +   n s b

occurs. The coefficients in the logistic regression model tell us how much the logit changes based on the values of the predictor variables� The first logit expresses the log of the ratio of the probability of a prefecture being in the 'medium illegal housing' category or class compared to being in the baseline category (i�e� low informal housing activity)� Similarly, the second logit expresses the log of the ratio of the probability of being in the 'high illegal housing activity' category compared to being in the baseline category (i�e� low informal housing activity)�</p><p>The histogram of the dependent variable in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows that the distribution is not symmetric� There are two peaks on the left hand-side and also the distribution is skewed to the right having a tail towards larger 'illegal housing activity' values� That is why we constructed three categories of illegal housing activity prefectures. The first class represents the prefectures under the first peak that have smaller values of illegal housing activity� The cut point here is 2� The second category represents the prefectures under peak number two having a medium illegal housing activity� The cut-point here is 5� Finally, the last category represents the remaining prefectures of high illegal housing activity under the right tail of the distribution�</p><p>Examining the stem-and-leaf plot and the box-plot in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a) and 3(b) more information about the right tail of the distribution can be obtained� A stemplot or stem-and-leaf plot is a device for presenting quantitative data in a graphical format, similar to a histogram, to assist in visualizing the shape of a distribution and it is a useful tool in exploratory data analysis� Unlike histograms, stemplots retain the original data to at least two significant digits, and put the data in order, thereby easing the move to order-based inference and non-parametric statistics� A basic stemplot contains two columns separated by a vertical line� The left column contains the stems and the right column contains the leaves� The box plot is a graphical display that simultaneously describes several important features of a data set, such as centre, spread, departure from symmetry and identification of unusual observations or outliers� Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> presents the geographic distribution of informal housing activity for the prefectures classified in the high informal housing activity category. Most of the east coast of the country is designated as high informal housing activity area� There are also two important rings of informal housing activity. The first is located around the great metropolitan area of Athens consisting of the prefectures Euboea, Argolis and Boeotia� The other ring of informal housing activity is located around the second largest metropolitan area of Greece, the city of Thessaloniki� This ring consists of the coastal prefectures of Pieria, Imathia, Chalkidiki and Kavala as well as the hinterland prefecture of Kilkis�</p><p>The hypothesis here is that proximity to large urban concentrations results in high informal housing activity in the neighbouring prefectures� Being a coastal prefecture is also an additional significant factor of high informal housing activity.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> depicts the geographical distribution of prefectures with medium illegal housing activity� Given the mechanisms of informal housing activity cannot be observed and reliable past data are missing, it cannot be easily determined whether the prefectures on this category are at the risk of climbing to the high category of informal housing activity or at a state that any adverse effect will be less likely in the future� most of the west coast of the country as well as Peloponnese and Crete belong to this category� Finally, figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> presents the prefectures that belong to the 'low informal housing activity' category� The metropolitan areas of Athens and Thessaloniki belong to this group� In the 1960s and 1970s, these two areas used to be the hot-spots of informal housing activity in Greece� Historically, shortly after the Second World War, there was a rapid increase in migration of rural population to major Greek cities seeking employment or due to political reasons. The flows of new residents towards the cities were of such a magnitude that the state authorities were unable to cope with the demand for residential land <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Leontidou, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">maloutas, 2000)</ref>� The lack of available plots in the central areas of cities meant that the population had to be accommodated elsewhere� Nowadays, it seems that the pace of informal housing activity has lowered in the periphery of large urban concentrations� The new generations of informal settlements are not the homes of the poor, as they were in the 1960s and 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Potsiou and Ioannidis, 2006)</ref>, but the result of land speculation activity by an amalgam of actors, such as middle class individual land owners, land investors, building societies, investors in tourism infrastructure and upper and middle class owners of luxury vacation houses� This shows that the informal settlement phenomenon has been transformed from an 'obtaining a shelter' issue to an act of land speculation� </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">empirical results</head><p>The likelihood-ratio test for the overall model is shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1�</ref> This measure tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients in the logistic model are 0. Because the observed significance level is small (0.035), the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, it is concluded that the final model is significantly better than the intercept-only model� The variation in the values of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables cannot be measured directly in logistic regression models, as it can be in multiple linear regression ones with R 2 � However, the pseudo r-square statistics can provide an indication of explained variation in the values of the dependent variable, similar to the R 2 in multiple linear regression models� These approximations are presented in The null hypothesis that the model adequately fits the data can be examined by the Pearson and Deviance tests in the Goodness-of-fit part of table 1. Because the significance level is much greater that 0.05, the null hypothesis that the model does not adequately fit the data is rejected. The likelihood-ratio tests presented in table 2 evaluates the contribution of each variable to the model� It is a test for the individual coefficients and tests the hypothesis that the coefficients are 0. The -2 log-likelihood is computed for the reduced model; that is, a model without the variable. If the significance of the test is small (less than 0.05 or 0.10), then the effect contributes to the model� This test can be used instead of Wald test presented in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4�</ref> The Wald test sometimes fails to correctly reject the null hypothesis when coefficients are large. The Wald test performs well with large sample sizes. The significance values of the test for the variables 'total population potential', 'indirect population potential', 'gross domestic product in the tertiary sector', 'percentage of urban population' and 'length of sandy beaches' are lower than 0,05� Therefore, it can be concluded that they are important factors in the formation of illegal housing activity. All other variables have large values of significance (more than 0�10), meaning that they are not important factors� Finally, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are measures of how 'good' a model is compared to other models with different number of variables� The model with the smallest value of Akaike criterion or, alternatively, Bayesian criterion is better� As it can be seen, the model that includes all variables has the smallest AIC (123�139) as well as the smallest BIC (165�639)� a The chi-square statistic is the difference in -2 log-likelihoods between the final model and a reduced model. The reduced model is formed by omitting an effect from the final model. The null hypothesis is that all parameters of that effect are 0� Source: own elaboration�</p><p>The classification table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows that the model does very well in identifying the prefectures that experience high illegal housing activity. Almost 65% of them are classified correctly. In addition, the model classifies relatively well the prefectures with low informal housing activity. Approximately 56% of the prefectures are correctly assigned� The model does poorly in identifying prefectures with medium informal housing activity� </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Discussion and explanation</head><p>The parameter estimates table 4 summarizes the effect of each independent variable for the two logits. The squared ratio of the coefficients to its standard error, squared, equals the Wald statistic� Alternatively, the likelihood-ratio tests can be used for the individual logistic regression coefficients (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). The analysis starts by investigating the type, magnitude and significance of the relationship between current demographic patterns as well as development processes in Greek prefectures and the spatial distribution of informal housing� Among the explanatory variables of the model, 'total population potential' (TPP) has a negative coefficient for both logits. However, the relationship between TPP and informal housing activity is statistically significant only in the second logits� As mentioned, the TPP is an indicator of population agglomerations in each prefecture and of the total accessibility of each prefecture in relation to the other prefectures� It seems that population agglomerations do not necessarily increase the probability of a prefecture experiencing high informal housing activity� Therefore, the most heavily populated prefectures have less chances of getting informal housing activity� As the analysis of the rest of the variables shows, prefectures with large permanent population choose neighbouring prefectures for the construction of vacation or secondary housing units, which in many cases might be illegal construction� This is probably a kind of rural rebound process where urban populations construct informal settlements in rural areas� A second population-related variable is 'indirect population potential' (IPP)� Its coefficient has a positive sign and it is significant in logit 2 and not significant in logit 1� The effects of the variable are roughly similar in both categories of prefectures, as regards informal housing activity (namely medium and High)� However, the effects are more acute in the High/Low logit. With 1% rise in IPP, the likelihood of a prefecture being in the category of medium informal housing activity increases by a factor of 1�063, whereas being in the category of high informal housing activity increases by a factor of 1�202� Hence, in both categories of prefectures, improved accessibility increases the likelihood of informal housing activity� These results strengthen the initial expectation that the informal housing phenomenon has undergone significant transformations in Greece. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> indicates that two distinctive rings of informal housing activity have formed around the metropolitan areas of Athens and Thessaloniki� For further understanding the population-related effects, the variable 'population change' is examined for the 1991-2001 period. The coefficient of the variable has a positive sign for the first logit and a negative one for the second. This means that an increase in population increases the likelihood for a prefecture being in the medium informal housing category than in the low one, but decreases the likelihood of a prefecture being in high informal housing activity category� However, the level of statistical significance is not satisfactory in both logits, which does not allow drawing any firm inferences.</p><p>The coefficients of the share of the tertiary sector in the GDP show the relationship between the logits and the level of specialization in the service sector� For both logits, the coefficients are negative, but statistically different from 0 only for the second logits� These results indicate that the specialization of regional economy in the tertiary sector appears to be negatively related to high illegal housing activity� Namely, the prefectures whose economy mainly relies on the service sector do not suffer great informal housing activity, as in other study has pointed out (Dimopoulou and zentelis, 2008)�  The coefficient β of 'percentage of urban population' has positive sign in both logits, but it is not statistically different from 0 for the first logit, whereas it is statistically different for the second� This indicates that urbanization is not significantly related to the separation of the medium and low informal housing activity prefectures� However, it appears to be related to high informal housing activity prefectures� Two possible explanations of this outcome is that (a) high urbanization rates in a prefecture induce informal housing activity regarding mainly secondary housing and (b) the magnitude of urbanization influences the real estate market by increasing land prices�</p><p>The length of sandy beaches indicates the existence of suitable areas in each prefecture for building vacation and holiday houses. The positive and significant parameter estimate in High/Low logit denotes that there is a positive relationship between natural amenities and informal housing activity� This is reasonable since as the length of sandy beaches increases so does the relative attractiveness of an area for secondary and vacation housing� As regards the medium/Low logit, though the relationship is positive, it seems that there does not exist a strong association�</p><p>The total land surface added into the existing urban plans for the period 1985-2003 is a measure of the available developable land. For the first logit, the null hypothesis that the coefficient is the zero can not be rejected because of the high significance arising from the p-values testing� However, in the second logit, the significance level is below 0.05. This indicates that probability of a prefecture being in the high informal housing category increases by a factor of 1.58 with 1% increase in the legalized area per 100 residents�</p><p>From the observed significance index for both logits, the variable of 'new legal housing areas per resident' does not appear to be related to the medium or high level of informal housing activity in relation to the low level because its coefficients are not significantly different from zero. In other words, the construction of new building units for residential use does not seem to halt (or fuel) the phenomenon of informal housing activity� Urban sprawl shows a positive relationship with the dependent variable in both groups of prefectures. The parameter estimate is not statistically significant in the first logit; it is significant in the second at approximately 10% level of significance. This result leads to the conclusion that in prefectures of 'high informal housing activity' there is an association between the response and the estimated variable� Urban sprawl brings basic infrastructure to ex-urban areas that may attract informal housing� Foreign tourism shows a negative association with informal housing in both logits. However, the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the variable is significantly different from zero cannot be rejected due to the observed significance index� Even though we cannot be sure whether there is a negative relation in place or no relation at all, we can say that foreign tourism activity does not seem to produce informal housing activity� A possible explanation of this result relies on the fact that, as the statistical data shows, foreigner tourists usual accommodate in hotels, while domestic tourists use rented rooms, furnished suites etc� Furthermore, the majority of foreigner tourism, that is characterized as mass tourism, is concentrated in some prefectures (Crete, Rhodes, Corfu), in contrast to domestic tourism that is expanded in the whole country <ref type="bibr">(NSSG, 1996)</ref>� On the other hand, the domestic tourism variable has a positive relationship with informal housing in both logits, although it is statistically significant only in the second logit at approximately 11% in significance index. The positive relationship can be interpreted that, unlike foreign tourism, the domestic tourism activity fuels illegal housing, because regions that are attractive to domestic tourists are also attractive to illegal housing if this housing mainly concerns vacation and secondary units� This is further justified when bearing in mind that the prefectures of 'high informal housing activity' are situating close to great metropolitan areas and, therefore, they have large indirect population potential� Following, a further analysis and evaluation of the results concerning some specific variables are carried out in order that more complex or hidden associations can be uncovered� Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>(a) shows the box plots of the overnight stays of domestic tourists per resident in relation to the magnitude of informal housing in each prefecture� A box plot displays the three quartiles, the minimum and the maximum of the data on a rectangular box� The box encloses the quartile range with the lower edge at the first quartile, and the upper edge at the third quartile. A line is drawn through the box at the second quartile, which is the 50th percentile or the median� A line extends from each end of the box� The lower whisker is a line from the first quartile to the smallest data point within 1.5 interquartile ranges from, the first quartile. The upper whisker is a line from the third quartile to the largest data point within 1�5 interquartile ranges from the third quartile� The box plots are panelled by the variable 'length of sandy beaches', which has two categories, the first being non coastal areas or areas with small total length of sandy beaches and the second encompassing the areas with large stretches of sandy beaches� The medians of the 'per resident overnight stays by domestic holidaymakers' in non-coastal areas or areas with small sandy beach stretches are around 1, regardless if the area has low, medium or high informal housing activity� However, in prefectures possessing extensive sandy beaches as the number of the 'per resident overnight stays by domestic holidaymakers' increases so does the magnitude of informal housing� Therefore, increased informal housing activity is more likely in coastal or insular areas� Fig� 5� Hidden associations Source: own elaboration Following, a line chart will be made, in order to depict the relationship between 'urban sprawl' and 'indirect population potential', since a line chart works well as a visual summery of categorical values� Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>(b) presents a line chart of that relation, which is panelled by the variable IPP. In particular, the prefectures have been classified in three groups in terms of IPP. The first group includes 15 prefectures and refers to areas with low population potential� The second group refers to areas of medium population potential and consists of 24 prefectures� Finally, the third group incorporates the remaining 12 prefectures of high population potential. Τhe first sub-chart indicates that in remote areas with low population potential there is not a clear (positive or negative) relationship between urban sprawl and informal housing� Therefore, in these areas urban sprawl may represent legal construction activity for housing or other purposes� However, in the other two line sub-charts, a positive relationship appears between the two variables. More specifically, the second and third sub-charts which represent areas with medium and high population potential indicate that informal housing is positively connected to urban sprawl� Furthermore, the magnitude of informal housing activity is larger in medium population potential areas than in high ones as the pace of urban sprawl increases� This also indicates that the initial process of constructing informal housing units in the periphery of large cities during the 1960s and 1970s firstly moved to the neighbouring prefectures and at a second stage diffused further to the prefectures which are at a distance of about 100-150 km from Athens and Thessaloniki.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> is an interactive graph consisting of the scatter plot between informal housing activity and urban plan expansion (in km 2 ) per 100 residents and the box plots of each of the three categories of informal housing� It has been constructed in order to investigate the relationship between informal housing activity and the state policy of expanding the existing urban plans of large and medium size towns and cities in Greece during the period from 1985 to 2003� Fig� 6� The relationship between informal housing activity and the urban land policy in Greece Source: own elaboration Some obvious differences are immediately apparent� This indicates that as the supply of urban land by the state increases through the incorporation of new areas into the existing urban plans, so does informal housing activity� This seems odd because the provision of new developable land we would expect to lower the pace of informal housing activity� A possible explanation to the above pattern is that the state land planning policy follows informal building activity by legalizing areas of informal housing sporadically without making provisions for creating the necessary 'urban land stock' in each prefecture in time, so that everyone can find land parcels in an affordable price�</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ConCLUsIons</head><p>Several conclusions can be drawn on the basis of the empirical analysis presented in this paper� First, informal settlements in Greece seem to be different from those in the countries of the Third World as reported by the relevant international literature� The geographic distribution of illegal housing has changed� Whereas in the past, most informal settlements were located in peri-urban areas close to the major urban centres of the country, nowadays their majority develops in distant areas with large indirect population potential, great environmental value, close to the coastal zone or in islands� Secondly, in spite of the numerous legislative reforms, informal housing continues to develop� For instance, the legalization initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s added considerable land into the existing urban plans and solved pressuring social and environmental problems� However, all these legalizative initiatives as well as the updating and restructuring of building-related procedures and the reform of land use planning policy did not succeed to tackle the problem� In most cases, state intervention regarding the integration of new space into the existing urban plans virtually followed the informal housing process instead of the other way around� Hence, the increase in urban space did not precede but followed the demand already met by the process of illegal housing�</p><p>In Greece, the problem of informal settlements that lasts for over eighty years is tightly connected with adopted unrealistic regulations and centralized and mainly bureaucratic procedures in land management� As a result informal housing activity had taken place in all the prefectures, both within planned and non-planned areas, while the intense of the phenomenon is influenced by the determinant factors that have been analyzed in this work� Informal housing in Greece has different characteristics than in other poorer countries, where this building activity is connected with very poor people, and the specific features of Greek informal buildings differ from what has been found elsewhere� So, it is difficult to be interpreted in the frame of the existence approaches that have been analyzed previously�</p><p>In conclusion, the general lesson learned from the above analysis is that informal housing in Greece is a problem coming from the status quo in land market and an irrational situation in land management issues� The state has a responsibility for the applied urban and environmental policy, the illegal housing development and the lack of a central intervention in order to deal with planning development� It should make efforts to improve the situation in land markets through a better land administration system� Containing or eliminating informal housing activity presupposes the formulation of a sustainable, integrated land use policy and the establishment of effective regional and urban land use planning mechanisms� Major issues that need to be tackled include the complex and insufficient legal framework, the inappropriate planning and land use allocation provisions and procedures, the shortage of available well planned and organised land for vacation housing, insufficient control mechanisms, low political will and commitment, and land speculation� reFerenCes <ref type="bibr">ABBOTT, J� and DOUGLAS, D� (2003)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">HALL, P� and HAY, D� (1980)</ref>, Growth Centres in the European Urban System, London: Heineman� KAImOWITz, <ref type="bibr">D� and ANGELSEN, A� (1998)</ref>, Economic Models of Tropical Deforestation:</p><p>A Review, Jakarta: Centre for International Forestry Research� KAPOOR, m� and BLANC, <ref type="bibr">D� (2008)</ref>, 'measuring Risk on Investment in Informal (Illegal)</p><p>Housing: Theory and Evidence from Pune, India', Regional Science and Urban Economics, 38 (4), pp. 311-329.
