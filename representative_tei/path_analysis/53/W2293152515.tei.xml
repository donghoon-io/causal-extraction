<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Workplace stress is a major issue for both employees and organization. It is a common term used in our life with most people having different understanding about its meaning. Despite different understanding of its meaning, it is a mind-body-environment relationship. <ref type="bibr">Selye (1987, p. 17)</ref> for example, described stress as a "non-specific response of the body to any demand placed upon it." The term 'non-specific' was later refined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chrousos and Gold (1992)</ref> and limited to stress syndrome occurring when stressors are pushed above their threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Marketon and Glaser, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Glazer and Gyurak (2008)</ref> noted that the terms stress, stressor and strain are often used interchangeably but rather erroneously in the extant literature. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Selye (1987)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marketon and Glaser's (2008)</ref> descriptions of stress imply the origin of the word as a subject from the concept of resistant in physics which was extended to the field of psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Michael et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Leung et al. (2012)</ref> further clarified that stress is a psychological state of mind resulting from demands put on a person's body. From the medical point of view, stress has often been proven to be detrimental to health <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kozusznik et al., 2012)</ref>. Perhaps one of the explanations for the inverse relationship between stress and health is that stress deregulates immune function which may lead to activation of cancer cells and latent herpes viruses, delayed wound healing and impaired vaccine responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Marketon &amp; Glaser, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Although the above snapshot on stress carries a negative connotation, stress is multifaceted and at times brings out goodness <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Farler and Broady-Preston, 2012)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kozusznik et al. (2012)</ref>, the word stress in Chinese encompasses two characters which represent "crisis" and "opportunity." In the extant literature stress has similarly been seen as having two implications; eustress and distress conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Selye, 1964</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Selye, , 1987;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ismail et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Yu-Fei (Melissa) et al., 2012)</ref>. Eustress refers to the positive feeling which arises from a stressful condition while distress relates to threats and harmful effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kozusznik et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Code and Langan-Fox (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mayer (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ismail et al. (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gachter et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">), Yu-Fei et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Leung et al. (2012)</ref> argued that eustress may occur when individuals are able to handle external demands placed on their physique which may lead to decreased physiological and psychological stress (e.g. pleasant life, able to control feelings of anxiety and being proactive). Distress on the contrary may exist when individuals cannot cope with external demands placed on their bodies and end up with increased physiological and psychological stress (e.g. sickness, unpleasant life, unable to control feelings of anxiety, and passive).</p><p>In the field of management, workplace stress has come to the core of research as the costs to organizations and employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Arshadi and Damiri, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Webster et al., 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Farler and Broady-Preston (2012)</ref> suggested that a workplace is a community of its own, hence employees derive their sense of identity and belongingness from it. Stress in the workplace would therefore affect employees significantly and ultimately the performance of the entire organization would also be at stake <ref type="bibr">(Ahmad Ezane et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The commonly cited implications of workplace stress include low job performance and high turnover intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Arshadi and Damiri, 2013)</ref>, lack of motivation and ill health <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Farler and Broady-Preston, 2012)</ref> as well as burnout (Ahmad <ref type="bibr">Ezane et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Keshavarz and Mohammadi (2011)</ref> added low morale, poor product quality, low output, increased overtime payment, and organizational sabotage to the list of negative effects of workplace stress. In Great Britain, job-related stress has translated into an annual loss of 28 million work days <ref type="bibr">(Devonish et al., 2012)</ref>, while in the USA it has resulted in absenteeism and turnover with the monetary cost surpassing a billion US Dollar per year <ref type="bibr">(Kouvonen and Coyne, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Workplace stress is often viewed as the result of the interaction between the individual and his/her environment <ref type="bibr">(Brown and Uehara, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ismail et al., , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Keshavarz and Mohammadi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Santos et al., 2010)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lazuras et al. (2009)</ref>, three main sources of workplace stress (stressors) are: relationship with work colleagues, organizational constraints and workload. In their case study of library staff, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Farler and Broady-Preston (2012)</ref> similarly outlined routine and repetitive job tasks and lack of control over one's job and library patrons (customers) as the causes of stress among library staff studied. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Glazer and Gyurak's (2008)</ref> classification of job stressors, the above mentioned factors can be termed as psychosocial stressors and job role stressors. Apart from psychosocial stressors, there are physical stressors (e.g. noise and heat) as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Glazer and Gyurak, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Stress has two major dimensions: physiological stress and psychological stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(AbuAlRub, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beehr and Glazer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Larson, 2004)</ref>. Physiological stress is normally related to as a physiological reaction of the body (such as headache, migraine, abdominal pain, lethargic, backache, chest pain, fatigue, heart palpitation, sleep disturbance and muscle ache) to various stressful triggers at the workplace that directly and negatively affects an individual's productivity, effectiveness, quality of work and personal health <ref type="bibr">(Ismail et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ismail et al., , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Newell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2005)</ref>. Some examples of physiological stress are: changes in eating, drinking, sleeping and smoking habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beehr et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beehr and Glazer, 2005)</ref>. Psychological stress is often seen as an emotional reaction (such as anxiety and depression burnout, job alienation, hostility, depression, tension, anger, nervousness, irritability and frustration) experienced by an individual as a result from the stimulate at the workplace <ref type="bibr">(Ismail et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ismail et al., , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Millward, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Haines III and Saba (2012)</ref> suggested that psychological stress is associated with one's role identity. A person typically has multiple role identities (an employee, a husband, a son, etc.) The higher the value a person and his/her society associate with each role, the more the cost of not performing the role would be. An engineer who is denied the opportunity to exercise his professional role, for instance, may experience a psychological stress which is exhibited in mental exhaustion. Similarly, an employee who is deprived of the support due for his professional Azman I., Noorshafine S., Yusof I., Ainon J. Abu S., Rizal Abu B., Norish Norsiah A. identity may also experience psychological stress <ref type="bibr">(Haines II and Saba, 2012)</ref> In terms of eustress, workplace stress will usually occur when employees' knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes can cope with or match their work demands and pressures in organizations. In this situation, it may increase the ability of employees to manage their physiological and psychological stresses in order to fulfill job demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Adler et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wetzel et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2005)</ref>. Mesmer-Magnus, Glew and Viswesvaran (2012) suggested that positive humor in the workplace by both employee and employer can also help in buffering the effect of stress and improving work performance.</p><p>Conversely, in distress, workplace stress will often exhibit when employees' knowledge, skills, abilities and attitudes cannot cope with or do not match their work demands and pressures in organizations. Consequently, it may decrease the ability of employees to control and manage physiological and psychological stress, such as upsetting their self-regulatory bodies, and not able to meet their duties and responsibilities as a member of an organization and a good citizen of a country <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Basowitz et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Keshavarz and Mohammadi, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, extant studies in the workplace stress show that the levels of physiological and psychological stress may have a significant impact on individual outcomes, especially job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hsieh et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wetzel et al., 2006)</ref>. According to many scholars like <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">McShane and Von Glinow (2005)</ref>, Kreitner and Kinicki (2012) most organizations have to deal with job performance of their employees. Job performance means assessing individual performance, individual records or subjective evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Chockalingam, 2011)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fein (2009)</ref>, identifying specific job relevant and task behaviors actually is not a new concept in job performance in general management studies. In the past, job performance was also discussed as a specific job outcomes that link to individual work behavior. There is not a single consistent or concise definition of job performance. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Barrick and Mount (1991)</ref>, it is in the relation of "Big Five" personality dimensions: extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hunter (1986)</ref> claimed that the cognitive ability can predict job performance.</p><p>Nowadays, the ability to perform work without stress has rapidly become one of the key issues for management and their organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Homayan et al., 2013)</ref>. They pointed out that most job demand are stressful; hence, there exists a relationship between job stress and performance (task and contextual).</p><p>In a workplace stress model, several scholars believe that the ability of employees to properly control and manage their physiological and psychological stress in executing job may lead to higher job performance in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Adler et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hourani et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wetzel et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Zhong et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Within an organizational stress model, many scholars concur that physiological stress, psychological stress and job performance are distinct concepts, but strongly interconnected. For example, the ability of employees to properly manage their physiological and psychological stresses in executing job may lead to an enhanced job performance in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bar-On, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gillespie et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Spector and Goh, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Although the nature of this relationship is interesting, the role of physiological and psychological stresses as important predictors is inadequately explained in the workplace stress models <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Slaski and</ref><ref type="bibr">Cartwright, 2002, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Nikolau and Tsaosis, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Many scholars argue that the role of physiological and psychological stresses as an important predictor is given less empirical attention in the previous studies. Past studies have been descriptive, describing the global workplace stress concept, explaining the general physiological and psychological features, employing a meta-analysis method to establish the link between physiological and psychological stresses and employee behavior, but ignoring to quantify the magnitude and nature of the relationship between workplace stress and job performance.</p><p>Consequently, the results of this study have not Effect of workplace stress on job performance provided adequate recommendations to practitioners in designing and administering workplace stress programs in growth and competitive organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Johnston et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kazi and Haslam, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Farquharson et al., 2013)</ref>. Hence, this dearth encourages the researchers to further explore the relationship between physiological and psychological stresses and employee behavior, specifically job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</head><p>This study has twofold objectives: first, to examine the relationship between physiological stress and job performance and second, to examine the relationship between psychological stress and job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>Relationship between workplace stress and employee performance is consistent with the notion of workplace stress model. For example, <ref type="bibr">Karasek's (1979)</ref> job demand control model explains that high job demands and levels of control or decision making at work may reinforce high risk of individuals' physiological and psychological stresses <ref type="bibr">(Kain and Jex, 2010)</ref>. Further, Edward's (1998) P-E fit theory suggests that a lack of fit between job demands and resources may induce two forms of strains, physiology (e.g. raised blood pressure, raised serum cholesterol, and lowered immunity) and psychology (e.g., sleep disturbances, anxiety, panic attacks, dysphoria, and restlessness).</p><p>The notion of these theories has gained strong support from the workplace stress research literature. For example, several extant studies about workplace stress were conducted using different samples such as: perceptions of 213 employees at six geographic Logistics Centers within a medium-sized Fortune 500 company in the Southeastern United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cincotta, 2005)</ref>; perceptions of 333 nurses from four hospitals in Kampala, Uganda <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Nabirye et al., 2011)</ref>; 304 call center employees in the UK <ref type="bibr">(Kazi and Haslam, 2013)</ref>; perceptions of 100 nurses from a large general teaching hospital in Scotland <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Farquharson et al., 2013)</ref>; and perceptions of 254 nurses over three nursing shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Johnston et al., 2013)</ref>. These studies advocated that high levels of physiological and psychological stresses had decreased employees' competencies in managing, regulating and controlling their job demands and this condition could lead to decreased job performance in the respective organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cincotta, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Farquharson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Johnston et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kazi and Haslam, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nabirye et al., 2011)</ref>. Based on the literature, it can be hypothesized that: H1: Physiological stress is positively related to job performance. H2: Psychological stress is positively related to job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Research Design</head><p>A cross-sectional research design was employed in this study because it allowed the researchers to combine the workplace stress research literature and the actual survey as a main procedure to collect data for this study. Hence, a back translation technique was employed to translate the content of questionnaire into Malay and English in order to increase the validity and reliability of the instrument. Using this method may help to increase the ability to gather accurate, less bias and high quality data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cresswell, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Sekaran and Bougie, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wright, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>This study was conducted in a leading private investment bank in Peninsular Malaysia. The name of this organization is kept anonymous because of confidential reasons. It was incorporated in early 2000's as a public limited company and its main function is to be the preeminent provider of investment banking services. As a business entity, this company has restructured its organization and expanded its operation in investment, broking and fund management in order to be a major provider of financial market services. This change has increased employee stress because they have to carry out many challenging tasks, working long Azman I., Noorshafine S., Yusof I., Ainon J. Abu S., Rizal Abu B., Norish Norsiah A. hours and being unable to take leave in order to meet key performance indicators. As a result, this phenomenon may lead to decreased competency of employees in performing daily job. This curiosity motivates the researchers to discover the nature of the relationship in this organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Measures</head><p>The survey questionnaire has two major sections: physiological stress (PHST) had 3 items and psychological stress (PSST) had 4 items that were adapted from workplace stress literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beehr et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cox et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Johnston et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kazi and Haslam, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Farquharson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Newell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Seaward, 2005)</ref>. The dimensions used to measure physiological stress are nervous system and endocrine system, while the dimensions used to measure psychological stress are psychological strain and cognitive appraisal.</p><p>Finally, job performance (JPN) had 8 items that were adapted from job performance literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(AbuAlRub, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Adler et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beehr et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hourani et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hsieh et al., 2004)</ref>. The dimensions used to measure job performance are confidence, offer help, communication, problem solving, adaptability, responsive, and work appearance. All items used in the questionnaires were measured using a 7-item scale ranging from "strongly never/strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly always/strongly agree" (5). Demographic variables were used as controlling variables because this study focused on employee attitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Sample</head><p>The unit of analysis for this study is employees who have worked in the organization. In the first step of data collection, the researchers met the head of the organization in order to obtain his permission to conduct this study and also obtain his opinion about the rules for distributing survey questionnaire in his organization. Taking into consideration the organization's rule and the researcher constraints in terms of length of study and budget, 200 survey questionnaires were distributed to executive and non-executive employees in seven departments, using a convenient sampling technique.</p><p>This sampling technique was employed because the organization could not provide the researchers with the list of registered employees for confidential reasons. Due to this constraint, the researchers could not employ random sampling among prospective participants in the organization. Out of the total distribution, 132 useable questionnaires were returned to the researchers, yielding a 66 percent response rate. The survey questionnaires were answered by participants voluntarily.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The findings of this study confirm that physiological and psychological stresses act as an important predictor of job performance. In the context of this study, management has designed and determined challenging jobs for all employees in order to sustain and achieve its organizational strategy and goals. According to the majority of respondents, the levels of physiological stress, psychological stress, and job performance are high. This situation explains that the ability of employees to appropriately manage, regulate and control physiological and psychological stresses in executing job may lead to an enhanced job performance in the organization.</p><p>This study provides three important implications: theoretical contribution, robustness of research methodology, and practical contribution. In terms of theoretical contribution, the results of this study confirm that workplace stress has been an important predictor of job performance in the studied organization. This result also has supported and extended studies by Cincotta ( <ref type="formula">2005</ref> In terms of practical contributions, the findings of this study can be used as guidelines by practitioners to manage, regulate and control workplace stress problems in organizations. This objective may be achieved if management considers the following suggestions: firstly, management should require employees to attend stress management workshops in order to create awareness and enhance competencies in recognizing, using and managing stress. Secondly, management should involve employees in obtaining input in redesigning jobs that take into account stress potentials. Thirdly, organizational management may want to introduce a system of internal coaching and mentoring in order to motivate senior employees and supervisors to guide junior and inexperienced employees in planning and executing job. Proper emolument to senior employees should also be considered.</p><p>Fourth, organizational leadership should plan and implement regular work-life balance initiatives, such as sport and family day in order to reduce the intrusion of uncontrollable work problems in employees' private and family lives. Alternatively, a free or subsidized gymnasium annual membership should also be pro-Azman I., Noorshafine S., Yusof I., Ainon J. Abu S., Rizal Abu B., Norish Norsiah A.</p><p>vided to employees. Finally, the management may desire to consider reminding its organizational members to return to methods approved by their respective religions that are believed to provide tranquility and relaxation. The last suggestion has the potential to provide 'value' to both employer and employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>This study tested a conceptual framework based on the workplace stress research literature. The results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the instrument used in this study met the acceptable standards of validity and reliability analyses. The outcomes of SmartPLS path model analysis revealed that physiological and psychological stress were essential predictors of job performance in the studied organization. This finding has also supported and broadened the workplace stress studies mostly published in Western countries.</p><p>Therefore, current research and practice within workplace stress needs to consider physiological and psychological stresses as crucial components of the workplace stress domain.</p><p>This study further suggests that the competency of employees to appropriately manage, regulate and control physiological and psychological stresses in executing job will strongly increase the ir positive attitudes and behavior (e.g. satisfaction, commitment, health and pro social behavior). Further, these positive individual outcomes may lead to sustainable organizational competitiveness in an increasingly global economy.</p><p>Despite the fact that the results of the current study find support from existing literature, future research should consider its limitations of conceptual framework and methodology. One of the limitations of the current study is relatively moderate response rate (66 percent). By selectively contacting the respondents who have not responded the study, the researchers will be able to learn about the reasons for non-response and form an opinion whether this group has been under-represented in the sample. Next, while the current model investigated relatedness among the contributors to employee health, they did not explain the degree of their respective contributions towards the dependent variable.</p><p>Future research in this area may be strengthened by ensuring that respondents are well represented in the sample. In fact, under-representation maybe overcome by approaching more similar institutions and appointing representatives to help remind colleagues to complete and submit their completed instrument.</p><p>It is also feasible to make arrangement with the current organizations for longitudinal study. This approach will help confirm, among others, the reliability of results of the first and previous surveys. Using causal model would be the next logical step for correlations study. When this study has established valid statistical relationships among major variables, the latter qualify for testing on causality.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 5</head><label>5</label><figDesc>Figure 5.1. shows the outcomes of testing PLS path model.
