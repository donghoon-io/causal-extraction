<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The implementation of a teacher's teaching duties in teaching is influenced by several aspects, including the supervision of the principal, the teacher's work motivation and the teacher's attitude to work. The results of the researcher's review of several previous studies stated that motivation had an effect on work attitudes. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Wachidah, 2019)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Dewi, 2015)</ref> which states that work motivation has a positive and significant correlation to work attitudes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Nurfadilah &amp; Farihah, 2021</ref>) mentions one of the factors that influence employee performance, namely the motivation factor, where motivation is a condition that moves a person to try to achieve goals or achieve desired results. The contribution or influence of the principal's supervision and the teacher's attitude on the job towards the implementation of the teacher's teaching duties was expressed by stating that there was a positive and significant contribution between the principal's supervision and the teacher's attitude on the job towards the implementation of the teacher's teaching duties. Indonesian teachers always appear professionally with the main task of educating, teaching, guiding, directing, training, assessing and evaluating students in early childhood education through formal education, basic education, and secondary education. Indonesian teachers have high reliability as the main resource for realizing the goals of national education, namely the development of the potential of students to become human beings who believe and fear God Almighty, have noble character, are healthy, knowledgeable, capable, creative, independent, and become citizens. a democratic and responsible state. Indonesian teachers are responsible for delivering their students to reach maturity as future leaders of the nation in all areas of life. The role of the teacher is increasingly important in the global era. Only through the guidance of professional teachers, each student can become a qualified, competitive and productive human resource as a national asset in the face of increasingly fierce and tough competition now and in the future. Indonesian teachers in their position as professionals function to increase the dignity and the implementation of the teaching duties of teachers serves to improve the quality of national education. The teacher's attitude towards work is a teacher's belief in the work he carries, which is accompanied by certain feelings, and provides the basis for the teacher to make a response or behave in a certain way according to his choice. The teacher's attitude towards work affects the teacher's actions in carrying out their work activities. If a teacher has a positive attitude towards his work, then of course the teacher will carry out his functions and position as teaching staff and educators in schools with a full sense of responsibility. And vice versa, a teacher who has a negative attitude towards his work, he must only carry out his function and position as a mere routine. For this reason, it is very necessary to instill a positive attitude of teachers towards work, considering the role of teachers in the educational environment, in this case schools, is very important <ref type="bibr">(Rivai &amp; Murni, 2010)</ref>. One of the principal's roles in leading educational institutions is to supervise. Supervision comes from the words super and vision, super means above or higher and vision means to see, so supervision is an activity above to see, while supervisor is a person who supervises. Supervision carried out in schools is academic supervision. <ref type="bibr">(Glickman, Manggar (2010)</ref> defines academic supervision as a series of activities to help teachers develop their ability to manage the learning process in order to achieve learning goals. Academic supervision is an effort to help teachers develop their abilities to achieve learning goals. The principal's role as supervisor is to lead friends profession in schools to help develop abilities to achieve learning goals. The teacher becomes an educator because of the motivation to educate. If he does not have motivation then he will not succeed in educating/teaching or if he teaches because he has to. The success of the teacher in teaching because of this encouragement/motivation is a sign that what the teacher has done has touched his needs. Teaching activities carried out by teachers who are interested in them because their needs are not in accordance with their own interests. Teachers who are motivated at work will lead to a positive attitude towards their work and the needs of teachers who are met will also encourage the implementation of the teaching duties of teachers in their schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>This research is a correlational descriptive research, which is a research that aims to describe and analyze direct and indirect correlations. The population in this study were all 97 public junior high school teachers in Bati-Bati District, Tanah Laut Regency. A sample of 78 people, the method of determining sample members was taken using the Proportional Random Sampling technique. Data were collected through teacher performance appraisal assessment instruments, principal supervision instruments were measured through learning program planning, implementation of learning programs and follow-up to learning program results, teacher work motivation instruments were measured through responsibility, work performance, opportunities for advancement, recognition of performance, and challenging work, the instrument of the teacher's attitude on the job is measured through cognitive, affective and conative, and the instrument of the implementation of the teacher's teaching task is measured through planning teaching, implementing teaching and conducting evaluations. The instrument was analyzed by means of testing the validity and reliability of the description of the collected data using path analysis to see direct and indirect correlations, by first testing normality, linearity, and homogeneity. A total of four questionnaires were used in this study, namely the principal's supervision questionnaire, the teacher's work motivation, the teacher's attitude to work and the implementation of the teacher's teaching task. Data collection was carried out using an instrument consisting of 25 items of principal supervision (learning program planning, implementation of learning programs and follow-up to learning program results), 28 items of teacher work motivation (responsibility, work performance, opportunities for advancement, recognition of performance, and challenging work), teacher attitudes on work 41 items (cognitive, affective and conative) and implementation of teacher teaching tasks 43 items (planning teaching, implementing teaching and conducting evaluations). Before the instrument is used, the instrument is tested first. The data from the experimental results were analyzed to determine the validity and reliability. This study uses quantitative research that is intended to determine the correlation between principal supervision, teacher work motivation, and teacher attitudes on work towards the implementation of teaching tasks for State Junior High School teachers in Bati-Bati District, Tanah Laut Regency.</p></div>
