<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The bread the of internet use up on smartphones has resulted in buying and selling activities on the internet, which can even be done only with a smartphone. However, the rise of food purchases online is certainly not apart from the perceived benefits and the customer worries about the risk that will be faced. Trust becomes an important factor in the intention of buying food. Trust is expected to be higher when the perceived value is a higher and low perceived risk. This study aims to uncover the influence of perceived value and perceived risk to the trust and how the implications for buying intention. Using path analysis it is revealed that trust is the relationship between perceived value and buying intention, perceived value cannot be in the way of buying intention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the last decade of Internet use in Indonesia is remarkable, ranging from a young age to adulthood and even the elderly, the internet is used in job operations (many companies start to reduce the use of paper and transferred to the Internet) to penetrate the business world. Internet access that can be done using mobile phones increasingly easier for users to surf in cyberspace using the only mobile phone (currently more appropriate use term smartphone). Therefore, smartphone users can easily search for information about the promotion of products offered by the companies only by using their phones. Even bookings are also made using the smartphone. It is very likely to happen when supported by the ability of smartphone users to understand the use of the mobile phone for information retrieval on the Internet, or in short, it can be said the extent of literate users Technology affects their conduct in online spending (over the internet).</p><p>However, the decision to buy products through the Internet requires careful consideration, so considering sellers and buyers in addition to not meeting directly also the products offered are also only images, cannot be viewed directly held or even attempted. Purchase online where the buyer cannot see directly the goods ordered, trust is required by the consumer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Consumers should get a or some information that makes it believe. In addition to the belief he should also be good at considering the risk, for online purchases is considered more risky <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Then the consumer will make perception of the risks that will likely occur. Therefore, it requires consideration and trust of prospective buyers. Trust will increase if what is perceived by consumers to goods and services by reality, so consumers are interested to make a purchase.</p><p>As for the perception of risk that will be experienced, large or not risk will affect the consumer confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, otherwise, trust may also affect the perception of risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Trust and risk perception will ultimately affect the interest of the purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that interest is a factor affecting behavior.Interest shows the willpower or extent of a person's efforts on a behavior. Internet purchase is a precedent of a person's attitude or perception of the Internet purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In Indonesia today sales and online purchases have become a phenomenon in the business world, communication between consumers and sellers became easy to do although both sides were in a place far apart, Its breath to ownership and use of smartphones strongly supports this online trading phenomenon. It is no exception in Palembang city. Palembang, which is the largest and most populated city in South Sumatera province, is sure to have the largest smartphone user community, and also the most Internet users by smartphone.</p><p>There are several types of trading through the Internet that can be used by the community in this city among others is the sale of food, clothing, goods, transportation as well as ticket ordering. Online Food sales are already an alternative used by people in this city. This online food booking allows the timer not to bother out to find food, making the bookers More efficient in time utilization. After ordering meals, the customer will be contacted by a prospective introduction regarding the suitability of the food and the place (food vendor) ordered and the confirmation of the food delivery location.</p><p>The community argues that the presence of this online service and inter-food services can be very useful, because it provides benefits for the form of time saving, cost, power up to the utilization of smart phones more optimum.Logically, it can be said that the presence of the message service and interfood Online provides value to the community of its users.As said by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>Value refers to the cheap price that the consumer has to pay, and what the consumer has sacrificed equal to that earned.So logically it can be said that the higher the perception towards the benefits received then the higher the interest to buy. Therefore, consumer sacrifice can indicate the value that consumers receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, online messaging and food providers in Palembang are Gojek and Grab. Gojek's service using Go Food features, is currently Grab using the Food feature. The second service methods and phases can be said to be the same, and the two are competing strictly in the city's online food messaging industry. But the concern is not competition between the two but in this study will predict the behavior of food buyers online regardless of who the service provider is.</p><p>Since these services mostly involve online service providers and their co-workers (motorcyclists regarding contracts with companies) then the service factor will be highly noticed by consumers. Information received by consumers related to the service constitutes a perception the quality of the online service. Considering all the variables described in the online food purchase phenomenon experienced by consumers in Palembang, then this research will see how interest in purchasing food products online are influenced by some Factors such as consumer attitude, confidence factor and risk and perception of service quality.</p><p>The explanation above raises several questions that need to be sought by the answer, namely how to influence the perception of consumer value, Trust and risk perception to the buying interest of consumers Partial, could trust can be a mediator on the influence of consumer value perception to the buying interest of consumers as well as whether consumer confidence can be a mediator on the influence of risk perception to the buying interest of consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>The explanation above raises several questions that need to be sought by the answer, namely how to influence the perception of consumer value, Trust and risk perception to the buying interest of consumers Partial, could trust can be a mediator on the influence of consumer value perception to the buying interest of consumers as well as whether consumer confidence can be a mediator on the influence of risk perception to the buying interest of consumers. The consumption made by the consumer is initiated by the need arising and creates demand. Along with the development of thought, ideas, science, and technology need evolving into a desire. This desire is very dynamic, tastes have always undergone a change from time to time. Therefore, the benefits of the products expected by consumers are also changing and dynamic, consequently, the demand also becomes diverse. The role of value is crucial for consumers to determine their request.According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>value is a benefit received by consumers as opposed to the payout (sacrifice), or trade-off between give and get <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>argues is a quality that can be:</p><p>-Value is the price that (first time being sacrificed), quality is number two -Value is the price of cheap goods from a quality brand -Value equals quality Therefore, consumers will assess or argue how the value is received compared to its sacrifice <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Thus the consumer's perception of the value he will acquire will affect his interest in making a purchase. This relationship can be made in hypotheses namely:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Perceived Value positively and significantly affects buying intention</head><p>Trust is needed in an uncertain condition in the relationship between human beings and on the most economic conditions that are to be achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . In the business world the Trust is enormous influence for a consumer to trust a seller or seller company, so this is a considerable concern in the relationship between sellers with consumers/B2C or business to Consumer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Therefore, it can logically be said that the perception of value can affect consumer confidence so that it can also be made hypothesized:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: The perceived value affects trust positively and significantly</head><p>Risk is interpreted as a willingness to rely on or submit to a trusted partner to address the changes that <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, In that sense, it is logically confident that there is also a consumer to the seller.In the relationship between buyers and sellers of trust factors are closely related to the risks, both can influence each other.According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>between the belief and risk perception is negatively related, with the sense that when consumers assume a high risk in a purchase, the trust will be reduced, as otherwise. Both of these phenomena need proof, thus the hypothesis that can be made is:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: Perceived riskaffects negatively and significantly towards trust</head><p>Intention in buying according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> )intention to buy is influenced by three factors i.e. consumer attitudes, subjective norms and control perception of behavior. Regarding the perception of risk and trust is a trust that is owned by consumers that is a component of attitudes. Further trust and perception of risk affect the buying interest, as expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> dan <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>)that belief affects the buying intention of consumers, so that for this research can be hypothesized:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4: Trust affects the intentionto buy positively and significantly</head><p>In addition, the perception of resistance is able to influence the buying intention of consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>the greater the risk that consumers perceive then the less interest to buy, therefore the hypothesis can be made as follows: The population in this research is the community of Palembang who are interested in purchasing food products from the Web online. The chosen people who are interested in making food purchases online is due to the theory that is used also with consideration for the accuracy of population characters and samples.</p><p>As for the extensive sample is as much as 100 people, the magnitude of 100 is based on calculations made by <ref type="bibr">(Roscoe, 1975)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that for multivariate research the number of samples preferably several times greater than the number of variables in Research (more liked 10 times or greater). Therefore, because this research uses 4 variables, the number of samples obtained 25 times from the number of variables (4x25) is 100 people.</p><p>Sampling techniques need precise consideration or how samples are taken from within the population to obtain a representative sample, this is due to the population or sample character is very likely not the same in each Research. In other words, the situation in each of the different studies can lead to the question that the respondent had a large variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Therefore, this research uses the nonprobability sampling technique with its technically fetching method is purposive sampling. This method is used considering that it is not easy to find people who have an interest in buying food products online but must be sought in such a way that in search need some consideration. The considerations include familiar people with internet use through notebooks, laptops, and smartphones, and can and understand using online features in notebooks, laptops, and smartphones.</p><p>The Data used in this research is primary and secondary. Primary data is data derived from interviews and questionnaire that is filled by respondents, while secondary data is information that is a result of processed or explanation from other parties.Operational variables include: Perceived Value (PV) consist of price,postage,other expenses than price, adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Trust (Tr), Reliable , Maintaining promises and commitments, can maintain good judgment, the technology used is trusted, all adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> dan <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Perceived Risk (PR) The indicator consists of risk to the price, service, food quality, delivery time. All adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Buying Intention (BI) indicators are : be interested in buying food online, in the future will buy food online, buy food online in the near termadapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Variable measurements use a differential semantic scale, the reason for this scale usage because it gives the respondent the opportunity to provide more precise value according to what it felt. Differential Semantic scale has seven points of value ranging from one to seven and is bipolar because it has two embodied widespread with adjectives in which both have the meaning the opposite <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and analysis techniques using path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head><p>Profile respondents showed that online food participants were predominantly 74%, the most age was in the range of 20 to 24 years by 54%, and as many as 51% of respondents were as students. The most selected online food purchase and delivery service company is 80% Go Food, as well as the most common method of payment, is cash at 62%. Data obtained from questionnaires and processed using SPSS software, and the analysis of this path tests the path to the relationship between perceived value and buying intention, perceived risk and buying intention directly and indirectly, while the trust acts as a mediator. Not all indicators are used in this study, it is because the indicator is not giving a good validity, that is far from 60 percent. In the perceived valuefirst indicator is dropped, in the variable perceived risk to the five dropped indicators as well as the five indicator trust variables are also dropped. For variable buying intention all indicators provide good validity values.The following table explains the validity and reliability of all variables used. Regression calculations for data with a 5% confidence rate result in the estimated coefficient as seen in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The path analysis shows that the effect of PV on Tr is significant, as was the influence of Tr to BI. Meanwhile the influence of PR to Tr, PV to BI and PR to BI all insignificant. The indirect effect of PV to BI mediated by Tr is worth 0.240, and PR to BI through Tr is worth 0.016 so that the total influence PV to BI mediated by Tr by 1.002 and PR to BI mediated by Tr valued at 0438. Based on the calculations in table 2 also prove that H2 and H4 are supported, while H1, H3, and H5 are rejected. This suggests that Tr acted as a mediator on the relationship between PV and BI, while on the relationship between PR and BI Tr is not a mediator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION</head><p>The Internet today is very large in its role in the business world of one of the B2C marketing. The thing that consumers consider in online purchases especially food procurement is a matter of trust. Trust plays a very important role in this online marketing because sellers and buyers do not meet directly, the product cannot be seen or tried directly. Consumers ' perception of the benefits of purchasing and food delivery services made by Go Food and Grab Food is considered to be very decisive in their trust selling of both online services companies. Perceived risk is also expected to influence consumer trust. Trust will ultimately affect consumer buying intention.</p><p>Based on the results of data processing can be said that the belief acts as a mediator when the perception of value affects the intention to buy, so the trust of online food buyers will trust the web after realizing the benefits of service and products purchased online, then the belief affects the intention of buying. Then it can be known that the perceived value does not directly affect the intention to buy but the trust must be formed first through perceived value.</p><p>As the alleged perceived risk can affect the buying intent, and negatively affect the trust is thus not evident in the study. The effect of perceived risk on both trust and buying intention is positive. These results in addition to not being in line with previous theories and studies are also not logically supported. Therefore, the relationship perceived risk with trust and buying intention cannot be concluded. Consumers believe it or not is very likely due to the perception they have in which the perception was created due to his experience. The perception of risk is not a factor that affects the trust, it is also based on the experience that making a food purchase that provided by Go Food and Grab Food the risk is small, which means it can be trusted. Hence the built conceptual framework is still limited. This condition allows developing the conceptual framework by adding experience factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. IMPLICATIONS</head><p>This research implies that online food purchasing is a young person with a range of 20 to 24 years of age with student status and dominated by the female gender. The trust factor plays an important role in influencing the intention to buy. A positive trust relationship with both perceived risk and buying intention implies need to include other variables to prove the negative relationship between the trust and the perceived risk and purchase intention.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig 1.
