<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Among numerous problems of education in Indonesia, one of them is the effectiveness of teachers' work. The quality of an educational institution is strongly influenced by the effectiveness of the work of teachers, and there are other factors such as organizational climate, emotional intelligence and professional competence. Based on the results of preliminary study through observations, the level of teacher effectiveness is still not maximized, such as teacher preparation in learning, utilization of media and learning resources, innovation in developing teaching materials, and the ability of teachers to develop selfquality. Therefore, this current study aims to analyze the direct and indirect contribution between organizational climate and emotional intelligence through professional competence on work effectiveness. This study used a quantitative approach, with facto exposure. The population of this study was 300 people from 32 elementary schools. The sampling technique used was a proportional r andom sampling. The number of samples was determined based on the Slovin formula with 171 respondents. The d ata was collected using a questionnaire consisting of organizational climate (20 items), emotional intelligence (40 items), professional competence (36 items) and work effectiveness (30 items). This research instrument has been already tested for the level of validity and reliability using the product moment person correlation test. The data in this study were analyzed using path analysis to see the direct and indirect contributions between variables, by first using normality, homogeneity, and multicollinearity tests. The results showed that there were direct and indirect contributions between organizational climate, emotional intelligence, professional competence and work effectiveness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Work effectiveness is pivotal in an organization, in this case a school organization, in order to achieve the goals that have been established. Employees will try to overcome and solve problems encountered in the implementation of tasks and work as work effectiveness is created. According to <ref type="bibr">(Mulyasa, 2012)</ref>, an effective job is one that produces results in accordance with the criteria that were established from the beginning. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Lipham (2005)</ref> examines effectiveness in the context of job achievement, stating that effectiveness is related to the accommodation of the cooperative purpose, which is social and nonpersonal in nature.</p><p>Teacher is responsible in enhancing educational quality, hence focusing on improving teacher performance is critical. Teachers, as professional educators, have the primary responsibility of educating students. Students should be taught, trained, and directed to be ready to compete in an increasingly competitive global market. Effectiveness, on the other hand, is defined as the capacity to choose the right result objectives. An effective manager is one who decides to execute the truth <ref type="bibr">(Moenir, 2016)</ref>. Teachers who have high effectiveness will be more successful than teachers who do not have effectiveness or sincerity in their duties who are able to work hard and be responsible for good learning activities. According to <ref type="bibr">(Gibson, 1989)</ref>, the factors that influence effectiveness can be measured by organizational climate, emotional intelligence, professional competence, excellence and development. As a result, it is possible to concentrate on ensuring that the organizational climate, emotional intelligence, and professional competence of teachers in schools are superior in order to achieve school effectiveness. The climate of an organization can also have an impact on the effectiveness of teachers' work. The state of the school organization and its environment is in a highly comfortable, favorable, and pleasant condition for the teaching and learning process, and it is easy to engage with fellow members of the organization in the school environment (school organizational climate). achieve a better future <ref type="bibr">(Mulyasa, 2018)</ref>. In addition to internal factors in the teacher, there are also external factors that affect the effectiveness of the teacher's work, namely the teacher's ability to manage teaching. Teachers must not only improve their professional ability, but also maximize their own personal potential. Because fundamentally trained teachers not only facilitate learning for students, but also continuously enhance and grow their own self-integrity and the quality of their teacher competences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>This study used the descriptive method data. The goal of this research is to look at the direct and indirect effects of the following variables on work effectiveness: organizational climate, emotional intelligence, organizational climate and emotional intelligence on professional competence, and organizational climate and emotional intelligence through professional competence on work effectiveness. The research population in Martapura Kota comprising of 300 persons from 32 elementary schools and was homogeneous, resulting in a sample of 171 people using the Slovin formula <ref type="bibr">(Ridwan, 2010)</ref>. Since sampling individuals of the population in a study is done at random without looking at the strata that exist in the population, the sampling approach is called proportional random sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sudaryono, 2018)</ref>. This research design consists of two independent variables namely one intervening variable and one dependent variable. The data analysis process followed the following steps: (l) data description, analysis requirements, and (3) hypothesis testing. The results of the data description are used as a reference to describe and describe the tendency of each research variable. The data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of organizational climate (responsibility, identity, warmth, support, conflict), emotional intelligence (recognizing one's own emotions, managing one's emotions, motivating oneself, recognizing the emotions of others, fostering cooperative relationships), professional competence (mastering the material), lessons taught, mastering competency standards and basic competencies, developing subject matter creatively, developing professionalism in a sustainable manner, utilizing information and communication technology) and emotional intelligence (X2) on the effectiveness of teachers (Y) through the professional competence of teachers (Z) at Elementary Schools in Martapura Kota. The data was analyzed used a path analysis to establish the direct and indirect relationships between variables, by first conducting normality, homogeneity and multicollinearity tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The data obtained in this study are data on organizational climate (X1), emotional intelligence (X2), teacher professional competence (Z), and teacher work effectiveness (Y). Details of the data obtained are as follows: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows that the work effectiveness at intervals &gt; 106 categories is very high as many as 68 people or 39.77%.</p><p>Furthermore, the path analysis model of organizational climate, emotional intelligence and professional competence on the effectiveness of teachers' work is as presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Based on the results of path analysis research between organizational climate, emotional intelligence and professional competence on the effectiveness of teacher work at Elementary Schools in Martapura Kota, the discussion of each hypothesis is as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Direct Contribution of Organizational Climate to the Work Effectiveness of Elementary Schools Teachers in Martapura Kota</head><p>The results of this study indicate that there is a direct contribution between the organizational climate (X1) on the work effectiveness of teachers (Y) at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota, the results of the verification analysis indicate that the school organizational climate contributes significantly to the work effectiveness of teachers with a magnitude of 0.003 &lt; 0.005, so it can be concluded that there is a significant direct contribution. While the contribution of the influence of organizational climate (X1) on work effectiveness (Y) is 0.126. It can also be interpreted that the hypothesis is proven and logically acceptable, that there is a conducive school organizational climate that contributes positively to the effectiveness of teacher work.</p><p>A conducive organizational climate supports teachers psychologically by providing comfort, tranquility, security, and confidence that what they are doing will work well. In addition, it can be explained that a conducive school organizational climate, not only provides comfort to teachers but also to students and other school members, so that mutual support will occur. This is evident from the results of descriptive analysis, that according to respondents' perceptions the school organizational climate is in good condition, which of course contributes to the effectiveness of teachers' work. In other words, part of the work effectiveness is determined by the school organizational climate, if the school organizational climate is good, the teacher's work will be effective, and vice versa. However, from the results of the descriptive analysis, it is clear that the school's organizational climate is in good condition, which of course has a good effect on the effectiveness of the teacher's work. The first hypothesis, the results of the verification analysis show that the school's organizational climate contributes significantly to the effectiveness of teachers' work.</p><p>This strengthens the research that has been done related to the contribution of organizational climate to work effectiveness. As a research study conducted by <ref type="bibr">Darmada, et al., (2013)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Direct Contribution of Teacher Emotional Intelligence to the Effectiveness of Teacher Work at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota</head><p>The results of this study indicate that there is a direct contribution between teacher emotional intelligence (X2) on the work effectiveness of teachers (Y) at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota. The results of verification analysis shows that teacher emotional intelligence on teacher work effectiveness with a magnitude of 0.001 &lt; 0.005, so it can be concluded that there is a significant direct contribution. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the contribution of the influence of the emotional intelligence of the teacher X2) on the effectiveness of the teacher's work (Y) is 0.471. It can also be interpreted that the hypothesis is proven and logically acceptable, that there is a contribution of teacher emotional intelligence to the effectiveness of teacher work. According to <ref type="bibr">Ginanjar (2015)</ref>, the key to emotional intelligence is the honesty of conscience. It is the conscience that should be the center of the principle that is able to provide a sense of security, guidance, strength and wisdom. When this is carried out in a work environment, it results in an increase in the effectiveness of good work and achieving success. Based on the results of the analysis that emotional intelligence directly has a contribution to the effectiveness of the teacher's work. It is known from the results of the path coefficient value which shows that there is a positive contribution between emotional intelligence and the work effectiveness of Elementary Schools teachers in Martapura Kota District with a significance level of 0.001 &lt; 0.05.</p><p>Previous research studies that are in line with the research above are such as Yenni (2016) stating that there is a positive influence of emotional intelligence on work effectiveness, which is then reinforced by <ref type="bibr">Sumadiana, et al., (2015)</ref> showing the same thing. This shows that the teacher has good emotional intelligence so that he can manage the emotions that exist in him and recognize the emotions felt by others. So that teachers are able to express emotions appropriately in the school environment and motivate themselves to be able to survive in dealing with problems in the school environment. A teacher with good emotional intelligence tends to have good work effectiveness, and vice versa. Basically a teacher who carries out his duties as a teacher at school should have high emotional intelligence so that he can use his feelings to the maximum to better recognize himself. Teachers who have good emotional intelligence so that they can manage the emotions that exist within themselves and recognize the emotions felt by others. So that teachers are able to express emotions appropriately at school and motivate themselves to be able to survive in the face of failure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Direct Contribution of Teacher Professional Competence to the Effectiveness of Teachers at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota</head><p>This study indicates that there is a direct contribution between the professional competence of teachers (Z) on the work effectiveness of teachers (Y) at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota. The results of the verification analysis show that the professional competence of teachers on the effectiveness of teachers' work with a magnitude of 0.000 &lt; 0.005, so that it can be concluded that there is a significant direct contribution. While the contribution of the influence of professional competence of teachers (Z) to the effectiveness of teachers' work (Y) is 0.336. It can also be interpreted that the hypothesis is proven and logically acceptable, that there is a contribution of teacher professional competence to the effectiveness of teacher work. Increasing the ability of teachers to carry out further affects the professional competence of teachers in improving the quality of education in schools <ref type="bibr">(Samana, 2014)</ref>. The success of the teaching and learning process is largely determined by the role and competence of the teacher. Competent teachers will be better able to create an effective learning environment and will be better able to manage their classes so that they can achieve national education goals, one of which is by increasing the effectiveness of teachers' work. In addition, teachers who have professional competence have a high responsibility and a sense of pride in being a teacher will make a positive contribution to the quantity of teacher work, namely the quantity of work that results from the workload given, no matter how heavy the workload is if a teacher is able to carry out learning effectively. good so that high work effectiveness will be created <ref type="bibr">(Shah, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, teachers who have good professional competence, namely being able to master the concept structure material and scientific mindset that support the subjects being taught will make a positive contribution to work effectiveness in terms of work quality <ref type="bibr">(Wahyudi, 2019)</ref>. Teachers who have good professional competence will have the skills to work, be thorough in their work so that they will have conformity with their work results</p><p>The results concluded in this study that professional competence makes a positive contribution to the work effectiveness of teachers. This is supported by the statement put forward by Badriyah &amp; Hude (2016) that there is a positive and significant relationship between professional competence and work effectiveness, where increasing professional competence will increase work effectiveness. Then strengthen research by (Made, 2018) which states the same thing. Through professional competence, a person individually will try to improve his abilities, because basically professional competence is a term which means the extent to which an organization or institution can meet the needs and expectations of someone who works in it.</p><p>A professional teacher will be encouraged to complete work on time and meet the demands of work in terms of quantity and quality in his work. The more fulfilled aspects of a person's professional competence, the higher the level of professional competence. Teachers who have a positive attitude will encourage teachers to do their best work. So that the effectiveness of the teacher's work can be maximized.</p><p>Based on the findings as described above, that the professional competence of teachers greatly affects the effectiveness of the teacher's work itself. Mangkunegara (2016) states that the effectiveness of work or the results of both quality and quantity achieved by human resources for a period of time in carrying out their work duties are in accordance with the responsibilities given to them. While the professional competence of teachers is a positive feeling about one's work which is the result of an evaluation of its characteristics. The results of this study are also supported by previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Mulyadi &amp; Suwarsi (2022)</ref> which states that professional competence is a variable that is included in the High category and has a significant effect on the effectiveness of teachers' work. This means that the higher the level of professional competence of teachers will be followed by morale and increased work effectiveness of teachers.</p><p>The results of the research that have been carried out can be concluded that professional competence has a positive effect on teacher work effectiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to make efforts to increase the professional competence of teachers, through creating an atmosphere that can support the improvement of professional competence of teachers, for example with the support of information and communication technology facilities in learning; b) creating an atmosphere of self-development for example holding field trips, sports competitions and others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Direct Contribution of Teacher Organizational Climate to the Professional Competence of Elementary Schools Teachers in Martapura Kota</head><p>The results of this study indicate that there is a direct contribution between the teacher's organizational climate (X1) on the professional competence of teachers (Z) at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota. The results of the verification analysis show that the teacher's organizational climate on the professional competence of teachers with a magnitude of 0.001 &lt; 0.005, so it can be concluded that there is a direct significant contribution. Meanwhile, the contribution of the teacher's organizational climate (X1) to the professional competence of teachers (Z) is 0.433. It can also be interpreted that the hypothesis is proven and logically acceptable, that there is a contribution of teacher professional competence to the effectiveness of teacher work.</p><p>The Teachers are professional educators with the main task of educating, teaching, guiding, directing, training, assessing and evaluating students in early childhood education through formal education, basic education and secondary education. Efforts to professionalism in teacher positions are closely related to efforts to improve the quality of learning and student learning outcomes, meaning that improving student learning outcomes is determined by the quality of learning and teacher quality or teacher professional competence. The organizational climate in the implementation of teacher learning is expected to be able to understand how to manage learning well and will contribute to the professional competence of teachers, teachers who are able to manage learning will have good pedagogic competence, namely being able to master the character of students. During the implementation of learning, the teacher is expected to be able to manage learning activities, namely organizing time with students, implementing strategies and time management in the act of learning, which will contribute to the professional competence of teachers in terms of professional competence, namely in order to achieve learning objectives, the teacher must be able to master the concept structure material. and a scientific mindset that supports the subjects taught so that it will create good professional teacher competencies.</p><p>In order for teachers to make effective and effective preparations, they are required to understand various aspects related to learning assessment, both the nature, function, principles and procedures for developing teaching preparation, as well as measuring teaching effectiveness <ref type="bibr">(Sagala, 2010)</ref>. If the learning assessment is regular and well implicated, then the activity will be able to run well and get full support from the teachers in the form of increasing the effectiveness of their work. The ability of a teacher to actualize the organizational climate is intended to contribute positively to increasing the professional competence of teachers in schools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The Direct Contribution of Teacher Emotional Intelligence to the Professional Competence of Elementary Schools Teachers in Martapura Kota</head><p>The results of this study indicate that there is a direct contribution between the emotional intelligence of teachers (X2) on the professional competence of teachers (Z) at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota. The results of the verification analysis shows that the emotional intelligence of teachers on the professional competence of teachers with a magnitude of 0.004 &lt; 0.005, so it can be concluded that there is a significant direct contribution. Meanwhile, the contribution of the teacher's emotional intelligence (X2) to the teacher's professional competence (Z) is 0.195. It can also be interpreted that the hypothesis is proven and logically acceptable that there is a contribution of teacher emotional intelligence to teacher professional competence. The results of this study are in line with the hypothesis which states that there is an influence of emotional intelligence on the professional competence of teachers. The results obtained are in accordance with the results of research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Virk (2011)</ref> which proves that there is a positive and significant influence on the emotional intelligence variable on professional competence. These results are in accordance with the theory of affective events which states that emotional intelligence at work is closely related to professional competence. Professional competence is an emotional attitude that gives a feeling of pleasure, where a person will feel happy with his job and his place of work and can establish good relationships with co-workers. The implication of these results is that someone with greater emotional intelligence will manifest a sense of professional competence. The results of the research data analysis that have been carried out have empirical findings that emotional intelligence is good so that it has an impact on professional competence. The findings of this study are supported from previous research by Puluhulawa <ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref> suggesting that emotional intelligence has a significant contribution to professional competence. also reinforced by research by <ref type="bibr">Liestiati (2020)</ref> showing the same thing. In accordance with the theory put forward by <ref type="bibr">Goleman (2015)</ref> who reveals that emotional intelligence consists of five main dimensions, namely: recognizing one's own emotions, managing emotions, motivating oneself, recognizing other people's emotions and building relationships.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Indirect Contribution of Teacher Organizational Climate to Teacher Work Effectiveness through Professional Competence of Elementary Schools Teachers in Martapura Kota</head><p>The results of this study indicate that there is an indirect contribution of teacher organizational climate (X1) to the work effectiveness of teachers (Y) through the professional competence of teachers (Z) at Elementary Schools Martapura Kota. The results of verification analysis shows that the indirect contribution of teacher organizational climate to teacher work effectiveness through the professional competence of teachers with a magnitude of 0.001 &lt; 0.005; therefore, that is concluded that there is a significant contribution directly. Meanwhile, the indirect contribution of teacher organizational climate (X1) to teacher work effectiveness (Y) through teacher professional competence (Z) is 0.145. It is interpreted that the hypothesis is proven and logically acceptable, that there is an indirect contribution to the teacher's organizational climate on the effectiveness of teachers' work through the professional competence of teachers.</p><p>Previously, it was known that in this study it was found that organizational climate gave a significant direct contribution to both professional competence and the teacher's work effectiveness variable. This will have an impact on the number that will appear in the indirect path correlation coefficient which will also contribute. This means that either directly or through intermediaries, the organizational climate of the Elementary Schools Martapura Kota teacher organization is unidirectional. The better the teacher's organizational climate, the better the professional competence and work effectiveness of the teacher concerned. Other researchers such as <ref type="bibr">Ruyani (2013)</ref> in which the results of data analysis show that organizational climate has a significant effect on the effectiveness of teacher work through professional competence, then research is strengthened by <ref type="bibr">Maretha, et al., (2021)</ref> stating the same thing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Indirect Contribution of Emotional Intelligence to Teacher Work Effectiveness through Professional Competence of Elementary Schools Teachers, Martapura Kota</head><p>The results of research data analysis regarding the indirect contribution of teacher emotional intelligence to teacher work effectiveness through the professional competence of teachers as intermediaries are stated based on data on the direct contribution of emotional intelligence to work effectiveness. In addition, the direct contribution between professional competence and work effectiveness shows the results that both data are positive stating that there is a significant and significant contribution based on the amount of data both of which are then combined. The results of this study indicate that there is an indirect path coefficient of X2 to Y through Z of 0.066. So, it can be concluded that the emotional intelligence of teachers indirectly has a significant contribution to the effectiveness of teacher work through the intermediary of the teacher professional competence variable.</p><p>Based on the results of the path test that has been carried out, emotional intelligence has a significant influence on the effectiveness of teachers' work through professional competence. Associated with emotional intelligence Goleman (2012) conceptually describes that emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize one's own feelings and the feelings of others, the ability to motivate oneself and in relation to others. The results of this research are supported by research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Suastana (2015)</ref>. The contribution of leadership style, principal's academic supervision, and emotional intelligence to the performance of science teachers at public high schools in Tabanan district. Yang found that teachers' emotional intelligence had a positive impact on the work performance of science teachers. Thus, the variable of teacher emotional intelligence that was chosen as the determinant variable contributed significantly to the effectiveness of the work of science teachers at SMA Negeri in Tabanan Regency.</p><p>The results of other studies also examined by <ref type="bibr">Julita, et al., (2019)</ref> showed that the emotional intelligence variable showed a significant number. The essence of the effectiveness of teacher work on professional competence as a result of work achieved by individuals in quality and quantity that is adjusted to the work of a teacher in carrying out roles or tasks in accordance with the responsibilities given to him. And if a teacher is good at adjusting to the moods of other individuals, and the teacher has a good level of emotionality, it will make it easier to adjust to social interactions and the school environment so that it has an impact on the influence of professional competence on work effectiveness. The achievement of the work of a teacher in quality and quantity is the implementation of the effectiveness of the teacher's work on professional competence that is adjusted to the work of a teacher in carrying out the role or task in accordance with the responsibilities given to him. A teacher is good at adjusting to the moods of other individuals, and the teacher has a good level of emotionality which will make it easier to adjust to social interactions and the school environment so as to have an impact on the influence of professional competence on work effectiveness. A teacher with good emotional intelligence will be able to adapt to his school, be able to manage himself well, provide empathy for others. When all indicators in emotional intelligence can be met, a teacher will concentrate on the work he is doing and good work effectiveness can be realized.</p></div>
