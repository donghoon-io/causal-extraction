<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With rapid economic development and industrialization, air pollution is becoming a critical global issue affecting health. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the major contributors to acid rain and the key indicators for evaluating atmospheric pollution. And source intensity and meteorological factors are the main ways to influence the concentrations of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Thus, to investigate the specific effects of source intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure on SO2 and NOx, the path analysis method was used for the model. The results showed that Source intensity significantly affects the concentrations of SO2 and NO2. For both NO2 and SO2, the source intensity accounted for around 40%. Meteorological factors have very limited effects on the concentrations of SO2 and NO2. The effects of the meteorological factors on air pollutants are specific as differences in material properties. Humidity significantly affects the concentration of SO2 while temperature, humidity and wind speed have significantly affected the concentration of NO2.</p></div>

Air quality is relevant to everyone's life <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and air pollution adversely affects health significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The World Health Organization showed that millions of deaths were attributable to air pollution, globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. In China, air pollution caused between 35 000 and 500 000 people to die prematurely <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> and it became the fourth threat to people's health in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Unprecedented industrialization, motorization, and economic activity not only deteriorate _________________________ the air quality, but also makes air pollution complicated, consisting of particulate matter, ozone (O 3 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, the contribution of NO x and SO 2 to air pollution is nonnegligible. SO 2 is usually released by volcanic eruptions or fossil fuels with sulfur combustion; it is often used as an indicator to measure atmospheric pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Due to photochemical and catalytic reactions in the atmosphere, SO 2 often converts to SO 3 or sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) aerosols, and its salt particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which would cause haze events and harm public health. While nitrogen oxides in air pollution mainly include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), which derive from fossil fuel combustion such as car driving and kiln firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Under light conditions, the photochemical reaction between NO 2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produces O 3 , thus, NO 2 has a very short life in the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The generated O 3 and NO x with strong oxidizing could have a serious impact on public health.</p><p>High emission intensity, unfavorable meteorological conditions, special terrain, and chemical conversion would result in air pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Emission intensity determines the released concentration of pollutants, while meteorological conditions have limited influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Of all meteorological factors, wind direction and wind speed are the key factors to influence all pollutants by atmosphere turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The effects of other meteorological factors on pollutants would be specific and seasonal <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The research <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> showed that high SO 2 days are associated with stagnant warmed moist air masses. For SO 2 , Xue's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> found that SO 2 were negatively correlated with temperature, humidity, and wind speed and positively correlated with air pressure. Moreover, humidity has the dominant effect on the concentration of SO 2 in meteorological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. While several meteorological factors have significant effects on the concentration of NO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Polluted weather could occur for many factors. Moreover, different types of air pollution vary from place to place, with human pollutant emissions and the meteorological factor being the main factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The path analysis model is used to investigate the effects of source intensity and meteorological conditions on SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the path analysis model and the data. Section 3 shows the results of the path analysis model, which finds the effects of source intensity and meteorological conditions on SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations. In Section 4, we discuss the results of the path analysis model combined with other studies. Section 5 drew conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DATA AND METHODS</head><p>Data overview. All the data were collected from national atmospheric monitoring stations. Pollutants included SO 2 and NO 2 as dependent variables. The concentration of SO 2 varied from 0 to 47 µg/m 3 . The maximum value was measured at 11:00 on 14 April 2020. The concentration of NO 2 varied from 2 to 211 µg/m 3 . The maximum value was measured at 10:00 on 16 January 2021. The total number of samples was 19 342.</p><p>The hourly meteorological data from 1:00 on 16 April 2019 to 23:00 on 30 June 2021 includes temperature (T), humidity (H), wind speed (WS) and atmospheric pressure (AP). According to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, these four meteorological indicators are representative. The study site has a mild climate with temperatures varying from 5 to 38 °C, humidity from 14 to 99% RH, atmospheric pressure from 993.5 to 1029.2 hPa and wind speed from 0.1 to 5.8 m/s.</p><p>To investigate the effects of source intensity (S) on pollutant concentrations, each source intensity data was approximated by the pollutant concentrations from 24 hours ago. This is due to the continuous and periodic nature of pollutant emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Path analysis. The path analysis model is a multivariate statistical analysis method, usually employed to describe linear relationships between multiple independent variables and dependent variables. The path analysis model only has observable variables and residual variables, which is a special form of the structural equation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In the path analysis method, the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable was decomposed into direct and indirect parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Moreover, the relative importance of independent variables could be found. In the present study, the path analysis model was applied to calculate the direct and indirect effects of meteorological factors and source intensity on air pollutants. The path analysis model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, pollutant (y) is the dependent variable including the concentration of pollution, while T, H, AP, WS, and S are independent variables (x). e is the residual variable. P x,y indicates the direct path coefficient between the ith independent variable and dependent variable. r xi,xk indicates correlation coefficients between independent variables. x i and x k include independent variables. One-way arrow (→) shows a causal relationship between pollutant and independent variables and errors. For example, T→ pollutant shows the direct effect from T to pollution. The two-way arrow shows the correlations between the independent variables. For instance, T←→H shows the correlation between T and H denoted by , .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">INFLUENTIAL FACTORS OF THE CONCENTRATION OF SO2</head><p>Four meteorological factors and source intensity were considered independent variables in path analysis models. The total path coefficients of the five independent factors for SO 2 were -0.1406, -0.4495, 0.2963, -0.0968, and 0.6324, respectively. This means that the effects of T, H and WS on the concentration of SO 2 were negative, while those of AP and S were positive. Further, the direct effect coefficients of T, H, AP, WS, and S were 0.0423, -0.2860, 0.0704, -0.1536, and 0.5117, respectively. Ranking of the direct effect coefficients was This means that S and H play the most important roles to affect the concentration of SO 2 . The effect of source intensity is positive and increase of the source intensity by one unit would lead to increasing concentration of SO 2 by 0.6324 units. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proved that the chemical industry and thermal power plants are the main contributor to SO 2 in atmosphere, and the most important means of reducing the occurrence of SO 2 pollution is to limit SO 2 emissions.</p><p>By contrast, the effect of H is negative, the concentration of SO 2 would decrease by 0.4495 units if H increases by one unit. For all the meteorological factors, humidity makes the greatest negative contribution to the concentration of SO 2 . Some authors could explain these results, e.g., the aerosol water in high humidity conditions serves as a reactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Under good lighting conditions, photochemical reactions produce H 2 O 2 and O 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which would react with SO 2 to form sulfate as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 + 3 2 2 4 2 HSO H O SO H H O - - + → + + 2 2 3 2 4 2 SO + O + H O SO 2H H O - + → + +</formula><p>Under low light conditions, gas-phase NO 2 could react with SO 2 dissolved directly in the aqueous phase and produce nitrite and sulfate in the presence of aerosol water <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The reaction equation is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">+ 2 2 2 2 4 SO (g) + 2NO (g) + 2H O(aq) 2H (aq) + SO (aq) + 2HONO(g) - →</formula><p>Moreover, the mechanism of the reaction is self-amplifying. The reaction of NO x and SO 2 would produce sulfate and nitrate, which could make particulate pollution worse and lower light levels. Thus, photochemical reaction is weakened, and more nitrogen oxides react with SO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. In high humidity atmosphere, SO 2 and nitrogen oxides convert from gas phase to particle phase, which would cause haze events <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>For all independent variables, the effect of WS is least. Increase of WS by one unit would lead to a decrease of the concentration of SO 2 only by 9.68%. Further, the direct path coefficient of WS is negative while the indirect path coefficient of WS is positive. The higher WS would cause less stable atmosphere, and more pollutants are diffused by wind. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> found that the correlation between SO 2 concentration and WS is negative. While the concentration of SO 2 and humidity would be directly influenced by WS. Decrease in humidity would weaken the atmospheric sulfur chemistry.</p><p>Similarly, the direct and indirect effects of temperature on SO 2 concentration are opposite. The direct effect of temperature is positive and negligible, while the indirect effect is negative and dominant. The absolute determination coefficient of T for SO 2 was only 1.37%, which means that the effect would be negligible. According to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, an increase in T would strengthen atmospheric turbulence and convection. Especially, the concentration of SO 2 would significantly decrease when T is higher than 25 °C <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Summarily, on a sunny day, great temperature differences and strong vertical air convection could make the inversion layer disappear quickly, that would accelerate pollutants diffusing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>AP is the only meteorological factor that has a positive effect on SO 2 concentration The direct and indirect effects are all positive and the indirect path is the main pathway. The high AP take sunny and stables atmosphere conditions, without precipitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">INFLUENTIAL FACTORS OF THE CONCENTRATION OF NO2</head><p>NO 2 is an important substance in photochemical reactions. To investigate the main influencing factors and degree of influence of atmospheric NO 2 , four meteorological factors, and source intensity were considered independent variables in path analysis models. The total path coefficients of the five independent factors for NO 2 were -3534, -0.0456, 0.3062, -0.4660 and 0.5880, respectively. It showed that the effects of T, H and WS on the concentration of NO 2 are negative, while that of AP and S is positive. Moreover, the direct effect coefficients of T, H, AP, WS, and S were -0.2305, -0.1332, -0.0774, -0.3722 and 0.4378, respectively. Ranking of the direct effect coefficients was Thus, the source intensity makes a great contribution to the concentration of NO 2 . The determination coefficient of S is the largest among the five independent variables. Large amounts of NO 2 mainly come from the direct emission of NO x and photochemical reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, where the main source of NO 2 is the oxidation of NO. The RO  radicals further react with oxygen In photochemical reactions, NO 2 decomposes in two main pathways. On the one hand, NO 2 reacts with free radicals to form nitrate particles NO HO HNO + →  On the other hand, photolysis of NO 2 proceeds by absorption of light at wavelengths lower than 420 nm. The oxygen radicals generated react with oxygen to produce ozone. It seems to be the only known source of anthropogenic ozone in the atmosphere</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">2 NO NO O hv + → +  2 3 O + O M O M + → + </formula><p>During haze days, photochemical reactions would weaken while the stagnant weather would trap more NO 2 in the lower atmosphere causing NO 2 concentration to increase. On a sunny day, photochemical reactions would strengthen. However, NO 2 is an intermediate product of photochemical reactions, and when light is strong, large amounts of NO 2 are produced and consumed at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Overall, NO 2 is present in the air for a short time as an intermediate product in a series of reactions. Its concentration in air is still largely dependent on the source intensity.</p><p>Similarly, the total path coefficient is positive. However, the direct path coefficient is negative and negligible. AP mainly affects NO 2 concentrations by influencing other meteorological factors.</p><p>Results show that WS is negatively related to NO 2 concentration; moreover, WS has the most negative effects. The increase in wind speed can directly lead to a change in atmospheric stability and acceleration of inter-air movement resulting decrease of NO 2 . Similarly, T is negatively related to NO 2 concentration, further, its impact is second only to that of WS. T affects pollutant concentrations mainly by influencing atmospheric turbulence and chemical reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. On the one hand, unstable atmospheric turbulence accelerates the dispersion of pollutants resulting in lower pollutant concentrations. High temperatures can supply energy for chemical reactions to some extent, but for NO 2 this effect is rather limited. This is because NO 2 undergoes a photochemical reaction, which occurs when irradiated by light in a specific wavelength band. This is also the reason why photochemical pollution is little affected by seasonal changes.</p><p>In contrast to SO 2 , the effect of humidity on NO 2 concentration is negligible. NO 2 is mainly a photochemical reaction and does not require an aerosol water container, so it is not sensitive to changes in humidity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER FACTORS ON POLLUTANTS</head><p>From the coefficient of determination results, five independent variables could explain about 60% variance of SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations. There should be more factors that were not considered such as topography <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, chemical reactions between atmospheric pollutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and seasonal factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>According to the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, the spatial and temporal distribution and variation characteristics of major air pollutants in 336 prefecture-level cities across China from 2015 to 2016 were studied, and SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations were significantly correlated with regional rainfall and daytime temperature variations, in addition to the five factors studied in present study. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> used meteorological factors regression and back propagation neural network modeling techniques to investigate the effect of meteorological factors on NO 2 and they found that cloudiness and light have a significant effect on NO 2 concentrations and there is a non-linear relationship between meteorological factors and NO 2 concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>A path analysis model was applied to investigate the influence of the source intensity and meteorological factors on SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations. Conclusions could be summarized as follow:</p><p>• Source intensity plays a significant part in the effect of the concentrations of SO 2 and NO 2 in the atmosphere. For both variances of NO 2 and SO 2 , the source intensity is explained by around 40%.</p><p>• Meteorological factors could have an impact on pollutant concentrations. However, the impact of the four meteorological factors is very limited.</p><p>• Because of the different migration and transformation pathways of pollutants in the atmosphere, the effects of the meteorological factors on air pollutants are specific. Humidity has the most significant effect on the concentration of SO 2 while temperature, humidity and wind speed significantly impact the concentration of NO 2 .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
