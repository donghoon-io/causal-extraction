<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p>The choice of contraceptive use is based on regulating birth spacing or those who no longer want offspring. Although hormonal contraceptives have been available for more than 50 years, many do not know that hormonal contraceptives also have psychological effects on hormonal contraceptives and their biological mechanisms. This study aims to analyze the effect of hormonal family planning on symptoms of depression in women of reproductive age in Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta. Subjects and Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta, from December 2019 to January 2020. A sample of 200 women of reproductive age was selected by purposive sampling. The dependent variable was depression symptoms in women of reproductive age. In contrast, the independent variables were education, age, duration of use, employment status, family income, and hormonal contraceptives. Data were collected using the Beck Depression Inventor II (BDI II) questionnaire and analyzed with path analysis using the Stata 1.3 application. Results: The incidence of depression symptoms in women of reproductive age increased with duration of use ≥36 months (b= 1.84; 95% CI= 0.86 to 2.83; p &lt;0.001) and contraceptives use (b= 1.31; 95% CI= 0.47 to 2.15; p= 0.001). The incidence of depression symptoms in women of reproductive age decreased with age ≥29 years (b= -2.05; 95% CI= -3.04 to -1.07; p= &lt;0.001), family income ≥ IDR 1,571,000 (b= -3.06; 95% CI= -3.06 to -1.41; p&lt;0.001), ≥high school education (b= -1.67; CI 95%= -2.54 to -0.18; p= &lt;0.001), and employment status (work outside the home) (b= -0.98; CI95 %= -1.78 to -0.18; p= 0.016). Conclusion: Duration of use, contraceptive use, age, family income, education, employment status affect depression symptoms in women of reproductive age.</p></div>

Complaints that arise are somatic complaints, anxiety and the emergence of stressors from the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Toffol et al., 2011)</ref> 64% of women who are married between the ages of 15 and 49 in Indonesia use a contraceptive method, 57% use a modern contraceptive method and 6% use a traditional contraceptive method. The trends in the use of family planning that are most widely used by married women are injection (29%), pills (12%), implants and IUDs (5% each) and MOW (4%) <ref type="bibr">(IDHS, 2017)</ref>. The data recorded in the Yogyakarta Health Office in 2017 that active contraceptives users of Longterm contraceptive methods/MJKP (IUD, MOP, MOW, Implant) were 36.2% (149,708 participants) while non-long-term contraceptive methods were 63.8% <ref type="bibr">(263,492 participants)</ref>. The most used of family planning was an injection, amounting to 46.8% <ref type="bibr">(193,482 participants)</ref>.</p><p>The number of fertile age couples (PUS) in Gunungkidul is 118,767 people. The new family planning participants were 4.5% (5,336 people) and active family planning was 77.7% (92,324 people). The most used contraceptive devices were injections of 58.8% (54,308 people), IUD 14.1% (12,992 people), pills 11.9% (10,979 people), implants 7.9% (7,320 people, while MOP, MOW and condoms were 7.3% (6,725 people) (Gunung kidul Health Office, 2017).</p><p>Based on Basic Health Research (2018), the prevalence of depression was 706,689 people (6.1% of the total population) in the age range&gt; 15 years to 75+ years.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Operational Definition of Variables</head><p>Age was the age of the study subject at the time of the study. Data were collected using a questionnaire. The continous data was transformed into dichotomous, code 0&lt;29 years and 1 ≥29 years. Education was the level of formal education that a mother takes to get a diploma. Data were collected using a questionnaire. The measurement scale was categorical, code 0 &lt;Senior High School and 1 ≥ Senior High School. Employment status was a statement of the study subject regarding the status of work or not working at the study time. Data were collected by questionnaire. Categorical data scale, code 0= working at home and 1= working outside the home. The duration of use was the length of time the subject used the contraceptives. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Continous data scale, code 0 &lt;36 months and 1 ≥ 36 months. Type of contraceptives was the method chosen by the subject, both hormonal contraceptives (pills, injections, and implants) and non-hormonal contraceptives (IUD, condoms, and non-device methods). Data were collected using a questionnaire. The measurement scale was categorical, code 0= nonhormonal and 1= hormonal. Depression symptom was a feeling disorder in which the subject feels deep and continuous sadness, causing behavioral disorders. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Continuous data scale, code 0 ≤Score 19 and 1 &gt;score 19. During the last six months, family income was income as the cumulative economic source of the nuclear family (husband and wife).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The Effect of Age on Depression Symptoms</head><p>The results showed a direct effect between maternal age and depression symptoms in users of hormonal contraceptives and it was statistically significant. Mothers aged ≥ 29 years were more likely to experience symptoms of major depression when using hormonal contraceptives than mothers aged &lt;29 years (b= -2.05; 95% CI= -3.04 to -1.07; p= &lt;0.001). This is in accordance with the results of a study conducted by <ref type="bibr">Skovuland et al. (2016)</ref>, which stated a decrease in the risk of depression symptoms in users of hormonal contraceptives as they age. Women in the age range of 20 to 30 years are three times more likely to experience symptoms of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Maina et al., 2016)</ref>. In other studies, it is known that women under 30 years of age are more prone to experience the negative impacts of using hormonal contraceptives than women who are over 30 years of age. The negative psychological effect of contraceptive use has even started for 3 months of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lisofsky et al., 2016)</ref>. So that younger women have a greater chance of experiencing stress, which will lead to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tunurrohmin et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Effect of Duration of Hormonal</head><p>Contraceptive Use on Depression Symptoms The results showed a direct effect between duration of use and depression symptoms in users of hormonal contraceptives and it was statistically significant. Mothers with a duration of use ≥ 36 months were more likely to experience severe depression symptoms using hormonal contraceptives than mothers with a duration of use &lt;36 months (b= 1.84; 95% CI= 0.86 to 2.83; p &lt;0.001) This is in line with the results of a study conducted by Aulia (2019), which stated that the length of use was related to depression symptoms with p= 0.018 and OR= 2.192. This means that women who use hormonal contraceptives than two years had the potential to be 2.192 times more likely to experience depression symptoms than nonhormonal. Another study conducted by Fatmawati and Fatmawati (2019) also stated that the longer the use of hormonal contraceptives, the higher the risk of depression symptoms with an r value of 0.55.</p><p>The length of time using hormonal contraceptives affects the incidence of dep-ression caused by a lack of serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin functions as a mood regulator or a person's feelings. Several studies have found that a lack of serotonin is responsible for the symptoms of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Martini and Fairus, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Natalia, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>A study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Skovlund et al. (2016)</ref> stated a correlation between the duration of use and the risk of depression and the use of antidepressants and then a decrease in the incidence of depression after 7 years of use to less than 10 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Merki-Feld et al. (2017)</ref> stated that although hormonal contraceptives allow the improvement of depression symptoms, it can subside after several months of stopping hormonal contraceptives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Effect of Education on Depression Symptoms</head><p>The results showed a direct effect between maternal education and depression symptoms in hormonal family planning users and was statistically significant. Mothers with education level ≥Senior High School were less likely to experience severe depression symptoms using hormonal contraceptives than mothers with education &lt;Senior High School (b= -1.67; 95% CI= -2.54 to 2.15; p &lt;0.0001)</p><p>There is an inverse correlation between education and depression symptoms. This is in line with a study conducted by Faith and Ross in <ref type="bibr">Kranjac (2016)</ref>, which stated that women who had higher education were at lower risk of experiencing depression symptoms. On the other hand, there is evidence that people with low education have less economic and social resources to successfully cope with mental health problems. Therefore they are more likely to experience depression symptoms <ref type="bibr">(Kranjac, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Women with lower secondary education are more likely to experience symptoms of depression <ref type="bibr">(Pulgar et al., 2015)</ref>. A study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ardoino et al. (2013)</ref> stated that a higher level of education has a risk of experiencing depression symptoms by 0.8 times lower than that of women with low education. According to Beck in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hall et al. (2015)</ref>, women with low levels of education also influence risk assessment, planning, social learning, motivation, taking care of themselves, excessive worry, and a lack of perception of pregnancy opportunities, which have an impact on the decision-making process in choosing a contraceptive method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Effect of Family Income on</head><p>Symptoms of Depression The results showed a direct effect between family income and symptoms of depression in users of hormonal contraceptives and it was statistically significant. Mothers with family income ≥ Rp. 1,571,000 have a lower likelihood of experiencing depression symptoms when using hormonal contraceptives than mothers with family income &lt;Rp 1,571,000 (b= -2.23; 95% CI= -3.06 to -1.41; p= &lt;0.001) Some literature suggests that families with low income and socioeconomic status have become evidence of risk factors for distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Drapeau, 2012)</ref>. Economic limitations, economic dependence, household responsibilities, and the lack of access outside the household cause an increased risk of emotional distress for women <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Isfandari, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, it can be presumed that women with prior mood disturbances and distress may be at a higher risk of developing adverse depression symptoms from the use of hormonal contraceptives because women are particularly sensitive to estrogen and progesterone in the brain pathways involved well connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bengtsdotter, 2018)</ref>. Hormonal contraceptives validate the stress response to reduce cortisol levels, which tend to experience depression symptoms more easily than non-hormonal ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lewis, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>A study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Farr et al. (2011)</ref> states that income influences the relationship between mental stress and contraception.</p><p>Women with low family income are more likely to choose to use short-term contraceptives than women with high family income who choose to use long-term contraception. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liwang (2018)</ref>, contraceptives were practical, cheap, easy to reach, and efficient, which was why women prefer to use hormonal contraceptives (injections) rather than IUDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The Effect of Employment Status on Depression Symptoms</head><p>The results showed a direct effect between maternal occupation and depression symptoms in hormonal contraceptives users and was statistically significant. Mothers who work outside the home were less likely to experience depression symptoms using hormonal contraceptives than mothers who work at home (b= -0.98; 95% CI= -1.78 to -0.18; p= 0.016) This is in line with a study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hoshino et al. (2016)</ref>, which stated that women who only work at home had a greater chance of experiencing depression symptoms than women who work outside the home. In domestic work, the variance in workload and a lack of self-utilization are associated with the occurrence of depression symptoms and unpredictable circumstances in household work. Domestic work that does not have high standards and work intensity can contribute to women's poor mental health through disruption of distorted sleep and eating patterns and disruption of circadian rhythms <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shepherd-Banigan et al., 2015)</ref>. According to Wulyani and Sudiajeng in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Putri and Sudhana (2013)</ref>, housework was one of the three main stressors of housewives. The monotonous homework that must be done every day and mostly focuses only on the house triggers isolated situations in housewives so that they tend to be stressors for women themselves.</p><p>While there is some evidence to suggest that estradiol levels in contraceptive use can modulate attention to stressor exposure, they are more susceptible to experiencing depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Graham and Shin, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Scheuringer et al. (2020)</ref>, even mild negative mood changes were considered stressful by women rather than users who do not experience anxiety disorders. As a result of the pressure from the homework they face. A study conducted by the National Population and Family Planning Board (BKKBN) (2011) stated that occupation is very influential in choosing the type of contraceptives. Working women prefer to use long-term non-hormonal contraceptives because they realize the benefits and uses of women who work at home.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">The Effect of Hormonal Contraceptives on Depression Symptoms</head><p>The results showed a direct effect between the type of hormonal contraceptives and the depression symptoms in users of hormonal contraceptives, and it was statistically significant. Mothers using hormonal contraceptives were more likely to experience depression symptoms using hormonal contraceptives than mothers who used non-hormonal contraceptives (b= 1.31; 95% CI= 0.47 to 2.15; p= 0.002) This is in line with a study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Martini and Fairus (2017)</ref>, which stated that hormonal contraceptives had a 3.15 times risk of experiencing depression symptoms compared to non-hormonal users.</p><p>Several research findings shed light on the biological mechanisms linking hormonal changes to depression symptoms, including mood and anxiety. First, the hormones estrogen and progesterone affect neurotransmitters' function, especially serotonin, which is associated with depression. Second, progesterone's effect has an impact on the GABA (Gamma Amino Butiric Acid) receptors that regulate a person's anxiety. Third, ovarian hormones influence the stress response, thereby increasing susceptibility to depres-sion symptoms, via the hypothalamic-hypnosis-adrenal axis. Besides, estradiol affects the neurological system associated with fear or anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014)</ref>. Ovarian hormone fluctuations are associated with an increased prevalence of depression symptoms in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kuehner, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The disruption of ovarian hormone production naturally is caused by disruption of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine regulation, which mostly causes depression symptoms as ethylogy. The reduced serotonin is responsible for the incidence of depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Natalia, 2014)</ref>. Then, hormonal contraceptives exacerbate mood swings outside the menstrual period and increase the onset of depression symptoms during the pre-menstrual period. Although statistically significant, the average difference in depression symptoms was small between users of hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Roe et al., 2020)</ref>. The current literature shows that modern low-dose hormonal contraceptives show less effect on the occurrence of depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pagano et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Large cohort studies have shown that progestin-contraceptives have a greater risk of developing depression symptoms. Still, a systematic review found little evidence of an association between progestin contraceptives and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Laird et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>According to Laely and Fajarsari in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ramadhan et al. (2017)</ref>, among the three types of contraceptives that contain progestins (mini pills, DMPA, implants), mini pills have the highest synthetic progesterone content, namely 350 mg norethindrone, then DMPA of 150 mg and implants of 36 mg levonorgestrel (norplan), 68 mg 3-ketodesogestrel (implanon) and 75 mg lenovorgestrel (jadena)</p><p>The hormonal components of combined contraceptives have little effect on mood swings and depression symptoms. This is due to the difference in lower doses, so it is lower to experience depression symptoms than a single hormone <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Schaffir, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Some studies suggest that estrogen has a role in increasing serotonin levels which has an antidepressant-like effect on the neurotransmitter depominergic neurons, ergikneuron GABA. Therefore, combined hormonal contraceptives may reduce the exacerbation of depression symptoms compared to those containing only the hormone progetin <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Smith, 2018)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1shows that employment status, education, and duration of use indirectly</figDesc><graphic coords="5,126.50,123.60,342.20,215.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
