<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>Abstract-This paper investigates active damping of LCL-filter resonance in a grid-connected voltage source converter with only grid-current feedback control. Basic analysis in the s-domain shows that the proposed damping technique with a negative high-pass filter along its damping path is equivalent to adding a virtual impedance across the grid-side inductance. This added impedance is more precisely represented by a series RL branch in parallel with a negative inductance. The negative inductance helps to mitigate phase lag caused by time delays found in a digitally controlled system. The mitigation of phase-lag, in turn, helps to shrink the region of non-minimum-phase behavior caused by negative virtual resistance inserted unintentionally by most digitally implemented active damping techniques. The presented high-pass-filtered active damping technique with a single grid-current feedback loop is thus a more effective technique, whose systematic design in the z-domain has been developed in the paper. For verification, experimental testing has been performed with results obtained matching the theoretical expectations closely.</p><p>Index Terms-Voltage source converter, LCL filter, resonance damping, non-minimum phase system, virtual impedance</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>CL resonance has always been an important concern for LCL-filtered voltage source converters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A wide variety of resonance damping techniques have thus been developed with the trend generally favoring active damping techniques because of the additional power losses experienced by passive damping techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Active damping techniques can also be broadly divided into those realized by cascading a digital filter with the current controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and those realized by feeding back the filter state variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The former represents a sensor-less technique realized by plugging in a digital filter, which unfortunately, is sensitive to parameter uncertainties and variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. It is therefore not as popular as the feedback of filter state variables for damping purposes. Among the state variables fed back, the filter capacitor current has been widely chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and is usually realized with a proportional resistive gain.</p><p>The proportional resistive gain is, however, easily modified by transport delays found in a digital system. The outcome is a negative virtual resistance, which upon introduced, will add open-loop Right-Half-Plane (RHP) poles to the system. These open-loop poles will, in turn, introduce a non-minimum-phase closed-loop behavior to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Such a non-minimumphase behavior has subsequently been resolved by replacing the usual proportional gain with a High-Pass Filter (HPF) along the capacitor current feedback loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The capacitor current must however still be measured, which in practice, will demand an additional sensor or a complex software-based observer <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>To avoid additional sensing, the single-loop current control schemes have increasingly been studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, for example, it has been shown that a stable grid current control scheme can be implemented with only a single control loop without damping. The reason has been identified as an inherent damping introduced by the transport delays in the considered digital control system. This inherent damping effect is however available only when the LCL resonance frequency is above one-sixth of the system sampling frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It is, therefore, not always suitable like in weak grids, where grid impedances and hence system LCL resonance frequencies may vary widely. As a precaution, the external active damping is recommended, especially in the power-electronics-based power systems, where the interactions among multiple converters may lead to harmonic instability if not damped appropriately <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>It is therefore encouraging to develop a robust active damping technique that relies only on the feedback of grid-side current (hence no additional sensor) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Ideally, the developed scheme will require an s 2 term for inserting the necessary positive virtual resistance, which in practice, is not implementable because of the possible noise amplification. A second-order Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or a first-order HPF with a negated output <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has thus been suggested as a replacement for the s 2 term. Another alternative is to use the optimized loop shaping design discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where the current controller and active damping have been designed together as a fifth-order feedback transfer function in the z-domain. In terms of simplicity, the HPF is clearly more attractive, while not compromising accuracy significantly. Its parameter design has thus been discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, but not its alteration caused by the transport delays. Its equivalent circuit notation has also not been discussed. These issues, when </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L</head><p>left unresolved, will more easily lead to non-minimum-phase response of the system, owing to the overlooked presence of negative virtual resistance. This paper thus begins by presenting an impedance-based analysis in the s-domain for generalizing the physical circuit property of grid current feedback active damping. The analysis specifically demonstrates that the grid current active damping is equivalent to the insertion of a virtual impedance in parallel with the grid-side inductance. In case of a HPF with a negated output along the damping path, the virtual impedance can further be notated as a series RL branch in parallel with a negative inductance. The resistive part of the RL branch may become negative when influenced by transport delays, which may then cause non-minimum-phase response that can impair the overall system stability and robustness. The non-minimumphase problem can, however, be minimized by the negative virtual inductance in parallel with the series RL damper. This mitigation effect is not inherited by other existing active damping techniques based on the feedback of filter capacitor current, and has presently not been discussed in the literature. It is thus the intention of this paper to study the combined negative resistive and inductive effects introduced by the grid current active damping. Moreover, the frequency region, within which negative virtual resistance exists, will also be identified, and shown to be dependent on the ratio between HPF cutoff frequency and system sampling frequency. A robust damping performance can subsequently be ensured by developing a systematic co-design procedure for the active damping and grid current controller. The procedure is explained with root locus analyses in the z-domain, before verifying it experimentally.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Description</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates a three-phase grid-connected voltage source converter with an LCL filter and a constant DC-link voltage V dc for simplicity. Parasitic resistances of the circuit have been ignored to arrive at the worst case condition, where no passive damping of resonance exists. The Synchronous Reference Frame Phase-Locked Loop (SRF-PLL) has also been employed for synchronizing the converter with the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) voltage <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. A low-bandwidth SRF-PLL has been designed to avoid the undesired low-frequency instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The grid voltage V g has also been assumed as balanced, which then allows per-phase diagrams to be used for analysis in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, where the per-phase grid current control scheme has been shown. The illustrated scheme clearly has the grid current i 2 sensed and fed back for regulation and active damping purposes.

The added impedance can be shaped by varying G ad (s) rather than G d (s), which is usually fixed by the chosen sampling frequency. For example, with G d (s) = 1 fixed by having no system delay, a resistive damper Z v (s) = R v like in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (a) can be inserted by shaping G ad (s) = s 2 for cancelling the same s 2 term found in the numerator of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p></div>

Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (c) again shows a series RL damper, but now with an additional negative virtual inductance (-L v,2 ) connected in parallel. This negative virtual inductance, if chosen equal to the grid-side inductance L 2 , will lead to only R v,2 and L 2 in series on the grid-side of the filter. The HPF gain in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> will also simplify to k ad = ω ad L 1 . However, this simplified case is only for the conceptual information, since the grid-side inductance will drift in practice, making it hard to be exactly cancelled by the negative virtual inductance in parallel.</p><p>Then, with a finite time delay considered, the virtual impedance in (4) changes to ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>), and that in (6) changes to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">  ,1 ,1 ,1 ( ) cos(1.5 ) sin(1.5 ) v d v v s s Z R j L T j T       (8)   ,1<label>,1 ,1 Re cos(1.5 ) sin(1.5</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">v d v s v s Z R T L T     <label>(9)   ,1 ,1 ,1 Im sin(1.5 ) cos(1.5</label></formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">v d v s v s Z R T L T        2 2 ,2 ,2 ,2 ,2 cos(1.5 ) sin(1.5 ) v v d v s s v L Z jL T j T R                (10)   2 2 ,2 ,2 ,2 ,2 Re cos(1.5 ) sin(1.5 ) v v d s v s v L Z T L T R       (11)   2 2 ,2 ,2 ,2 ,2 Im sin(1.5 ) cos(1.5 ) v v d s v s v L Z T L T R      </formula><p>From either <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, the observation noted is imaginary and real terms of the virtual impedance can both become negative after introducing the finite time delay. The negative imaginary term will tend to shift the actual LCL resonance frequency ω res , while the negative real term will add open-loop RHP poles to the current control loop. The latter causes the non-minimum-phase behavior, which should preferably be avoided if a fast dynamic response is demanded. Comparing the real terms in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) also informs that the negative paralleled virtual inductance (-L v,2 ) in Fig. <ref type="figure">4 (c</ref>) helps to lessen the likelihood of Re{Z v,2 } in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> being negative. It is thus an important feature furnished by the HPF-based grid current active damping, which has so far been overlooked by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, even though the same HPF scheme has been tried.</p><p>With this understanding, the next immediate task is to identify the critical frequency ω v , above which Re{Z v,2d } in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> becomes negative. The task can be done by first replacing G ad (s) in (3) with the HPF parameters k ad and ω ad .

Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">13</ref>) can further be plotted as Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> for showing the relationship between critical frequency ω v and HPF cutoff frequency ω ad . It is shown in particular that with ω ad = 0 or the HPF reduced to only a negative proportional gain (k ad ≠ 0), the critical frequency read is ω v = ω s /6. This value can also be determined from the virtual impedance expression given in (3), which upon substituted with ω ad = 0, simplifies to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Any resonance frequency ω res above ω s /6 considered for damping will then lead to negative Re{Z v,2d0 }, and hence non-minimumphase characteristic of the system. A simple solution is to invert the polarity of k ad when ω res  ω s /6 and ω ad = 0. Alternatively, active damping can be removed since it is not necessary for ω res  ω s /6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">  2 1 2 ,2 0 cos(1.5 ) sin(1.5 ) v d s s ad L L Z T j T k     <label>(14)</label></formula><p>A third possibility is to set a non-zero ω ad for generating a high critical ω v that saturates at ω v = ω s /3. Damping of resonance in the range of ω s /6  ω res  ω v  ω s /3 can then be performed with no negative virtual resistance introduced. Yet, above ω s /3, synthesis of negative virtual resistance cannot be avoided, which means the non-minimum-phase response will always be experienced. The value of ω s /3 can therefore be referred to as the theoretical upper limit for ω v when a HPF with negated output is used for synthesizing the demanded active damping. This limit is, however, not achievable in practice, where noise amplification and digital sampling error will realistically limit the HPF cutoff frequency ω ad to below the Nyquist frequency of 0.5ω s . With ω ad = 0.5ω s further assumed, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> gives the companion practical upper limit as ω v  0.28ω s , which needless to say, is smaller than the theoretical limit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. DISCRETE Z-DOMAIN ANALYSIS</head><p>The impedance analyses in the s-domain aim to illustrate the active damping effects with the physical filter circuit, where components are always continuous. Therefore, demonstration of the circuit effects in the continuous s-domain is appropriate. Now, the intention is to co-design the discretized current controller and active damper, where classical control theory states that it is more accurately done in the z-domain. The rootlocus analyses in this section are therefore performed in the zdomain, where results obtained can also be used for verifying the impedance-based equivalence identified earlier.</p><p>Parameters used for the analyses are given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, where three different filter capacitance values have been included for generating three different LCL resonance frequencies. Alternatively, the different resonance frequencies can be obtained with different grid-side inductance L 2 values, which certainly, can also be viewed as a change in grid inductance. Changing of capacitance is, however, preferred for the eventual experimental testing owing to the ease of obtaining well-tested commercial capacitors, whose values over a frequency range are available. Different capacitances, instead of inductances, have therefore been chosen for analysis without compromising the objective of obtaining different resonance frequencies.</p></div>

For both plots, the HPF cutoff frequency ω ad is swept from 0 to 0.5ω s (Nyquist frequency) with a step size of 0.05ω s . The obtained root loci initially track outside the unit circle, but are gradually moved inside it as ω ad increases.</p><p>The inward shifting is, however, slower in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (a), whose root loci only enter the unit circle after ω ad crosses 0.3ω s . The root loci in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (b), on the other hand, enter the unit circle upon ω ad rising above 0.05ω s . These observations can be explained by noting that ω res = 0.24ω s in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7 (a)</ref>, which according to Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, requires critical frequency ω v to be higher than 0.24ω s . With a safety margin included, ω ad of the HPF should hence be chosen higher than 0.3ω s according to Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, with ω res = 0.17ω s in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (b), ω v must be higher than 0.17ω s , which can be ensured by choosing ωad higher than 0.05ω s (with again a safety margin included). The discussed examples have therefore demonstrated the relevance of the impedance-based analyses presented in Section II, from which Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> has been derived for explaining phenomena observed in this subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Co-Design of Active Damper and Current Controller</head><p>The conventional approach towards designing an actively damped system is to design the grid current controller first followed by the active damper. For the former, plenty of existing references are available with <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> being an example. The method proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> uses only the total inductance (L 1 +L t ) and a defined phase margin θ m for computing the parameters of (1), according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">m c c p c t i s k L L k T           (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>where ω c is the crossover frequency of the grid current control loop. Parameters of the PR grid current controller can then be included for designing the active damper based on root locus or other analytical techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, such a design procedure has overlooked the virtual impedance shaping effect that the active damping has introduced to the physical LCL filter. For grid current active damping, the introduced effect is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (c) when a HPF with negative output is used as the damping transfer function (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>).</p><p>For illustrating more of the virtual impedance effects, Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> plot the closed-loop pole trajectories of the overall grid current control scheme with both proportional gain k p of the PR current controller and active damping gain k ad included. The former (k p ) is continuously varied to obtain the root loci for a few chosen representative k ad values. Moreover, since the resonant term of the PR controller is designed for obtaining the zero steady-state error at the fundamental frequency, its effect at the higher crossover frequency of the current control loop is comparably negligible. It is thus not included with the root locus analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The subsequent root locus plots obtained are for three different LCL resonance frequencies (ω res = 0.24ω s , 0.17ω s , 0.14ω s ), and for each plot (or resonance frequency), three cutoff frequencies (ω ad = 0.15ω s , 0.25ω s , 0.35ω s ) and four gains (k ad = 0, 5, 15, 35) of the HPF have been compared. Beginning with Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> for the case of ω res = 0.24ω s and C f = 4.7 μF, the closed-loop poles can be kept within the unit circle even with k ad = 0 for representing no added active damping. Obtaining stable poles with k ad = 0 is, however, possible only when ω res &gt;ω s /6, above which the system transport delay will create an inherent damping effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Therefore, for Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, external active damping is strictly not necessary, but can be introduced for improved robustness in case that parameter drift causes ω res to fall below ω s /6.</p><p>Addition of external damping by setting k ad ≠ 0 then results in prominent change in the root loci with both changes in k ad and ω ad causing the closed-loop poles to move inside the unit circle. Consequently, the dynamic performance of the overall system is altered, implying that the grid current controller cannot be designed without considering the virtual impedance shaping effect introduced by the active damper. It should also be noted that k ad cannot be increased excessively since it forces the root loci to move out of the unit circle from the right. This can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">8 (a)</ref>, where the right root paths are always out of the unit circle when k ad = 35. The overall system is, therefore, always unstable regardless of how the grid current controller is designed. The "always unstable" upper limit of k ad in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> is also noted to increase with ω ad like demonstrated by the higher ω ad = 0.25ω s in Fig. <ref type="figure">8 (b)</ref> and ω ad = 0.35ω s in Fig. <ref type="figure">8  (c</ref>). The higher ω ad in either of the diagrams causes critical frequency ω v read from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> to become higher than ω res = 0.24ω s set for Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The non-minimum-phase behavior is, therefore, avoided when in Fig. <ref type="figure">8 (b</ref>) and (c), permitting higher gains like k ad in the active damper and k p in the PR grid current controller to be used without causing instability.</p><p>The same root loci have been re-plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, but with lower resonance frequencies of ω res = 0.17ω s  ω s /6 and ω res = 0.14ω s  ω s /6 considered. Since ω res is no longer higher than ω s /6, inherent damping introduced by the transport delay is no longer applicable, causing the closed-loop poles to track outside the unit circle when k ad = 0. Active damping is, therefore, necessary when in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, unlike in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Other than this, patterns of the root loci in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> are also noted to be different, except for an observation related to k ad which remains unchanged. More specifically, increase of k ad is again noted to gradually destabilize the system with the root loci always located outside the unit circle on the right when k ad = 35 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> (a) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10 (a)</ref>). This upper limit of k ad can similarly be raised by increasing ω ad , which unfortunately, is not always effective now. Explanation for that can be deduced from Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> (c), Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10 (b)</ref> and<ref type="figure">(c)</ref>, where it can be seen that root loci related to k ad = 15 change their trajectories prominently as ω ad increases. A higher ω ad forces the root loci for k ad = 15 to move closer to the boundary of the unit circle rather than away from it. That gives lesser damping, which is certainly undesirable.</p><p>Parametric influences of the active damper on the system response must therefore not be ignored, and it is certainly not appropriate to design the grid current controller with only the total inductance considered, like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. An acceptable design for the overall control scheme can only be guaranteed when both HPF and current controller are co-designed simultaneously using root locus or other analytical techniques. In this section, root loci have been plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, where it has been shown that for each pair of given k ad and ω ad , its accompanied root locus is formed by two conjugate pole trajectories moved along by two complex pole pairs. The pole pairs move in opposite directions as k p increases. It is hence not straightforward to decide on the eventual set of parameters.</p><p>To resolve the problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> uses a basic rule related to direct pole placement, which is to constrain all poles to have the same natural frequency. In other words, k ad , ω ad , and k p should be co-designed such that the two conjugate pole trajectories intersect, and hence reducing the poles to only one conjugate pole pair. The conjugate pole pair must then be shifted so that it has the same natural frequency as the real pole. Such a design is, however, too restrictive. A slightly relaxed criterion is thus adopted for the design procedure recommended below, while still relying on direct pole placement in the z-domain for producing acceptable performance.</p><p>1) Identify the resonance frequency ω res , and then choose a few possible values for the HPF cutoff frequency ω ad from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> that will help to avoid non-minimumphase characteristic by ensuring that ω v  ω res . 2) Root loci like in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> can be plotted using the chosen ω ad and k ad values for studying their influences on the system closed-loop poles. A final value can then be decided for ω ad and another for k ad through minimizing the distance between the two conjugate pole trajectories. 3) Two conjugate pole pairs with the shortest separation distance can then be marked, from which proportional gain k p of the PR current controller can be determined. Natural frequencies of the conjugate pole pairs will then be the closest possible. 4) Since the resonant term of the PR controller has an effect only at the grid fundamental frequency, its resonant gain k i can be approximately computed using <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and an assumed crossover frequency ω c obtained by substituting phase margin θ m = 40 to the first equation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. However, note that ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_23">22</ref>) is derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for a converter with L-filter only. It is therefore only an approximation, where ω c does not give the actual crossover frequency of the LCL-filtered system. 5) The procedure can be iterated, where necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>For verification, the three-phase converter and LCL filter shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> were implemented and connected to a California Instruments MX-series AC power supply for emulating the grid. Circuit parameters used for the setup are listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, while Table II lists parameters of the PR controller and active damper designed using Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>. Corresponding closed-loop poles obtained using Table <ref type="table">II</ref> are also marked with "X" in the figures. The designed control scheme was eventually implemented using a dSPACE DS1006 platform with a DS5101 digital waveform output board for generating the modulating pulses. Additionally, a DS2004 high-speed analog-to-digital board was used for sampling the PCC voltage and grid current values in synchronism with the modulating pulses.</p><p>With the implemented setup, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> shows its measured grid voltage and current waveforms when ω res = 0.24ω s and C f = 4.7 μF. Since ω res  ω s /6, the system remains stable even with no active damping added, as demonstrated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11 (a)</ref> with k ad = 0. The system dynamic can however be improved by active damping, as understood from Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11 (c</ref>). This observation is in agreement with the pole locations marked in Fig. <ref type="figure">8 (c)</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref> next shows the grid voltage and current waveforms when the filter resonance frequency was changed to ω res = 0.17ω s  ω s /6 by using C f = 9.4 μF. Since ω res is no longer higher than ω s /6, the system cannot be stabilized without active damping, as demonstrated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref> (a) obtained with a small k ad of 5, ω ad = 0.25ω s . It shows a critically stable operation, which matches with the dash-lined root locus in Fig. <ref type="figure">9 (b)</ref>. Note that k ad has not been reduced further since it caused high oscillatory current that tripped the system over-current protection during the testing. Results for k ad = 0 are therefore not provided. Instead, results for an increased k ad of 15, but the same ω ad , are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12 (b</ref>). It can be seen from the results that the system is effectively damped by the larger k ad , which hence confirms the dotted root locus drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure">9 (b)</ref>.</p><p>For both Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref> (a) and (b), it should also be mentioned that the system does not exhibit the non-minimum-phase behavior, because ω res is below ω v = 0.25ω s read from Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> when ω ad = 0.25ω s . The non-minimum-phase behavior will be avoided too when ω ad is increased to 0.35ω s . However, according to Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> (c) plotted with ω ad = 0.35ω s , root locus corresponding to k ad = 15 is shown to shift closer to the unit circle. The system is thus comparably less damped. This expectation has been verified by  comparison with 12 for Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12 (c</ref>)) has been used with the grid current controller. Indirectly, it implies that the active damper and current controller must be co-designed simultaneously since their parameters affect each other.</p><p>The same grid voltage and current waveforms are re-plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref>, but now for an even lower resonance frequency of ω res = 0.14ω s  ω s /6 obtained with C f = 14.1 μF. Since ω res is again lower than ω s /6, reducing k ad to zero will gradually lead to instability according to the dashed root locus plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10 (a)</ref>. This expectation has been confirmed by results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref> (a) for k ad = 5 and ω ad = 0.15ω s . Also observed from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13 (b</ref>) and (c) for the same k ad = 15 is the more oscillatory transient response of the latter obtained with a higher ω ad = 0.25ω s . This observation has similarly been explained when analyzing root loci for the same k ad = 15 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>  Further comparison between Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref> (c) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref> (b), which use the same active damping parameters, can also be performed, where the lower resonance at ω res = 0.14ω s has caused the results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13 (c</ref>) to be dynamically poorer even though a smaller proportional gain of k p = 9 has been used with it. This finding is similar to that concluded earlier when comparing Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11 (c</ref>) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12 (c</ref>). The preferred value for ω ad in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref> has lastly been noted to be lower than that in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>, which is, to a great extent, expected since the smaller ω res in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">13</ref> does not demand a high ω ad for mitigating the non-minimum-phase response caused by the unintentionally inserted negative virtual resistance (based on Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper studies grid current active damping and control for LCL-filtered voltage source converters. Through systematic impedance-based analyses, it has been shown that active damping with grid current feedback is equivalent to adding a virtual impedance in parallel with the grid-side filter inductance. This virtual impedance has further been shown to be a series RL branch in parallel with a negative inductance when a HPF with negative output is used for implementing the active damper. The introduced negative inductance is particularly helpful for reducing non-minimum-phase behavior caused by transport delays in a digital system. Parametric influences of the active damper and current controller have also been studied through root locus analyses, where it has been shown that parameters of the active damper influence the system poles greatly. They have therefore been included in the co-design procedure recommended for the active damper and grid current controller. Experimental results obtained have shown the anticipated steady-state and transient performances, hence validating concepts presented in the paper.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
