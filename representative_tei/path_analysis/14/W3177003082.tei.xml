One way to solve the problem is through organizational communication. This human tendency to communicate continues and is carried out in an organizational environment while at work. Employees who work for a company have an obligation to communicate with each other. One aspect that can influence the success of a company is the communication climate created in the company. Changes in communication climate that occur in an organization can affect the performance and productivity of employees <ref type="bibr">(Alseiari &amp; Farrell, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chakraborty &amp; Biswas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dartey-Baah et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the organizational communication climate, another important point in an organization is the organization's culture. Exploring organizational culture issues is essential for an organization or company, because it will always be interconnected and related to the company's life. Organizational culture is a common and binding philosophy, assumptions, beliefs, ideology, values, expectations and rules. In particular, the culture of the organization shall be determined by team working conditions, organizational management, character and administrative processes applicable. Organizational culture is highly regarded because it is an organization's practice which represents the standards of behavior followed by the members of the organization's hierarchy. A productive organizational culture is one that can make an organization stronger <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balanagalakshmi &amp; Kumari, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Budie et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Horváthová et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The problem that often arises with weak employee retention is employee turnover, but can be solved through various pro-active employee retention strategies so that the organizational culture has a positive impact on employee performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Communication Climate Relations and Employee Performance</head><p>Communication that occurs in an organization is called organizational communication. The purpose of communication in the organization is to form mutual understanding so that there is an equality of reference framework and similar experience among the members of the organization. Human beings as social beings need to communicate to build relationships with the exchange of messages/information in an effort to achieve certain goals. This communication involves yourself, between individuals, small groups and organizational groups. The human tendency to communicate continues and is repeated in the organizational environment while they are at work <ref type="bibr">(Diamantidis &amp; Chatzoglou, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jiang &amp; Shen, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sopow, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Employees who work for a company have an obligation to communicate with each other. An organizational communication climate is very important because the organizational communication climate can affect the way of life of its members, to whom it speaks, to whom it is liked, how it works, how it develops, what it wants to achieve and how it adapts. When running the wheels of an organization, the human resources of the organization will interact with each other in the organization and with the inter-organizational parts, it is necessary harmony in the communication between people in the organization or institution for organizational communication to run effectively and efficiently to achieve the objectives of the organization <ref type="bibr">(Kellner et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maamari &amp; Majdalani, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steers &amp; Lee, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, social interaction between employees and superiors through effectively intertwined communication will create job satisfaction and foster a sense of organization. This sense of ownership is very important because it can produce genuine devotion from its workers. Conversely, ineffective communication due to personal problems, competition between work units, lack of superiors' willingness to hear, understand and acknowledge employee opinions or achievements will trigger the onset of job dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Halter et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jo &amp; Shim, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rapert et al., 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Climate Relations of Organizational Communication with Organizational Culture</head><p>The organization's culture that arises when an organization is formed is one of the factors that can influence the organizational climate. Existing systems can influence an organization's existing climate in the organization, norms, or disciplines in the organization or company.

Mediation is established when a variable affects the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. Changes in the based variables lead to changes in the mediator variable and the conclusion also causes changes in the dependent variable. In this paper, the authors use a simple mediation model because there is one mediator variable. In order to analyze this simple mediation model, the author adopts the flow created by <ref type="bibr">(Al Idrus et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Haider &amp; Kayani, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mivehchi &amp; Rajabion, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Siahaan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vu, Tran, Le &amp; Nguyen, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vu, Tran, Le, Nguyen, et al., 2020)</ref> The picture above is a simple mediator model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on the results of the analysis, it explains that the influence of employee's organizational communication climate hasn't an influence on employee's performance, which means that employee's organizational communication climate at work can't improve employee's performance at the company. Employee retention hasn't an influence on employee's performance, meaning that retention employee in the company can't increase the employee's performance receive from the company. Meanwhile, organizational culture has an influence on the employee's performance. While the indirect effect of organizational culture if it is included to improve employee's, performance has a very large effect on improving influence of organizational communication climate and retention employee to increase performance in the company.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure above, five indicators are omitted, namely x1.1 (Trust), x1.2 (decision making), x1.3 (honesty), x1.6 (attention to high performance goals) and m1.5 (open system).</figDesc></figure>
