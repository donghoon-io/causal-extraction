<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Teacher performance refers to the quality and quantity of work completed by a teacher in accordance to the duties he or she is responsible for, and is based on the teacher's professional responsibilities. Teacher performance is related to the tasks and functions of teachers as decision makers related to areas of teaching and education implementation, such as learning planning, implementation, and evaluation, according to <ref type="bibr">Madjid (2018: 91)</ref>. Several factors influence a teacher's effectiveness in the classroom, including the principal's leadership, quality culture, and job happiness. According to the findings of the researcher's examination of various previous studies, the principal's transformational leadership has an impact on teacher performance. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Aslamiah &amp; Normianti (2019)</ref> stated that the principal's transformational leadership has a positive and significant relationship to teacher performance. The existence of a direct relationship or influence of transformational leadership on teacher performance was revealed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Warni, et al. (2021)</ref> who stated that there was a direct relationship between transformational leadership and teacher performance. Burns defines transformational leadership as a process which basically "leaders and followers raise each other to a higher level of morality and motivation" <ref type="bibr">(Komariah &amp; Triatna, 2015: 77)</ref>. The leader in this context is the principles of organizational development and human performance in order to develop his leadership aspect as a whole through motivating staff and calling for higher ideals and moral values. Principals have an important and quite heavy role in carrying out school programs according to their duties and functions as educators, managers, administrators, and leaders <ref type="bibr">(Depdiknas, 2007: 9)</ref>. The principal is a particularly powerful character in formal education because, as a self-identification figure with the ability to lead by example, he or she can provide direction to instructors so that they can perform their tasks and obligations. The principal is accountable for his leadership and has the ability to coach and supervise his students.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Burn (1978)</ref>, transformational leadership is one of several leadership paradigms that is characterized as a process of reciprocal improvement between leaders and followers to a higher degree of morality and motivation (Yukl, 2016: 298). Bass &amp; Riggio, (2016: 76) termed transformational leadership as "Four I" which includes idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration. The principal is a hugely strong character in formal</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The Effect of Transformational Leadership on the Job Satisfaction of State Elementary School Teachers in North</head><p>Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency The results of the path analysis show that the principal 's transformational leadership has a Beta value of 0.672 with a significance value of 0.000, which means that the principal's transformational leadership directly has a significant effect on the job satisfaction of public elementary school teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency. Transformational leadership is a leadership model for a leader who tends to motivate subordinates to work better and focuses on behavior to help transformation between individuals and organizations. According to Hater &amp; <ref type="bibr">Bass (1988)</ref> in Wahyuddin (2016: 45), transformational leaders are charismatic leaders and have a central and strategic role in bringing the organization to achieve its goals. Transformational leaders can create an example for their staff by acting as a role model, encouraging them to be creative, imaginative, and problem-solving experts. Furthermore, transformational leaders are concerned about the challenges that members of the business confront, and they consistently provide incentive to increase performance and promote job happiness for employees.</p><p>Because job satisfaction is one of the most significant factors in a business, employees will strive to provide their best efforts in the company's best interests. Job satisfaction is an attitude toward work that is based on features of work and is the consequence of a person's impression of something that is felt in his work (intrinsic &amp; extrinsic). Therefore, conducive working conditions are expected to create job satisfaction for a member of the organization. The relationship between transformational leadership and job satisfaction is in line with the research of Ismail et al., (2014) which reveals that there is an interaction between leadership and job satisfaction. Likewise, <ref type="bibr">Aslamiah (2015)</ref> states that there is a direct relationship between transformational leadership and job satisfaction. The same was said Dewi (2018) that transformational leadership style affects job satisfaction. In addition, research study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Warni, et al. (2021)</ref> pointed out that there is a direct relationship between transformational leadership and job satisfaction. Ali et al., (2017) stated that " transformational leadership has a significant effect on job satisfaction" (transformational leadership has a significant effect on job satisfaction). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hutagaol (2018)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Influence of Quality Culture on Job Satisfaction of State Elementary School Teachers in North Labuan Amas</head><p>District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency The results of path analysis show that quality culture has a Beta value of 0.424 with a significance value of 0.000, which means that quality culture directly has a significant effect on job satisfaction of State Elementary School teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency. Job satisfaction is determined by how well one's expectations and the benefits received match. Work performance, discipline, and quality of work are all affected by teacher job satisfaction. Teachers who are happy with their jobs are more likely to have a beneficial impact on education quality. On the other side, low teacher work satisfaction will have a detrimental impact on the improvement of educational quality. A quality culture is a system that creates an environment that allows for the long-term improvement of educational quality in schools. The goal of implementing a quality culture in schools is to improve the effectiveness of instruction in those institutions. The results of this study are in line with research Elçi˙ &amp; Ki˙tapçi, (2010) in their research stated that quality culture has a significant effect on job satisfaction. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tetuko (2012)</ref> which states that culture has a positive and significant effect on job satisfaction. Hosan et al. (2019) also state that culture has an influence on job satisfaction. Antariksa (2020) also states that culture affects job satisfaction. Juwaini &amp; Fahlevi ( 2021) claimed that work culture has a significant role in job satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Murtedjo &amp; Suharningsih ( 2016)</ref> mentioned that the culture that takes place in a turn educational institution contributes to teacher job satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hamonangan &amp; Samsir ( 2021)</ref> in their research stated that work culture has an effect on teacher job satisfaction. Damanik &amp; Situmorang (2021) stated that " Quality culture has a positive effect on job satisfaction".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Effect of Transformational Leadership on Teacher Performance in Public Elementary Schools in North Labuan</head><p>Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency The results of the path analysis show that the traditional leadership of the principal has a Beta value of 0.507 with a significance value of 0.000, which means that the principal's transformational leadership directly has a significant effect on the performance of public elementary school teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency. Leadership is the process of influencing others to take steps or actions towards a common goal. Therefore, leadership is an activity to influence others to want to work to achieve predetermined goals <ref type="bibr">(Purwanto, 2015: 212)</ref>. A person will be a leader if he has advantages over his followers. Essentially, a leader must possess three advantages: first, mental advantages, which include the benefits of using one's mind, knowledge of how to move the organization, and the ability to make quick and precise decisions; second, spiritual advantages, which imply that a leader must be able to demonstrate his nobility of character to his subordinates. Because a leader is essentially a role model for his followers, he or she must have good morale. Third, physical advantages, namely, a leader's acts, deeds, attitudes, and words should be a role model for his followers; and finally, bodily advantages, namely, a leader should be in better physical shape than his followers in order to act quickly. However, the problem of bodily excess is not a major factor (Rivai, 2014: 7). Aslamiah &amp; Normianti (2019) stated that there is a direct relationship between the principal's transformational leadership on teacher performance. Transformational leadership that prioritizes providing opportunities that encourage all elements or elements of the school, namely: teachers, students, employees/staff, parents, surrounding communities and others, to work on the basis of a noble value system, so that all elements in the school are willing to participate optimally in achieving the school's vision. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dharma (2015)</ref>, transformational leadership is a picture in an educational school environment that brings a person into his work in different types and levels of behavior. Competence determines the process aspects of the performance of a job. Leadership describes the relationship between leaders and those who are led and how a transformational leader directs those who are led will determine the extent to which his performance goals are achieved. The existence of a direct relationship or influence of transformational leadership on teacher performance is in line with the research of Warni et al (2021) which states that there is a direct relationship between transformational leadership and teacher performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hutagaol (2018)</ref> states that the principal's transformational leadership has a direct effect on teacher performance. Maris et al. (2016) stated that transformational leadership has an effect on performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Marlina et al. (2019)</ref> states that transformational leadership has a direct effect on teacher performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Setiawan (2015)</ref> states that transformational leadership has an effect on performance. Sulaxono (2020) points out that there is a link between transformational leadership and teacher performance. Sunarsi (2017) revealed that transformational leadership has an effect on performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Susmiyati (2016)</ref> states that transformational leadership has an effect on performance. Wote &amp; Patalatu (2019) stated that transformational leadership style has an effect on performance. Jyoti &amp; Bhau (2015) mention that transformational leadership directly affects performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The Influence of Quality Culture on the Performance of Public Elementary School Teachers in North Labuan Amas</head><p>District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency The results of the path analysis show that quality culture has a Beta value of 0.419 with a significance value of 0.004, which means that quality culture directly has a significant effect on the performance of State Elementary School teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency. Culture and performance are interrelated with each other based on the perfect relationship between the processes that take place in an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aramina, 2015)</ref> . Culture is the driving force for decisions, actions and impact on performance Sarifani &amp; Rasto (2017: 145) state that quality culture has a positive and significant effect on teacher performance. Widaryat (2017: 5) explains the notion of quality culture as "quality values and beliefs in a society that are used as a source of raising highquality behavioral conformism for the supporting community". Explained further about school culture which includes school values and beliefs. School values and beliefs are the basis for implementing a quality culture in schools. Value is the appreciation of the school community about what is considered right-wrong, good-bad, as well as worthy and unworthy; while belief is an attitude about how something should be done. Thus, school culture was originally a rule and order that was mutually agreed upon by the school community, internalized, and carried out continuously until it became a habit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sarifani &amp; Rasto (2017)</ref> state that quality culture has a positive and significant effect on teacher performance. This shows that quality culture is a predictor of improving teacher performance. The level of quality culture will be followed by the level of teacher performance. Thus, from the results of the study it can be concluded that to improve teacher performance, it can be done by increasing the managerial skills of the principal and improving the quality culture. The same thing is also expressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mursyaid (2021)</ref> in his research which states that there is a significant influence of quality culture on employee performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wu (2015)</ref> stated that " The results indicate a chain effect that quality culture serves as an antecedent for infrastructure practices to take effect and infrastructure practices provide a supporting foundation for core practices to generate positive impact on quality performance. Anything that breaks on the chain will cause a problem in quality practices implementation . " breaks in the chain will cause problems in implementing quality practices ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Friedli et al. (2018)</ref> state that "Quality culture as an enabler of high-quality performance " (quality culture is a driving factor for the emergence of high-quality performance). Hilman &amp; Abubakar (2017) state that "quality culture has a significant positive effect on university performance". Antariksa (2020) culture in an organization, including that quality culture affects teacher performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Aziizah (2018)</ref> assumes that culture influences teacher performance. Elçi˙ &amp; Ki˙tapçi (2010) stated that quality culture influences performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hartono (2019)</ref> states that the culture of a school or educational institution has a significant direct effect on teacher performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. The Effect of Job Satisfaction on the Performance of Public Elementary School Teachers in North Labuan Amas</head><p>District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency The results of path analysis show that job satisfaction has a Beta value of 0.780 with a significance value of 0.000, which means that job satisfaction directly has a significant effect on the performance of State Elementary School teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency. Job satisfaction is a term used to describe how people feel about their jobs and the conditions in which they work. According to Hariandja (2002), job satisfaction is a set of positive and negative emotions that people experience as a result of numerous elements or dimensions in their work. Employment satisfaction is achieved when a person is satisfied with his or her job and the conditions that develop at his or her workplace. The pleasure will occur when a teacher may feel that his requirements are being addressed fairly through his work and the atmosphere in which he works, as long as he is considerate. The indicates that satisfying these needs include: salary or wages, promotions, patterns of interaction between co-workers, bonuses and health benefits, as well as other facilities found in the work and work environment. Performance is the result of work achieved by someone in an organization in accordance with their respective authorities and responsibilities in order to achieve organizational goals legally,in accordance with morals and ethics <ref type="bibr">(Prawirosentono, 2016: 2)</ref> .Meanwhile, according to <ref type="bibr">(Simamora, 2014: 327)</ref>, performance is a person's level of achievement in fulfilling work. Good performance will be shown through good work behavior as well. This performance will then be assessed and evaluated by management, the results will be used to make managerial decisions related to compensation, employee transfers and promotions for the employee concerned. Job satisfaction received and felt by an employee will affect the results obtained from his work. By obtaining job satisfaction by employees, both by giving appropriate salaries, the work given according to their expertise, and good relations with superiors, this will improve the performance of the employees. So there is a much stronger relationship between job satisfaction and employee performance <ref type="bibr">(Luthans, 2016: 186)</ref> . Employees who are satisfied at work will always have a positive attitude and always have high creativity <ref type="bibr">(Handoko, 2017: 132)</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Widayati (2020)</ref> states that there is a strong influence between job satisfaction variables on teacher performance variables. Similarly, research study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Warni, et al. (2021)</ref> which states that there is a direct relationship between job satisfaction and performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abidin (2017)</ref> states that satisfaction has an effect on performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Afifah &amp; Musadieq (2017)</ref> state that job satisfaction affects performance. <ref type="bibr">Aslamiah (2015)</ref> states that job satisfaction affects performance. Hutagaol (2018) reveals that performance is influenced by job satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mardianti, et al. (2020)</ref> states that job satisfaction directly affects performance. Wote &amp; Patalatu (2019) stated that job satisfaction has an effect on performance. <ref type="bibr">Aslamiah, et al., (2019)</ref> stated that there is a positive and significant relationship between job satisfaction and performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hartono (2019)</ref> states that job satisfaction directly affects performance. Suriansyah (2020) also states that job satisfaction can have an effect on performance</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Indirect Effect of Transformational Leadership on Performance through Job Satisfaction of State Elementary School</head><p>Teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency The results of the analysis show that the principal's transformational leadership indirectly affects performance through job satisfaction with a value of 0.523 with, which means that indirectly the principal's transformational leadership affects teacher performance through the job satisfaction of State Elementary School teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency. . The results of this study are in line with the research of Djuraidi &amp; Laily ( 2020) which states that job satisfaction is able to mediate the effect of transformational leadership on performance . <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hutagaol (2018)</ref> states that there is an indirect relationship between leadership and performance through job satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tetuko (2012)</ref> states that indirectly leadership has a significant effect on performance through job satisfaction. Warni, et al (2021) stated that indirectly there is a positive and significant relationship between the principal's transformational leadership and teacher performance through job satisfaction. The results of Amri &amp; Rahardja's research (2016) show that a person's performance can be improved by job satisfaction and transformational leadership. Furthermore, transformational leadership and job satisfaction affect employee performance through employee loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Transformational Leadership of School Principles, Quality Culture and Job Satisfaction on Teacher Performance</head><p>Leadership style has a positive and significant effect on employee job satisfaction. Leadership style is an important factor that influences work behavior such as performance. Leadership style directly affects Job Satisfaction through his meticulousness in creating an attractive job and work environment, delegation of responsibilities and proper application of regulations. Therefore, a leader with the right leadership style will lead to employee satisfaction with his work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Indirect Effect of Quality Culture on Performance through Job Satisfaction of State Elementary School Teachers in</head><p>North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency The results of the analysis show that indirectly quality culture affects performance through job satisfaction with a value of 0.331 with, which means that indirectly quality culture affects teacher performance through job satisfaction of State Elementary School teachers in North Labuan Amas District, Hulu Sungai Tengah Regency. Tetuku (2012) states that indirectly, culture has a significant effect on performance through job satisfaction. This result validates that job satisfaction is an intervening or intermediary for quality culture. Thus, job satisfaction is the dominant variable in influencing teacher performance. From the findings, it can be seen that the value of the influence of quality culture on job satisfaction is greater than the value of the influence of quality culture on performance. As a result, quality culture is more dominant in influencing job satisfaction when compared to the influence of quality culture on performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>There is a direct and indirect correlation between the principal's transformational leadership, quality culture and job satisfaction on teacher performance. Teachers should further improve mastery of the basic competencies of the subjects they teach, namely by first studying the basic competencies of each subject so that they are able to realize the objectives of learning. Should take a closer approach to the teachers personally. This is in order to increase the influence of the principal's deal on the teachers who are his subordinates so that in the future the principal can more easily mobilize the teachers. </p></div>
