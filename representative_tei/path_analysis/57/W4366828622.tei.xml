Organizational performance is all about achieving goals through the transformation of inputs into outputs. Organizational performance is also an indicator of the level of achievement that can be achieved and reflects the success of an organization, and is the result achieved from the organization's strategic planning and is always inseparable from the role of managing Organizational Resources. The Resource Based View (RBV) paradigm is one of the paradigms that views that organizations have a dependency on the resources they have, when dealing with rapidly changing global environments. Organizational resources and capabilities that distinguish the resilience or excellence of an organization in achieving organizational goals. The view of the RBV, promises and provides insight into the importance of internal organizational resources in the effort to achieve organizational goals. In this case, the achievement of organizational excellence is outlined in the form of organizational strategic planning aimed at confronting the dynamics of opportunities and the choice of ways to achieve excellence through the utilization of organizational capabilities and resources.</p><p>The work planning program of the organization, it is very much needed by the organization in compiling the organization's activities in order to achieve organizational goals. The strategic planning of an organization is a strategic plan that is arranged systematically to do something for the future or in the future, which giving forms, guides, and directs the achievement of organizational goals. However, an organization's strategic planning that is structured to provide organizational direction for movement through various systematic activities / programs, still requires strategic coordination as a medium for clear information delivery, as well as proper communication and clear division of work to individual personnel in the organizational structure. Coordination in an organization, is the process of integrating goals and activities within a company or organization so that it has harmony in achieving the goals set, with the aim that managers can coordinate human resources and other resources owned by the organization effectively and optimally. Coordination is also expressed as an interdependent management to unite activities that occur within the organization. Based on the perspectives above, the uniqueness of Pushidrosal organization as Hydrographic agency with dual function and role, which is to support military / defense interest and public services as National Hydrographic Agency or government agency which authorized to provide navigational chart for safety of navigation, made Pushidrosal become interesting to be observed. With these two dimensions of role and function, Pushidrosal capabilities must always have balanced and proportionality in those two dimensions internally in its organization which covered the military and public services readiness in responding to the vast changing strategic environment. One of the success is that strategic planning prepared by Pushidrosal organizations must be able to consider aspects of resource utilization by involving all organizational resources, which through mediating strategic coordination is expected to improve the performance of Pushidrosal as an organizations also as national institution and as military institution.</p><p>Based </p></div>

To realize these goals requires a way to achieve them, commonly referred to as strategies. Then plans, policies (policies) to the achievement and program of action. In its application, the above elements may experience changes as a result of not fulfilling the assumptions used in planning, for example because the resources obtained are not in line with expectations. It could also be caused by goals that are too abstract so far from what is expected. "Each organization must have a plan, and for the scope of the organization that is familiar with the term strategic planning, where strategic planning can help to evaluate regularly to achieve goals, help organizations to progress and develop, enlarge market share in the midst of increasingly fierce business competition" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allison &amp; Kaye, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Johnson and Scholes define strategy as "Strategy is the direction and scope of an organization over the long-term: which achieves the advantages for the organization through its configuration of resources within a challenging environment, to meet the needs of markets and to fulfill stakeholder expectations" <ref type="bibr">(Johnson and Scholes, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Strategic Resources Base View</head><p>Organizational resources according to Khusnul influence the determination of strategies made by the organization when competing in the business environment. Organizational capabilities can also add value in customer value chains, product diversification or new market development (Khusnul, 2014). Yang and Conrad explained that Resources Base Theory is concerned with organizational performance heterogeneity. The objective is to bring together a range of internal resources which combined and deployed strategically can create competitive advantage for the organization. Internal resources include various types of capital: Physical capital (buildings; machinery; stock); financial capital (investments; cash reserves; operating capital); human capital (the knowledge, qualifications, skills and experience of employees) and corporate capital (trademarks; patents; systems) (Yang and Conrad, 2011).</p></div>

There is no effect of Strategic Resources Base View on Organization Performance. There is no effect of Strategic Resources Based View on Organization Performance due to the uniqueness of the Pushidrosal organizational status in the process of managing organizational resources, which not only covers aspects of financial resources but also non-financial needs a different approach to be able to achieve organizational performance optimally (Organization Performance) and carry out the vision and mission and the achievement of the goals of the organization as a whole. c. There is the influence of Strategic Planning on Organization Strategic Coordination. Coordination helps implementation of the strategic planning that has been prepared. Coordination become a tool to facilitate synchronization and communication activities between organizational units and externally. Communication in the form of coordination between organizational units aims to form the similar perception and understanding of the organization's vision, mission and objectives to compile the actions needed in order to achieve the objectives and develop the resources needed. d. There is an influence of Strategic Resources Base View on Strategic Coordination. Achievement of organizational goals is realized by efforts to integrate units within the organization to be able to use and manage organizational resources optimally through coordination between units within the organization. Coordination as one of the functions in organizational management cannot be separated from the ability of every manager in utilizing various organizational resources for the achievement of goals through integration and coordination between organizational units. The magnitude of the value of the Operational dimension in the variable Strategic Resource Based View shows the utilization of large organizational resources in Survey and data collection on Hidrography Operations and other operational activities in the form of inter-institutional maritime cooperation. e. There is an influence of Strategic Resources Base View on Strategic Planning. The preparation of Strategic Planning as an organizational guideline requires information about the quality and quantity of organizational resources. Analysis of organizational resources is needed in the strategic planning process; it is to find out the quality and quantity of resources owned by the organization. Environmental scanning is the main indicator to find out the Strategic Planning of the organization. f. From the results of the study, the magnitude of the value of the effectiveness dimension on the Organization Performance variable shows the ability of the organization to achieve organizational goals is carried out through the implementation of programs and activities as planned through strategic coordination at each stage. g. There is the influence of Strategic Planning on Organization Performance mediated by Strategic Coordination. The perception of strategic planning, especially in the interpretation of the organization's vision and ways that must be done by the organization to realize its vision. The success of an organization in determining and achieving its strategic plan requires consideration through mediation at the strategic level (strategic coordination) in order to achieve a formulation of strategic planning that is appropriate (realistic) and measurable (accountable) so that it is able to guarantee to be implemented optimally. h. There is an influence of the Strategic Resources Base View on Organization Performance mediated by Strategic Coordination.</p><p>Pushidrosal as an institution, in realizing its duties and functions as a Military Hydrographic Institute and Civil Hydrographic Institute, is based on the variety and quality output of products in the form of nautical charts, electronic nautical chart and nautical publications that able to support national interests in maritime safety of navigation and maritime environmental application. the resources that an organization has but are also determined by the capabilities of the organization turn the organizational resources into competitive advantages. Coordination as part of the management function is needed to integrate Work Unit units in the Pushidrosal environment and to differentiate the activities and activities of the organization beside to manage coordination externally with the layer of beurocracy with the parent organization and other maritime agencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Implication</head><p>Based on these research results and findings, the theoretical and practical implications can be stated as follows: a. In the preparation of an organization's strategic planning, in addition to have better understanding and orientation of the organization's vision, mission and goals, strategic coordination media needs to be considered as part of determining the phasing of its achievements so that it can be used as guidelines and can be measured for improving organizational performance in achieving the goals set. b. The perspective view on the organizational resources (Resources Base View), directs the management of personnel capabilities at the managerial level to be able to manage and utilize tangible and intangible organizational resources optimally to be directed towards improving organizational performance and through competitive advantage. c. Koordinasi internal sangat signifikan mempengaruhi mediasi antar unit organisasi dalam penyusunan perencanaan dan pengelolaan sumber daya organisasi. Koordinasi eksternal yang efektif dengan induk organisasi juga menentukan pencapaian kinerja organisasi. The internal coordination significantly influences mediation between organizational units in the planning process and management of organizational resources. Effective external coordination with the parent organization also determines the achievement of organizational performance. d. Organizational performance can be a picture of organizational working performance in implementing strategic planning and organizational capabilities in managing organizational resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Managerial Implication</head><p>a. After examining hypotheses and theoretical implications, managerial policies need to be developed which are expected to be able to contribute theoretically to management practices. Some of the implications that can be derived from the results of this study are as follows: b. The results and finding from this study can be used as a material for consideration and evaluation of the dimensions of the assessment of Pushidrosal organization performance and improvement by considering the relationship between Strategic Planning, Strategic Resources Based View, Organizational Performance and Strategic Coordination. c. Identifying obstacles / problems faced in terms of performance evaluation of Pushidrosal through Strategic Planning, Strategic Resources Based, Organizational Performance and Strategic Coordination variables. d. Pushidrosal organizational performance evaluation parameters, as well as Pushidrosal performance measurement parameters are not only based on the perspective of Pushidrosal as a Military Hydrographic Institute but also in terms of implementing the Pushidrosal mandate as a National Hydrographic Institution. e. Based on empirical evidence in this study, it illustrates that the interdependence of the Pushidrosal Organization with its parent organization can affect the achievement of performance optimally in accordance with the dual functions of the organization. The mandate of public services and as one of the national institutions needs to be made as a focus of consideration in determining the form and structure of the Pushidrosal organization in order to be able to shorten the range of bureaucracy in the administration of tasks and functions that represent Government functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Further Research Recommendation</head><p>1. The results of this study can be followed up with studies of other parties related to Pushidrosal organization. 2. Future studies might add more dimensions to the variable Strategic Planning and Strategic Resource Based View with the influence of organizational culture (Organization Culture).</p><p>3. The composition of respondents is determined based on the criteria of personnel who oversee the planning field and involve relevant institutional respondents outside Pushidrosal organization but still have an interrelated interaction between the organization of the activity program with Pushidrosal organization. 4. Indicator variables need to be added by referring to the proportional implementation of Pushidrosal's functions as the National Hydrographic Institute and the Military Hydrographic Institute.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>6 .</head><label>6</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The influence of Strategic Planning on Organizational Performance mediated by Strategic Coordination is obtained from the product of path coefficients p31 and pY3. The test results in this study indicate that there is a direct positive or negative effect that can be proven by the multiplication value of the path coefficient. Strategic Planning path coefficient with Strategic Coordination shows p31 = -0.164 with a significant value of 0.020. Strategic Coordination path coefficient with Organization Performance shows pY3 = 0.164 with a significant value of 0.019. Strategic Planning has an indirect effect on Organization Performance through Strategic Coordination. The examination of Strategic Coordination as a mediating variable and the effect of Strategic Planning on Organizational Performance using the Sobel Test to detect Strategic Coordination as a fully mediating variable of the influence of Strategic Planning on Organizational Performance. T-value of the coefficient ab = -0.281 &lt;ttable = -1.96 indicates that Strategic Coordination is a fully mediating variable of the influence of strategic planning on Organizational Performance. 8) The effect of Strategic Resource Based View on Organizational Performance mediated by Strategic Coordination The effect of Strategic Resource Based View on Organizational Performance mediated by Strategic Coordination is obtained from the product of path coefficients p32 and pY3. The test/examination results indicate there is a direct positive or negative effect that can be proven by the multiplication value of the path coefficient. Path coefficient Strategic Resource Base View with Strategic Coordination shows p32 = 0.221 with a significant value of 0.003. Strategic Coordination path coefficient with Organization Performance shows pY3 = 0.164 with a significant value of 0.019. The purpose of the examination of the Strategic Coordination as a mediating variable influences of the Strategic Resource Based View on Organizational Performance using the Sobel Test is to detect Strategic Coordination as a full mediating variable of the effect of strategic Resource Based Views on Organizational Performance. The value of the tcount coefficient ab = 2.152 &gt; ttable = 1.96 shows that Strategic Coordination is a mediating variable full of the influence of the Strategic Resource-Based Views on Organizational Performance.</figDesc></figure>

The Strategic Coordination variable influences the Organization Performance variable. It can be seen from the magnitude of the path coefficient value of table = 1.975 and at the concluded rejecting hypothesis H0 and accepting hypothesis H1. Thus, it can be said that Strategic Coordination affects Organizational Performance. 4) Strategic Resources Base View Influence on Strategic Coordination. Strategic Resource Based View influence Strategic Coordination. This can be seen from the magnitude of the value of the path coefficient = 0.221 with t = 2.798 apparently greater than the value of t table = 1.975 and at a significance level = 0. 006/2 &lt;0.05, it is concluded rejecting the H0 hypothesis and accepting the H1 hypothesis. This means that Strategic Resource Based View Influences Strategic Coordination. 5) Strategic Planning Influence on Strategic Coordination. From the hyphothesis examination, the results found that Strategic Planning influences on Strategic Coordination. This can be seen from the -0.164 with tcount = -2.072 it turns out to be smaller than the value of table = -1.975 and at the significance level = 0. 040/2 &lt;0.05, it is concluded rejecting the hypothesis H0 and accept the H1 hypothesis. Or it can be interpreted that Strategic Planning influences Strategic Coordination. Hypothesis test results explain that Strategic Planning influences Strategic Coordination. 6) Effect of Strategic Resources Based View on Strategic Strategic Planning. Strategic Resources Base View variable influences the Strategic Planning variable. This can be seen from the magnitude of the value of the path count = 2.604 turned out to be greater than the value of ttable = 1.975 and at the can be stated rejecting the hypothesis H0 and accept the H1 hypothesis. This means that Strategic Resources Base View influences Strategic Planning.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Table.5.
