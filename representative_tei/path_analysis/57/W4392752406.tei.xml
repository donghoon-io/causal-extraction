<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>With the vigorous development of digital technology and industrial Internet, the transformation strategy featuring digitalization, low carbonization and multi-win cooperation becomes a key choice for the construction of emerging energy systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Digital transformation enables energy enterprises to use digital technologies to optimize supply chain efficiency, and create new production models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Along with the digital transformation process of Chinese energy enterprises, some large state-owned energy enterprises have made initial progress. However, they still face many challenges in their development, such as data application obstacles and the formation of synergies on digital platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The development of digitalization level in energy enterprises is unbalanced. Therefore, exploring the scientific and efficient path and providing digital transformation strategies of digital transformation for different types of energy enterprises has become the key to speed up the high quality development of the energy system.</p><p>Energy enterprise is an important basic industry of national economy. Reconstructing enterprises' core competitiveness through digital enabling becomes a new impetus for the transformation and upgrading of China's energy system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Some scholars have studied the meaning of digital transformation from the perspectives of business model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. And some scholars mainly define the connotation of digital transformation from the perspective of industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>or enterprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The above research provides a rich perspective for understanding the meaning of digital transformation. Analyzing the digital transformation of enterprises from the influence degree of internal and external factors can further reveal the types and development paths of digital transformation.</p><p>As for the research on the digital transformation path, scholars have divided digital transformation into two paths from the focus of transformation: one is the path of production automation, another is the user experience-oriented path <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Or from the perspective of products, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Frank et al. (2019)</ref> puts forward the path of synergistic development of digital technology and service innovation ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Or according to the characteristics of the transformation stage, the enterprise digital transformation can be divided into three transformation stages: product or service digitization, process digitization, business model and organizational model digitization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, few previous studies have carried out targeted path design and its influencing factors based on the characteristics of an industry. In addition, the scientific quantitative method of path design needs to be further expanded.</p><p>As for the research on the energy enterprise digital transformation, on the one hand, existing researches focus on the impact of digital transformation of energy enterprises on enterprises. For example, Ren and Li (2023) analyzed the impact of digital transformation mediated by green technology innovation on the financial performance of Chinese energy enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Zhang et al. (2022)</ref> studied the impact of digital economy on energy conservation and emission reduction of energy enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. On the other hand, some scholars analyzed the key elements in the process of digital transformation of energy enterprises, such as the physical environment and time factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.However, the existing researches lack the path design promotion strategy for the stage of digital transformation.</p><p>In view of this, this paper starts with the driving factors of energy enterprise, uses The Strategic Position and Action Evaluation(SPACE) analysis method to design different types of digital transformation paths for energy enterprises. It hopes to promote the digital transformation of energy enterprises and lay the foundation for the high quality development of the energy system.</p></div>

Therefore, The digital transformation of energy enterprises is driven by many internal and external factors as shown in Figure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Internal driving factor</head><p>As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the internal driving factors for energy enterprises digital transformation include resource, capability and organization in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. As the key element, digital infrastructure can be used to improve the operational efficiency of an enterprise ' s overall supply chain. The investment of digital capital can ensure the sustainability of energy enterprises'digital upgrading. The quantity and quality of enterprise digital talents can help energy enterprises optimize organizational structure, improve decisionmaking efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The digital capability is the comprehensive embodiment of energy enterprises ' digital technology application ability and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The application ability of enterprise digital technology reflects its technology transformation and application in energy production. The enterprise's digital profitability is the economic performance and direct output of enterprises' digital transformation.</p><p>The change of organizational management mode can enable energy enterprises to make more scientific and effective decisions. Upgrading of digital management and organizational structures can facilitate communication and knowledge flow in enterprises, and the efficiency of work cohesion can be improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">External driving factor</head><p>As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the external driving factors for digital transformation of energy enterprises can be divided into macro and industrial environment, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The government's preferential tax policies can help ease the cost and pressure of the digital transformation of energy enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Digital capital provides guarantee for the introduction of digital infrastructure. The optimization of the market environment reflects the degree of digital services provided by the government and market management departments.</p><p>The industry growing market demand can drive energy enterprises to implement digital strategies. To some extent, the overall digitalization of the industry determines the degree of digital resources and technologies that can be obtained by the enterprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Type of energy enterprise digital transformation</head><p>As different driving factors have different impacts on enterprises ' digital transformation. Therefore, according to the role of internal and external driving factors, energy enterprise digital transformation can be divided into two types, namely, internal-driven and external-driven.</p><p>Internal-driven digital transformation means that the main driving force of energy enterprise transformation comes from inside the enterprise. Enterprises take the initiative to develop digital transformation strategies based on the evaluation of their existing resources and availability of resources, the learning and application ability of all aspects and the adaptability of organizational structure.</p><p>External-driven digital transformation means that the main driving force of energy enterprise transformation comes from the outside. Due to the guidance of government policies in the macro environment, as well as the influence of market demand and competition requirements within the industry, the energy enterprise passively adopt the digital transformation strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model construction of energy enterprise digital transformation path 3.1 Design of SPACE model for digital transformation path of energy enterprise</head><p>Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE) method is a method of strategic position and action evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. It provides reference for enterprise to make strategic decisions. Based on the theoretical basis of the internal and external driving factors for the digital transformation of energy enterprise, this paper constructs a SPACE model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the conceptual model: As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the evaluation index system of internal and external driving factors for the digital transformation of energy enterprises should be constructed first. The entropy weight method is used to evaluate the driving factors scores of energy enterprise, thus identifying the types of enterprise digital transformation. Then, according to the position of the identification and evaluation results in the SPACE model, different types of scientific and accurate digital transformation paths are designed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Construction of digital transformation driver evaluation index system</head><p>According to the analysis in 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 above, the evaluation index system of the internal and external driving factors of the digital transformation is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>

The coordinate diagram of point P (x, y) in the SPACE model can be obtained in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. According to the regional characteristics of Ⅳ-Ⅵ in the SPACE model, when point P (x, y) is located in the Ⅵ region, it poses a great threat to the enterprise in the environment faced by the external enterprise, and has a small driving force for the enterprise's digital transformation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1 1 m i i i P pw   <label>(7)</label></formula><p>The enterprise is still in embryonic stage. When point P (x, y) is located in region Ⅴ, energy enterprises are faced with more opportunities outside, which can provide the required technology and resources for enterprises.

When point P (x, y) is located in area Ⅳ, the external environment of energy enterprises can meet the needs of enterprises for digital transformation, and promote the improvement of their own digital ability by using the external environment. Its digital transformation is in mature stage. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation results of driving factors</head><p>According to the calculation of driving factor evaluation proposed in 3.3 above, entropy weight method is first used to calculate the weights of internal and external driving factor indicators respectively. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, resources (0.568030) are the most influential among the internal driving factors. Among the resources, digital talents (0.288318) inject the blood of digital innovation into enterprises. Digital infrastructure (0.194491) lay the foundation for the implementation of enterprise digital transformation.</p><p>According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, the government financial support for enterprises (0.438148) and the market demand within the industry (0.229727) are the important external influencing factors for the digital transformation of enterprises.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Comparative analysis of external drivers of digital transformation</head><p>Traditional energy enterprises and new energy enterprises are respectively calculated to compare the importance of external drivers of digital transformation in different industries. The calculated weight comparison results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>, among traditional energy enterprises, government financial support has a greater impact than that of new energy enterprises. Traditional energy enterprises have mature energy exploitation and sales business, and their capital chain is relatively stable. Among the new energy enterprises, the impact of government policy support and industrial environment is greater. This is because there are many development paths for new energy enterprise, and its development direction is more dependent on the guidance of government policies, as well as the overall development of the industry and customer demand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Comparative analysis of internal drivers of digital transformation</head><p>Compare the importance of internal drivers of digital transformation in traditional and new energy enterprises. The calculated results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, digital technology application capability has a relatively high impact. This is because the traditional technology of traditional energy enterprises is relatively stable in the industry. The application of digital technology innovation in enterprises can help enterprises innovate, so as to improve the digital level of enterprises. In the digital transformation of new energy enterprises, the importance of enterprise scale is greater than that of traditional energy enterprises. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Evaluation results of driving factors</head><p>According to formula ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">7</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), the evaluation scores of internal driving scores (P1) and external driving scores (P2) of all energy enterprises can be calculated. Taking new energy enterprises as an example, the calculation results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. According to the evaluation results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, there are 18 internal-driven digital transformation enterprises. There are 32 external-driven digital transformation enterprises. It can be seen that fewer enterprises currently choose active digital transformation. This is due to the industrial characteristics of energy enterprises and the overall development of the current energy system, and the choice of active digital transformation requires greater investment and risk. The use of external environment to obtain digital resources, so as to gradually improve the digital business capability has become the choice of most energy enterprises.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Internal-driven digital transformation path design and promotion strategy</head><p>There are two types of enterprises applicable to this path: one is energy enterprises with a certain scale. They have high visibility and brand degree, large size, complex structure. The other is to deal with new small energy companies set up in the digital economy. They are younger and smaller, but they are usually more innovative. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> shows the path framework. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Defensive path</head><p>In the embryonic stage of internal-driven digital transformation, that is, when they are located in region Ⅰ of the SPACE model, enterprises should take the defensive path. At this stage, energy enterprises should not take radical risks and consolidate their business foundation.</p><p>Enterprises should strengthen the construction of digital transformation infrastructure, strengthen information security, improve technical standards, and prevent various risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Developmental path</head><p>In the growth stage of internal-driven digital transformation of energy enterprises, that is, when they are located in region II of SPACE model, the enterprise should implement the developmental path. Firstly, the enterprise can build a digital application platform that gathers energy digital elements to provide hardware support for the digital transformation of energy enterprises. Secondly, enterprises should accelerate the promotion of digital technology innovation ability of energy enterprises to enhance their core competitive position in the industrial chain. Finally, it is necessary to accelerate the construction of energy digital talent team to enhance personnel's digital technology application ability. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Competitive path</head><p>In the mature stage of internal-driven digital transformation, that is, when energy enterprises are located in the region Ⅲ of SPACE model, enterprises should take the competitive path. At this stage, energy enterprises should actively introduce heterogeneous subjects to enhance competitive advantages through business remodeling. Within the enterprise, it is necessary to improve and innovate the organizational model and operation mechanism of the integration of digital technology and business. Outside the enterprise, strengthen the cross-regional technical cooperation with other energy enterprises, give full play to the advantages of heterogeneous subjects and realize collaborative innovation.</p></div>

At this stage, energy enterprises need to use external platforms to complete data management and gradually form a digital value creation model. In addition, it should make full use of external digital resources to enhance its digital innovation capabilities, improve the own digital technology application capabilities, and ensure the smooth progress of the next stage of digital transformation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Active transformation path</head><p>In the mature stage of external-driven digital transformation of energy enterprises, that is, when they are located in area Ⅳ of SPACE model, energy enterprises take the active transformation path. At this stage, energy enterprises should adjust the initiative of digital strategy according to their own situation, strengthen participation in the construction of large data centers and digital application platforms in the industry. At the same time, it should transform and upgrade the value chain to multi-entity parallel and coordinated development.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Under the background of digital wave, the digital transformation is not only a strategic choice to support the energy industry to achieve the overall national development goals, but also an inevitable choice to achieve the goal of "carbon neutrality". Taking energy enterprises as the research object, this paper breaks through the previous research perspective of digital transformation path, and uses entropy weight method and SPACE model to evaluate and identify the types of digital transformation of some new energy enterprises from the perspectives of internal and external driving factors of digital transformation of energy enterprises, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis. This provides strategic guidance for energy enterprises to scientifically match the digital transformation path and development strategy. The main work and conclusions of the research are as follows:</p><p>(1) The digital transformation of energy enterprise is the transformation and upgrading of energy value creation mode under the comprehensive action of internal and external driving factors. According to the influence degree of internal and external driving factors, digital transformation of energy enterprises can be divided into two types: internal-driven type and external-driven type.</p><p>(2) The influence degree of internal and external driving factors of digital transformation of energy enterprises, traditional energy enterprises and new energy enterprises is analyzed respectively. Across the sample of energy companies, digital talent is the internal driver with the highest impact. Digital capital investment is the most influential external driver. The most influential factors of new energy enterprises are market demand and enterprise scale.</p><p>(3) It provides a scientific method for energy enterprises to determine the types and paths of digital transformation. In this paper, entropy weight method is used to calculate the evaluation scores of internal and external driving factors of 107 energy enterprises based on the data of their digital transformation. According to the influence of driving factors, the digital transformation of energy enterprises is divided into three stages: embryonic stage, growth stage and maturity stage. Each stage in the SPACE model reflects the type of digital transformation and the magnitude of opportunities and threats in the environment.</p><p>(4) The digital transformation paths of internal-driven and external-driven in energy enterprises are designed. According to the evaluation results of driving factors of energy enterprises digital transformation and their SPACE model characteristics, the internal-driven digital transformation path is divided into defensive, developmental and competitive path. The external-driven digital transformation path is divided into maintenance, flexible adaptive and active transformation path.</p><p>Of course, there are some limitations in this study. In this study, the stage of energy enterprise digital transformation is not comprehensive only from the position of the influence degree of driving factors in the SPACE model. In the future research on digital transformation path of energy enterprises, a more comprehensive and systematic index system should be constructed to evaluate the stage of digital transformation quantitatively. It should provide a more scientific and systematic method and reference basis for enterprises to identify the digital development level and make targeted improvement strategies. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Digital transformation driving factors of energy enterprises</figDesc></figure>

At this stage, energy enterprises should maintain their own advantages and further wait and see the development trend of industrial environment. On the one hand, the direction of digital transformation should be clearly defined within the enterprise. The digital transformation strategy is planned systematically according to the development situation of driving factors. On the other hand, it should observe the process of industry digitization and seize opportunities, and strive to overcome the obstacles brought by the external environment of digital transformation.</figDesc></figure>
