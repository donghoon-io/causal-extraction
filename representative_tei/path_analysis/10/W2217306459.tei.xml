<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION Computation of Shortest Path</head><p>) (SP is one of the most fundamental problems in graph theory. Both in operations research over and above theoretical computer science areas, the Single Source Shortest Path Problem ) (SSSPP is an extremely well-studied problem because of its broad applicability in a wide range of domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The wide spectrum of its applications ranges from the routing problem in communication networks to robot motion planning, highway and power line engineering etc. Many optimization problems solved by dynamic programming or more complicated matrix searching techniques, such as the 0/1 knapsack problem, construction of optimal inscribed polygons, sequence alignment in molecular biology, length-limited Huffman coding etc, are expressed as shortest path problems. These also include scheduling problems such as critical path computation in PERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> charts. Moreover, the shortest-path problem as well has numerous variations such as the minimum weight problem, the quickest path problem etc. Our motivation for focusing on the algorithmic processes of these shortest path problems with few distinct edge lengths initiates from a problem that arises in social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The Shortest Path Problems ) (SPPs have been, and still is, investigated by many researchers and mathematicians. With the rapid advancements and developments in communication, computer science and transportation systems, more variants of the SPPs have appeared. Some of these are the traveling salesman problem, K-shortest paths, constrained shortest-path problem, multi-objective shortest path problem, network flow problems, and so forth including our key SSSPP [2, 4, 8]. In this paper, we propose a model 2 3 </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Conclusion.</head><p>The Bellman-Ford's approach for shortest path problems has come into practice with different tools. The approach in this paper is re-investigated with adjacency matrix selection in associate least running time. The proposed model ) (SPL from a given source (starting) vertex s to each other vertex v in G can be defined in (1) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">     ∞ ∃  →  = otherwise v to s from path a if v s p W v s SPL p , , ) : ) ( min( ) , (<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">&gt; =&lt; k v v v p ,..... , 2 1 is a Shortest Path ) (SP from vertex 1 v to vertex n k v k ≤ ≤ 1 ,</formula><p>. Therefore, SPL (also termed weight) of p is the sum of the weight of its constituent edges. Thus, ) , (</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">- = + = k i i i v v W p W (2)<label>) ( 1 1 1 ∑</label></formula><p>As a consequence, SPL from vertex s to v in G means any path p with weight, ) , ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( v s SPL p W = [4, 11, 12].</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. NEGATIVE WEIGHT CYCLE</head><p>We assume that all vertices are reachable from s otherwise unreachable vertices can be deleted from G in a linear-time at preprocessing steps. In some instances of SSSPP , there may be edges whose weights are negative. If the graph G has either no negative-weight edges, or no reachable negative-weight cycles from s then V v ∈ ∀ , the ) , ( v s SPL remains well defined during computation even if it has a negative value; otherwise SPLs are not well defined. No path from s to a vertex on the cycle in this case can be a shortest path and a lesser-weight path can always be found that follows the proposed shortest path and then traverses the negative- weight cycle. If there is a negative-weight cycle on some path from vertex s to v , we define -∞ = ) , ( v s SPL . Illustration in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> exemplifies the effect of negative weights and negative-weight cycles on shortest path weights. Within each vertex its shortest-path weight from source s is shown. Vertices e and f appear in a negative-weight cycle reachable from s , so they have shortest-path weights of ∞ -. Because vertex g is reachable from a vertex whose shortest- path weight is ∞ -, it, too, has a shortest-path weight of ∞ -. Vertices h , i , and j are not reachable from s , and so their shortest-path weights are ∞ , even though they lie on a negative-weight cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. PROPOSED WORK</head><p>The literature on the SSSPP is large, since computing shortest paths in a given graph (both directed and undirected) can be done in various ways. For example, consider   <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. The algorithm maintains n partitions at most of the n vertices. Each partition consists of each vertex v and its corresponding adjacent vertices. Each partition acts as respective node of our ograph Pr with node s as its root. Still, these n partitions can be sub-grouped into three states:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">] [ = s SPL and ∞ = ] [v SPL for every V s v ∈ ≠</formula><p>• Unlabeled Vertices: those with infinite provisional costs.</p><p>• Labeled Vertices: those with finite provisional cost whose minimum cost is so far unknown.</p><p>• Scanned Vertices: those whose minimum cost is known.</p><p>We start with s as labeled root node and all other vertices are as unlabeled. The Prograph Based Shortest Path Algorithm named as () _ _ Pr Path Shortest ograph described below executes comparable to Bellman-Ford approach to some extent.</p><p>A variety of methods and algorithms are available for the solution of SSSPPs depending on the nature of specific problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref>. Because of the nature of our problem, the algorithm suggested in this paper consists of the following steps and repeats till all vertices are scanned: <ref type="figure">Algorithm: Prograph_Shortest_Path (G,</ref><ref type="figure">E,</ref><ref type="figure">V,</ref><ref type="figure">W</ref> // determines number of nodes in prograph <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> Repeat for j = 1 to |E| <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> If i = Source(j) ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) Continue ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) Else <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> i= Source(j) (12) M++ ( <ref type="formula">13</ref> is stopped. This checking is done Z (a constant) times. This Z naturally is reasonably a very small non-negative integer number. Generally Z is 2. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) Reachable tentative path lengths from source vertex s to other vertices v are computed through lines 21 -43. These relaxations will be continued till Y X = .</p><p>Thus, overall running time complexity of the algorithm executes in Θ(Z|V||E|) time. Since Z is a constant and has numerical value 2 in general, thus the proposed algorithm runs in Θ(|V||E|) time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section we will now look at an example of how our suggested algorithm works on a weighted digraph shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref> to solve SSSPP in optimal way with ograph Pr  When there are no cycles of negative length, we know that there is a shortest path between two vertices.

So, path length for s is 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">] 1 [ ] 1 [ = = SPL V SPL .</formula><p>For simplicity, we need to have SPL from this s to remaining vertices. Typical initial configuration of the ograph Pr would look like as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>. Similarly, it is applicable to other nodes. However, each node each is related in top-down manner. Tentative path length value of a vertex in a node of the ograph Pr will be treated with its present value in next node if the vertex appears. But source vertex s would not be appeared as adjacent of the current</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Vi \ Vj V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V1 0 4 ∞ 5 14 W[i][j] = V2 2 0 8 7 ∞ V3 8 ∞ 0 1 3 V4 ∞ 9 5 0 2 V5 ∞ ∞ 7 3 0</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. COMPARISON STUDY</head><p>The 2 3 P S model could be solved easily with BFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref> graph traversal algorithm under a special case when all weights are 1 or shortest paths with unweighted graphs <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Theoretically, most efficient known algorithm for the problem was devised by Dijkstra in the year 1959 and since then it is known as the Dijkstra's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>. It is believed that first polynomial run time algorithm for Shortest Path Problem which is based on Greedy approach is this Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's original algorithm runs in O(n 2 ) time. Later the algorithm has been implemented more efficiently in O((m + n)logn) ≈ O(mlogn) time. However, this algorithm does not work on the digraphs with negative edge weights. Richard Bellman, Samuel End and Lester Ford Jr. solved the underlined problem with more powerful approach called Dynamic Programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>. And the algorithm they devised is popular as Bellman-Ford algorithm. It runs in Θ(n 3 ) time and Θ(mn) time whenever adjacency matrix and adjacency list are used correspondingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. Although few non-negative edge weights have been considered in the proposed 2 3 P S model, it allows negative edge weights without any "Loss of Generality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> of the Dynamic Programming Approach. Therefore, this algorithm which also runs in Θ(mn) time using adjacency matrix, should be considered preferable due to its open acceptability and powerfulness of Dynamic Programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and superb easy understandable way to represent solution using ograph Pr . The illustration computes a shortest-path tree similar to BFS tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>Our optimization technique is to detect vertices with exact distance labels from source vertex s . It should be noted that the proposed algorithm is competitive to algorithms used commonly in practice for shortest path computations. We implemented our approach without adjacency list representation of cost matrix and are able to estimate overall complexity in Θ(|V||E|) time. Two lists X and Y in this paper </p></div>			</div>
