<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Ab initio kinetics studies play a crucial role in deepening our understanding of reaction mechanisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> The most reliable but still computationally costly approach considers a systematical exploration of reaction pathways between equilibrium states, resulting in the creation of a reaction path network. Within this network, individual nodes correspond to equilibrium states (EQ), while their connecting edges represent elementary chemical transformations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Each EQ represents a local minimum on the Potential Energy Surface (PES) whereas each Transition State (TS) represents a saddle point along a reaction path between two EQs. As such, each edge of the reaction path network is associated with a TS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) algorithm applies artificial molecular forces to overcome energy barriers, providing a powerful tool to systematically explore reaction pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Usually, the compilation of all reaction paths generated by AFIR leads to particularly large reaction path networks. For example, a recent AFIR-based reaction path search on a 20-atoms system led to the generation of 1.2x10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> equilibrium states (EQ) and 4.5x10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> distinct geometries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> As more complex reactions are being considered, the size of networks is anticipated to grow even larger. Usually, to obtain accurate results, such a PES exploration is ideally performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) to assess the structures' energy and forces. This represents the main bottleneck of the approach, as nearly all the computation time is dedicated to DFT calculations. In order to accelerate these calculations and to treat large-size systems, Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) has recently been employed as a rapid and cost-effective alternative to the traditionally expensive DFT calculations, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Recently, we reported an AFIR-based path search for the hydrogenation of ethylene catalyzed by a model Wilkinson's catalyst, using DFT, xTB and NNP methods, and discussed various aspects of PES machine-learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> In particular, we have demonstrated that a pure NNP architecture should be coupled to a physics-based potential, such as a semi-empirical xTB method, in order to greatly reduce the generation of broken 3D structures. AFIR-based kinetics studies automatically explore many reaction paths, and therefore, typically yield large reaction path networks. Traditionally, a reaction path network is visualized by a connected graph in which each node represents a 2D or 3D molecular structure and each edge connecting the nodes corresponds to a chemical transformation. Each 3D structure can be characterized by its atomic coordinates, chemical bonding topology and some properties (potential energy, charge on selected atom, etc.). However, a graph-based network containing several hundred or thousand nodes hardly allows to analyze such Structure-Property Relationships (SPR). Moreover, direct comparisons of reaction path networks calculated with the help of different theoretical methods are challenging.</p><p>The disconnectivity graph is one of conventional approach to visualize a complex energy landscape represented by many elementary steps, and has been utilized in cluster and biomolecular systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> As an alternative method of reaction data visualization and analysis, we have suggested to use the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM), describing the data distribution on a 2-dimensional map. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> For the reaction path network of hydrogenation using Wilkinson's catalyst, it has been shown that GTM possesses the abilities to cluster structures that share the same 2D representation, to visualize potential energy surface and to provide an insight on the reaction path exploration as a function of time. However, many aspects of GTM application were out of the scope of that previous study.</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate how GTM can be used for detailed SPR analysis and investigate its capability to compare reaction path networks obtained from different potentials.</p><p>We also introduce new Distance Distribution Descriptors which have some advantage over previously used Pairwise Sorted Distances-Based descriptors to encode 3D structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>We used four datasets generated in our previous study using DFT and NNP(+xTB) for potential energy assessment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> The DFT dataset contains 118240 geometries, including 6298 approximate TSs and 2049 EQs, and their associated potential energy and gradients, computed at the RωB97X-D/Def2-SVP level of theory, see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. These geometries correspond to the reaction paths for the 6298 elementary processes explored with the AFIR method. These AFIR explorations were performed using the kinetics-based navigation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> which controls the automated pathway search based on an index called traffic volume. The traffic volume represents the amount of reaction flux through each EQ, and thus preferentially finds kinetically important EQs and elementary steps.</p><p>The conventional alkenes hydrogenation by H2, catalyzed by the original Wilkinson's catalyst (i.e., RhCl(PPh3)3), involves several steps subsequent to the initial PPh3 elimination: oxidative addition of H2 to the metal complex; alkene coordination; alkene insertion; and reductive elimination of alkane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> Earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> , we have examined the reaction using the simplified catalyst RhCl(PH3)3. We found that at the first step, the ethylene coordinates to the catalyst producing RhCl(PH3)3(C2H4); followed by the elimination of a PH3 ligand. Then the oxidative addition of H2, ethylene insertion and reductive elimination of ethane proceed with two PH3 ligands.</p><p>Finally, the initial RhCl(PH3)3 catalyst is regenerated, completing the catalytic cycle.  In order to accelerate the network expansion, a Neural Network Potential (NNP) associated with the semi-empirical xTB method was suggested to approximate the DFT potential energy surface at a much lower cost. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> Three NNP(+xTB) models (simply called NNP-xx in the following) were trained on the first 20%, 50% and 80% of the DFT generated dataset, respectively (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Level of theory</head><p>GTM is a method of non-linear mapping of data points from a multi-dimensional chemical space to two-dimensional space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> The probabilistic topology-preserving characteristic of GTM has made it a popular tool for data analysis and chemical visualization. The algorithm inserts a two-dimensional "rubber sheet"-like manifold into the initial descriptor space in order to reproduce the best data by a simulated probability distribution function. The latter is represented by an ensemble of Gaussian functions located at the nodes of two-dimensional grid related to the manifold. Distortion of the manifold is controlled within the limits of a predefined set of parameters. Finally, the molecules are projected with a given probability onto each node of the manifold, which then is then projected onto a two-dimensional latent space in which a molecular structure is associated with one or more nodes.</p><p>For each molecular structure 𝑀 mapped onto GTM, a probability matrix 𝑅(𝑀, 𝐾) is calculated which gives the probability of 𝑀 residing in node 𝐾, i.e., the responsibility of node 𝐾 related to structure 𝑀. Generally, the responsibilities related to a molecular structure may be distributed across several nodes. The overall probability to see a structure anywhere on the map, i.e., ∑ 𝑅(𝑀, 𝐾) In order to visualize a given property distribution on GTM, the weighted average of properties of all structures associated with any particular node is used to "color" the manifold, resulting into a fuzzy property landscape, where the projected property can be energy, error of energy prediction or relative population of the structures of the given type. The responsibilities related to molecular structures are used as weights. A property landscape can be used to build classification and regression models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>: GTM preparation workflow. Some studied molecular systems are encoded by 3D descriptors and represented as objects in N-dimensional space. A flexible manifold fits the data following by fuzzy projection of the datapoints onto the manifold. For each datapoint, the mapping algorithm calculates the probabilities (responsibilities) to its projection into the nodes of rectangular grid superposed with the manifold. Unbending the manifold results in a 2D map.</p><p>Location of a datapoint on the map is calculated as a gravity center of the responsibilities' distribution.</p><p>In this work, the manifold was developed on the frame set of 10 4 randomly selected structures. Either Pairwise Sorted Distances-Based (PSDB) descriptors or Distance Distribution descriptors (D 3 ) were used to encode the 3D structures. An evolutionary algorithm-based approach was implemented in order to optimize the parameters required for GTM setup: number of nodes, number of radial basis functions (RBF) defining the manifold and their width, the regularization coefficient. The optimal set of GTM parameters defined a Pareto front of locally best solutions corresponding to (i) minimal energy prediction error and</p><p>(ii) maximal informational entropy.</p><p>To compute energy prediction errors, a 3-folds cross validation procedure was employed.</p><p>Sequentially, two-third of all the structures was used to build the energy landscape whereas the remaining one-third was then used as test set for which the predicted energy values were compared to related DFT values. The process was repeated three times, so that each molecular structure gets a predicted energy value. </p></div>

The molecular system RhClP3C2H15 considered in the simplified Wilkinson's catalyst-catalyzed hydrogenation reaction contains 22 atoms. Thus, the number of interatomic distances and, hence, the length of the PSDB descriptor vector is 231.</p></div>

License: CC BY-NC 4.0</p><p>During the GTM manifold training, the D 3 parameters were systematically varied (cutoff from 2 to 10 Å and number of bins k from 5 to 30). The parameters values cutoff=3 Å and k=30 found in the grid search were retained for further calculations. For each set of D 3 parameters, GTM parameters were optimized by a dedicated Genetic Algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the one corresponding to minimal energy prediction error and maximum entropy at the Pareto front were selected.</p><p>The resulting density and energy landscapes obtained with both PSDB and D 3 descriptors look similar (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>). The PSDB-based energy landscape provides with the slightly better accuracy in cross-validation in energy predictions compared to the D 3 -based landscape: RMSE = 44.2 kJ/mol (PSDB) and 48.9 kJ/mol (D 3 ). On the other hand, the density landscapes show that the data are distributed more homogeneously on the D 3 -based map, therefore, only landscapes built on D 3 descriptors-based manifold will be further analyzed. number of 2D structural motifs (122) observed in the DFT simulations (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Examples of overlapping structural motifs are given in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> in Supporting Information.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>). On the maps, the color code shows highly (in blue) and low (dark red) populated areas by the given structures. representative for a given 2D motif is always located in the low energy area (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>). This is not surprising because the Boltzmann-like weighting of descriptors favors contribution of lowenergy species.</p><p>The high-energy areas contain chemically unreasonable structures, for instance, those with a deeply unfavorable isolated Cl -in vacuum (zone A) or H2 and HCl formation from the catalyst decomposition (zone C), or an hypervalent P with trigonal bipyramidal shape (zone B), or even displaying a C-C dissociation (zone D), see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref>. The class landscapes for alkanes/alkenes presence and their coordination states shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref> exhibit remarkable discriminatory power, partitioning the GTM into three distinct region featuring uncoordinated ethylene or ethane (the upper left and upper right areas, respectively) and species with coordination of at least one carbon atom to the metal (bottom area). This suggest that GTM inherently produced a chemically meaningful mapping, that can be used for a chemical feature-based characterizations. As an example, here, by projecting and following each reaction step on the class landscapes of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref>, it appears clearly that the reaction starts with a free ethylene, then proceeds to its coordination and hydrogenation (while still being coordinated), followed finally by the release of a free ethane. With the appropriate class landscapes, a similar analysis could be performed based on any chemically relevant feature/property (e.g., the oxidation state of Rh or partial atomic charges on selected atoms).</p><p><ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zn0g0">https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zn0g0</ref> ORCID: <ref type="url" target="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1886-925X">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1886-925X</ref> Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monitoring the DFT network expansion.</head><p>In addition to "static" data distribution, we investigated the chronological expansion of the reaction path network driven by the AFIR algorithm. For this purpose, the manifold constructed for the entire DFT reaction path network was used to project the first n% (n=1, 5, 20, 35, 50 and 100) portions of path structures discovered in the DFT/AFIR run initiated from the reactants structure. Each portion corresponds to a "chronological milestone" of the reaction path network expansion. In such a way, 6 class landscapes showing data projected at the current chronological milestone compared to the previous ones (e.g., 5% compared to 1%) have been built, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>, left. On the "1%" landscape, the structures predominantly occupy the reactant area, whereas at 10%, the network explores the steps 1-5 zones. The "20%" landscape shows that the network not only encompasses the area related to the structures of step 6 but also reaches the product area. At 35% of the network expansion, the product area becomes dense. The 50% and 100% landscapes show that the search is shifting from exploration to refinement, mainly associated with the discovery of new reaction pathways in the products area.</p><p><ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zn0g0">https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zn0g0</ref> ORCID: <ref type="url" target="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1886-925X">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1886-925X</ref> Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NNP-based reaction path network</head><p>Similar "chronological" analysis has been performed for three reaction path networks NNP-20, NNP-50 and NNP-80 obtained in NNP/AFIR runs using the model trained, respectively, on the first 20%, 50% and 80% of the DFT network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>). The "current/previous" class landscapes show that the NNP-20 network exploration significantly differs from the DFT, NNP-50 and NNP-80 ones. Thus, even in the first 50% of the network expansion, the NNP-20 model was not able to reach the zone of products, which can be explained by the fact that the training set contained just a few structures from the step 6 and product areas.</p><p>For more detailed analyses of the NNP networks, a series of regression landscapes were prepared, showing the distribution of predicted energies and the absolute error of energy predictions; as well as classification landscapes for overlapped DFT and NNP networks. They show that the NNP-20 trained on 20% DFT set generates many high energy structures mostly populating the areas poorly covered by its training dataset (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>, top left). This observation is consistent with the generation of unreasonable geometries outside of the training domain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">12</ref>). Finally, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> (bottom left) shows a large discrepancy in the chemical spaces populated by the DFT/AFIR search and the NNP-20/AFIR search. When combining this landscape with the time evolution in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>, we observe that some of the regions, which are very predominantly populated by NNP-20 geometries, correspond to areas that seems to "capture" the exploration at the expense of other regions of interest during the search. We believe these observations to characterize the presence of areas with deep (or even apparently unbounded) energy underestimations in the trained potential. Indeed, due to both the gradientfollowing nature of AFIR and the exploration focus around apparently kinetically accessible regions, the AFIR method is prone to preferentially sample these unphysical regions.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the DFT manifold is poorly adapted to describe NNP-20 data distribution, which is proved by loglikelyhood distribution analysis shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">13</ref>.  </p></div>

By combining different GTM-based property landscapes, one can identify regions of chemical interest, perform fast and intuitive comparison of different reaction path networks and monitor the reaction path exploration.GTM is a dimensionality reduction method and, therefore, its efficiency strongly depends on the choice of descriptors encoding 3D molecular structures. Proposed in this work, the Distance Distribution descriptors (D 3 ) are alignment-free and invariant by rotation, translation, and permutation of atoms with the same atomic number. The descriptor vector size depends on the number of atom types in the considered molecular structure, but, unlike the previously reported PSBD descriptors, not on the total number of atoms. The D 3 descriptors, on one hand, allow to distinguish different molecular structures, and, on the other hand, to group on GTM structures possessing similar geometries.Since GTM manifold delineates a frame of the explored reaction space, a retrospective analysis allows to monitor reaction path network expansion. This analysis shows how quickly the path search reaches the kinetically relevant reaction species and provides an information about data density in different areas of reaction space. The latter is important to draw conclusion concerning the suitability of generated DFT data at the given step for the training of NNP model. This study demonstrates that GTM is a unique tool for comparing different reaction path networks. The map accommodating two networks (e.g, DFT and NNP) clearly shows both overlapping areas and zones occupied exclusively by one particular network. If the manifold is built on DFT data, the loglikelihood parameter helps to identify the NNP "novelties", i.e., structures which significantly differ from the DFT generated ones.Last but not least, compared to the conventional graph-based representation, GTM doesn't explicitly show the reaction pathways. That's why the combination of the two above approaches for the visualization and analysis of large reaction path networks looks very promising.Software tools usedhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zn0g0 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1886-925X Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.
