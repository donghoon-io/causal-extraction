<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Forest soils store vast amounts of terrestrial carbon, but we are still limited in mechanistic understanding on how soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization or turnover is controlled by biotic and abiotic factors in forest ecosystems. We used phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) as biomarker to study soil microbial community structure and measured activities of five extracellular enzymes involved in the degradation of cellulose (i.e., b-1,4-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase), chitin (i.e., b-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase), and lignin (i.e., phenol oxidase and peroxidase) as indicators of soil microbial functioning in carbon transformation or turnover across varying biotic and abiotic conditions in a typical temperate forest ecosystem in central China. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to determine the interrelationship between individual PFLAs and biotic and abiotic site factors as well as the linkage between soil microbial structure and function. Path analysis was further conducted to examine the controls of site factors on soil microbial community structure and the regulatory pathway of changes in SOC relating to microbial community structure and function. We found that soil microbial community structure is strongly influenced by water, temperature, SOC, fine root mass, clay content, and C/N ratio in soils and that the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and actinomycetes explained most of the variations in the specific activities of soil enzymes involved in SOC transformation or turnover. The abundance of soil bacterial communities is strongly linked with the extracellular enzymes involved in carbon transformation, whereas the abundance of saprophytic fungi is associated with activities of extracellular enzymes driving carbon oxidation. Findings in this study demonstrate the complex interactions and linkage among plant traits, microenvironment, and soil physiochemical properties in affecting SOC via microbial regulations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The interactions between above-and below-ground components play an important role in driving ecosystem processes, but their underlying mechanisms are yet poorly understood. Thus, there have been continued and growing interests to elucidate the explicit relationships between vegetation and below-ground processes and to seek mechanistic understanding on the contribution of soil biota and associated processes to ecosystem functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Wardle et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Xiao et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">De Deyn et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jin et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Zhou et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Soil microorganisms are a critical link between shifts in the composition of dominant vegetation and fundamental shifts in ecosystem functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Waldrop et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Prescott and Grayston 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Prescott and Vesterdal 2013)</ref>. Soil active microbial communities play a central role in belowground processes, especially in mediating soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(van der Heijden et al. 2008</ref>). An improved knowledge on the interactions between site factors and soil microbial communities in facilitating forest soil organic matter decomposition and soil carbon sequestration is increasingly recognized as key to understanding feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystem processes to global climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Singh et al. 2010)</ref>. However, owning to the complexity of below-ground processes as well as technical difficulties to experimentally manipulate soil microbial structures and activities, significant gaps remain in our current understanding on how soil microbial communities are controlled by complex interactions of biotic and abiotic site factors and how the structural shifts in soil microbial communities are linked to alterations of their functioning, such as in mediating soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hackl et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brockett et al. 2012)</ref>. While advancement in biotechnology has allowed for the development of techniques for structural analysis of soil microbial communities, for example, the characterization of microbial functional components with phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis, determinations of the linkage between microbial structure and function still pose a critical issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Prescott 2010)</ref>. A lack of effective technical solution in directly relating microbial community structure to functioning in SOC transformation and turnover in natural ecosystems has been an obstacle for seeking mechanistic understanding on the feedbacks of changes in belowground processes to ecosystem succession and functioning in response to climate and land-cover changes.</p><p>The PLFAs extracted from soil are used as an indicator of microbial community structure, as certain groups of microorganisms have different "signature" fatty acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tunlid and White 1992)</ref>. These lipids are only present in the membranes of viable organisms and are rapidly degraded in soil and as such are a measure of the organisms living at the time of sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grayston and Prescott 2005)</ref>. A more advanced technique based on nucleic acid extraction and analysis has also been increasingly used for examining soil microbial community structure, particularly genes coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). However, the PLFA method is a rapid and inexpensive way of assaying the biomass and composition of microbial communities in soils and may even be more sensitive in detecting shifts in microbial community composition when compared to nucleic acid-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ramsey et al. 2006)</ref>. Although the PLFA method cannot compete with the rRNA methods in the phylogenetic resolution by which a given community can be characterized, the latter provide little information on the phenotype and the activity of the microorganisms in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Frosteg ard et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Soil microbial community structure in natural ecosystems is known to be directly influenced by many edaphic factors, such as temperature, water, and soil physicochemical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Williams and Rice 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Collins et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angel et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Castro et al. 2010)</ref>. Vegetation type and structure, by modifying the site microclimate, the quantity and quality of litter, the production of root exudates, and/or the allocation patterns of organic matter, directly and indirectly affect soil microbial community structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(De Deyn et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wardle et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jassey et al. 2013)</ref>. Previous studies have demonstrated that ecosystems may differ in the relative influences of site factors on soil microbial communities. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brockett et al. (2012)</ref> found that soil water was the dominant factor influencing the potential function of the soil microbial community across forests of varying biogeoclimatic zones. In contrast, many studies show that SOC is closely related to soil microbial community structure and function under different types of vegetation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grayston and Prescott 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yao et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Franklin and Mills 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Katsalirou et al. 2010)</ref>. There are also findings that specific soil chemical properties, such as soil C/N ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fierer et al. 2009)</ref>, nutrient status <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lauber et al. 2008)</ref>, and soil pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rousk et al. 2009)</ref>, are highly correlated with soil microbial community composition and function, and that plant litter chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ushio et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Strickland and Rousk 2010</ref>) and spatial pattern of soil properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ushio et al. 2010</ref>) can impose marked impacts on forest soil microbial function by changing soil microbial community composition. Despite a much improved understanding on the controls of below-ground processes, however, there lacks a general model quantifying the relative contributions to, and the levels of control of, soil microbial processes when multiple biotic and abiotic site factors are involved. The underlying mechanisms on the functional linkages between plant communities and soil microbial communities and the impacts on forest biogeochemical processes that arise as a consequence of below-ground activities are much complicated by the multiple effects of various site factors, biotic or abiotic, leaving alone the complexity in interactions and autocorrelations among the factors that potentially lead to nonlinearity of biotic and environmental controls of ecosystem processes. Clearly, a holistic approach taking into consideration of all potential factors and drivers is necessary when examining the structure-function relationships of soil microbial communities in order to gain mechanistic understandings on the controls and functioning of below-ground processes.</p><p>In this study, using a typical temperate forest in central China as a model ecosystem, we examined the linkage between soil microbial structure and functioning in driving SOC transformation and turnover and assessed the relative influences of biotic and abiotic site factors on soil microbial structure and function. Soil microbial community structure, as characterized by PLFA analysis, and microbial function in driving SOC transformation and turnover, as represented by five extracellular enzymes involved in the degradation of cellulose (i.e., b-1,4-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase), chitin (i.e., b-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase), and lignin (i.e., phenol oxidase and peroxidase), were investigated across varying biotic and abiotic conditions established by setting up sampling plots in different types of forest stands naturally occurring or historically planted in the study area. Multivariate analysis and pathway analysis were used to identify the dominant biotic and abiotic site factors affecting soil microbial structure and function and to determine the regulatory pathway of changes in SOC relating to microbial community structure and function. Our objectives were to determine that, in forest ecosystems, (1) how soil microbial communities are controlled by complex interactions of biotic and abiotic site factors; and (2) how and to what extend the structural variations in soil microbial communities are linked to functioning in driving SOC transformation and/or turnover. We anticipate that the outcome of the study would help with gaining better mechanistic understanding on the microbial regulation of SOC dynamics. We hypothesized that soil microbial community controls SOC stabilization or turnover through a linkage between structure and function and that the role of biotic and abiotic site factors in affecting SOC stock is operated via regulations on the structural attributes of soil microbial community (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>

It is in a transitional zone from warm temperate to northern subtropical climatic region. The climate is of a continental eastern monsoon type, with annual mean air temperature of 15.1°C and mean annual precipitation of 900 mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Luan et al. 2011)</ref>. Precipitation occurs mainly in the summer months June through August (55-62%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Liu et al. 1998)</ref>. The soils are of dystric cambisols (FAO-UNESCO soil classification system) developed on weathered arenites.</p><p>The zonal vegetation at the study sites is typically a deciduous broadleaved forests dominated by, with changes in topography and position on slopes, Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata Maxim., Quercus glandulifera var. brevipetiolata Nakai., and Quercus variabilis Blume., respectively, in the canopy layer. Pinus armandii Franch. plantations were established in the region for timber production around 1956, but some stands developed into mixed forests due to natural regeneration of Q. aliena  Field survey was conducted on each plot to collect data on tree species composition and density, size of individual trees &gt; 5 cm DBH, canopy openness, litter mass on forest floor, fine root biomass, and soil physicochemical properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field measurements and sampling</head><p>Soil temperatures at 10 cm depth (T soil10 ) were measured using HOBO Data Loggers (TidbiT v2 Temp, Onset Computer Corporation, Cape Cod, MA) at 30 min intervals. The average soil temperature for each plot was calculated for 4 weeks prior to soil sampling, which represented the critical time period for microbial response to varying environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bell et al. 2009</ref>). Plant fine roots and litter samples were collected following soil sampling. Litter samples (including undecomposed plant tissues, partially decomposed duff, and O e and O a horizons) were collected on each plot at 12 random locations with a 20 cm diameter ring frame and oven-dried at 65°C to constant weight. Twelve root core samples were also collected on each plot by soil layer for 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and 10-20 cm using a 15-cm-innerdiameter soil-corer. They were washed clean using 0.4-mm mesh bags and separated into coarse (&gt;5 mm), medium (2-5 mm), and fine (&lt;2 mm) roots before being oven-dried at 65°C to constant weight. All litter and root samples were measured for total dry mass and analyzed for concentrations of C and N, and the acid soluble fraction and insoluble residue (i.e., the "Klason lignin") <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Parton et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Meier and Bowman 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Soil samples were collected in mid-August 2012, at 12 systematically arranged locations on each plot at a distance of 5 m from the plot center in the directions of <ref type="bibr">0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, and 330°.</ref> They were collected at depths of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and 10-20 cm using a 10-cm-inner-diameter soil-corer. The samples were mixed to obtain one composite sample for each of the soil layers on each plot. All soil samples were immediately stored on ice in insulated containers upon collection and sieved to pass a 2-mm mesh after returning to laboratory. Each processed soil sample was divided into two portions and stored in a refrigerator at À20°C before being analyzed. One was freeze-dried for PLFA analysis and the other for enzyme assays and physicochemical analysis.</p><p>Altogether, 216 forest floor litter samples, 648 fine root samples, and 54 composite soil samples were collected and analyzed in this study.</p></div>

Forward selection of the nine factors in the RDA ordinations showed that the microbial composition was primarily influenced by %SWC, SOC, T soil10 , % clay content, FR, and C/N soil (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). Despite the relatively high marginal effect, NH 4 -N had negligible conditional effect on soil microbial composition.</p><p>The RDA ordination biplot shows specific associations between the dominant site factors and individual PLFAs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). % SWC and % clay form positive associations pre- dominantly with the Gram-negative bacteria 18:1x7c and the Gram-positive bacteria i15:0, and negative associations with the saprophytic fungi 18:2x6,9c, the Gram-positive bacteria a15:0, and the nonspecific PLFA 14:0; whereas T soil10 , C/N soil , and C/N litter are associated with the same PLFAs but in reversed pattern.

The five soil microbial types jointly explained 66% of variations in the specific activities of the five soil enzymes assessed (sum of Lambda-B in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>), with Gram-negative bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi appearing to be the most dominant controls (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>A sound mechanistic understanding on the controls of biotic, climatic, and edaphic factors on soil carbon dynamics is a prerequisite for achieving a realistic prediction of changes in the regional soil carbon sink in response to changing environment. It is generally   understood that SOC in forest ecosystems originates predominantly from decomposing plant litter and that the transformation and turnover of plant-derived organic carbon are mediated primarily by soil microbial communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Singh et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Schmidt et al. 2011)</ref>. As microbial communities in soils act to either stabilize or turning over plant-derived organic carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liang et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Miltner et al. 2011)</ref>, it has long remained a challenge to directly link the soil microbial attributes with the capacity of soil carbon sequestration. Despite a profound progress over the past two decades in elucidating the microbial community structure as affected by site or environmental conditions in forest soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(H€ ogberg et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ushio et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Thoms et al. 2010)</ref>, associating the soil microbial structure with functioning in driving soil carbon transformation and turnover still occurs as an unresolved issue. In this study, by measuring a suite of complex site factors and soil microbial-related attributes under field conditions and applying multivariate analysis techniques, we examined ecosystem-level controls on soil microbial community structure and the linkage between microbial structure and function in soil carbon processes. Results show that at ecosystem level, factors relating to soil microclimate and fertility are the major controls on soil microbial structure and that the soil bacterial community and saprophytic community play distinct roles in mediating soil carbon processes in temperate forest ecosystem of the region.</p><p>Research to date has uncovered some of the regulations of soil microbial community composition by individual biotic and abiotic factors and/or their interactive effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bezemer et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Thoms et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brockett et al. 2012)</ref>. However, results are inconsistent concerning the critical drivers of differences in soil microbial structure. While the study of <ref type="bibr">H€ ogberg et al. (2007)</ref> shows that soil C to N ratio and pH are the major factors associated with variations in soil microbial community structure, the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mitchell et al. (2010)</ref> suggests that plant community composition better predicts changes in microbial community composition than soil properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Thoms et al. (2010)</ref> found that plant community directly and indirectly affected soil microbial community composition through influences on the amount and quality of litter and soil physicochemical properties. Here, we show that soil water, SOC, soil temperature, soil clay content, fine root mass, and soil C to N ratio are all significant drivers of variations in soil microbial community composition. We found that soil water was positively associated with the abundance in bacterial community, especially the Gram-negative bacteria community, whereas soil temperature was positively associated with the abundance in saprophytic fungal community and negatively with the abundance in bacterial community. Both soil temperature and soil water have been identified as primary drivers of variations in soil microbial community structure in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hackl et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Djukic et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brockett et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Factors relating to soil fertility, that is, SOC, NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N, and soil C to N ratio, were also found to correlate with soil microbial community structure.

The C to N ratio in both soil and litter was strongly and positively associated with saprophytic fungi in this study, consistent with the findings of positive correlation between the soil C to N ratio and the fungal to bacterial ratio by others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">H€ ogberg et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fierer et al. 2009)</ref>. Our finding that high soil clay content favors the abundance of bacterial community and constrains the abundance of saprophytic fungal community is well supported by literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">H€ ogberg et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lamarche et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fierer et al. 2009)</ref>. Fine root mass, as a biotic factor, was found to associate mainly with nonspecific PLFAs. The influence of plant fine root mass on soil microbial community structure has been considered to involve several mechanisms, including alteration of soil microclimate, for example, changing soil water by uptake activity or modifying soil physical structure by root penetration, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Prescott and Grayston 2013)</ref>, and production of root litter <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Loranger-Merciris et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ushio et al. 2008</ref>) and root extrudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kuzyakov and Donmanski 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jones et al. 2004</ref>) as energy sources of soil microbial communities.</p><p>Several recent studies have demonstrated that soil pH is among the primary site factors determining soil microbial community structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(H€ ogberg et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sinsabaugh et al. 2008)</ref>. But in the current study, soil pH was not identified as a significant explanatory variable in the variations of soil microbial community composition.

With the help of RDA ordination, which is a well-known multivariate analysis technique for discriminating the relative effects when multiple factors are involved in regulating a specific process, we were able to establish the relative linkage between soil microbial community types and functional-specific soil extracellular enzymes. We found that the relative abundance in the Gram-negative bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities was associated with the specific activities of hydrolytic enzymes involved in C acquisition (i.e., b-glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase), whereas the relative abundance in the saprophytic fungi community was correlated with the specific activities of soil enzymes involved in degradation of chitin (i.e., NAGase) and lignin (i.e., phenol oxidase and peroxidase). Gram-negative bacteria generally grow fast to compete for simple organic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Waldrop et al. 2000)</ref> and were found in this study to significantly relate to the specific activity of b-glucosidase involved in the breakdown of complex organic compounds into small molecules substrates in favor of C acquisition through microbial community growth.

Moreover, factors affecting soil microbial community structure may also impose direct and/or indirect impacts on the microbial function, enhancing or weakening the overall controls of soil microbial community function by individual site factors.</p><p>We used the specific activity of the soil extracellular enzymes (i.e., enzymatic per unit SOC) to assess the dynamics of SOC transformation and/or turnover in path analysis. Soil bacteria community was identified to strongly regulate SOC storage although increasing the microbial C acquisition activity. Saprophytic fungi community contributes to SOC turnover by increasing the microbial C oxidative activity. Extracellular enzyme activity in soils has been studied for more than a century with a goal of understanding the biochemistry of decomposition and nutrient cycling. Extracellular enzymes are widely produced by different groups of soil microorganisms, and some of them can be used as indicators of the presence or activity of specific microbial taxa <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baldrian 2009)</ref>. They provide useful insights into the mechanisms of microbial sensitivity to environment change <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cusack et al. 2011)</ref>.

Soil microbial community composition is strongly influenced by water, temperature, SOC, fine root mass, clay content, and C/N ratio in soils. Soil bacterial communities are strongly linked with the extracellular enzymes involved in carbon transformation, whereas saprophytic fungi are associated with activities of extracellular enzymes driving carbon oxidation.
