There are a large number of "lower-order" personality traits, that are often 1 Accepted version of paper published in 2019 in the International Journal of Bilingualism, DOI: 10.1177/1367006919888581 journals.sagepub.com/home/ijb correlated with Big Five traits but also explain unique variance. Although psychologists agree that personality is determined both by physiological and social factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Furnham &amp; Heaven, 1999)</ref>, relatively less research has been carried out on the effect of social factors. The present study is situated within this avenue of research as multilingualism (and possibly multiculturalism, see <ref type="bibr">Grosjean, 2014</ref>) is a social/cultural variable with the potential to shape a person's personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dewaele &amp; van Oudenhoven, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dewaele &amp; Li Wei, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wei &amp; Hu, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The present study is the first to investigate the effect of multilingualism on five higherorder personality traits. Its goal is to demonstrate that multilingualism and multiculturalism, which have increasingly been maligned by politicians, is an advantage that provides positive traits to individuals. Rigorous and impartial research on how multilingualism is linked to personality is crucial to combat the return of the deficit view of bi-and multilingualism <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Edwards &amp; Dewaele, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The literature review will focus on the research that has linked measures of multilingualism and personality traits measured with the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (van der Zee, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">van Oudenhoven, Ponterotto &amp; Fietzer, 2013)</ref> and will briefly mention research on "lowerorder" personality traits and emotions. Following the recommendation by Wei, <ref type="bibr">Hu and Xiong (2019)</ref> to report effect sizes in literature reviews, we will use the bench marks proposed by <ref type="bibr">Wei and Hu (2018)</ref>. The authors argue that given the topic-specific nature of effect size, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cohen's (1988)</ref> traditional grid is inadequate for the effects of sociobiographical variables. They suggest to lower the Cohen's threshold values so "that .005, .01, .02, and .09 be used respectively as the small, typical (medium), large, and very large benchmarks for the effect size R 2 when interpreting the influence of sociobiographical variables (…)" (p. 8).</p><p>The literature review will be followed by the research question and the methodology section. The results section will present the nonparametric statistical analyses which will be discussed in the following section and, finally, some tentative conclusions will be presented.  <ref type="bibr">2013)</ref>. It has been applied to various age groups and professional groups: students, employees, expatriates and their family members, and refugees. In all cases, the dimensions were found to be reliable (reliability coefficients range between .70 and .90) and to show consistent patterns of correlations with related variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Leone et al., 2005)</ref>. Construct validity is strong as the dimensions show correlations as predicted with related personality and attitudinal variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Leone, van der Zee, van Oudenhoven, Perugini, &amp; Ercolani, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">van</ref>  participants (explaining 4% of the variance). Surprisingly, the number of languages known was unrelated to their personality profile. However, a more granular measure of multilingualism (total language use and total proficiency in various languages) showed that those who scored higher on these two language measures also scored significantly higher on Cultural Empathy, Openmindedness and Social Initiative. Advanced knowledge of more languages was also linked to higher levels of Cultural Empathy (predicting 2.3% of the variance, i.e. a small effect size). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Korzilius, Van Hooft, Planken and Hendrix (2011)</ref> also investigated the link between multilingualism and personality traits (measured with the MPQ) among 144 non-international employees, international employees and business contacts in a Dutch multinational company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head><p>A Pearson correlation analysis revealed that number of languages known was positively linked to Openmindedness (N = 144, r = .35, p &lt; .01, r 2 = .1225) and Emotional Stability (Emotional Stability: N = 144, r = .30, p &lt; .01, r 2 = .09) (p. 540). Both effect sizes could be described as medium. An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of stake holder group on three MPQ traits, namely Openmindedness (F(2, 130 = 7.68, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .11), Emotional Stability (F(2, 130 = 7.97, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .11), and Flexibility (F(2, 130 = 4.42, p &lt; .014, η 2 = .06). Post-hoc tests revealed that the international employees, who knew significantly more languages than the two other groups (F(2, 141 = 12.49, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .15), scored significantly higher than non-international employees on Openmindedness and Flexibility than the local employees and business contacts. In a follow-up study based on the same database, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dewaele and Li Wei (2013)</ref> considered the link between multilingualism and another lower-order personality trait, Tolerance of Ambiguity. A one-way ANCOVA revealed that the number of languages had a significant positive effect on Tolerance of Ambiguity (F(5,1984) = 8.7, p &lt; .0001, η 2 = .021) (p. 235). Post-hoc tests showed that monolinguals scored lower on Tolerance of Ambiguity than the trilinguals, quadrilinguals and pentalinguals (p &lt; .0001). The difference between the monolinguals and the bilinguals was smaller (p &lt; .027) (p. 235). Levels of Tolerance of Ambiguity scores stabilized for quadrilinguals and pentalinguals. Higher levels of global proficiency in different languages also had a significant (but very small) effect on Tolerance of Ambiguity scores (F(2,1978) = 6.0, p &lt; .003, η 2 = .008) (p. 236). The authors concluded that Tolerance of Ambiguity is to some extent influenced by the sociolinguistic and cultural environment and by the need to acquire new languages in order to survive in a new linguistic and cultural environment.</p><p>Van Compernolle (2016) partly replicated the Dewaele and Li Wei (2013) study, looking for relationships between global proficiency and Tolerance of Ambiguity among 379 adults, including monolinguals, bilinguals and multilinguals. A Spearman rank correlation showed that participants with higher levels of global self-assessed proficiency also scored significantly higher on Tolerance of Ambiguity (N = 379, Rho = .019, p &lt; .0002, r 2 =.000361).</p><p>Wei and Hu (2018) also investigated the question of the effect of global self-assessed language proficiency and multilingualism on Tolerance of Ambiguity of 260 Chinese multilinguals in an English Foreign Language context. A one-way ANOVA revealed that the differences in Tolerance of Ambiguity scores of low, medium and high global proficiency groups were not statistically significant (F(2, 251) = 2.490, p = .085, partial η 2 = .019, R 2 = .019but the variance explained reaches the bench mark for a medium effect size. A further hierarchical regression analysis showed that number of languages known was a significant predictor of Tolerance of Ambiguity (p &lt; .027, R 2 = .019), which the authors interpret as "a typical (or medium) effect size for this line of research" (p. 8). Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire that focused on social interactions, social flexibility and positive outlook. The authors found that the bilinguals scored significantly higher than monolinguals on social flexibility (F = 14.74, p &lt; .001, η 2 = .022) and on social interactions (F = 6.80, p &lt; .01, η 2 = .01) (i.e. medium and small effect sizes). Mediation analyses revealed that social flexibility fully mediated the relationship between bilingual status and social interactions (p. 9). The authors conclude that as "bilinguals switch between two languages, they develop the ability to adapt to new environments, cope with change, and attend to others' perspectives" (p. 10).</p><p>The effect of multilingualism has also been investigated on psychological and emotional dimensions such as Foreign Language Anxiety which has been shown to be strongly linked with high Neuroticism and low Emotional Stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Dewaele, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dewaele &amp; MacIntyre, 2019</ref>). An ANOVA in an international sample of 1746 Foreign Language learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dewaele &amp; MacIntyre, 2014)</ref> revealed that knowing more languages corresponded with significantly lower Foreign Language Anxiety (F(5, 1740) = 14.1, p &lt; .0001, η 2 = .032) and significantly higher Foreign Language Enjoyment (F(5, 1740) = 9.9, p &lt; .0001, η 2 = .022) The effect size is medium.</p><p>An overview of the effects of multilingualism (broadly defined) on personality traits and psychological dimensions reported in the literature review are presented in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.  This brief literature review suggests that multilingualism, advanced knowledge of several languages and frequent use of them has been linked to personality traits and other psychological and emotional dimensions. In the current contribution, we propose to delve deeper in the topic, focusing solely on the five MPQ dimensions, re-using the large database that was collected to analyse variation in Foreign Language Enjoyment and Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dewaele and MacIntyre (2019)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations and Regressions between the Observed Variables</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> indicates the descriptive statistics for all observed variables. It should be noted that although some skewness and kurtosis is present in each of the MPQ subscales, no one subscale has a skewness or kurtosis value of larger than +1 or smaller than -1, indicating an acceptable distribution of data <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Hult, Ringle &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> indicates the correlations among all observed variables, as measured by Pearson correlation coefficients. As indicated, three subscales of the MPQ had statistically significant positively weak correlations with the number of languages spoken, namely Flexibility (r = .134; p &lt; .001), Social Initiative (r = .158; p &lt; .001), and Openmindedness (r = .203; p &lt; .001). As such, whilst the three correlations are positively significant, the indicated relationship may in fact be very small or even negligible. Direct linear regressions were conducted between multilingualism and each of the personality variables (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). Results indicate a significant regression between multilingualism and Flexibility (F (1, 649) = 11.799; p &lt; .01) with an R 2 = .018. Similarly, a significant regression was derived between multilingualism and Social Initiative (F (1, 649) = 16.545; p &lt; .001) with an R 2 = .023. Lastly, statistical significant results were also found for the linear regression between multilingualism and Openmindedness (F (1, 649) = 27.838; p &lt; .001) with an R 2 = .040. Multilingualism therefore positively predicts Flexibility (β = .134), Social Initiative (β = .158), and Openmindedness (β = .203). The amount of variance explained by multilingualism in each of the three personality variables (1.8% to 4/0%) would be considered small according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cohen's (1988)</ref> criteria but would be considered very large in Wei and Hu's (2018) new benchmark system for interpreting the effects of sociobiographical variables. The results thus lend credence to the research hypothesis that multilingualism does indeed shape personality.</p><p>As three personality factors indicated a relationship with multilingualism (as measured by the self-reported number of languages spoken), further analysis will be conducted in order to provide further depth with regard to the findings. Structural Equation <ref type="formula">Modelling</ref>A model was constructed demonstrating the proposed hypothesis that multilingualism may affect an individual's standing on Flexibility, Social Initiative and Openmindedness (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>). The model was tested with MPlus version 7.11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2012)</ref>, utilizing a robust likelihood estimator (MLM) in order to take the non-normality of the data into account. A mean-adjusted chi-square will therefore be interpreted in the model fit statistics. It should be noted that multilingualism was indicated by a single observed variable namely the self-reported number of languages spokenand as such the factor loading was fixed to 1 and the error terms fixed to 0 in order to accommodate the single indicator latent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2012)</ref>.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>). Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .756 especially indicated a weak fit with a value far below the recommended .90 cut-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kline, 2005)</ref>. In addition, the Satorra-Bentler chi-square (χ 2 (270) = 1267.085; p &lt; .001) indicated an inadequate fit of the data to the proposed model. The only fit indices that indicated a mediocre fit was the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = .075 and the Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = .078 with a fit below the recommended cut-off of .80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kline, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">MacCallum, Browne &amp; Sugawara, 1996)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Widaman, Zhang &amp; Hong, 1999)</ref>, as well as lowering the likelihood of distributional violations <ref type="bibr">(Little, Cunningham, Shahar &amp; Widman, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The parceled structural equation model can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> with the fit statistics reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>.

Therefore, the oft cited critique against parcelingnamely that it distorts multidimensional constructsis not applicable in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The answer to the research question is largely positive as the total number of languages known was significantly linked to three out of five personality traits, namely Flexibility, Social Initiative and Openmindednessalbeit with very small effect sizes. An overview of the effects of multilingualism on the five MPQ personality traits identified in the present study and in previous research is presented in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>. It shows that different measures of multilingualism have been related with all MPQ personality traits but not systematically so.</p><p>The only trait that has been consistently linked with multilingualism is Openmindedness, which also had the strongest path coefficient (β = .230; p &lt; .001) as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>Openmindedness is a trait that shares characteristics with the lower-order trait Tolerance of Ambiguity that was also found to be higher among people knowing more languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dewaele &amp; Li Wei, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">van Compernolle, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wei &amp; Hu, 2018)</ref> and with Social Flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ikizer &amp; Ramírez-Esparza, 2017)</ref>. In other words, multilinguals know from very early on that their own linguistic, cultural values and practices may not be shared by the people with whom they interact. The awareness and the interest in these differences could lead to self-reflection and ultimately to acceptance that different people may have different values.</p><p>The present research design does not allow us to pinpoint the exact origin of the differences in Openmindedness of our participants. It could be caused by their multilingualism or in fact by their multiculturalism, defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Grosjean (2015)</ref> as active participation in the life of two or more cultures, a combination and blending of attitudes, behaviours, values, and languages of these cultures. Becoming multilingual may not affect individuals' sense of self, identity and personality to the same extent as becoming multicultural. It is thus likely that participants with a higher number of languages proportionally may contain a larger number of multiculturals. It is likely that more of these participants were multilingual by design rather than by accident.</p><p>Given the more scattered effects of multilingualism on the four other personality traits, it is probably better not to speculate too much about possible causes. Finally, just as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dewaele and Li Wei (2013)</ref>, it is important to point out that the causal pathway could in fact be multidirectional, where multilingualism is both a cause and an effect. Indeed, being multilingual can push a person to develop a more multicultural personality. Similarly, it could be argued participants who were born with a certain personality profile were more likely to become multilingual later in life, through an active choice. The current study examined the relationship between multilingualism and personality through the use of correlation coefficients and structural equation modelling and achieved relative success in doing so. However, several limitations of the current study ought also to be discussed. The study relied on self-reported data and as such the measure used to quantify the level of multilingualismthe self-reported number of languages an individual speakscan vary based on interpretation by the individual as to what level of competence constitutes the ability to communicate in a language. A future study with independent verification on the level of multilingualism of participants is recommended. Also, the database did not contain monolingual participants because the target group was foreign language learners. It is possible that the presence of a monolingual group would boost the effect sizes that we identified, as the crucial threshold might be between monolinguals and those knowing more than one language, after which the effect of knowing extra languages tails off. Another limitation is that more than 70% of participants were female, which is typical is this type of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dewaele, 2018)</ref> but it means the results need to be interpreted keeping this in mind.</p><p>Methodologically, the use of a parceled model to fit the data may also be criticized as the parceled data does have a higher probability of producing a Type II error <ref type="bibr">(Bandalos &amp; Finney, 2002)</ref>. Thus, a future replication study with a more robust sample is needed in order to determine whether fit can be achieved in the proposed model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>. In addition, future studies may also want to examine nuances in the data more closely, as group-level differences may be found in age, gender, language or regional groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The aim of the present study was to establish whether a link existed between level of multilingualism and personality traits measured through the MPQ.</p><p>The level of multilingualism of 651 participants turned out to higher scores on personality traits Flexibility, Social Initiative and Openmindedness. The positive link between multilingualism and Openmindedness turned out to be consistent in the studies we reviewed. Overall, the findings suggest that multilingualism and/or multiculturalism does indeed shape personality to some degree. Crucially, the current study expands previous research showing that knowing more languages provides positive traits to individuals, and that multilingualism and/or multiculturalism is -by extension-an advantage for the communities in which these multilinguals live.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dewaele and Li Wei (2012)</ref> looked at the relationship between multilingualism and a lower-order personality trait, Cognitive Empathy, among 2158 participants.

However, a significant effect emerged of global language use on Cognitive Empathy (r(1922) = .072, p &lt; 0.001, r 2 = .005).

This null result was slightly surprising because a Kruskal-Wallis test in<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alqarni and Dewaele (2018)</ref> revealed that 205 Arabic-English bilinguals scored significantly higher than 404 Arabic and English monolinguals on Trait Emotional Intelligence (χ 2 (2) = 11.23, p &lt; .004, d Cohen = .262, i.e. a small effect size). The authors suggest that the unexpected result might be linked to the fact that previous research focused on degrees of multilingualism, and that it rarely included monolingual participants. Following a similar avenue, Ikizer and Ramírez-Esparza (2017) used mediation analyses to investigate social flexibility in 206 bilinguals and 465 monolinguals living in the US or Canada. The authors developed a 12-item scale based on Petrides' (2009) Trait</figDesc></figure>

As is usual in this type of research<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dewaele 2018)</ref>, there was a strong gender imbalance (461 females, 181 males, 9 preferred not to say). The youngest participant was 15, the oldest 70 and the mean age was 25.6 years (SD = 9.3). They were studying FLs mostly in Europe (n = 391) and North America (n = 114), followed by Asia (n = 65), Africa (n = 43), Australia (n = 26), and South America (n = 12). Most were at university (n = 597) with a minority at high school (n = 54).

In terms of nationality, the largest group were Americans (n = 104), followed by Belgians (n = 58), Spaniards (n = 56), Japanese (n = 47), British (n = 18) and smaller groups of other nationalities. English was the most frequent L1 (n = 297), followed by French (n = 79), German (n = 69), Japanese (n = 52), Arabic (n = 49), and 48 other languages. Close to half of participants (n = 318) reported studying English as a FL.Participants were recruited through snowball sampling, which is a form of nonprobability sampling(Ness Evans &amp; Rooney, 2013). An open-access anonymous online questionnaire was used. Calls for participation were sent through emails to students, colleagues and informal contacts asking them to forward the link to people studying a foreign language who had at least intermediate competence in English 1 . The questionnaire remained online for eight months in 2016 and attracted responses from 782 participants across the world, of which 651 filled out the questionnaire completely. The advantages of online questionnaires, ease of access to rich and abundant data from participants in diverse locations, outweighs the main disadvantage, namely participant self-selection<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dewaele, 2018)</ref>. The research design received ethical approval from the first author's research institution. Participants indicated consent by ticking a box at the start of the questionnaire.</figDesc></figure>

A five factor personality measure, with 40 items measured on a 5-point scale (van der Zee et al., 2013). The five factors, each with 8 items, included in the measure are: Cultural Empathy. The subscale measures the ability to empathise in culturally diverse situations and include items such as '[I] enjoy other people's stories" (Cronbach's α = .81).]</figDesc></figure>

Just like Big Five personality inventories, the MPQ scales consider five dimensions. The main difference is that the MPQ scales are more geared toward predictions of</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p>multicultural success compared to general personality questionnaires. The first dimension is Cultural Empathy: the ability to empathise with cultural diversity, understanding feelings, beliefs and attitudes different from heritage ones. The second dimension is Flexibility: the ability to learn from new experiences, adjusting behaviour according to contingency and enjoying novelty and change. The third dimension is Social Initiative: the tendency to approach social situations actively, taking the initiative and engaging in social situations. The fourth dimension is Emotional Stability: the tendency to remain calm in stressful situations controlling emotional reactions. The final dimension is Openmindedness: an open, unprejudiced attitude towards diversity. Even the MPQ dimensions that closely correspond with Big Five scales are more specifically focused on aspects that are relevant to multicultural success</p><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(van Oudenhoven &amp; van der Zee, 2002)</ref></p>. The MPQ dimension of Cultural Empathy, for example, is similar to Agreeableness from the 'Big Five' construct as both refer to the ability to empathise with other's feelings. However, Cultural Empathy also includes empathizing with and understanding the feelings of members of different cultural groups. The MPQ has been used around the world. The construct validity of the five-factor MPQ has been assessed through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses across diverse samples (Van der Zee et al.,</p></note></figure>

In addition, no other study could be found that examined the research question through the method of structural equation modelling. Therefore, the authors argue that the benefits of examining the effects of multilingualism on the three personality factors of Flexibility, Social Initiative and Openmindedness through the powerful method of structural equation modelling should outweigh the potential critique against the use of parceling. However, future replication studies with larger samples and measurement models without parceled indicator variables is recommended and needed in order to lend credence to the findings of this study. </p></div>
