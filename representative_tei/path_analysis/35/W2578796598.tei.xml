<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Market competition drives attention to the prospects of New and Emerging Science &amp; Technologies (NESTs), which are fast changing and, so far, have relatively limited applications. Technology evolution pathways, as a powerful representation of the development of technology, have caught researchers' interest as a tool to trace historical progression, explore knowledge diffusion, and forecast future NESTs trends. Citation analysis approaches are actively applied to structure a large number of patents, map patent distribution, and capture knowledge transfer and change in technologies or industries. This paper (1) introduces the indicator of connectivity and modularity in the interior citation network to identify the technology development stage; (2) takes family patent information into the process of building a comprehensive patent citation network; (3) extracts technological trajectories by applying integrated approaches of main path analyses, namely global main path analysis and global key-route main analysis, among different technological stages. We illustrate this approach with Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as an example of a promising NEST, contributing to the remarkable growth in the renewable energy industry. The results show how our method can trace the main development trajectory of a research field and discern the technology focus to help decision-makers facilitate technology management.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Identifying core and emerging technologies is essential for formulating technology strategies and policies that achieve competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The ability to analyze and monitor the history and current stage of a particular technology is a critical asset to gain competitive advantage and to identify promising opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Many researchers have attempted to identify current technology structures and trace technological trends by performing patent analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Early patent analysis methods mostly compared the numbers of patents assigned to different entities (e.g., nations, companies, inventors, and technological fields, over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>). Such indicators cannot reflect micro-level technology changes effectively, especially for New and Emerging Science &amp; Technologies (NESTs).</p><p>Patents, as important carriers of technological knowledge, often interconnect with other patents; such technological structures and linkages are called networks. Patent citations represent previous knowledge underlying a specific inventive step. A patent citation network consists of groups of related patents in which the largest groups can be defined by patent technology categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Therefore, some researchers use patent citations to investigate knowledge flows and technology diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Patent citations have also been used to evaluate corporate performance and Merger &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Tracking the number of patent citations to non-patent sources can illuminate the role of science in technological innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have considered the role of science in technological innovation by investigating citations between patents and the scientific literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Moreover, patent citation analyses are applied to confirm rapid growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, explain the development trajectory of a technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, trace knowledge growth and transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and identify major technological barriers to mass application <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Patent citations, provided by patent applicants and examiners to clarify the reach of intellectual property (IP) rights, are regarded as important information in generating a highly concentrated collection of relevant patents by practitioners <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. A patent citation indicates a technological relationship between the inventions claimed in the citing and cited patents and provides a reasonable "proxy" for their technological significance, as they generally appear to be highly correlated with other measures of the value of innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Patent citation networks can be understood as representing relationships among the pieces of knowledge contained in individual patents to trace "technological trajectories" in a given technology field. One patent citing another implies that the cited patent reflects a piece of previously existing knowledge upon which the citing patent builds <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. For a vast citation network, some patents usually represent key technologies in the field that play a notable role in the overall progression. These patents are usually located on the "main trajectory" of citation networks. By extracting these patents, one can gain insight into the main technical developments of a certain technology. In addition, for large technical systems, patent citation analysis provides potential clarity. By examining the structure of a patent citation network, one should be able to identify the critical trajectories characterizing a target technology's evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Among the approaches of discovering citation trajectories, main path analysis (MPA) is one of the most attractive methods to determine the critical developing paths. The theory of MPA was first introduced by Hummon and Doreian, who called the sequences of links and nodes in the network search paths, and calculated a traversal count for each link to quantify the connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In their study, MPA aimed to seek the primary development trend in research fields through identifying the maximum connectivity from a series of studies in the literature. Subsequently, Hummon and his colleagues conducted further studies to test the method. Those studies include applying MPA to the centrality-productivity citation structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, to social network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, as well as to the conflict-resolution field <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Afterwards, MPA has been extended using bibliographical citation data and/or patent citation data to explore the history of fuel cell research <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, to map the emergence, growth, and transformation of medical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, to highlight the development of a structural backbone in the field of fullerenes and fullerene-like structures of nanotubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, to identify the development trajectories of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and to investigate the knowledge diffusion structure for the field of data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Recently, Choi and Park suggested a forward citation node pair (FCNP) algorithm to distinguish patent development paths from a large patent citation network by evaluating the weight of citations among patents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Previous patent citation approaches of MPA and analyzing technology evolution offer some fruitful discussions and findings, but there are two notable limitations that need to be addressed. First, most of these analyses ignore the essential role of patent families when constructing citation networks. Consolidating data into patent families not only helps avoid duplicate data retrieval during a search of patents across patent authorities' databases, but also helps show the geographical focus of the patentee and the patentee's evaluation of the value of the patent <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. We do not find much literature on MPA using patent families. Although some scholars had realized the importance of including patent family information in the analysis of a patent portfolio of a single applicant, their studies were limited to investigating the members of only one patent family <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. The use of multiple authorities' patent data bundled with the patent family information can significantly improve the coverage and practicability of patent citation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Second, the complex structure of technological changes at different developmental stages should be interpreted in detail. Various citation networks can be generated, even for the same patent, so different periods will show different technological trajectories. Hence, it is necessary to understand the critical technological progress over different periods to better explore the factors determining how technology plays a role in the process of knowledge diffusion.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we focus our analysis of patent data on search results from the title and abstract fields that pertain to a particular technology of interest, and then take a systematic approach to gauge evolutionary pathways. Our approach mainly takes three forms of intelligence into consideration: 1. To identify the Technology Life Circle (TLC) stage by introducing the indicator of connectivity and modularity in the interior citation network; 2. To take family patents into consideration when building a citation network to more fully present the citation relationships among all prominent patent families; 3. To apply integrated main path analyses to construct a set of technology trajectories and then trace the technology evolution pathways. This paper is organized as follows, Section 2 describes the framework and main methods applied in our studyit details the process to identify patent evolution pathways; Section 3 discusses our search strategy and how the data are acquired; Section 4 presents an application of the suggested approach-evolution pathways for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs); Finally, in Section 5, we conclude with the summary, discussion, and further research ideas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodological Approaches</head><p>In this research, we offer a systematic approach to better exploit patent resources concerning NESTs to identify technology evolution pathways. The framework is illustrated as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In this process, we use a professional desktop text mining software-VantagePoint (<ref type="url" target="http://www.theVantage-Point.com)-to">http://www.theVantage-Point.com)-to</ref> help identify the field from raw data and show results through a combination of statistics. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Technology Life Cycle</head><p>Technology often presents different development tracks; therefore, it is necessary to consider the technology life cycle when creating a distinct R&amp;D strategy plan. The technology life cycle comprises a pattern of dynamic characteristics pertaining to technology, in which its innovative and economic outcomes change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>The concept of the technology life cycle dates back to the 1960s. In 1981, Ford and Ryan (1981) proposed a conceptual standard that allows the base level of technological development to the application level of different technologies be revealed. Also, the consulting firm of Arthur D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Little (1981)</ref> developed a technological life cycle model that represents the evolution of the technologies with a system that is similar to the one used to reveal the life cycle of an industry, but it utilizes, on the vertical axis, some qualitative measure of technological changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Among all the technological life cycle models, the S-curve connects the investment in technology to observe technological performance, either over time or in terms of cumulative R&amp;D expenditures. It is generally accepted that technology life cycle includes two dimensions: (1) competitive impact and (2) integration in products or processes, which can be divided into four stages with different characteristics-emerging, growth, maturity, and decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Studying technology life cycles is widely used to measure patent activity indices, especially patent applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Nowadays, more and more researchers tend to introduce multiple indicators to measure the technology life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>Though such statistical indicators offer a convenient way to make a quick sense of the technological stage, they ignore the technology nature of internal knowledge flow and knowledge overflow. In other words, such traditional indicator-based methods cannot explain the dynamic mechanism of technology evolution and fail to determine inner representation. In this paper, we hold the view that the process of technology evolution can be interpreted through the evolution of patent citation behavior. To some extent, it is similar to the progress of urbanization. The node could be treated as an individual, and the edge could be designated as the community links. At the beginning, the city is a small village, sparsely populated, where hardly anyone has a relationship with others. Thereafter, many people move to this place, and some close community relationships could be observed. Then, more and more people come in and there is more of a community connection, even though a large number of individuals stay isolated; Finally, the urban population keeps increasing to arrive at a relatively stable level, but strong relationships among individuals form a series of communities that can be merged into some larger components. The schematic diagram is presented as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Schematic Diagram of Community Evolution over Different Life Cycle Periods</head><p>In order to describe these temporal processes, we introduce the growth rate of connected edges and the growth rate of weakly connected components to observe the technology evolution during the development period. Here, connected edge is defined as citation linkage, and the weakly connected component is deemed as the linkage community, among which all nodes are connected. In general, a certain new technology first appears; the rate of activity increases slowly during the emerging stage, and there are various nodes in the technology field. At the growth stage, the technology develops very fast to form some technology focus, among which the nodes are closely linked. In the technology maturity stage, new patents are filed, typically isolated as independent communities, but the number of such nodes grows rapidly. At the decline stage, technology integration becomes a trend or a pattern; citation linkages also become more frequent and some small components merge into larger technology communities. A summary of the technology life cycle's characteristics in relation to the growth rate of connected edges and weakly connected components is provided in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Citation Network Construction</head><p>As we mentioned above, patent citation analysis approaches are actively applied to structure a large number of patents, to profile the patent landscape, and to capture knowledge transfer and change in technologies or industries. Previous researchers often analyze patent data of a single authority because of the availability of the data and the simplicity of the analysis. A patent family is the collection of patents in different countries referring to the same technical topic, so it can be a useful information source because duplicate data retrieval can be avoided during a search of patents across patent authorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Citation behavior is different among patent authorities and between parent and child patents, so global technology trends cannot be understood only with the analysis of patent data issued by a single authority. For the sake of statistics, in this paper, an important step is to merge patent documents of a family into a single family record. Family patents are usually identified by the claim of priority or disclosure, and here, the certain patent family is marked by the earliest published patent in this family. Meanwhile, all cited patents of a family's members are merged to form the cited patents of the family record. In regard to patent families, we mainly consider three types of linkage between patents, shown as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. A general directed network (also called a Bayesian Network) consists of vertices and arcs that link two vertices (nodes). A citation network is a standard directed network that can also be represented as a citation matrix. Its columns and rows stand for the nodes, and each value in the matrix is defined as the strength of citation between two nodes. While conducting MPA for a given field of technology based on the patent citation network, we are more concerned about citations between patents within the technology field. These effective citations are extracted from the merged family records.</p><p>A patent citation network can be represented as a patent citation matrix. Nodes stand for the individual family records, and arcs between two nodes are citations. The patent (actually meaning family) citation matrix is defined with these nodes and arcs as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑃 = [ 𝑝 11 𝑝 12 ⋯ 𝑝 1𝑛 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 𝑝 𝑛1 𝑝 𝑛2 ⋯ 𝑝 𝑛𝑛 ] Where 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 = { 1, 𝑖𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑗 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑠 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑖; 0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.</formula><p>The patent citation matrix 𝑃 is an 𝑛 × 𝑛 square matrix, which represents an acyclic citation network with four types of vertices corresponding to four types of patent family records, respectively: (1) isolated records-the patent families that cite no other patents, and are not cited; (2) source records-the patent families that cite no patents, but are cited; (3) sink records-the patent families that cite others, but are not cited by others; and (4) intermediate records-the patent families that cite other patent families, and are also cited by other patents.</p><p>To simplify the process of analyzing the technological trajectories and identifying core patents, we disregard patents neither citing nor cited by at least one patent in the maximum connected componentnamely, the "orphan" patents that are digressional from the mainstream of those technological domains are eliminated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Main Path Analysis</head><p>The main path is a path from a source vertex to a sink vertex with the highest traversal weights on its arcs <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>MPA is applied to explore the most significant paths in a citation network and is commonly used to trace the developmental trajectory of a research field by using bibliographical citation data and/or patent citation data. In (SPC), concluding that SPC performs a bit better than SPLC and SPNP because of its properties, even though these indices always obtain almost the same results. However, subtle differences exist among them. In this paper, we do not elaborate on the pros and cons of applying each of the traversal counts, but follow the recommendations and apply SPC throughout to count the weight of each citation link.</p><p>Based on the previous phases, technology evolution pathways can be finally constructed by identifying the important patents located on the main trajectory at different stages. After getting the SPC weight of each node, we need to choose an algorithm to figure out the main path. Most of the traditionally proposed algorithms represent a "local" approach, which repeatedly chooses the link with the largest traversal count emanating from the current starting node. Such local algorithms highlight significance at a particular point in time and track the most significant citation link at every possible splitting point, whereas the global algorithm emphasizes the overall importance and delivers the path with the largest overall traversal count <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. In other words, in contrast to the local main path that highlights significance in local progress, the global main path emphasizes the overall importance in knowledge flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> . The approaches of main path analysis can be presented as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. inclusion of the top links in these multiple paths. This approach viewed a main path as an extension of a specific key route, and began a search from both ends of that key route <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we apply the global MPA method for different periods to obtain the path that has the most significant overall traversal count in different technological stages. Furthermore, we use the multiple global key-route method to track the technology flow and evolution from a holistic perspective. The procedure of the multiple global key-route method is as follows: (1) select the link that has the highest traversal count as the key-route; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> utilize standard search to trace the nodes that have the largest overall traversal counts. The multiple global keyroute method not only provides multiple paths, from which we can find the knowledge diffusion trajectory comprehensively, but also contains almost all the important connections and makes the results much more comprehensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Search Strategy and Data Retrieval</head><p>Previous citation analysis approaches often chose data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) because data there are rich in citations and are easy to obtain. However, using patents of a single authority may ignore important characteristics of patenting systems and cause a critical oversight of information on patent application status and R&amp;D trends of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In this paper, we use the Thomson Innovation patent compilation provided by Thomson Reuters. It offers a comprehensive worldwide patent database system, which covers patents recorded at more than 80 patent authorities, including the USPTO. Thomson Innovation includes Derwent World Patents Index (DWPI) patent data and the Derwent Patent Citation Index (DPCI), by which we can collect data on patent families and citations. While the claim of priority or disclosure as a member of a certain patent family is not mandatory, DWPI defines a family based on both the claim and the investigation of experts. The DWPI bundles patents recorded at 47 worldwide patent authorities as a protection for the same invention as a sort of family <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are an important nanoscience domain contributing to photovoltaic technology development. In contrast to conventional silicon-based solar cells, the demand on purity of materials for DSSCs is lower and forecasted manufacturing costs are approximately halved, making DSSCs an attractive alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. We have analyzed DSSCs for several years <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Based on our experience, the seminal paper on DSSCs appeared in 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Therefore, in this paper, we chose the time span from 1991 to 2014. As the quality of the retrieved patent data is important for our analysis and the meaningfulness of the generated results, we selected the terms for Boolean searching with guidance of domain experts. The search strategy was:</p><p>TS=((Dye* or Pigment*) and (Sensiti*) and (Solar* or Photovoltaic*) and (Cell* or Batter*))</p><p>The total number of patent families obtained from Thomson Innovation was 6,857 (search results updated on February 17, 2016).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>In this section, we first identify the technology life cycle of DSSCs from 1991 to 2014. In order to better fit the true development level of DSSCs and decrease the influence of commercial activity, we prefer to use raw data from USPTO that provide integral citation information. Thus, we extract 653 USPTO granted patents from our initial dataset to conduct the technology cycle life analysis.</p><p>After constructing the citation network by year, we can obtain the information on connected edges and weakly connected components with the help of the interactive visualization and exploration platform, Gephi (<ref type="url" target="http://gephi.org/">http://gephi.org/</ref>). We visualized the indicator information and fit these dots in MATLAB (<ref type="url" target="http://www.mathworks.com/">http://www.mathworks.com/</ref>), a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment. The results are shown in  Whereas inventors tend to participate in constructing a research front, assignees can be considered primarily as economic agents who follow another logic than the technology cycle per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Based on such analyses, the technology stage division basically meets our initial judgment, and the approach we propose offers a reasonable way to set up further MPAs in different time periods. We separately showed our results to two experts who are working for the Georgia Institute of Technology. In their opinion, the results basically fit their understanding of the development of DSSCs.   Note: The technology life cycle stages --E, G, and M --stand for the stage of emerging, growth, and maturity, respectively. The number behind the caption means the order in the main path of the corresponding stage.  Are the patents located at the technological trajectory all highly cited by others patents? The answer is no. In general, the number of citations a patent receives can be used to show its impact on a field of technology, but an analysis based on citation counts may fail to identify those concepts and principles that could act as "focusing devices" for a sequence of inventive activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The information shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> supports this conclusion.</p><p>In the process of identifying the technological trajectory, patents cited by the other patents of our targeted data set are highly weighted. Also, those that cite more DSSCs patents are more likely to be selected as nodes located on the main technological trajectory. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Discussion</head><p>Tracing technology evolution pathways is essential to track innovation progress, and MPA is one of the effective approaches to identify key technological trajectories within complex patent citation networks. Most previous studies ignore the essential role of patent families when constructing the citation network, which leads to a decrease of coverage and practicability of the analyses. Also, different temporal intervals may affect citation relations, so it is vital to understand the critical technological progress over different periods to better explore knowledge diffusion. Therefore, we introduce technology community evolution and patent diversity indicators to gauge the technology stage over time; and then we merge family patents to build a more comprehensive citation network. Lastly we introduce global MPA and global key-routes MPA to identify a set of main technology trajectories and then trace the technology evolution pathways accordingly.</p><p>Based on these analyses we derive several ideas. First, observing technology changes in different stages can help understand the mainstream track and key technologies. Static technical evolution is only well suited for mature technologies or emerging technologies that are in an extended, stable developmental stage. Some patents play a vital role in a certain stage and obtain a remarkable weighting in the patent citation network, but they may lose their advantages in the process of identifying main patents and focus in a longer period. Second, taking patent family into consideration has a remarkably positive effect on constructing the patent citation network and identifying main patents. The performance of centrality, connectivity, and modularity in the citation network of considering family patents are better than the one ignoring family patents. Such good network attributes are beneficial for discovering critical nodes in MPA. Third, patent citation analysis is a useful method to trace technology development. Applying MPA to a citation network simplifies a complicated citation network to a small number of nodes and links. The identified patents located on the main path may prove helpful for decision makers in the field. This method generates technological intelligence, which serves to elucidate technological change processes. We believe it can facilitate the identification of innovation opportunities (i.e., prospective paths to commercialization along with target developmental priorities to attain them).</p><p>Furthermore, this study offers some technology management insights for practical applications. On one hand, the main path analysis with the multiple key-route approach is an effective tool to trace technological changes. Based Based on current research, future studies could be improved in at least these two fields. First, we applied SPC algorithms to calculate the weight of the vertices in the network. Such algorithms (also including NPCC, SPLC and SPNP) only work on binary citation networks; in other words, all citations between any citing-cited pair are treated the same. The current advances in text mining, especially semantic analysis, can be used to scale the relevancies between any citing-cited pair of patents or publications and then further turn the traditional binary citation networks into weighted networks. Second, in a complex citation network, the method to find main paths seems to achieve the goal of simplifying the citation network and looking for the most significant development path. But in fact, on one hand, the obtained significant route may not be the path with the largest overall impact, even though some vital nodes can be observed; on the other hand, it is also important to identify the potential nodes that will make an enormous impact in the future but are neglected in the process under the evaluation system of citation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

How to measure the weights of each citation link from a set of starting vertices to the ending vertex is an important step in MPA. Several indices have been proposed, and the most widespread algorithms are Node Pair Projection Count (NPCC), Search Path Link Count (SPLC), and Search Path Nodes Pair (SPNP), which were proposed by Hummon and Doreian [32]. In 2003, Batagelj proposed a new traversal count, namely the Search Path Count</figDesc></figure>

Before the early 21 st century, the granted DSSCs patents were in slow-growth, and most of these patents had rare citations to each other. After 2002, the linkages among DSSCs patents became much more frequent than before, and some technology communities were gradually formed. Upon entering the 2010s, new technology communities grew at a rapid speed; in other words, the new and emerging technology focuses are in the course of forming and developing. After repeated testing, the growth trend of connected edges and weakly connected components can fit three curves in three phases. Based on the analysis, we divide the DSSCs development into three stages: emerging (1991-2001), growth (2002-2011), and maturity (2012-2014).</figDesc></figure>

An additional observation is that technological focus indicated by the main IPC numbers of patents drifts along with citation flows in the patent citation network. Take the citation pairs &lt;WO 200211213, WO 2006134939&gt; and &lt;WO 2006134939, US 2007240756&gt; in 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ 2011 and 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ 2014 as an example; the main IPC number of patent "WO 200211213" is H01L-031/00 (Semiconductor devices) while the main IPC of "WO 2006134939" is H01M-014/00 (Electrochemical current or voltage generators), and the main IPC of "US 2007240756" is H01L-051/00 (Solid state devices using organic materials as the active part). Since citations indicate direct relevance between citing and cited patents, it is pretty interesting to find topic drifts in a technological trajectory.In order to identify other critical R&amp;D directions in the field, we use a global key-route MPA. The key-route approach allows us to examine different levels of details by selecting the number of important links<ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. We explore different sequential numbers from the top 10 to top 50 to seek a reasonable threshold to identify paths exhibiting the greatest weight values in the patent citation network. Finally, we figure out that when the threshold value is set to the top 20 links, a divergent-convergent pattern is clearer than others. We therefore determine to analyze the key-route main paths based on these top 20 links, and the results are shown in Figure8.</figDesc></figure>

On the other hand, technological emergence, technological convergence, and technological diffusion always occur as a series of evolutionary, variant changes that are gradually combined or fused together to open the industry to successive dominant designs or guideposts. If inventors can publish equivalent patents of an invention in different countries, the multiple authorities' patent data should be analyzed to better grasp the technology development venation. Therefore, patent family information can significantly improve the coverage and practicability of patent citation analysis and also indicate the commercial potential and market distribution in the near future.</figDesc></figure>
