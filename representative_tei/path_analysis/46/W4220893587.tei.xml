<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Organizational silence, as a very important concept in terms of the purpose, goal and success of the organizations is an up-to-date subject that closely concerns schools. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pinder and Harlos (2001)</ref> approached the concept of silence from the point of view of "reaction to injustice" and expressed silence as a purposeful, deliberate state of consciousness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bogosian and Stefanchin (2018)</ref> emphasized that silence can prevent every stage of the information transfer process and the elimination of the information gap, and emphasized that managers should take into account the symptoms of silence and encourage sound culture. It is seen that silence provides both information and hides information, it can be a function of deep thought and not thinking at all, and it is an expression of both approval and rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pinder &amp; Harlos, 2001)</ref>. Ignorance of employees' opinions and concerns about organizational problems poses a potential danger to creativity, organizational change, motivation to learn, development and progress, and impedes the reflection of differences and the expression of opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000)</ref>. Similar results are experienced in educational institutions, and the processes of taking initiative, decision-making and participation in innovative activities are negatively affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alqarni, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>As long as employees, who vary in their values, beliefs, priorities and experiences, feel that they could not openly express their views on critical issues, organization cannot benefit from this pluralism as the expressed viewpoints remain substantially uniform. Therefore, in order to understand how change and development can occur in pluralistic environments, it is an important issue to try to understand the organizational forces that do not systematically evaluate employees' own ideas and thus cause discouragement. The management's knowledge of implementation level developments and disruptions are closely related to establishment of a positive organizational climate based on trust, sharing feedback and suggestions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Organizational silence is important for the development of the organization as well as its importance in terms of its impact on the employee <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kulualp &amp; Çakmak, 2016)</ref>. Unwillingness to share information, speak and provide feedback affect employee confidence and motivation negatively and block development and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Liu, Zhu, &amp; Yang, 2010)</ref>. In recent years, studies are being done to conceptualize organizational silence as a different phenomenon beyond defining it only lack of the expression of thoughts or absence of opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brinsfield, 2009)</ref>. Evaluation of the messages given to the organization or manager by means of organizational silence is important as these messages have the potential of affecting employee attitudes and behaviors and they may change the results <ref type="bibr">(Özdemir &amp; Sarıoğlu-Ugur, 2013)</ref>. It has been observed that organizational silence has a significant effect on employee effectiveness, affecting levels of commitment, trust and fear. It is thought that the inability to benefit from intellectual contribution, unidentified problems and the development of a negative organizational culture can also affect organizational learning. (Francis-Odii, Oduyoye &amp; Asikhia, 2020).</p><p>Since the situation of conscious denial of opinions and concerns about organizational problems is experienced in many organizations, 42 issues such as when and how employees decide to remain silent, what they take into account when making this decision, what issues they show silence behavior, how they choose the people they share their thoughts with should be addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Milliken, Morrison &amp; Hewlin, 2003)</ref>. It is interesting that while some individuals remain silent in similar situations, some individuals show speech behavior. This situation emphasizes the role of individual differences in organizational silence behavior. Studies on individual factors have been conducted mainly on gender, internal psychological perception, personality traits, self-monitoring and self-esteem level <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lu &amp; Xie, 2013)</ref>. It has been suggested that individuals' specific personality traits such as locus of control, self-esteem or self-esteem, communication anxiety, risk-taking tendency, and group identification may be effective in keeping silent behavior, individuals with low self-esteem, high communication anxiety and external control-oriented individuals exhibit more silence behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pinder &amp; Harlos, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Although organizational silence is a known concept, research continues on the latent meanings of silence and the effects of organizations on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Slade, 2008)</ref>. Silence is a vague and slippery behavior with multiple causes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Milliken et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, understanding and interpreting silence is more difficult than speaking. In recent research on the topic of silence, it has been observed that concepts such as organizational learning (Köse &amp; Güçlü, 2017), organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Parcham &amp; Ghasemizad, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Sholekar &amp; Shoghi, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yalçınsoy, 2019)</ref>, organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bayramoğlu &amp; Çetinkanat, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Çetin, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rayan, Ali &amp; Moneim, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sadeghi &amp; Ravazi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Vardarlıer &amp; Akıner, 2020)</ref>, organizational trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Helmiati, Abdillah, Anita &amp; Nofianti, 2018)</ref>, school climate (Algarni, 2020) and the mediating effect of perceived stress and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dong &amp; Chung, 2020)</ref> were mostly discussed.</p><p>However, the main element that constitutes the organizational structure; organizational behavior, organizational culture, organizational learning and other organizational issues emerge as a result of the behavior of people working in organizations. According to the research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Yıldızhan and Ağırbaş (2020)</ref>, the level of organizational silence varies according to personal factors. In the studies conducted by Tokmak (2018) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dağlar (2020)</ref>, it has been found that people with high extroversion tend to remain silent.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between locus of control, self-confidence, perceived organizational support and organizational silence. For this purpose, answers to the following questions are sought:</p><p>1. Are there any significant relationship between teachers' locus of control, self-confidence, perceived organizational support, and organizational silence perceptions? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background</head><p>Predicting teacher organizational silence and the relationship between locus of control, self-confidence, perceived organizational support and organizational silence are active research areas concerning the schools. In this section, a brief summary of literature is given about organizational silence, locus of control, self-confidence and perceived organizational support as very important concepts that are studied a lot for the success of the school organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Silence</head><p>The foundation of organizational silence, which negatively affects the development and change of the organization, is the practice of silence together. Employees who exhibit silence behavior do not intentionally express collectively their thoughts and knowledge about improving their work and organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000)</ref>. It is possible to come across some theoretical studies in explaining organizational silence behaviors. According to the theory known as cost-benefit analysis, individuals decide to speak by accounting for what they will gain or lose. It is thought that silence will be seen in the event that personal interests are prevented or losses are high <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Milliken et al., 2003)</ref>. The individual may have to pay direct costs such as loss of time and energy after the speech or indirect costs such as image damage, loss of reputation, conflicts, psychological pressures, loss of rank and dismissal <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Çakıcı, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Premeaux &amp; Bedeian, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>According to Vroom's Expectation Theory, which is another approach, the behaviors of the individual are shaped according to their personal characteristics and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Eren, 2003)</ref>. According to the theory developed by Noelle-Neumann that is known as the spiral of silence; the individual tends to join the majority, even though it is contrary to his own thoughts, with the need to avoid being isolated and be accepted. According to the spiral of silence theory, people hide their own thoughts and actions by thinking about the effect of the dominant thought on the majority around them and take part in the spiral of silence <ref type="bibr">(Çakıcı, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Organizational silence is classified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Van Dyne, Ang, and Botero (2003)</ref> as acquiescence silence, defensive silence, and pro-social silence for the benefit of the organization. In the study conducted by <ref type="bibr">Çakıcı (2008)</ref>, three types of silence were mentioned: acquiescent silence, quiescent silence and protective silence. Acceptive silence is defined as the belief that the idea of speaking is meaningless and will not make a difference, and is defined as the inability to express information, thoughts and opinions about any issue, problem or situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Durak, 2012)</ref>. Employees adopt the current situation of the organization and show the behavior of accepting the options offered instead of finding different solutions to the problems. Likewise, although their friends who show silence behaviors are aware, they do not try to change these behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pinder &amp; Harlos, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Defensive silence refers to fear-based and deliberate hiding of relevant ideas, information or opinions in order to protect itself from external threats. One of the examples of protective silence is the silence effect. The silence effect can be defined as people avoiding being personally disturbed, receiving defensive responses or transmitting negative news to their superiors to avoid negative personal consequences. Pro-social silence is about worrying about the wellbeing of others rather than fear of the personal consequences of negativity that may be encountered <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Van Dyne et al., 2003)</ref>. Individuals</p><p>do not complain about their conditions, and avoid expressing their opposing views in order to maintain intergroup solidarity, unity and solidarity <ref type="bibr">(Çakıcı, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The direction of silence can be bottom-up, top-down, or between workers on the same level. In literature, the state of being silent from the bottom up is most frequently mentioned and discussed.</p><p>Accordingly, it is upper management rather than the top management which has a greater impact on the silence of the employees. In this sense, the leader and top management must be informed about the level of communication of hierarchical management with the employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brinsfield, 2009)</ref>. In addition, it is not always possible to understand whether employees are deliberately doing this when they remain silent about an important issue. Therefore, being silent can be interpreted as an employee "not having anything to say" or a silent expression is that he/she is in agreement with the status quo. In fact, it is difficult to understand whether the employees are personally suppressing their opposing views even if they declare that they are generally in agreement with the opinions of others in the working group <ref type="bibr">(Tangirala &amp; Ramanujam, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Dyne et al. (2003)</ref> state that employees' motivation to talk about organizational issues and silence are not two opposite concepts, each of which is complex, multidimensional and can be explained with different dynamics. Silence is a more difficult concept that can be described based on non-verbal cues, thus attention is given to necessity of addressing its antecedents and consequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Milliken et al. (2003)</ref> remain silent and prefer silence for the employees who sometimes prefer to talk and sometimes prefer to remain silent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Locus of Control</head><p>Locus of control, which is thought to be associated with employee silence, is a property that individuals binding to the results, rewards, punishments, success and failure obtain to their own control or concentrate on the outside factors. Therefore, the concept of internal or external locus of control is an important personality dimension that shows people's perspectives on the world and the events around them.</p><p>Individuals with internal locus of control are more resistant to attempts and factors to shape their behavior and try different solutions to face failures, are more active and responsible <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Yeşilyaprak, 2006)</ref>. In terms of locus of control, it has been revealed that individuals differ significantly from each other <ref type="bibr">(Tümkaya, 2000)</ref>. It is thought that a qualified education can only be provided by teachers who are focused on internal control. The locus of control is also of particular value in terms of creating a society consisting of individuals who are aware of their social roles and responsibilities and who have the ability to manage themselves <ref type="bibr">(Tümkaya, 2000)</ref>. The locus of control belief is thought to have a significant effect on teachers' classroom behaviors such as planning the teaching process, motivation, effective classroom management skills, and ensuring student participation in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adu &amp; Olantundun, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Akiri &amp; Ugborugbo, 2009)</ref>. It is stated that as the organizational support perception of individuals with high internal locus of control increases, the tendency to remain silent will decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kulualp &amp; Çakmak, 2016)</ref>. Teacher locus of control, as related variable to some personal and organizational factors, may be examined in relation to organizational silence behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-confidence</head><p>Self-confidence is another variable that is thought to be related to organizational silence. Changes in the management approach make it necessary to work with individuals who have a critical perspective, who are open to cooperation, who have high self-esteem, and who care about team work <ref type="bibr">(Çakıcı, 2010)</ref>. Determining the level of selfconfidence and related variables is also important in terms of ensuring their use in the learning and teaching process (Tezci, 2010).</p><p>Individuals' self-confidence allows them to learn at a high level in learning environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ornstein &amp; Lasley, 2000)</ref>, to exhibit independent, creative and productive behaviors in interpersonal relationships, and to make changes by offering alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Yıldırım, 2004)</ref>. Their personal judgments and beliefs about their own abilities and skills are very important in terms of solving the problems teachers encounter in the teaching process, their approach to teaching responsibilities, their work in the classroom and their effects on students (Rubie- <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Davies, Flint, &amp; McDonald, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ryan, Kuusinen, &amp; Bedoya-Skoog, 2015)</ref>. Organizational silence, which is worth examining by researchers in recent years, is considered among the factors that weaken the organization's operation and cause inefficiency that may prevent change <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Arlı, 2013)</ref>. It has been observed that some personality and demographic characteristics of employees are effective in exhibiting silence behaviors, and those who state that they do not hesitate to speak openly generally use concepts that express their style of struggling with life events such as self-confidence, determination, and combative personality structure (Uçar, 2016). The fear of losing self-confidence as a result of the managers giving negative feedback to their employees causes silence behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Personality issue is an area that needs to be focused on in terms of providing the opportunity to better understand employee behavior, analyze, interpret and examine the changes of behaviors with working life <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Aytaç, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Organizational Support</head><p>The perception of organizational support, which is defined as the general belief of employees that their contributions to the organization are valued and their happiness is valued, may also be a premise shaping organizational silence behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002)</ref>. Individuals with strong organizational support perception theoretically tend to behave in accordance with the benefit of the organization <ref type="bibr">(Stamper &amp; Johlke, 2003)</ref>. In this sense, it is mentioned that perceived organizational support is an important variable in explaining and predicting employees' attitudes and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Yüksel, 2006)</ref>. According to the organizational support approach, which is based on the theory of social change, employees develop a general perception and belief about how much they appreciate by the organization in return for their services and efforts. In line with this general perception, employees develop loyalty to the organization in proportion to the material and moral contributions provided by the organization and base their behavior on reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Eisenberger, Hungtington, Hutchison, &amp; Sowa, 1986)</ref>. In the study conducted by It can be claimed that there is a causal relationship between the perception of organizational support and prosocial silence behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kızrak &amp; Yeloğlu, 2016)</ref>. According to the research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Rahimi and Zahari (2020)</ref>, it is stated that organizational support leads to a decrease in silence, increases the general belief that their efforts are valued and well-being is important, and facilitates the communication of honest and genuine comments about organizational situations and events. The mediating effect of the trust variable in the relationship between perceived organizational support and silence was examined, it was found that there was a negative relationship between organizational support and trust and organizational silence, and a positive relationship between organizational support and trust. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Singh &amp; Malhotra, 2015)</ref>. However, there are also studies indicating that prosocial silence is not affected by organizational support <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kulualp &amp; Çakmak, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yürür, Sayılar, Yeloğlu, &amp; Sözen, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, conducting research by including different premises with perceived organizational support can provide the subject to be handled from different perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method Research Model</head><p>The research was carried out based on the relational survey model. Relational studies are research models that aim to determine the presence and / or degree of co-variation among two or more variables. Relational survey model does not give a real cause-effect relationship, but if the situation in one variable is known, it allows the other to be estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Karasar, 2006)</ref>. In this research, structural equation model was used to determine the relationship between teachers' locus of control, self-confidence and perceived organizational support levels and organizational silence behaviors.</p><p>Structural equation models are comprehensive statistical techniques used to test causal relationships between directly observed variables and the unobservable variables associated with them. This model assumes that there is a causality structure among the variables that cannot be observed and that these variables can be measured through the observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Yılmaz &amp; Çelik, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Structural equation models or relational models developed in a historical order as regression models, path models, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, path analysis was used to model the explanatory relationships between the observed variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population and Sampling</head><p>The population of the research was composed of 6030 teachers working in 119 Anatolian high schools in the central districts of Ankara, Turkey in 2016-2017 academic year. The teachers in the sample were selected from the simple sampling method, which is one of the random sampling methods. Random sampling methods are stronger than other sampling methods in providing representation, and the sample has a higher power to represent the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Büyüköztürk, Çakmak, Akgün, Karadeniz, &amp; Demirel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Karasar, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In line with this information, a sample of 450 people was selected from the teachers working in the official Anatolian high schools in the central districts of Ankara. As a result of outlier analysis 14 questionnaires are excluded, and the study continued with 436 samples. It is seen that more than half of the teachers participating in the research are women (59.0%), the majority are married (83.8%) and undergraduate graduates (78.5%). The age range of the participants ranged from 24 to 63, with an average age of about 44; professional seniority ranges from 1 to 40 years, while average professional seniority is about 20 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Tools</head><p>In order to collect data, Locus of Control Scale, Self-confidence Scale, Perceived Organizational Support Scale and Organizational Silence Scale were used. In the data collection tool applied to teachers, other than these measures, questions were asked to determine the gender, marital status, educational status, age and professional seniority of teachers.</p><p>Locus of Control Scale. The locus of control scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rotter (1966)</ref> was adapted to Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dağ (1991)</ref>. In this scale, which consists of 29 items, each item includes two options in the form of forced choice and aims to determine the possible position of the generalized control expectations of individuals on the dimension of internality-externality. To hide the purpose of the scale, 6 items (1, 8, 14, 19, 24, and 27) were placed as fillers. "a" options questions 2, 6, 7, 9, <ref type="bibr">16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, and 29 and "b" options of questions of 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 22, 26</ref> and 28 get 1 point. Thus, the options in the direction of externality are evaluated with 1 point, and the options in the aspect of internality are evaluated with 0 points, and points between 0-23 are taken. Rising scores show an increase in the belief in external locus of control.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dağ (1991)</ref>, this scale, which emerged with the adaptation of the J. Rotter's Locus of Control Scale to Turkish, yielded similar results with the original. Item-total score correlations of this scale, which is frequently used in researches, varied between .11 and .48; in a sample, the internal consistency coefficient was reported to be .77. Test-retest reliability coefficient is .83 (p&lt;.001; df = 98). The reliability coefficient of the scale calculated with the KR-20 technique was found to be .68, and the Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be .70. In the main study, the internal consistency coefficient over the data of the sample (n = 532) is .71. A correlation of .69 was obtained between the interview locus of control mean score and the Rotter's Locus of Control Scale scores of the subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dağ, 1991)</ref>. In this study, items 12, 22, 24 and 29 were excluded from the questionnaire since permission was not obtained from Ministry of National Education, and 25 items were included to the study. According to the results of Tetrachoric factor analysis performed on the locus of control scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rotter (1966)</ref>, the 54 original factor structure of the scale could not be reached. The original structure of the scale was preserved in case the alternatives like item discarding negatively affect the scope validity and Cronbach's alpha internal consistency reliability coefficient was calculated as .65.</p><p>Self-confidence Scale. The self-confidence scale, which consists of 44 items, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Akın (2007)</ref> on the basis of Bandura's selfefficacy theory, was written as a five-step Likert ("1" Never, "2" Rarely, "3" Often, "4" Usually, "5" Always) grading scale and validity and reliability analyzes were made on these items. Internal self-confidence sub-dimension consists of 17 items <ref type="bibr">(1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, and 32)</ref> and evaluates features such as the individual loves and knows himself, setting clear goals. The external selfconfidence sub-dimension consists of 16 items <ref type="bibr">(2, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, and 33)</ref> and is aimed at the external environment and social life of individuals. It is related with selfconfidence and includes features such as easy communication, expressing yourself in a healthy way, controlling feelings and taking risks. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 165, and the lowest score is 33. The high score obtained from the scale with no negative items indicates a high level of self-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Akın, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>KMO coefficient and Bartlett's Sphericity test were calculated to determine the appropriateness of the research data to perform Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA). The KMO value was determined as .88. When the literature is examined, it is stated that .50 or .60 KMO value will be the lower value. For example, Kaiser (1974) states that KMO value greater than .50 may be sufficient to perform factor analysis. In this case, the KMO value of .88 observed is higher than the recommended KMO value. Bartlett's Sphericity test is a statistical technique used to check whether research data comes from multivariate normal distribution. Thus, the significance of the chisquare test statistic indicates that the data comes from a multivariate normal distribution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion, Conclusion, and Suggestions</head><p>At the end of the research, it was observed that there was a negative and significant relationship between locus of control and internal self-confidence, external self-confidence, and perceived organizational support. Self-confidence and perceived organizational support level decrease as the belief in external locus of control increases, as it is thought that success and failure situations do not depend on their own behavior. However, as the belief in external locus of control increases, accepting silence and defensive silence behavior also increase. In the study conducted by Şekerli (2013), it was stated that organizational silence behaviors decrease as the locus of control shifts from outside to inside. This situation can be explained by the ability of self-confident individuals with internal locus of control to express their thoughts and feelings and to have problem-solving skills.</p><p>Individuals focused on internal control who believe that they can affect events are able to express their ideas, requests, suggestions and criticisms more easily, and exhibit a more willing attitude to change the conditions in the environment. Therefore, it can be said that teachers with a focus on internal control will affect students positively.</p><p>There is no relationship between locus of control and participation in educational decision-making processes, appreciating their efforts and paying attention to their happiness enable them to participate voluntarily in activities and show high performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Korkmaz, 2006)</ref>. Teachers' possibility of attending meetings, helping their colleagues, making suggestions for improvement and performing useful activities are closely related to the organizational support they feel, and negative organizational behaviors direct them to give negative reactions <ref type="bibr">(Özdemir, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Öztürk (2019)</ref> states that teachers prefer accepting silence and protective silence. In the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kulualp and Çakmak (2016)</ref>, it was stated that perceived organizational support should be increased in order to reduce the accepting silence, and organizational support did not have a significant effect on prosocial silence. Akçin, Erat, Alnıaçık and Çiftçioğlu (2017) also revealed that as perceived organizational support increased, defense silence decreased. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hu, Zhu, Zhou, Li, Maguire, Sun, and Wang (2018)</ref> emphasized the importance of the belief that thoughts will not be harmed and faced with a risky situation so that they can be expressed easily.

This research shows that self-confidence and perceived organizational support level decrease as the belief in external locus of control increases, as it is thought that success and failure situations do not depend on their own behavior. Observations indicate that there is no relationship between locus of control and protectionist silence and as self-confidence and perceived organizational support level increases, accepting and defensive silence behavior decreases. It is critical to see that perceived the organizational support has the highest effect on teachers' perceptions of organizational silence and selfconfidence and the organizational support perceived by individuals 44 with low internal locus of control affects silence behavior more strongly. It is also found that the self-control level affects the selfconfidence level positively and that the external locus of control negatively affects the self-confidence level.</figDesc></figure>

It is stated that perceived organizational support contributes to the 50 development of organizational commitment, increases willingness to help the organization, and improves consistent positive attitudes and behaviors by making more work-related efforts<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(James et al., 2015)</ref>.Whether employees share their ideas for the benefit of the organization or remain silent for this purpose depends on how much support they receive from the organization. Giving importance to learning activities, encouraging new practices and methods and encouraging employees to question the status quo are effective in increasing the perceived organizational support. When employees feel that they are operating in an organization where they are supported, who value their wellbeing and happiness, they refrain from voicing their feelings and thoughts in order not to disturb the harmony and peace of the organization, to keep their colleagues and supervisors in a difficult situation, and to harm the spirit of unity and solidarity.</figDesc></figure>

Organizational Silence Scale. In order to measure organizational silence, the organizational silence scale developed by Van Dyne et al. (2003) and adapted to Turkish by Taşkıran (2010) was used in the scope of this study. The scale measures organizational silence in three different dimensions: accepting silence, defensive silence and protectionist silence. The scale, which consists of 15 items, allows to determine three different types of silence from 5 items. Employees</figDesc></figure>

With this aspect, it can be said that the construct validity and reliability of the scale are provided. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to see whether the three-factor structure of the scale was confirmed. As a result of the CFA, it was understood that the model related to the three-factor structure of the scale fit well with the data (X 2 /df=128.500/86=1.49; RMSEA= .039; GFI= .86; AGFI= .80; CFI = .93; NFI = .83).</figDesc></figure>

Predictive Effects of Organizational Support and Locus of Control on Organizational Silence and Self-confidence Path analysis was carried out to determine the level and direction of organizational support and locus of control of the Anatolian high school teachers' organizational silence and selfconfidence perception levels.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>silence variable was not related to any variable in the scope of the research. The results of the research show that the variable that has the highest effect on teachers' perceptions of organizational silence and self-confidence is perceived organizational support. The finding, which indicates that the locus of control variable predicts selfconfidence negatively, shows that the self-control level affects the selfconfidence level positively and that the external locus of control negatively affects the self-confidence level. It is seen that the organizational support variable is a positive predictor of selfconfidence. It was concluded that as the level of organizational support and self-confidence increased, organizational silence behaviors decreased and the locus of control variable predicted organizational silence positively. Individuals who are valued and cared for by the institution they work for experience feelings such as positive thinking, taking responsibility, taking risks and not being afraid of making mistakes and this may increase their self-confidence level. By expressing their innovative ideas and suggestions in a supportive work environment, teachers can improve their performance and keep up with the rapidly changing world of science and education. School principals need to know how to support teachers as organizational support has many dimensions and changes<ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Singh &amp; Billingsley, 2001)</ref>.Locus of control and organizational support variables havedirect and indirect predictive effects on organizational silence. It has been observed that locus of control has a direct and indirect predictive 66 effect on organizational silence through self-confidence. Similarly, the direct and indirect predictive effects of perceived organizational support on organizational silence and self-confidence were found to be significant. Since a high level of organizational trust eliminates organizational silence, management should carry out more activities to develop organizational trust. To this end, a culture that promotes multilateral communication and dialogue among employees should be adopted first. Employees' sense of justice should be handled with strong corporate values by rewarding individual and team work, and transparent and competitive reward systems should be developed for this. It is important to make the workload manageable. Preparing employees through planning and personnel development programs and giving them the opportunity to realize their potential will increase their loyalty to the institution. In this study, the relationship between organizational silence and locus of control, self-confidence, perceived organizational support was examined. In studies conducted in Turkey it has been found that the Rotter's Locus of Control Scale is widely used. In this study, the version adapted to Turkish by Dağ (1991) was used. It has been observed that the recently translated or developed locus of control scales are more directed at children and adolescents. Another limitation of the research is related to the generalization of the results obtained. The sample of the research; It includes teachers working in Anatolian high schools in the central districts of Ankara. Conducting the research only in the public sector is also among the limitations of the study. In addition, it was observed that the participants were partially hesitant to express their views on the issue of organizational silence.There is a need for further studies on whether the personality traits that shape the behavior and attitudes of the teachers are effective in their silence behaviors. This reality is very more important for the schools as being synergistic institutions. All other stakeholders in the school, especially the policymakers, administrators and teachers, have to create a wealth of thoughts, ideas and opinions, provide effective feedback in the learning and development process, and internalize different perspectives by synthesizing them.In order to improve the managerial skills of school administrators and to increase peer learning and solidarity among teachers, teachers should be professionals who can generate ideas, share their opinions, solve problems and express themselves.Policymakers should examine the variables associated with organizational silence in order to create such a school culture and climate that is open to communication, thinking and generating synergy. It can be said that researchers examining different personal, social and organizational variables that explain organizational silence will contribute to the field.It is necessary to carry out studies to increase the awareness level of teachers about organizational silence and negative consequences of silence, to determine the type of support needed, to ensure participation in the activities and decision-making process in the school, and to create a healthy school climate where ideas and opinions can be expressed openly. Considering that behavioral cycles and personality traits leading to organizational silence cannot be directly observed and are the result of a long process starting from childhood, it is necessary to emphasize the concept of perceived organizational support. As it is understood from the results, perceived organizational 68 support increases teacher self-confidence and decreases teacher organizational silence.</figDesc></figure>
