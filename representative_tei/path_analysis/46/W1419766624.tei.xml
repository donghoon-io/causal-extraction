<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Since the early 2000s, evidence has accumulated for a significant differential effect of firstline antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment outcomes, such as CD4 response and viral load suppression. This finding was replicated in our data from the Harvard President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program in Nigeria. Investigators were interested in finding the source of these differences, i.e., understanding the mechanisms through which one regimen outperforms another, particularly via adherence. This amounts to a mediation question with adherence playing the role of mediator. Existing mediation analysis results, however, have relied on an assumption of no exposure-induced confounding of the intermediate variable, and generally require an assumption of no unmeasured confounding for nonparametric identification. Both assumptions are violated by the presence of drug toxicity. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and show that certain path-specific effects remain identified under weaker conditions. We focus on the path-specific effect solely mediated by adherence and not by toxicity and propose a suite of estimators for this effect, including a semiparametric-efficient, multiply-robust estimator. We illustrate with simulations and present results from a study applying the methodology to the Harvard PEPFAR data. Supplementary materials are available online.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has been a highly successful program that has saved millions of lives worldwide since its inception in 2003. The Harvard School of Public Health was awarded one of the PEPFAR grants, receiving a total of $362 million for work in Nigeria, Botswana, and Tanzania. The program has furnished these countries with invaluable medical infrastructure and provided AIDS care services in Nigeria for over 160,000 people and treatment to approximately 105,000 of those patients.</p><p>Our data set consists of previously antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected, adult patients enrolled in the Harvard PEPFAR/AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN) program between June 2004 and November 2010 who started ART in the program and were followed for at least 1 year after initiating ART. Upon entry into the Harvard/APIN PEPFAR HIV care program, all patients completed informed consent; all consent forms were approved by the institutional review boards at Harvard, APIN and all the corresponding Harvard/APIN PEPFAR HIV care and treatment sites. Patients not on one of 6 standard first-line regimens at baseline or seen at two of the hospitals without reliable viral load data were excluded from the data set. The analysis in this paper consists of only the complete cases, and results are given for all regimens but d4T+3TC+EFV (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref> note for full drug names), due to the small sample of patients on this regimen as a consequence of it having been dropped midway through the program. (d4T+3TC+NVP was also dropped, but had a large enough sample to provide for stable inference.)</p><p>The significant funding support for AIDS treatment in resource-limited settings provided by PEPFAR and other international donor organizations relied on clinical trial data generated in resource rich settings. In order to maximize the benefit of providing ART to the largest number of patients, well-established drug regimens that were less costly were recommended and supported by the program. Studies dating back to the early 2000s have demonstrated evidence that these first-line regimens were not equally effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tang et al., 2012)</ref>, and indeed, in the Harvard PEPFAR data, we have observed a significant differential effect of first-line ART regimens on virologic failure and, to a lesser extent, CD4 count. Since these were first-line regimens in use in most resource-limited settings, this difference could have widespread implications to the success Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Treatment regimen coding and their estimated average causal effects on risk of virologic failure (VF) and CD4 count path-specific effects canceling one another out. One such path-specific effect could work strictly through biological pathways, in which case this population would benefit most from switching to a more favorable drug regimen. Alternatively, biological factors might play a comparatively smaller role relative to the effect of the treatment through nonbiological pathways, such as through adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Shpitser, 2013)</ref>. We suspect a lack of adherence to treatment to be a driving mechanism of the observed differential effects, in which case it would be worth considering how to improve this mediating factor.</p><p>Adherence is widely accepted as a key factor for sustained viral suppression and is considered a prerequisite for maintenance on a prescribed drug regimen and optimal patient outcomes. However, the extent to which adherence to a given choice of first-line ART contributes to virologic failure (defined by the World Health Organization <ref type="bibr">[WHO]</ref> as repeat viral load &gt; 1000 copies/mL after 6 months of ART duration) is complex and still poorly understood and is a pressing mediation question in HIV research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bangsberg et al., 2000)</ref>. Understanding this issue is particularly important in resource-limited settings, where ART regimen options are few, and adherence to lifelong multi-drug daily dosing is challenging, but necessary. In such settings, quantifying to what degree differential rates of virologic failure are due to differences in adherence rates between therapies would inform the extent to which failure rates could be reduced by programs that improve adherence rates for certain ARTs, rather than changing the ART regimens themselves. Such adherence interventions have been very successful in the treatment of tuberculosis <ref type="bibr">(China Tuberculosis Control Collaboration, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fujiwara et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Suárez et al., 2001)</ref> and are considered similarly important in the treatment of HIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mills et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Vranceanu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pop-Eleches et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Remark. Technically, the WHO also requires demonstration of adherence in their definition of virologic failure, which we avoid using in this paper since we cannot study the role of adherence as a mediator when it is part of the definition of the outcome.</p><p>Among other potential mechanisms, the effect of treatment on virologic failure and CD4 count may be mediated by adherence, drug toxicity, or both. This study investigates the extent to which adherence, and not drug toxicity, mediates the effect, using the Harvard PEPFAR data set.</p><p>That is, we focus on the role of adherence when it is differentially affected by the ways the drugs are obtained and taken, rather than by different levels of toxic side effects. The effect mediated by nonadherence due to toxicity is unlikely to be appreciable, since toxicity in Nigeria is typically clinically recognizable and actionable. The magnitude of the roles of other drug-specific predictors of nonadherence, on the other hand, are less understood. These predictors also potentially point to lower-hanging fruit for development of adherence-promoting interventions. In mediation analysis terminology, we aim to estimate the effects of treatment assignment on virologic failure and CD4 count that are indirect with respect to adherence but direct with respect to toxicity.</p><p>The definition, identification, and estimation of direct and indirect effects have received much attention in recent causal inference literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Robins and Greenland, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Robins, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Robins, , 2003;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pearl, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Avin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Taylor et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Petersen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ten Have et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goetgeluk et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">van der Laan and Petersen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">VanderWeele, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">VanderWeele, , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr">VanderWeele and</ref><ref type="bibr">Vansteelandt, 2009, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Imai et al., 2010a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tchetgen Tchetgen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Shpitser, 2014, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The particular effect we are interested in can be classified as a path-specific effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pearl, 2001</ref>) -a class of estimands which can represent effects along any given causal pathway or collection of causal pathways. We consider the effect along the path from the provision of ART to virologic failure (or CD4 count) that goes through adherence, but not through toxicity. This effect is a measure of the change in risk of virologic failure (or mean CD4 count) were one to intervene on the mechanism by which the choice of treatment regimen directly, i.e., not through toxicity, affects adherence. For instance, if the difference in the effectiveness of ART through adherence were due to some regimens of ART having certain meal restrictions, posing a greater risk of patients missing dosages due to issues with food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Eldred et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gifford et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Roberts, 2000)</ref>, this effect would reflect the change in mean outcome if we were to modify the pills such that they can be taken without any meal restrictions. We emphasize our focus on the pathway through adherence, which does not involve toxicity, to learn about other possible mediating mechanisms that may be as important as toxicity, but are currently underappreciated.</p><p>The presence of an effect through this pathway calls for closer investigation of these possible mechanisms, such as number of pills taken per dosage or the requirement that they be taken with meals. The absence indicates that differential effects through other pathways are driving the observed differences in effects among the treatment assignments. In particular, the efficacies of the drugs themselves may, in fact, differ, i.e., they may have a differential direct effect on the outcome with respect to adherence, or they may have a differential effect on adherence due to their differing levels of toxicity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pearl (2001)</ref> defines path-specific effects, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Avin et al. (2005)</ref> provide general necessary and sufficient conditions for their identification for a single exposure and outcome, while Shpitser (2013) generalizes these definitions and conditions to settings with multiple exposures, multiple outcomes, and possible hidden variables. Our path-specific effect described above satisfies these identifying conditions, however an estimation strategy for its identifying functional does not yet exist. In this paper, we develop a suite of estimators (including a multiply-robust, semiparametricefficient estimator) for the effect. The HIV case study detailed in this paper also functions as a guide for the application of this new method to analogous mediation settings where there is confounding that is affected by the exposure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">NOTATION &amp; DEFINITIONS</head><p>To formalize our discussion, we begin by defining variables and counterfactuals. We will be considering pairwise comparisons of first-line ARTs prescribed to most HIV patients in Nigeria. Let E be an indicator of exposure to one of two such regimens of ART (coding given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>For notational simplicity, let e denote the "reference level" treatment and e denote the "comparison level" treatment. Let C 1 be a bivariate vector of an indicator of any lab toxicities (alanine transaminase ≥120 UI/L, Creatinine ≥260 mmol/L, Hemoglobin ≤8 g/dL) observed six months after treatment initiation and an indicator that the patient's average percent adherence during the same six months, i.e., the total number of days that the patient had their drug supply divided by the number of days in the six month period, was no less than 95%. Let M be an indicator that the patient's average percent adherence during the subsequent six months was no less than 95%. Let Y be an indicator of whether the patient experienced virologic failure at the end of the year (based on viral load measurements at twelve and eighteen months for confirmation), or alternatively CD4 count at twelve months. Let C 0 be a vector of baseline confounders of the causal relationships between E, M , and Y not affected by exposure, viz. sex, age, marital status, WHO stage, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, CD4 count, and viral load. Throughout, we will assume that we observe i.i.d. sampling of O = (C 0 , E, C 1 , M, Y ).</p><p>We now consider counterfactuals under possible interventions on the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rubin, 1974</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C 0 E C 1 M Y</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>: A causal graph with unobserved confounders that allows for identification of the P EM Yspecific effect 1978). Let Y (e * ) denote a patient's virologic suppression status or CD4 count if assigned, possibly contrary to fact, to the regimen of ART e * . In the context of mediation, there will also be counterfactuals for intermediate variables. We define C 1 (e * ), M (c 1 , e * ) and Y (m, e * ) similarly, and adopt the standard set of consistency assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Robins, 1986)</ref> that if E = e * , then To define the path-specific effect along the path E → M → Y , which we denote P EM Y , we begin by discussing the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This is a complete graph of all observed variables in the sense that it includes all possible directed arrows that follow the natural temporal ordering. That is, any variable may directly affect any other variable succeeding it under this graph. The graph departs from the standard mediation graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron and Kenny, 1986)</ref> in two important ways.</p><p>The first is with the presence of C 1 , which allows confounders of the effect of the mediator on the outcome to be affected by the exposure. In our HIV context, C 1 contains toxicity, which is clearly affected by the treatment assignment and may confound the effect of adherence on virologic failure. One way in which it might do this is on a biological level, toxicity might have an interactive effect with the drugs on the outcome, allowed for by the presence of the directed arrow from C 1 to Y in conjunction with the directed arrow from E to Y . Thus, toxicity is a common cause of the outcome and adherence and, therefore, a confounder. Such a confounder is known as a recanting witness, due to its role in telling two conflicting "stories" about how E affects Y by being involved in two different pathway from E to Y -one involving M and the other not. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Avin et al. (2005)</ref> showed the natural (or pure) direct and indirect effects (NDE and NIE, both highly popular in the mediation literature) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Robins and Greenland, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pearl, 2001)</ref> to be unidentified in the presence of a recanting witness.</p><p>The second way the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> departs from the standard mediation graph is by the presence of the gray bidirected edges between C 0 , C 1 , and Y , each of which represents unobserved common causes between the two nodes to which it points. In the HIV application, these bidirected edges allow for the possibility of underlying biological factors which may be unobserved common causes of toxicity, the outcome, and biological baseline measurements such as viral load. The presence of these bidirected edges induces confounding of the effect of adherence on the outcome via toxicity, even if the arrow directed from C 1 to Y is absent. Since early adherence (during the first six months) may confound the effect of adherence at a later stage (during the subsequent six months) on the outcome, early adherence must be included in C 1 . Thus, P EM Y involves only later adherence, and neither toxicity nor early-stage adherence.</p><p>As described above, we wish to quantify the mediating role of adherence along P EM Y in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> which does not involve toxicity. Effects along such arbitrary (bundles of) causal pathways are known as path-specific effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pearl, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Avin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shpitser, 2013)</ref> and it is possible to define them inductively, which results in a quantity that is a function of a nested counterfactual <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Shpitser, 2013)</ref>. A general definition for the static-treatment and single-outcome case is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pearl (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Avin et al. (2005)</ref>. Defining</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">β 0 ≡ E[Y (M (e, C 1 (e )), C 1 (e ), e )] δ 0 ≡ E[Y (M (e , C 1 (e )), C 1 (e ), e )],</formula><p>the P EM Y -specific effect, with respect to the comparison treatment value e and the baseline treatment value e on the mean difference scale, is given by β 0 -δ 0 . δ 0 gives the mean outcome had everyone been assigned to the reference treatment regimen. β 0 gives the mean outcome had everyone been assigned to the reference treatment regimen, and adhered as they would have based on the toxicity they experienced from this regimen, but otherwise as if they had been assigned</p><p>to the comparison treatment. This is the P EM Y -specific effect since it captures the impact of changing M (e ) to M (e, C 1 (e )), which in turn would lead to an effect on Y only if M affects Y directly when all patients are assigned to e .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">IDENTIFICATION</head><p>Before introducing our identification result, we must first introduce a model that relaxes the assumption of independent errors of the Markovian model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Pearl, 2000)</ref> in a natural way. We will associate this model with the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This model consists of a set of equations, one for each variable in the graph. With each random variable on the graph is associated a distinct, arbitrary function, denoted g, and a distinct random disturbance, denoted ε, each with a subscript corresponding to its respective random variable. A component in a graph connected by bidirected edges (i.e., connected when ignoring directed edges) is known as a district <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Richardson, 2009)</ref> or c-component <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tian and Pearl, 2002)</ref>. The sets of random disturbances corresponding to each district are assumed to be mutually independent of one another. That</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">is, {ε C 0 , ε C 1 , ε Y }, ε E</formula><p>, and ε M are mutually independent; ε C 0 , ε C 1 , and ε Y , however, are not.</p><p>Each variable is generated by its corresponding function, which depends only on all variables that directly affect it (i.e., its parents on the graph), and its corresponding random disturbance, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C 0 = g C 0 (ε C 0 ), E = g E (C 0 , ε E ), C 1 = g C 1 (C 0 , E, ε C 1 ), M = g M (C 0 , E, C 1 , ε M ), Y = g Y (C 0 , E, C 1 , M, ε Y ).</formula><p>Just as the Markovian model, the model we introduce is especially useful for making counterfactual independence assumptions explicit. Take for instance the statement {Y (m, e ), C 1 ( e )}⊥ ⊥M (c 1 , e)|C 0 . To see whether this statement holds in the context of the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, observe what occurs when we intervene on the mechanism in one case to force the exposure to be the comparison level, e, and set C 1 to an arbitrary value c 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C 0 = g C 0 (ε C 0 ), E = e, C 1 = c 1 , M (c 1 , e) = g M (C 0 , e, c 1 , ε M ), Y (c 1 , e) = g Y (C 0 , e, c 1 , M (c 1 , e), ε Y )</formula><p>; and in another case to force the exposure to be the reference level, e , and set M to an arbitrary value m:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">C 0 = g C 0 (ε C 0 ), E = e , C 1 (e ) = g C 1 (C 0 , e , ε C 1 ), M = m, Y (m, e ) = g Y (C 0 , e , C 1 (e ), m, ε Y ).</formula><p>Note that the only sources of stochasticity in M (c 1 , e) are C 0 and ε M , and the only sources of stochasticity in {Y (m, e ), C 1 (e )} are C 0 , ε C 1 , and ε Y .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">PATH-SPECIFIC INFERENCE</head><p>Thus far, we have only considered a nonparametric model M nonpar for the observed data, making our identifying functional of the P EM Y -specific effect valid under any possible correct model for the data. Unfortunately, we will seldom have the luxury to continue using M nonpar through the estimation stage; because inference in M nonpar is rarely practical in situations with numerous or continuous confounders (C 0 , C 1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Robins et al., 1997)</ref>, we will often be forced to posit parametric models. Which models we are to fit depend on how we choose to estimate (1). We now consider four estimators and the corresponding models needed to compute them. Note that, while these estimators are in fact asymptotically equivalent under a nonparametric model, they will have different asymptotic properties under parametric and semiparametric models (Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser, 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Maximum Likelihood Estimation</head><p>We first discuss the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for β 0 . By considering the identifying functional (1) as four nested expectations, it is clear that we can fit three appropriate regression models with parameters γ 1 , γ 2 , and γ 3 using maximum likelihood, and plug the predicted means under these models into the functional; the outermost mean can then be estimated empirically. If the conditional mean of Y is taken to be linear in M and C 1 , and the conditional mean of M is taken as linear in C 1 , then mean models can be fit for Y , M , and C 1 . Thus, the MLE is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">βmle ≡ P n Ê( Ê( Ê(Y |M, C 1 , e , C 0 ; γ1 )|C 1 , e, C 0 ; γ2 )|e , C 0 ; γ3 ) ,</formula><p>where P n denotes the empirical mean.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Define γ ≡ (γ 1 , γ 2 , γ 3 ), g(γ) ≡ Ê( Ê( Ê(Y |M, C 1 , e , C 0 ; γ 1 )|C 1 , e, C 0 ; γ 2 )|e , C 0 ; γ 3 ), D γ ≡ E[∇ γ g(γ)],</formula><p>and U(γ) and I(γ) to be the vector of score equations and block-diagonal matrix of expected informations, respectively, for γ.

The MLE is asymptotically efficient when the three regression models are correctly specified, hence this is the minimum variance achievable by regular, asymptotically linear estimators under the choice of model M par of O. βmle will be consistent only under correct specification of the three models.</p></div>

In order to express the estimator more succinctly, we introduce additional notation: </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">B(m, c 1 , e , c 0 ) ≡ E(Y |m, c 1 , e , c 0 ), B (c 1 , e , e, c 0 ) ≡ E{ E(Y |M, c 1 , e , c 0 )|c 1 , e, c 0 }, B (e , e, c 0 ) ≡ E[E{E(Y |M, C 1 , e , c 0 )|C 1 , e, c 0 }|e , c 0 ], M ratio ≡ f (M |C 1 , e, C 0 )/f (M |C 1 , e , C 0 ), and C ratio 1 ≡ f (C 1 |e, C 0 )/f (C 1 |e , C 0 ).

The mean functions in θ M and θ C 1 require correct specification of the functions of M and C 1 based on the working models for Y and {M, Y }, respectively, so that θ W M and θ W C 1 can be correctly specified regardless of whether B W is, and θ W C 1 can be correctly specified regardless of whether θ W M is.

Due to its reliance on inverse-propensity-score weights, this estimator may suffer from instability in settings where the set of positivity assumptions is nearly violated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kang and Schafer, 2007)</ref>. A useful stabilization technique is to simply replace any propensity score fE|X with f † E|X , where X is some vector of covariates and logit fE|X (e|X) = logit fE|X (e|X) -log(1 -P n (1 e (E))) + log(P n [1 e (E) fE|X (e |X)/ fE|X (e|X)]), which ensures the weights are bounded as discussed in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">HARVARD PEPFAR NIGERIA ANALYSIS</head><p>We now present results of the Harvard PEPFAR data analysis. The data set consisted of 9968 complete observations, i.e., observations with no missing variables, which was 41.9% of the entire data set. We first consider the path-specific effect of treatment regimen assignment on virologic failure through adherence, expressed on the log-risk ratio scale. We used each of the four estimators for β 0 from Section 4, and in each case, δ 0 was estimated using only a subset of the models used to estimate β 0 . In particular, the doubly-robust estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang and Robins, 2005)</ref> was used to estimate δ 0 when contrasted with βb and the multiply-robust estimator, βmr ;</p><p>the inverse-probability-weighted estimator (IPW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Horvitz and Thompson, 1952)</ref> was used to estimate δ 0 when contrasted with βa ; and the MLE was used to estimate δ 0 when contrasted with the MLE for the β 0 , βmle . Accordingly, let PEMY ;mle denote the effect estimate using βmle , PEMY ;a denote the effect estimate using βa , PEMY ;b denote the effect estimate using βb , and PEMY ;mr denote the effect estimate using βmr . We computed all four estimates and corresponding bootstrap confidence intervals for each pairwise comparison of treatments. The wild bootstrap <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mammen, 1993)</ref> with weights sampled from Exp(1) was used to account for instability of resamples due to a small number of cases in some strata of E. Results are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> of the supplementary materials. PEMY ;a agreed with PEMY ;mr across all comparisons, suggesting that it did not suffer much from model misspecification, or at least any worse than did PEMY ;mr . It also proved to be the more efficient estimator in this setting, with confidence intervals that were narrower than those of PEMY ;mr , and comparable to those of PEMY ;mle , which did not appear to be as robust. Thus, we chose to perform inference using PEMY ;a for this portion of the analysis.</p><p>Recall that the treatment regimens were coded in descending order of magnitude of their total effects on risk of virologic failure, i.e., they were coded in ascending order of counterfactual risk of virologic failure had everyone been assigned to that treatment, since a lower counterfactual risk of failure corresponds to a higher magnitude of total effect. Because in practice we are more interested in learning how less-effective treatments can be improved, we only consider the highercoded treatment in a pair as the baseline, e . Using this ordering, the path-specific effect gives the improvement over the total effect of the less-effective treatment when intervening to make patients adhere as if they were on the more-effective treatment, but had the toxicity and direct effectiveness of the less-effective treatment.</p><p>We are primarily interested in the proportion of the total effect attributable to the mediated effect, i.e., the percent mediated by P EM Y . If this proportion is close to or exceeds one, we can conclude that the drugs themselves likely have the same effectiveness on virologic failure, and that it is their differential effect on adherence not due to toxicity that is driving the difference in total effects. If, on the other hand, this proportion is small or negative, we can only say that the difference in total effects is not driven by a difference in effects through P EM Y . It may be the case that the efficacies of the drugs themselves do, in fact, differ, or that the difference in total effects is driven by the differential effect on adherence due to toxicity, but we cannot confirm either. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows PEMY ;a divided by the total effect estimates, which are also on the log-risk ratio scale and are estimated by IPW. Superscripts indicate the comparisons with significant and marginally-significant path-specific effects. Due to the treatment coding, the denominators of the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> values are always negative. Thus, a negative path-specific effect will be in the same direction as the total effect, and hence will explain a positive proportion of it. NOTE: * Significant path-specific effect (α = 0.05). † Marginally-significant path-specific effect (α = 0.1).</p><p>Note that all significant and marginally-significant proportions of total effects due to the effects through P EM Y were negative apart from the one comparing treatment 1 (TDF+3TC/FTC+ EFV) to baseline treatment 2 (d4T+3TC+NVP). This occurs when the P EM Y -specific effect estimate is in the opposite direction of the total effect estimate, suggesting that directionallyopposite effects through other pathways overwhelm our estimated effect, and that the total effect would have been even greater if not for the P EM Y -specific effect. For example, had the P EM Yspecific effect been null in the case comparing treatment 3 (AZT+3TC+EFV) with treatment 5 (TDF+3TC/FTC+NVP), we estimate that the total effect would have been 13% larger. The effect of treatment 3 is stronger than 5 not because of its effect through P EM Y , but in spite of it. All differences between treatment 5 and another treatment, and all differences between treatment 4 (AZT+3TC+NVP) and another treatment besides 1 were observed to exhibit this phenomenon as well.</p><p>Now consider the exception noted above: the comparison of treatment 1 (TDF+3TC/FTC+ EFV) to baseline treatment 2 (d4T+3TC+NVP). We saw a marginally-negative effect, which would have the following interpretation: the effect of treatment 2 on the risk of virologic failure would be improved by patients adhering as if they were assigned to treatment 1, but still had the same toxicity that they did on treatment 2. Unfortunately, treatment 2 is known to have toxicities that were not measured in this data set that are likely to also be affected by underlying biological causes of virologic failure. This interpretation cannot even be considered to be valid for the effect through these unmeasured toxicities, since they induce unmeasured confounding that once again renders this effect unidentifiable. If there were no unmeasured toxicities, we would interpret this effect as accounting for an estimated 41% of the differences in total effects between treatments 1 and 2.</p><p>In conclusion, of the significant P EM Y -specific effects we observed, all apart from those involving unmeasured toxicities were countervailing to the total effect. This means that for these treatment pairs, the differences in their total effects on virologic failure would have been even</p><p>greater if not for the effect along P EM Y . Thus, the effect through P EM Y does not explain the differential effects on virologic failure, and in some cases actually works against them. As mentioned above, the differential effects may instead be due to the drugs themselves differing in efficacy, or they may be driven by the differential effects on adherence due to toxicity, but such hypotheses require further investigation beyond the scope of our analysis.</p><p>We now consider the path-specific effect of treatment regimen assignment on log CD4 count, expressed on the mean difference scale. We again analyzed the four estimators given in Section 4. This time PEMY ;a and PEMY ;b were drastically less efficient than PEMY ;mle and PEMY ;mr .</p><p>possible explanation for this is that the density of log CD4 count was less concentrated around zero, making PEMY ;a and PEMY ;b more sensitive to small weights. PEMY ;mle disagreed with PEMY ;mr on several occassions, so PEMY ;mr was the best choice in terms of achieving both robustness and efficiency. It is worth noting that the linear outcome model for CD4 count did not seem to suffer too much from misspecification, while the logistic outcome model for virologic failure did. Results are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> of the supplementary materials.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows PEMY ;mr divided by the total effect estimates, which are also on the log-risk ratio scale and are estimated using doubly-robust estimators. As before, we are interested in NOTE: * Significant path-specific effect (α = 0.05). † Marginally-significant path-specific effect (α = 0.1).</p><p>learning how the less-effective treatment can be improved, but now less-effective is in terms of CD4 count. Since the order of the effectiveness of the treatments for CD4 count is not the same as the order for virologic failure, the treatments which should be considered the comparison versus baseline level in a pair no longer correspond to the treatment coding. The order of the treatments in the margins of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> is rearranged to reflect this different ordering of effectiveness. The denominator for each of the values in the table positive, since a higher counterfactual CD4 count corresponds to a higher magnitude of total effect. Therefore, positive proportions correspond to positive path-specific effects, and negative proportions correspond to countervailing path-specific effects.</p><p>The path-specific effect was found to be significant for only one of the pairwise comparisons: treatment 4 (AZT+3TC+NVP) vs. treatment 3 (AZT+3TC+EFV). This effect is estimated to be in the positive direction, therefore we conclude that the effect of treatment 3 on CD4 count would be improved by patients adhering as if they were assigned to treatment 4 but without necessarily altering toxicity experienced under treatment 3 that they did on treatment 3. The effect through this pathway accounted for almost half of the total effect at an estimated 48%. Thus, if one were interested in improving the effect of AZT+3TC+EFV on CD4 count, it would be worthwhile to examine what mechanisms other than toxicity may be implicated in differential adherence rates between these two regimens. The P EM Y -specific effect comparing treatments 4 and 5 (TDF+3TC/FTC+NVP) was found to be marginally-significantly less than zero. Thus, the difference in total effects of these two treatments is not attributable to their differential effect on adherence not due to toxicity, as the effect through this pathway was in fact in the opposite direction. Rather, this difference was due to differential effects through other pathways as previously described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">DISCUSSION</head><p>In the PEPFAR case study, we observed an interesting trend of countervailing effects along P EM Y to the total effects on virologic failure for most treatment comparisons, meaning that the differences in the total effects of treatment assignment would have been even greater if not for the effects along P EM Y . While this does not help explain why the treatment assignment effects are different (or at least different in the direction that we observe), it does suggest a method for im-proving the regimens that we observed to have greater effects on virologic failure. For a treatment comparison with a significant P EM Y -specific effect, if we could identify what is different about the more effective drug regimen that is causing people to not adhere to it as well, then we could potentially eliminate this mechanism in order to reduce the countervailing P EM Y -specific effect and consequently improve its total effect on virologic failure.</p><p>A countervailing P EM Y -specific effect on CD4 count was also observed between AZT+3TC+</p><p>NVP and TDF+3TC/FTC+NVP, which has the same interpretation as the countervailing effects on virologic failure. On the other hand, almost half of the difference in the effects of AZT+3TC+EFV and AZT+3TC+NVP on CD4 count was found to be attributable to the effect through adherence, but not toxicity. This suggests that the effect of AZT+3TC+EFV on CD4 count could be improved up to that of AZT+3TC+NVP if one could identify and eliminate the mechanisms driving the difference in these treatments' effects on adherence. In the other treatment comparisons, none of the differences in total effects on CD4 count were found to be attributable to an effect through P EM Y . Overall, we have achieved an enhanced understanding of the role of adherence in the effects of the five ART regimens considered on both virologic failure and CD4 count.</p><p>The most significant methodologic contribution of this paper is the extension of mediation analysis methods to settings in which the NDE and NIE may not be identified, viz. settings with unmeasured confounding and exposure-induced confounding of the mediator. We present conditions under which the P EM Y -specific effect is nonparametrically identified as well as four estimators, including an efficient estimator that is multiply robust to model misspecification for settings where nonparametric estimation is not feasible.</p><p>Often effects of adherence are evaluated regarding the treatment assignment as an instrumental variable, relying on an assumption of no direct effect of assignment with respect to adherence.</p><p>Furthermore, instrumental variable methods rely on an assumption of monotonicity in the effect of assignment on adherence. However, neither of these assumptions are reasonable in our setting where we are forced to compare treatments head-to-head rather than to a control exposure level.</p><p>This paper suffers from a few limitations. One is that our identifiability assumptions, though weaker than those of the Markovian model, are still untestable as stated. When possible, we can embed our mediation problem in a larger model represented by a larger graph where treatments can be split into a component corresponding to the EM Y pathway and a component corresponding to all other pathways. This can provide a testable reformulation of identifying assumptions, as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Robins and Richardson (2010)</ref> in simpler mediation contexts. Another limitation is that this method is not yet equipped to handle missing data. As such, only a complete-case analysis was conducted for the HIV data, allowing for the possibility of bias due to informative missingness. Additionally, for both virologic failure and CD4 count outcomes, it is possible that we are underestimating the effect of substantive interest if adherence over the first six months plays a large mediating role since we are forced to control for early adherence and can only estimate the effect through adherence over the second six months. Finally, not a limitation, but rather a caveat, is that the P EM Y -specific effect is not a substitute for the NIE. The NIE is not fully captured by this effect and, in fact, even if the effects along both</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">P EM Y and E → C 1 → M → Y</formula><p>are in the same direction, the NIE does not necessarily have to be. Strong assumptions are needed to draw this conclusion. As such, while often practically meaningful, the P EM Y -specific effect must be interpreted with care and not blindly substituted for the NIE.</p><p>Future directions for this work would, of course, include adjusting the method to account for missing data, which could improve the analysis conducted in this paper. Another important extension would be to the full longitudinal case, with repeated exposures, mediators, and confounders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shpitser (2013)</ref> gives the identifying functional for the analog to the P EM Y -specific effect in this setting, but no estimation strategy exists as of yet. Finally, it is not uncommon for a mediator to be measured with error, which tends to induce bias as shown by VanderWeele et al.</p><p>(2012). It would be valuable to adapt the methods of Tchetgen Tchetgen and Lin (2012) for handling this problem to our setting. Alternatively, parametric approaches have been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Valeri et al., 2014)</ref> that could also potentially be adapted.</p></div>
