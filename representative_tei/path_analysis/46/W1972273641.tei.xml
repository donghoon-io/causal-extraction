<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To explore the role of the integrin signaling pathway in hepatocytes during rat liver regeneration, the integrin signaling pathway-related gene expression profile in hepatocytes of regenerative liver was detected using Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. The chip data showed that 265 genes of the integrin signaling pathway were included by Rat Genome 230 2.0 array and 132 genes showed significant expression changes in hepatocytes of regenerative liver. The numbers of up-, down-and up/down-regulated genes were 110, 15 and 7 respectively. In addition, bioinformatics and systems biology methods were used to analyze the role of the integrin signaling pathway in hepatocytes. The analysis of gene synergy value indicated that paths 1, 8, 12, and 15 promoted hepatocyte proliferation at the priming phase of liver regeneration; paths 1, 3, 8, and 12-15 enhanced hepatocyte proliferation at the progressing phase; paths 11 and 14 promoted hepatocyte proliferation, while paths 12 and 13 reduced hepatocyte proliferation at the terminal phase. Additionally, the other 8 paths (2, 4, 5-7, 9-10 and 16)  were not found to be related to liver regeneration. In conclusion, 132 genes and 8 cascades of the integrin signaling pathway participated in regulating hepatocyte proliferation during rat liver regeneration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>It is well known that the rat liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate in response to partial hepatectomy (PH) or liver injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. After liver injury or PH, the residual liver cells are rapidly activated and enter the cell cycle to restore the hepatic mass, which is called liver regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Liver regeneration after PH is a very complex and well-orchestrated phenomenon. It is carried out with the participation of all mature liver cell types, and involves numerous physiological activities including activation/expression of a series of cytokines and growth factors, accompanied by cell proliferation, cell differentiation and dedifferentiation, and tissue structure reconstruction, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. As the main functional cell populations in the liver, hepatocytes make up 70-80% of hepatic mass and 65% of total hepatic cell number <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and perform many important physiological functions, including energy storage and metabolism, bile secretion, detoxification, immune response, as well as modification and excretion of substances <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Additionally, hepatocytes are the first cells to begin DNA synthesis and the cell cycle after PH <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Therefore, study of hepatocyte proliferation will provide new insights into liver regeneration. Previous studies showed that hepatocyte differentiation and proliferation are greatly affected by extracellular matrix (ECM) through the integrin signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Recent research demonstrated that disruption of ECM/integrin signaling via elimination of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in hepatocytes interferes with signals, leading to termination of liver regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, the ECM/integrin signaling pathway is a complex signaling transduction network which is made up of many branches. In this study, the branches are named "paths". According to the related websites and references, there are mainly 16 paths in the integrin signaling pathway (as Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> depicts). In paths 1-2, integrins bind to the membrane protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1) through their external and transmembrane domains, then recruitment of Fyn and Shc to Cav-1 results in phosphorylation of Shc Tyr 317 , leading to recruitment of the Grb2/Sos complex for Ras→ERK (extracellular regulated protein kinase) cascade activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Equally, the residue Tyr 925 of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) recruits Grb2/Sos complex and then activates the ERK cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In paths 3-4, integrins bind to ILK, and then trigger the downstream signaling cascades such as ERKs, v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (Akt) / protein kinase-B (PKB) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In paths 5-13, FAK has many phosphorylation sites and combines with numerous intracellular signaling molecules including Src, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), RhoGAP, RhoGEF, and p130CAS (Crk-associated substrate), then activates their downstream signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. α-actinin links tails of integrins to actin fibrils, and also binds to several cytoplasmic molecules including vinculin, zyxin, and ERK1/2, forming path 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In addition, CD47 associates with integrin heterodimer to form a protein complex; the complex stimulates Gs-mediated upregulation of the cAMP cascade through adenyl cyclase (AC), resulting in nuclear translocation of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase-A (PKA), and then enters into PKA→GSK3 and PKA→ERK cascade forming paths 15-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Studies on regulation of the integrin signaling pathway in relation to liver regeneration and hepatic cell differentiation and proliferation have been reported. However, the integrin signaling pathway is a complex signaling transduction network including 16 paths. It is unclear which path of the integrin signaling pathway participates in liver regeneration and how it does, especially the roles of every path in regulation of hepatocyte proliferation. The purpose of this study is to explore which paths of the integrin signaling pathway are involved in regulation of hepatocyte proliferation during rat liver regeneration at the transcriptional level. Firstly, Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array was used to detect expression profiles of integrin signaling pathway-related genes of hepatocytes, which were isolated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation from rat regenerative liver, and then the role of the integrin signaling pathway in hepatocytes during rat liver regeneration was analyzed using bioinformatics and systems biology methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of rat partial hepatectomy model</head><p>Sprague-Dawley rats were provided by the Animal Center of Henan Normal University in compliance with the Laws of Animal Protection of China. A total of 114 SD healthy adult rats, weighing 190±20 g, were randomly divided into 19 groups consisting of nine PH groups, nine sham-operation (SO) groups and one control group with six rats per group. The PH operation was performed according to the classical model of Higgins and Anderson <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. SO was performed by mid-ventral laparectomy. The rats in the control group, serving as a 0-hour sample of both SO groups and PH groups, were sacrificed immediately after the surgical removal of the left and median lateral lobes. The Laws of Animal Protection of China were enforced strictly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation of hepatocytes</head><p>The rats from the SO groups and PH groups were anesthetized by ether and sterilized with 75% alcohol after <ref type="bibr">PH 2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">72</ref>, 120 and 168 h respectively, and then the abdominal cavity was opened. Rats were subjected to ligation of the inferior vena cava both below and above the liver, followed by catheterization of the liver portal vein. Conventional two-step perfusion method was used to disperse liver cells. Briefly, the liver was perfused via the portal vein with calcium-free perfusate preheated at 37°C until the liver surface turned gray, and then perfused with 0.05% type IV collagenase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The perfused liver was cut into small pieces and digested with 0.05% type IV collagenase for 15 min at 37°C. The digested sample was filtered through 400-mesh nylon net. The filtrate was centrifuged at 200g for 5 min. The pellet at the bottom was washed thrice by phosphate buffered saline buffer at 4°C. After adjusting cell concentration to 1×108 cells/ml, 6 ml of the mixed cell suspension was spread on the surface of 4 ml 60% Percoll in a 10 ml tube, and then centrifuged at 200g at 4°C for 15 min. The sediment was enriched with hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunochemical analysis</head><p>A few purified hepatocytes were taken and individually fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 30 min, and then smeared onto glass slides. When the cell suspension dried on glass slides, microwave antigen retrieval was performed. The sections were incubated separately with a 1:200 dilution (V/V) of ALB and G6PC antibodies overnight at 4°C and then with a 1:5,000 (V/V) diluted biotinlabeled secondary antibody at 37°C for 60 min. The system was hybridized with streptavidin-biotin complex (SABC) at 37°C for 30 min. All steps were performed at room temperature. Meanwhile, the paraffinized sections of liver tissue at the corresponding time points were prepared for immunohistochemical performance. The results were observed and analyzed under an optical microscope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection of rat genome 230 2.0 microarray and data analysis</head><p>The total RNA of hepatocytes was extracted according to the manual of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, California, USA) and purified following the RNeasy Mini protocol (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA). The quality of total RNA was assessed by optical density measurement at 260/280 nm and agarose electrophoresis (180 V, 0.5 h); the sample with a 2:1 ratio of 28S RNA to 18S RNA was regarded as qualified <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. T7-oligo DT (24) (Keck Foundation, New Haven, CT), SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and 5 μg of total RNA were used to synthesize the first strand of cDNA. The second strand was synthesized using the Affymetrix cDNA singlestranded cDNA synthesis kit. The cDNA product was purified following the cDNA purify protocol. The 12 μl purified cDNA and the reagents in the GeneChip in Vitro Transcript Labeling Kit (ENZO Biochemical, New York, USA) were used to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA. The labeled cRNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Their concentration, purity and quality were assessed as above for RNA extraction. 15 μl cRNA (1 μg/μl) was incubated with 6 μl 5×fragmentation buffer and 9 μl RNase free water for 35 min at 94°C, and digested into 35-200 bp cRNA fragments. The prehybridized Rat Genome 230 2.0 microarray was put into a hybridization buffer which was prepared following the Affymetrix protocol, and hybridized in a rotating chamber (60 rpm) for 16 h, at 45°C. The hybridized arrays were washed by wash buffer to remove the hybridization buffer, and stained in GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA). Then the arrays were scanned and imaged with a GeneChip Scanner 3000. The images showing gene expression abundance were converted into signal values, signal detection values (P, A, M) and experiment/control values (Ri) using Affymetrix GCOS 2.0. The data of each array were initially normalized by scaling all signals to a target intensity of 200. When the P value is &lt; 0.05, it means that the gene is present (P), a value &lt; 0.065 means marginal (M), and a value &gt; 0.065 is marked absent (A). On the other hand, the normalized signal value in PH to that in the control was used to calculate the relative value, that is, the ratio value of gene expression abundance. To minimize the technical error from array analysis, each sample was tested at least three times using Rat Genome 230 2.0 microarray. Their average value was calculated as the corrective value. Finally, these values were analyzed with GeneMath, GeneSpring, Microsoft Excel Software and Pathway Studio 7.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RT-PCR</head><p>To verify the chip data, six genes were selected for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Firstly their total mRNA was isolated. Of them, 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers and a reverse transcription kit (Promega). The primer was designed with Primer Express 2.0 software according to the GenBank number of six target genes including alb, g6pc, apoe, jun, trim24, and myc, and synthesized by Shanghai Generay Biotech Co, Ltd. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random primers and a reverse transcription kit (Promega). First-strand cDNA samples were subjected to quantitative PCR amplification by using SYBR ® Green I on the Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Robotics, San Francisco, CA). Every sample was analyzed in triplicate. Standard curves were generated from five repeated ten-fold serial dilutions of cDNA, and the copy numbers of target genes in every milliliter of the sample were calculated according to the standard curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of genes associated with integrin signaling pathway of hepatocytes and their relation to liver regeneration</head><p>To identify genes associated with integrin signaling pathways of hepatocytes in rat regenerating liver, the words "integrin" and "integrin signaling pathway" were entered into NCBI (www. ncbi.nlm. nih. gov) and RGD (www.rgd.mcw.edu) to identify its genes associated with rat, mouse and human. Then, the influential genes were collated according to the biological pathways embodied by GENEMAP (www.genmapp.org), KEGG (www.genome.jp/ kegg/pathway.html), and BIOCARTA (www.biocarta.com/genes/index.asp), etc., and the genes associated with the integrin signaling pathway were collated and reconfirmed through the literature by searching pertinent articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. To confirm the genes related to liver regeneration, a gene was considered as significantly up-regulated when its expression change was ≥ 3 as compared with the control, as significantly down-regulated when the change was ≤ 0.33, and as significantly up/down-regulated when it has been up-regulated and downregulated in liver regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene synergy analysis of integrin signaling pathway</head><p>According to the gene expression, abundance of the integrin signaling pathway of hepatocytes in regenerating liver detected by Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array, and interactions of genes curated from the ResnetCore7.01 database, which is attached in Pathway Studio 7.0 software, and integrating the rationale that the role of a gene relies on its interactions with others, a mathematical model (E t ) was established to measure gene synergy between the related genes with time series analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and correlation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> based on the multivariate statistical method. This mathematical model describes how physiological activities are governed by gene synergy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">n n (t) (t) i k i k i =1 k =1 t (X , X ) * r E = n (n + 1 )      </formula><p>In the formula, the gene correlation coefficient (r ik ) was defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">m m m (t) (t) (t) (t) i k i k t=1 t=1 t=1 ik m m m m (t) 2 (t) 2 (t) 2 (t) 2 i i k k t=1 t=1 t=1 t=1 m( X X ) -( X )( X ) r = m (X ) -( X ) m (X ) -( X )                   </formula><p>"E" means gene synergy value which refers to physiological activity.

Physiological activities in liver regeneration are more strengthened than control groups when E t ＞ 2E 0 ; the activities are suppressed or lowered when E t -E 0 ＜ 0, and the activities are similar in two groups when E 0 ＜ E t ＜ 2E 0 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation and identification of hepatocytes</head><p>As an example, here we present the morphology and vitality of hepatocytes isolated from a PH 0 h liver sample. Immunohistochemistry data showed that ALB and G6PC were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of liver tissue and hepatocytes. After isolation, the percentage of ALB-and G6PC-positive cells among the purified hepatocytes was for both over 96% at any time point after PH (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consistency of the quantitative RT-PCR results and the microarray results</head><p>In order to determine the validity of results obtained by the microarray analysis, six randomly selected genes were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The detection of RT-PCR and Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array showed that the expression trends of six genes including alb detected by the two methods were generally consistent, suggesting that the array check results were reliable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).  </p></div>

In these significant expression genes, 110 genes showed up-regulation, 15 genes showed down-regulation and 7 genes showed up/down-regulation in hepatocytes during liver regeneration (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene synergy analysis of integrin signaling pathway in hepatocytes</head><p>The gene synergy and the physiological activities of the integrin signaling pathway in hepatocytes of regenerative liver were analyzed using the mathematical model (E t ). The results indicated that 8 paths of the integrinsignaling pathway were related to hepatocyte proliferation of rat regenerative liver. Of them, the E t values of paths 1, 8, 12, and 15 were larger than control groups at the priming phase of liver regeneration, indicating that these paths promote hepatocyte proliferation at this phase; similarly, the E t values of paths 1, 3, 8, and 12-15 were higher than control groups at the progressing phase, indicating that these paths enhance hepatocyte proliferation at the progressing phase; paths 11 and 14 promoted hepatocyte proliferation while paths 12 and 13 reduced hepatocyte proliferation at the terminal phase. The other 8 paths (2, 4, 5-7, 9-10, and 16) were not found to be related to rat liver regeneration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Liver regeneration involves a sequence of orchestrated events including activation/expression of a series of cytokines and growth factors, accompanied by cell proliferation, cell differentiation and dedifferentiation, and tissue structure reconstruction, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Hepatocytes are the chief functional cells of the liver, making up roughly 80% of the mass of the liver, and play an important role in liver regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Therefore, research into the underlying mechanism of hepatocyte proliferation would provide new insights into liver regeneration. Firstly, we collected high-purity (over 96%) hepatocytes isolated from six PH rats per group together using two-step perfusion and Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Meanwhile, we established a mathematical model (E t ) to measure gene synergy of every path in the integrin signaling pathway. At the priming phase (0.5-6 h after PH) of rat liver regeneration, expression of numerous genes including cell proliferation-and apoptosis-related genes promoted the conversion of hepatocytes from G0 phase into G1 phase, completing the launching of liver regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Analysis of the integrin signaling pathway related gene expression profile and the gene synergy value of paths showed that some genes and paths were significantly different compared with control groups. The gene synergistic effect (E t ) of path 1 was higher than the control at the priming phase, meaning that this path possibly takes part in hepatocyte G0/G1 transition of the cell cycle. Meanwhile, Cav-1 in path 1 is downregulated at 2 h and 6 h after PH. The genes of Elk1, Elk2, and Ccnd1 are upregulated. A recent study showed that integrins bind to the membrane protein caveolin and activate ERK1/2 via the Grb2/Sos→Ras → Raf →MEKs cascade reaction (path 1), and finally regulate cyclin D1 gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Williams et al.</ref> reported that decrease of Cav1 expression resulted in activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and thus accelerated the cell cycle process and promoted cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Additionally, FAK is primarily recruited to sites of integrins via interaction between its C-terminal domain and integrinassociated proteins. The cytoplasmic tail of β-integrins (β1, β3 and β5) facilitates FAK activation, then activates the Rho GAPase → PIP2→PKC (path 8) or PI3K →Vav→ PAK→ MAPK (path 12) signaling pathway, and then regulates the cell cycle process and cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. A previous study showed that cells injected with GST-C-term of FAK had decreased DNA synthesis compared with the control. These findings indicated that FAK functions in the regulation of cell migration and cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Increased FAK expression facilitates transcription factor NF-КB activation, thereby promoting cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, activated RhoGAPase can also control the cell cycle process through regulating expression of cyclin D in G1 phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. In our study, we have found that gene synergistic effects (E t ) of both path 8 and path 12 were also higher than the control, meaning that these paths possibly regulated hepatocyte proliferation in the primary phase of liver regeneration. Moreover, many genes involved in these paths (i.e. ptk2, ptk2b encoding FAK, Arhgap11a, Arhgap4, Arhgap20, Arhgap9, Arhgap10, Arhgap22, Arhgap27 encoding RhoGAPase) were up-regulated in the primary phase of liver regeneration, indicating that these genes play an important role in hepatocyte proliferation. In addition, CD47 associated with integrin heterodimer to form a protein complex, which stimulates Gs-mediated up-regulation of the cAMP cascade through AC; cAMP may also activate PKA, which may further activate the Rap pathway, finally activating ERK 1/2 (path 15). G proteins regulate adenylate cyclase activity by adjusting the level of intracellular cAMP, and play an important role in regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Studies have proved that G-protein-coupled receptor signaling and small GTPase signal transduction can promote the growth of remnant liver at the primary phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In our study, we found that gene synergistic effects (E t ) of path 15 were also higher than the control; meanwhile, the genes (Gna15, Gnai1, Gnat1, Gnat2, Gnaz; Gnb3, Gnb5; and Gng3, Gng8, Gng11) encoding Gα, Gβ and Gγ subunits, respectively, were up-regulated in hepatocytes at the primary phase, and the gene which encodes adenyl cyclase was also up-regulated, indicating that these genes play an important role in hepatocyte proliferation. To summarize, four paths (paths 1, 8, 12 and 15) mediated by integrin may promote hepatocyte proliferation at the primary phase, based on the analysis of gene expression and gene synergy value. Previous studies have demonstrated that the proliferation of hepatocytes occurred mainly at the progressing phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In the present study, analysis of the gene synergistic effect (E t ) of the four paths mentioned above showed that their E t s were also higher than the control, indicating that these paths were promoting hepatocyte proliferation not only at the primary phase, but also at the progressing phase. In addition, the E t of path 3 was higher than the control, too. Integrins combined with ILK, and then regulated expression of cyclin D1 by activation of the ERK→MSK1/2→CREB pathway (path 3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Transfer of ILKoverexpressing hepatocytes resulted in continued high levels of expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A proteins, indicating that, when overexpressed, ILK induces signaling pathways resulting in the stimulation of G1/S cyclin-Cdk activities, finally leading to hepatocytes entering S phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. This study showed the genes Ilk, Rps6ka4, Rps6ka5, Creb1, Creb3, Creb4, and Ccnd1 involving path 3 were up-regulated at 24-30 h, 24-72 h, 12-72 h, 72 h, 72 h, 12 h and 30 h, and 30 h and 72 h, respectively, indicating that these genes probably were related to an increase of hepatocyte proliferation activities at the progressing phase. P130Cas interacts with FAK through its SH3 domain and is then phosphorylated by Src, leading to recruitment of Crk, and enters the Rac→PAK→MAPK→JNK pathway through Dock1 (path 13) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. α-actin links tails of integrins and binds to zyxin, then also enter the Rac→ PAK → MAPK→JNK pathway (path 14) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Previous studies indicated that Src protein expression and activity increased significantly in cells which had strong proliferation activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. When Src gene expression was inhibited, the cells during division stopped at G2 phase, and stopped at conversion to the M phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. We found that the gene synergistic effects (E t ) of paths 13 and 14 were higher than the control, and what is more, the genes involved in these paths (i.e. Src, Actn1, Actn2, Ccnd1, Nfkb1, Nfkb2) were up-regulated at the progressing phase, meaning that these paths and genes possibly regulated hepatocyte proliferation at the progressing phase. Finally, seven paths (1, 3, 8, and paths 12-15) mediated by integrin may promote hepatocyte proliferation at the progressing phase of liver regeneration.</p><p>In the terminal phase (120-168 h after PH), cell differentiation, adhesion and tissue structure reconstruction were the main physical activity. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were weak at this phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The report showed that hepatocyte proliferation-related genes were down-regulated and cell proliferation was inhibited in the terminal phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The genes Fn1 and Fbn1 encoding fibronectin, the genes Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1, Col5a2, Col8a1, Col9a3, Col10a1, Col11a1, Col13a1, Col17a, and Col24a1 encoding collagen, and the genes Lama5 and Lamb1 encoding laminin, which participate in cell adhesion and tissue structure reconstruction, were up-regulated in hepatocytes at the terminal phase. Our finding was consistent with the results above. Moreover, the gene synergistic effects (E t ) of paths 11 and 14 were higher than the control; conversely the E t of paths 12 and 13 were lower than the control, indicating that hepatocyte proliferation was reduced at the terminal phase of liver regeneration.</p><p>In conclusion, 132 genes and 8 paths of the integrin signaling pathway participated in regulation of hepatocyte proliferation during rat liver regeneration. The above results will be confirmed using gene knockout and addition or RNA interference in vivo and in vitro in future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
