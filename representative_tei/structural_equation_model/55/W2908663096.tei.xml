<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study analyzes the impact of work-family policies (WFP) on job performance, and the possible moderating role of gender and family responsibilities. Hypothesis testing was performed using a structural equation model based on a PLS-SEM approach applied to a sample of 1,511 employees of the Spanish banking sector. The results show that neither the existence nor the accessibility of the WFP has a direct, positive impact on performance, unlike what we expected, but both have an indirect effect via the well-being generated by these policies. We also find that neither gender nor family responsibilities have a significant moderating role on these relations, contrary to what we initially expected.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Having policies in place to help workers balance work and family-work-family policies (henceforth, WFP)-is an intangible capital within corporate social responsibility because it generates an improvement in the firm's external social image.</p><p>In many cases, literature assumes that the WFC and WFP impacts on employee performance are direct, but some studies consider the possible intervention of mediating variables that-influenced by WFC or the WFP in place-ultimately affect job performance. The most widely studied of these mediating variables are stress, job satisfaction, motivation, and commitment to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Ravangard et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Wang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Karatepe, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Hyun &amp; Kim, 2012)</ref>. These variables can generate both positive and negative affective states that influence the worker's psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Higgs &amp; Dulewicz, 2014)</ref>, so they can be included within the concept of emotion-based well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Wright, 2014)</ref>. And the literature on workers' emotion-based well-being finds that this well-being has a significant effect on job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Wright, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The need to reduce the problems resulting from WFC has encouraged firms to implement WFP. But having these policies in place is not enough: the workers need to know about them <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Budd &amp; Mumford, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Yeandle et al., 2002)</ref> and to be able to access them without negative repercussions for themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Whitehouse &amp; Zeitlin, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gray &amp; Tudball, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bond, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>WFP are mainly designed with workers who have family responsibilities in mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Premeaux et al., 2007)</ref>. The literature observes that women assume these responsibilities to a greater extent than men, so gender is an important variable in the WFC literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Blanch &amp; Aluja, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Linehan &amp; Walsh, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Harrington, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Harris, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kirkwood &amp; Tootell, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We now describe the theoretical framework that will form the foundations for the hypotheses in our model that we statistically test in our subsequent empirical study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WFP: existence and accessibility</head><p>In the WFP literature authors often analyze the impact of the existence of such policies on workers' behaviors and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Sturman &amp; Walsh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Vanderpool &amp; Way, 2013)</ref>. But the mere existence of such policies is a necessary but insufficient condition.</p><p>For the WFP to actually generate benefits the workers first need to know that they exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Yeandle et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mumford, 2005)</ref>. They then need to perceive that the policies are accessible to them, in other words they can use them without negative consequences for themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gray &amp; Tudball, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Whitehouse &amp; Zeitlin, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bond, 2004)</ref>. Some studies examining the accessibility of WFP suggest that workers are not always aware that they can use these policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Yeandle et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Budd and Mumford, 2005)</ref>. Moreover, the fact that WFP are in place in the firm does not necessarily mean that the workers perceive that they can use them freely <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gray &amp; Tudball, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Whitehouse &amp; Zeitlin, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bond, 2004)</ref>. For this, the organization needs to promote a climate that supports the use of the WFP. Workers may be discouraged from using these policies out of fear that they will lose their chances of promotion, that others will think they are not fully committed to the firm, or even that they will lose their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Whitehouse &amp; Zeitlin, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The hypotheses we propose in this work take into account this twofold dimension of WFP. On the one hand, they consider the existence of these policies and the workers' knowledge of their existence. And on the other, they consider to what extent the WFP are accessible without subsequent reprisals or any other type of negative repercussions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of family responsibilities and gender</head><p>By definition, the workers who are most likely to suffer from WFC are those with some type of family responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Premeaux et al., 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kossek et al. (2001)</ref> empirically demonstrate the impact of the family responsibilities of looking after children or elderly relatives on WFC, and on well-being and job performance. Caregivers who worked in supportive organizations (e.g. adopting WFP) had higher odds of good work outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Plaisier et al., 2014)</ref>. Nevertheless, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">de Janasz, Forret, Haack, &amp; Jonsen (2013)</ref>, by providing a more 'family-friendly' work environment, organizations may foster perceptions of inequity in people without family responsibilities, possibly resulting in lower job satisfaction and other work-related outcomes.</p><p>The theory recognizes gender differences in the assumption of family responsibilities and consequently in the probability of experiencing WFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Harris, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Harrington, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kirkwood &amp; Tootell, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Baral &amp; Bhargava, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Cloninger, Selvarajan, Singh, &amp; Huang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Foster &amp; Ren, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Harris (2004)</ref> argues that as a result of WFC women are likely to suffer more stress and to show lower job satisfaction than men.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gutek et al. (1991)</ref>, gender role theory establishes that family and work roles have traditionally been gender specific, where men are work oriented and women family oriented. Thus, a number of studies support the idea that the negative relation between WFC and job satisfaction is stronger among women than among men <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Bruck et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Kossek &amp; Ozeki, 1998)</ref>. Some researchers in contrast fail to find empirical evidence for the existence of significant differences in the impact of gender on the existence of WFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akintayo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Hughes &amp; Bozionelos, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Thus it seems advisable to analyze the possible moderating effects of gender and family responsibilities on the relations between WFP and the worker's behavior (performance, absenteeism or quitting) and psychological state (stress, satisfaction, motivation or commitment). In this respect, our hypotheses take into account the possible moderating role of family responsibilities and gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WFP and performance</head><p>The literature points out that WFC leads to a lower organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Sánchez-Vidal et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Matta et al. (2014)</ref> argue that significant work events, such as WFC, in which the worker perceives that the situation is unfair or threatens their economic or social well-being, generate stress and negative emotions and affective states. According to these authors, these are predictors of counter-productive behaviors such as reduction of effort, deliberately doing tasks incorrectly, verbal and physical abuse, and theft <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Penney &amp; Spector, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Spector et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The negative emotions generated by a WFC and their negative impact on employee performance may be drawn from <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lazarus and Folkman's (1984)</ref> theory on appraisals and coping. Cognitive appraisal is the process where an individual evaluates whether a WFC is relevant to his or her wellbeing and, if so, there is an evaluation of the coping options, in other words, of what can be done about this WFC. There are two well-known types of coping: emotion-focused and problem-focused <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. Thus WFC leads to emotional responses such as reduced job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Glaveli, Karassavidou, &amp; Zafiropoulos, 2013)</ref>, increased psychological strain or distress, and increased intent to quit, among other negative consequences, potentially leading to increased emotional exhaustion <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Rodwell et al., 2014)</ref>. Besides, WFC could also lead to problem-focused responses (options for coping with the situation) such as reducing effort or deliberately doing tasks incorrectly.</p><p>In turn, WFP are considered to make a positive contribution to organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Barnett, 1998)</ref>. WFP improve job satisfaction and organizational commitment, factors that are closely related to employee productivity and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Greenhaus and Powell 2006)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Ko et al. (2013)</ref> the employees who are more satisfied with WFP will have a higher level of job satisfaction and performance.</p><p>Hence, when firms alleviate the tension between work and family, worker productivity increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Estes et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Swody &amp; Powell, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The first hypotheses of this work follow: H1: The greater the worker's perception that WFP exist in their firm, the greater their job performance.</p><p>H1a: The relation between the perception of the existence of WFP and job performance is stronger in women than in men.</p><p>H1b: The relation between the perception of the existence of WFP and job performance is stronger in workers with family responsibilities than in workers without family responsibilities. H2: The greater the worker's perception that the WFP are accessible, the greater their job performance.</p><p>H2a: The relation between the perception of the accessibility of the WFP and job performance is stronger in women than in men.</p><p>H2b: The relation between the perception of the accessibility of the WFP and job performance is stronger in workers with family responsibilities than in workers without family responsibilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Wright (2014)</ref> points out that researchers have been interested in the role of employee well-being, but also indicates that the literature has not yet reached a consensus about its definition, components or how to measure it (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Knight &amp; Haslam, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Loretto, Platt, &amp; Popham, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Wegge, van Dick, Fisher, West, &amp; Dawson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">van Dick, Ullrich, &amp; Tissington, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Nicholson &amp; Imaizumi, 1993)</ref>. Adopting <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Cropanzano and Wright's (2014)</ref> classification, the contributions to the literature on this question can be grouped into four categories: (1) objective living conditions (wealth, health, status, education, etc.); (2) eudaimonic well-being (related to having a purpose in life); (3) satisfaction with life; and (4) emotion-based well-being. The literature on WFC often analyzes the impact of this conflict on a number of psychological variables that can be included in the concept of employee well-being. The most common variables examined include job satisfaction, which is assigned to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Cropanzano and Wright's (2014)</ref> third category, and stress, motivation and commitment, which can be placed in the fourth category, known as emotion-based well-being. The values of these psychological variables can be influenced by <ref type="bibr">WFC and WFP (Medina-Garrido et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Biedma-Ferrer &amp; Medina-Garrido, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Beauregard, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Redman, Snape, &amp; Ashurst, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WFP and well-being</head><p>And considering these variables as components of employee well-being, the literature establishes a negative correlation between WFC and employee well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Lapierre &amp; Allen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Fiksenbaum, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to job stress, many studies argue that WFC causes stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Baxter &amp; Chesters, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Zhang &amp; Liu, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Anderson et al., 2002)</ref> and hence negatively affects the individual's well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Martha, 2010)</ref>. The literature also finds a negative relation between WFP and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Litchfield et al., 2004)</ref>, and a positive relation between lack of WFP and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Idrovo, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, research on WFC does not pay sufficient attention to motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Zhang &amp; Liu, 2011)</ref>. But some evidence does exist for a positive relation between <ref type="bibr">WFP and motivation (López-Ibor et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Meil et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Job satisfaction-understood as the feelings individuals have about their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Locke, 1976)</ref>-can be considered an important indicator of employee well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(De Jonge et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Page &amp; Vella-Brodrick, 2009)</ref>.

Thus when firms alleviate the tension between work and family, worker turnover drops and worker retention increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Glass &amp; Estes, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Drago et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bocaz, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Foley et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Estes et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Swody &amp; Powell, 2007)</ref>. Likewise, empirical evidence exists that a lack of WFP generates low commitment and high absenteeism <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Idrovo, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>All this leads us to propose the following hypotheses:</head><p>H3: The greater the worker's perception that WFP exist in their firm, the greater their employee well-being.</p><p>H3a: The relation between the perception of the existence of WFP and employee well-being is stronger in women than in men.</p><p>H3b: The relation between the perception of the existence of WFP and employee well-being is stronger in workers with family responsibilities than in workers without family responsibilities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Well-being and performance</head><p>The literature offers evidence for a positive relation between employee well-being and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Lyubomirsky et al., 2005)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Wright (2014)</ref>, one part of the literature defines well-being as satisfaction with life and finds a positive relation between well-being and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Rode et al., 2005)</ref>. More studies, however, examine well-being's impact on job performance using emotion-based well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Wright &amp; Cropanzano, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Wright et al., 2007)</ref>. This emotion-based well-being exists when the worker does not suffer stress or emotional exhaustion and enjoys a positive affectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Wright, 2014)</ref>. Positive affectivity means that the worker feels enthusiastic, active and alert, and predicts a readiness to solve conflicts, an optimistic mood, and a greater creativity and affiliative motivation.</p><p>Regarding the well-being and job performance relationship, where no significant differences between the groups are expected, the final hypothesis of this work is as follows:</p><p>H5: The greater the worker's employee well-being, the greater their job performance.</p><p>H5a: The relation between employee well-being and job performance is similar in men and women.</p><p>H5b: The relation between employee well-being and job performance is similar in workers with family responsibilities and workers without family responsibilities.</p><p>Given the hypotheses proposed in this work, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>   Thus data were collected at thirteen Spanish organizations. We contacted the organizations for their participation, explaining our research purpose and offering a company-specific final report as an incentive to participate. All the information given to the companies was at the aggregate level and no respondent could be identified. To obtain the data we designed a questionnaire with closed questions. We carried out a pretest to improve its effectiveness and design, remove ambiguities and improve the measures. Employees were contacted by e-mail directly by the organizations. The type of survey carried out belongs to the category Internet-based self-administered survey.</p><p>The survey was open from July to November 2014. A total of 1,565 questionnaires were thus collected, 54 of them were omitted due to missing or incomplete data. In the 1,511 effective responses, 42.4% of the respondents were female (641 women and 870 men); 75.9% of the participants had family responsibilities (1,147 respondents had family responsibilities and 364 did not); and the mean age was <ref type="bibr">43.7 (s.d. 8.9)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>To measure the unobservable variables of the proposed model, existence and accessibility of WFP, well-being, and job performance, we have adapted validated scales from the literature <ref type="bibr">(Families and</ref><ref type="bibr">Work Institute, 2012a, 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Anderson et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Boshoff &amp; Mels, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Warr, 1990)</ref>.

To measure job performance we used a single indicator on the same scale.</p><p>For all the latent variables we opted for a reflective measurement model because the indicators are manifestations of the unobserved, theoretical construct that they represent, they share a common theme, and they are exchangeable and highly correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Mackenzie et al., 2005)</ref>. Employee well-being was measured with four items using scales validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Anderson et al., (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Boshoff &amp; Mels (2000)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Warr (1990</ref>) (e.g. "I often feel nervous and stressed", reverse-scored; or "The major satisfaction in my life comes from my work") (α=0.963).</p><p>Perceived job performance was measured with a single item developed and validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Boshoff &amp; Mels (2000)</ref>. The item was as follows: "My organization inspires the very best in me in the way of job performance" (α: n.a.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>To test our hypotheses we conducted a structural equation modeling. These models use both latent (unobservable) variables, which represent theoretical concepts, and data coming from measures (indicators or manifest variables), which are used as input for a statistical analysis to provide evidence about the relations between the latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Williams et al., 2009)</ref>. Following the generally accepted procedure for selecting the right model to estimate structural equation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Hair et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Ringle et al., 2012)</ref>, we opted for the PLS-SEM approach. To carry out the analysis we used the SmartPLS 3.0 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Ringle et al., 2014)</ref>, which uses the algorithm developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Wold (1982)</ref> to estimate the parameters. This algorithm is essentially a sequence of regressions in terms of weighted vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Although  whether the measurement is done in a stable and consistent way.</p><p>In the reliability analysis we first evaluate the individual reliability of each item, examining the factor loadings (lambda) or simple correlations between the indicators and their respective latent variables. An indicator is accepted in the measurement model of a construct if it has a factor loading greater than or equal to 0.707. This means that the variance shared between the construct and its indicators is greater than the variance of the error <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Carmines &amp; Zeller, 1979)</ref>. Some researchers argue that this empirical threshold (λ&gt;=0.707) should not be so strict in the initial stages of scale development <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>, and that indicators with loadings between 0.4 and 0.7 should only be eliminated from a scale if this leads to an increase in the average variance extracted (AVE) or composite reliability (CR) to over the suggested threshold value (AVE=0.5; CR=0.7). Thus weak indicators could be retained depending on their contribution to the content validity. Very weak indicators (λ≤0.4) should, however, always be eliminated.</p><p>In this research we retain all the indicators of the measurement model despite the fact that five of them do not meet the minimum required threshold (λ&gt;=0.707). This decision is justified because the AVE of all the latent variables exceeds 0.5. This means that eliminating these indicators in an attempt to achieve the minimum AVE threshold would be pointless. Thus the indicators are retained because of their contribution to the content validity.</p><p>Second, we analyze the scale reliability. This process allows the researcher to ensure the internal consistency of all the indicators when measuring the concept, in other words, we evaluate how rigorously the indicators are measuring the same latent variable. To evaluate this aspect we use the Cronbach alpha coefficient and the composite reliability (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Nunnally (1978)</ref> suggests using 0.7 for a modest reliability and a stricter 0.8 for basic research. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows, all the constructs comfortably exceed these Cronbach alpha and CR values. In turn, the validity analysis involves evaluating the convergent and discriminant validities. The first implies that a set of indicators represents a single, underlying construct, and this can be demonstrated by its unidimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. This is evaluated by the AVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>, which measures the share of the variance that a construct obtains from its indicators compared to that due to the measurement error. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref> recommend that the AVE exceeds 0.5, which would mean that more than 50% of the construct's variance is due to its indicators rather than the indicators in the rest of the constructs. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows, all the constructs have AVE values exceeding 0.5. Thus more than 50% of the variance of each construct is due to its indicators.</p><p>For the single-item construct PERF, the Cronbach Alpha, CR, and AVE are not appropriate measures since the indicator's outer loading is fixed at 1.00.</p><p>The discriminant validity evaluates the extent to which a given construct is different from other constructs. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fornell and Larcker's (1981)</ref> criterion based on the idea that a construct should share more variance with its indicators than with the other constructs in a particular model. Thus a good way of measuring a construct's discriminant validity is by showing that its AVE is greater than the variance the construct shares with the other model constructs. Or in other words, we must show that all the correlations between the constructs are lower than the square root of the AVE.</p><p>As can be seen from the figures in bold in the table, for all the latent variables of the model the square root of the AVE is greater than all the correlations between the variables, which means that all the constructs are more strongly related to their own indicators than to those in the other constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of structural model</head><p>Having confirmed the goodness of fit of the measurement model, we analyze the structural model by evaluating the strength and significance of the relations between the different variables. In particular, this analysis involves evaluating the variance explained of the endogenous variables, measured by their R 2 , their path coefficients or standardized regression weights (Beta), and their significance levels.</p><p>A measure of the predictive power of a model is the R 2 value of the dependent latent variables, which indicates the share of the construct's variance explained by the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Chin (1998)</ref> recommends the following thresholds: from 0.67, "substantial"; from 0.33, "moderate"; and from 0.19, "weak". The R 2 value obtained in this model is weak for the variable Employee well-being (R 2 =0.046), but moderate, close to substantial, for Job performance (R 2 =0.542).</p><p>Second, the evaluation of the significance of the path coefficients is carried out using the bootstrapping resampling technique. The subsamples are created following the recommendations of the literature with 5,000 observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>, extracted at random and with replacement of the original set of data. This is a sufficiently large number to ensure that the results are stable. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the results of the p-values.</p><p>Apart from the above, and again following the recommendations of the literature we carry out an additional evaluation with a non-parametric test to calculate the confidence intervals. In addition, to evaluate the possible indirect and total effects between the latent variables we repeat the previous procedure for these relations (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The results of the analysis do not provide support for Hypothesis 1 (ß=0.002; p-value=0.940) or Hypothesis 2 (ß=-0.016; p-value=-0.504), as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows. This implies that the mere existence and accessibility of the WFP do not generate an improvement in performance. Nevertheless, these two variables do have an indirect effect on performance via employee <ref type="bibr">well-being (ß=0.054; p-value=0.031; and ß=0.117; p-value=0.000, respectively)</ref>, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows. Moreover, adding the direct and indirect effects we find that accessibility does have a total effect on performance (ß=0.101; p-value=0.001), existence does not (ß=0.056; p-value=0.099).</p><p>As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows, the results do provide support for Hypothesis 3 (ß=0.073; p-value=0.030) and Hypothesis 4 (ß=0.158; p-value=0.000). This implies that existence and accessibility have very weak but statistically significant effects on employee wellbeing.</p><p>Finally, the results also provide support for Hypothesis 5 (ß=0.742; p-value=0.000): employee well-being generates improvements in performance. In fact, of the three variables expected to have a direct effect on performance in our proposed model this is the only one for which we have found empirical evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of moderating role of gender and family responsibilities</head><p>As mentioned in the theoretical framework section and given the nature of the phenomenon of interest, we suspected that there would be heterogeneity in the data due to gender and the existence of family responsibilities.</p><p>To analyze the possible moderating role of gender and family responsibilities we carry out two multigroup analyses. Multigroup analysis (MGA) is a method to test for significant differences between subsamples. To analyze whether significant differences exist in the factor loadings and path coefficients between the two groups we use <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Henseler's (2007)</ref> test. This is a non-parametric significance test that compares the differences in the specific results of each group on the basis of the PLS-SEM bootstrapping results. A difference is significant at the 5% probability of error if the pvalue is less than 0.05 or greater than 0.95 for a particular difference in values between the groups.</p><p>Before carrying out the test for significant differences in the parameters we evaluate the metric invariance of the measurement model in each subsample in order to validate the goodness of fit of the measurement model for each subsample.</p><p>The first MGA is carried out with 641 women and 870 men and the second with 1,147 respondents with family responsibilities and 364 respondents without family responsibilities. We do not report these results for space reasons, but all the indicators analyzed-except for one in the comparison between men and women-show that no significant differences exist in the measurement model, so we can accept the hypothesis of metric invariance.</p><p>We then run Henseler's test to evaluate differences in the path coefficients of the structural model in both subsamples (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>). A resampling of 5,000 cases is carried out and the results form the basis for the test for significant differences between the groups. The results of each resampling for the second group are compared to the results for the first group. The number of positive, significant differences divided by the total number of comparisons indicates the probability that the parameter from the second group is higher than the parameter from the first group <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Afonso et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> show, all the p-values are greater than 0.05, which means that no statistically significant differences exist in the relations analyzed between men and women or between respondents with or without family responsibilities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These findings have some theoretical implications. The contribution of this work to literature is twofold. On the one hand, it deals with the unpublished role of the variable WB as a mediator of the relationship between WFP and job performance. On the other hand, we have considered two different dimensions of WFP to measure their impact on job performance. The first dimension is the knowledge that WFP exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Yeandle et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Haar &amp; Spell, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Mumford, 2005)</ref>. The second dimension is the perception that these WFP are accessible without negative consequences for workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gray &amp; Tudball, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Bond, 2004)</ref>. Although some studies differentiate these two dimensions of WFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gray &amp; Tudball, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">, Yeandle et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Haar &amp; Spell, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Bond, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Mumford, 2005)</ref>, none of them empirically analyzes this difference and their impact on job performance.</p><p>In this research we have shown that employee well-being has a mediating effect in the relation between work-family policies (WFP) and job performance. This is true for the two dimensions of WFP considered here: existence and accessibility. Our concept of well-being is basically founded on the emotion-based well-being approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Wright, 2014)</ref>. A large number of studies have shown that WFP help to reduce stress, negative emotions and affective states (dissatisfaction, lack of motivation, or lack of commitment) and unfair situations related to work-family conflict (WFC). Thus WFP contribute to improving employee well-being and consequently job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Beauregard &amp; Henry, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Yasbek, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Matta et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Penney &amp; Spector, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Spector et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>These results are coherent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Allen, French, Dumani, and Shockley's (2015)</ref> meta-analysis. These authors state that the role of the organization is stronger in avoiding work interference with the family (WIF) than in avoiding family interference with the work (FIW), with the latter being influenced more by the environment. WFP implemented by firms may positively impact on WIF conflicts, which explains why they increase the workers' well-being. However, the increase in FIW conflicts depends more on environmental factors like the existence of a collectivistic (versus individualistic) culture or an economic gender gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Allen et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, firms' efforts to reduce conflicts with WFP may not impact directly on performance, as firms do not have much control over FIW, but may do so indirectly mediated by workers' well-being.</p><p>On the other hand, we have failed to find empirical evidence here that gender and family responsibilities have a moderating role on the relations in our model, contrary to what we initially expected. These results contrast with the results of previous studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kossek et al. (2001)</ref>, who find that family responsibilities affect well-being and performance, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Harris (2004)</ref>, who shows that women suffer more stress and are less satisfied with their work-both components of well-being-as a result of WFC. In fact, various studies find a negative relation between WFC and satisfaction among women <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Bruck et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Kossek &amp; Ozeki, 1998)</ref>. However, our results are coherent with other studies failing to find significant differences in the impact of gender on conflict and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akintayo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Hughes &amp; Bozionelos, 2007)</ref>. In our particular study, this could be due to the organizational culture of the sector we study -the financial sector-or to the cultural characteristics of the country concerned -Spain.</p><p>Most of the studies on WFC and WFP have been carried out in Anglo-Saxon countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Idrovo et al., 2012)</ref>. But the culture and specific values of each country have an important impact on WFP existence and accessibility and on their impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Karatepe &amp; Uludag, 2008)</ref>. WFP may differ among countries due to historical, political, and attitudinal reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Notten, Grunow, &amp; Verbakel, 2017)</ref>. For instance, in Muslim cultures women's participation in the labor market is low <ref type="bibr">(Cohen, Granot &amp; Yishai, 2007)</ref>. Similarly, most Latin American countries have a low rate of female labor participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Jiménez &amp; Gómez, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Idrovo, 2006)</ref>. In these contexts, there is a poor culture of WFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Idrovo, 2006)</ref>. On the other hand, the USA lags behind in terms of WFP, despite its higher rate of female participation in the labor market <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hammer &amp; Zimmerman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Ray, Gornick &amp; Schmitt, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Heymann, Earle &amp; Hayes, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Various US studies point to the lack of support for working families and defend the adoption of WFP in the European style <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Williams, 2010)</ref>. Nevertheless, the development of WFP in Europe is heterogeneous (Adame-Sánchez &amp; Miquel-Romero, 2012).</p><p>WFP have been a priority objective of the social policies of some European countries for decades, even before they became a key element of European Union policies.</p><p>However, in other European countries, especially the Mediterranean ones, these policies have been imposed by European regulations. Thus, there is a lack of WFP tradition in Spain and there are cultural and institutional differences with respect to other European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Moreno, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Following previous research, countries can be classified as liberal welfare state, conservative, social-democratic or postcommunist welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Notten et al., 2017)</ref>. Spain can be included in the conservative group. The WFP in the conservative welfare regimes usually include very long family leave and provide a job guarantee for the parent on leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Notten et al., 2017)</ref>. In the case of Spain, parents can share all or part of many of these benefits (e.g. maternity and paternity leave), which may explain the lack of differences in our model due to gender. In addition, a number of WFP in Spain are also extended to workers without family, which may explain the lack of differences in our model due to family responsibilities. Our findings are consistent with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Glass, Simon, &amp; Andersson (2016)</ref>, for whom in countries like Spain WFP are associated with smaller disparities in well-being between parents and non-parents.</p><p>Moreover, the WFP that increase parental well-being do not reduce the well-being of nonparents.</p><p>Another factor that may also influence the lack of differences in our model due to gender and family responsibilities is the collectivistic nature of Spain. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Allen et al. (2015)</ref>, Asian and Latin American societies are considered collectivistic while Anglo Saxon societies are more individualistic. Individualists tend to focus on the self and on personal achievement. For historical reasons, Spain has important cultural similarities with the countries of Latin America. The collectivistic culture present in Spain reduces differences due to gender or family responsibilities. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Allen et al. (2015)</ref>, WFC is less of a concern in collectivistic countries than in individualistic countries. In the former, individuals seek help from family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Allen et al., 2015)</ref>, and employers support their employees more in exchange for their loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Powell et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for management</head><p>From the manager's perspective, the mediating role of well-being in the relation between WFP and job performance implies on the one hand that management can improve employee well-being by offering WFP, publicizing their existence and making sure that they are accessible without reprisals of any kind; and on the other, that this well-being can ultimately improve performance. In this respect, the results obtained in this study show that well-being explains an important part of performance. Thus, introducing policies that improve employee well-being could lead to important improvements in job performance and ultimately firm performance. But for this to happen human resource managers must ensure that the WFP exist, that the workers know about them, and that they are accessible.</p><p>Nevertheless, well-being is only partially explained by WFP. Managers should also bear in mind other variables that can also affect well-being. For example stress due to overwork could reduce well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Harris, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Martha, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Viitala, Tanskanen &amp; Säntti, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Le Fevre, Boxall &amp; Macky, 2015)</ref>, but WFP cannot reduce this stress because it has nothing to do with WFC. Similarly, remuneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Vosloo, Fouché &amp; Barnard, 2014)</ref> and working conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Guzi &amp; de Pedraza, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Robone, Jones &amp; Rice, 2011)</ref> among other factors have important effects on well-being .</p><p>Another important question to consider is that firms that apply WFP can achieve greater performance improvements in countries with a deficient legislation in this area because their workers can experience a greater relative well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This work has analyzed the effects of work-family policies on well-being and job performance. For this purpose, we have considered two dimensions of WFP: (1) whether these policies exist and are known about by the employees; and (2) whether they are in practice accessible to the workers without reprisals. We have also looked for evidence for a moderating role of gender and family responsibilities. The results of this analysis show that the mere existence and accessibility of WFP do not generate improvements in performance. On the other hand, these two variables do have an indirect effect on performance via employee well-being. Moreover, and again according to the results, neither gender nor family responsibilities has a moderating role on the above relations, contrary to what we initially expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>One of the limitations of this study is the difficulty in measuring well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Wright, 2014)</ref>. Although we can say that the indicators we use are components of well-being, they do not explain all the possible dimensions of this concept. Thus the concept of well-being used in this work is more a contribution to it than an explanation.</p><p>The limitations of the fieldwork include the difficulty in encouraging employees from the sector of interest to respond to our questionnaire. Finance workers are usually very busy, they have limited free time and their sector was in the midst of a crisis. In addition, the content of the questionnaire could have encouraged a disproportionate number of the most disgruntled workers to respond to the questionnaire and at the same time discouraged workers fearing possible reprisals from their firm. Moreover, the same respondents answered all the questionnaire items. Therefore, common method variance (CMV) might exist because the data used were from the same source. To examine CMV, Harman's one-factor test <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anderson &amp; Bateman, 1997</ref>) could be employed in future research.</p><p>Another limitation of the results of this study is that the sample comes from one specific sector-the finance sector-and one single country-Spain. The normative specificities (with regard to the legislation on WFP) and cultural idiosyncrasies of this sample mean that any generalization to other sectors and countries must be carried out with caution.</p><p>Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the study is another limitation. As this study is cross-sectional it represents a first approach that needs to be complemented by a longitudinal study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future lines of research</head><p>It would be interesting to replicate this analysis in other sectors and countries.</p><p>Regarding the international comparison, the collectivistic versus individualistic nature of different countries, as well as the existence or absence of gender egalitarianism, should be taken into account in any analysis of differences in the WFP-wellbeing and wellbeing-performance relationships due to gender or family responsibilities. Studying the influence on the model of economics variables such as GDP, unemployment rate or economic gender gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Allen et al., 2015)</ref> may also be valuable. Such a comparative analysis could have important implications for firm managers and for the establishment of national policies in favor of WFP.</p><p>As we have mentioned, WFP can explain well-being only partially. Researchers should consider other variables affecting well-being as control variables in the model.</p><p>These could include demographic, socio-economic, sectorial, geographic, legislative and cultural variables.</p><p>Finally, as mentioned in the Limitations section, this research should be accompanied by a longitudinal study, since the effects of WFP on employees' wellbeing and performance may evolve over time and so the relations considered in the model may change.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>illustrates our model of the impact of WFP on job performance.
