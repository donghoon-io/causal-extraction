<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objectives of this research are to qualitatively explore the attitudes towards online food delivery providers (ODP) during the COVID-19 lockdown in Ecuador, and to quantitatively analyse whether there are changes in e-satisfaction with ODPs and three determinants (e-service quality, delivery workers personal aspects, and food quality). Qualitative analysis results of 104 customer opinions showed positive attitudes towards ODPs and a new motivation for using this service: risk exposure reduction. However, concerns about the application of biosafety guidelines by restaurants and delivery workers were also evident. A structural equations model (n=483) revealed that personal aspects lost significance as a determinant for e-satisfaction during the lockdown, most likely due to personal contact reduction during delivery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The online food delivery sector has been growing at high rates worldwide in the last years. Its revenues have risen from <ref type="bibr">US$76,</ref><ref type="bibr">193</ref> million in 2017 to US$122,739 million in 2020 (17.2% average annual growth), with an expectation to reach US$164,002 million for 2025 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Statista, 2020)</ref>. Moreover, during the COVID-19 lockdown, more online delivery providers have emerged and more restaurants have turned to the delivery format <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dishman, 2020)</ref>. Even restaurants offering their products only through delivery have emerged; a practice that provides the opportunity to new entrants with low fixed costs. Therefore, nowadays this activity has gained relevance not only for established but also for new businesses.</p><p>Since March 17, 2020, the Ecuadorian government decreed mobility restrictions within the country, closed borders to all foreign travellers due to the spread of the coronavirus, and suspended face-to-face work in the government and private sectors; however, prioritized sectors (e.g., utilities, security, health) and delivery services were allowed to operate with specific guidelines (Comité de Operaciones de Emergencia Nacional -COE, 2020). By July 27, 2020, Ecuador was one of the most affected countries by COVID-19 in the world (#17), and the fourth most affected in South America with 313 deaths and 4,596 cases per million people (5,532 total deaths and 81,161 total cases reported) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Worldometer, 2020)</ref>. However, non-official estimations suggested that the number of deaths was significantly higher than the figures reported by the government <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(León &amp; Kurmanaev, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the lockdown, the entertainment, hospitality and restaurant sectors are the most affected in Ecuador. Most restaurant and cafe owners projected a fall in sales of 30% or more during 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Castillo &amp; Zhangallymbay, 2020)</ref>. During this crisis, delivery providers emerged as an alternative to mitigate the drop in sales. Thus, 46% of restaurants and cafes had a delivery service before the lockdown, but 92% expected to offer the service during the confinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Castillo &amp; Zhangallymbay, 2020)</ref>. A similar scenario was evident worldwide during the COVID-19 lockdown, as reported above.</p><p>Preserving customer satisfaction is crucial for service firms to influence trust and loyalty in crisis times (Monferrer-Tirado, Estrada-Guillén, Fandos-Roig, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moliner-Tena &amp; García, 2016)</ref>. In the digital world, it has been demonstrated that e-satisfaction is positively associated with consumer spending <ref type="bibr">(Nisara &amp; Prabhakar, 2017)</ref>. Thus, firms must be aware of what drives customer satisfaction within their specific industries, particularly when they are facing economic difficulties. Since COVID-19 crisis has brought several changes in doing business and customer perceptions, attitudes and behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deloitte, 2020)</ref>, it becomes pertinent to study eventual changes in attitudes, customer satisfaction and its antecedents. The literature on online services has evidenced that e-service quality and food quality impact e-satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Suhartanto, Helmi, Tan, Sjahroeddin &amp; Kusdibyo, 2019)</ref>. We suggest that the customer interaction with the delivery worker is another source of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with online food delivery providers (ODP), according to a vast literature in the service industry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alhelalat, Habiballah &amp; Twaissi, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jang &amp; Namkung, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Macias, Rodriguez &amp; Barriga, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wall &amp; Berry, 2007)</ref>. The most obvious way of estimating changes in the proposed variables is comparing its levels and relationships before versus during the COVID-19 lockdown. According to the literature review carried out here, to date there is no academic publication addressing the study of determinants of satisfaction with ODPs during the lockdown in Ecuador. A couple of studies are limited to reporting the emergence of a greater number of businesses of this type during the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Játiva &amp; Cabezas, 2020)</ref> and the fact that biosafety measures are being taken for food delivery (Bernal-Álava, Solórzano-Solórzano, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burgos-Salazar &amp; Cantos-Figueroa, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Given the growing importance of the food delivery sector within service industries worldwide, this study has two purposes: (i) to qualitatively explore the main attitudes towards online food delivery providers in Ecuador in times of <ref type="bibr">and (ii)</ref> to quantitatively investigate whether there is a change in customer satisfaction with this service and three antecedents: e-service quality, personal aspects of the delivery workers, and perceived food quality.</p><p>The following section presents the theoretical foundations of the proposed model, the third and fourth sections describe the methodology and results of the qualitative and quantitative phases of this research, respectively. Finally, discussion and conclusions are provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical background and conceptual model</head><p>Service literature has turned its attention into the e-world, mainly in the last two decades. The works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Malhotra (2002)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Malhotra (2005)</ref> define e-service quality and a summary of its main dimensions. E-service quality is understood as "the extent to which a website facilitates efficient and effective shopping, purchasing, and delivery of products and services" <ref type="bibr">(Zeithaml et al., 2002, p. 363</ref>). This construct comprises (i) efficiency, as the ease and speed of accessing and using the website; (ii) fulfilment, as the extent to which the delivery promises and item availability of the site are accomplished; (iii) system availability, referring to the correct technical functioning of the website; and (iv) privacy, as the degree to which the site is safe and protects customer information <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, studies about online food delivery providers are recent and scarce in marketing literature. Researchers have focused on the attitudes towards it <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cho, Bonn &amp; Li, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Yeo, Goh &amp; Rezaei, 2017)</ref>, intention to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alagoz &amp; Hekimoglu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Okumus, Ali, Bilgihan &amp; Ozturk, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>, adoption of ODPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Okumus &amp; Bilgihan, 2014)</ref>, and final conversion (i.e., placing an online order) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kapoor &amp; Vij, 2018)</ref>. All these studies analyse the pre-consumption stage. Instead, this work investigates customers who have already adopted the use of ODPs, have placed orders and have eaten the food, and analyses their satisfaction with the ODP. In this regard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wang, Tseng, Wang, Shih and Chan (2019)</ref> studied satisfaction only with restaurant-owned apps, and the authors included mainly information systems (IS) variables as determinants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alalwan (2020)</ref> included detailed functional aspects as precursors of ODP satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Suhartanto et al. (2019)</ref> proposed e-service quality and food quality as determinants of e-satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Macias et al. (2020)</ref> added personal aspects of delivery workers in the ODP context and explored spillover effects over restaurant brands. The present work differs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Macias et al. (2020)</ref> since this study analyses changes in the evaluation of e-satisfaction and its determinants, and changes in the structural relationship due to the COVID-19 lockdown, using a larger sample to capture the effect of the health emergency period. In addition, we provide a qualitative analysis of customer perceptions about the service of ODPs in times of COVID-19, which could bring new insights for further research on this topic.</p><p>Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Oliver's (1999)</ref> definition of satisfaction, we define ODP satisfaction as a subjective assessment of experience with an ODP regarding the degree of fulfilment of prior expectations. The customer service encounter in the ODP context includes interaction with the platform/ app (launching, searching, ordering, payment, waiting/ tracking), interaction with the delivery worker, and food consumption. Concerning the platform, the variable that best describes its performance is e-service quality. The platform's adequate functioning in its several dimensions (efficiency, fulfilment, system availability, and privacy) should contribute to e-satisfaction; prior works in lodging websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Jeon &amp; Jeong, 2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">ODPs (Macías et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref> showed this relationship. Therefore, we proposed the following hypothesis:</p><p>• H1: e-service quality is positively associated with ODP satisfaction.</p><p>Furthermore, delivery workers may interact with the customer through text messaging or phone calls for delivery details, and during the personal delivery of products. Several studies have explained that the employees' appearance and behaviour influenced brand image formation in the' minds of customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pounders, Babin &amp; Close, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Warhurst &amp; Nickson, 2007a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, 2007b)</ref>. In many industries, managers establish clothing, speech, and behaviour parameters to reflect brand image and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Witz, Warhurst &amp; Nickson, 2003)</ref>. We define personal aspects of delivery workers (hereafter, personal aspects) as the combination of physical appearance, clothing, and manners when interacting with ODP customers. There is evidence that personal aspects influence how customers evaluate the service <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kim, 2014)</ref>, restaurant experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wall &amp; Berry, 2007)</ref>, and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alhelalat et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Macías et al., 2020)</ref>. Hence, the second hypothesis is:</p><p>• H2: personal aspects are positively related to ODP satisfaction.</p><p>After platform and delivery worker interaction, customers eat food as a part of their experience from a process perspective. The degree of perceived food quality in the variety of menu, presentation, size, healthiness, taste, freshness, and food temperature, contribute to customer experience in restaurants <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Han &amp; Hyun, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Liu &amp; Jang, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Namin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Namkung &amp; Jang, 2007)</ref>. Although the restaurant has prepared the food, the ODP controls the delivery time affecting its freshness; it has been shown that perceived food quality is positively associated to satisfaction with delivery service providers <ref type="bibr">(Macías et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Suhartanto et al., 2009)</ref>. Based on these arguments and evidence, the following hypothesis has been drawn:</p><p>• H3: perceived food quality is positively associated with ODP satisfaction.</p><p>Finally, although restaurants prepare food orders, Spillover Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sirgy, Efraty, Siegel &amp; Lee, 2001)</ref> posits that some parts of a process influence the perception of another part of this process. Evidence of the referred theory is provided in several fields, for example, in the case of brand alliances, negative behaviour of one brand is likely to spill over to the other brand if consumers believe that the latter knew and overlooked the misbehaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Votolato &amp; Unnava, 2006)</ref>. Within coalition loyalty programs, one program partner service failure harms customer loyalty towards the whole program <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Schumann, Wünderlich &amp; Evanschitzky, 2014)</ref>. In the ODP context, e-service quality influences the way customers perceive food quality <ref type="bibr">(Macías et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref>; it can also be said that the good or bad experience with the previous food consumption phase (i.e., delivery worker interaction) could influence the way customers assess food quality. Therefore, we proposed:</p><p>• H4: e-service quality is positively related to perceived food quality. • H5: personal aspects are positively related to perceived food quality.</p><p>The relationships proposed above are depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Qualitative study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Methodology</head><p>An open-ended question was distributed to a sample of 104 users of ODPs in Ecuador. The objective was to know the opinion of users about the food delivery service during the lockdown: What is your opinion about having the food delivery service available during COVID-19 mobility restrictions in the country?</p><p>Qualitative data analysis involves making sense of the text. To analyse the responses text, researchers followed a three-stage coding process; open coding identified basic categories and axial coding related categories to subcategories, finally, key themes were identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results</head><p>After qualitatively analysing the text of 104 responses (164 codes), key themes were identified and summarized below (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>• Attitudes toward the service: Attitudes are overall evaluations of a brand, object, or in this case, the service provided by ODPs. Attitudes have some properties as valence (negative or positive), extremity (low to high), and emotionality (cognitive versus emotional) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rocklage &amp; Fazio, 2015)</ref>. There was a large number of favourable responses about having the ODP service during the lockdown. Some of them qualified this possibility from "okay" to "excellent" or "useful" to "indispensable", where "excellent" and "indispensable" denoted high extremity. Adjectives like "good", "very good", "positive", "wonderful" or "excellent" are mainly emotional; while "useful", "helpful", "necessary", or "indispensable" are more cognitive, i.e., beliefs about the service and its properties. Most of the responses included emotional adjectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"Excellent option." "It is the best we have." "It is a good option." "Well, it is necessary."</head><p>There were few negative responses expressing it was a "risky", "unsafe", or "expensive" service:</p><p>"I find it dangerous, high risk, and at the moment I am not consuming anything prepared."</p><p>• Reasons for positive attitudes: The respondents indicated why they expressed a favourable opinion about the ODP service during the lockdown. The most cited cause was convenience, which includes timesaving and staying at home. In some cases, staying at home was imperative when the consumer had mobility problems or belonged to the most vulnerable population. The second cause was the reduction of risk exposure: less probability of overcrowding and contagion. Finally, a smaller group of respondents considered the situation of businesses and workers since the delivery option allows preserving the financial stability of restaurants, ODPs, and delivery workers.</p><p>"An excellent option. It maintains sales in the restaurants found in the app and keeps its delivery workers employed."</p><p>• Concerns and demands: Another relevant theme that emerged from customer responses was the concern about restaurants and delivery workers biosafety guidelines when preparing and delivering the food, respectively. "It seems very opportune to me, as long as the appropriate sanitary and safety measures are taken." "Food service is considered a necessary service, so it is very positive that people can buy prepared food from the comfort of their home. It is clear that delivery workers must comply with established guidelines to avoid contagion or food mishandling."</p><p>Several customers also demanded that more restaurants, apps, and workers incorporate into the collaborative system to increase food options, improve geographic coverage, and reduce waiting times.</p><p>"It is a wise decision, and more restaurants should be added to have more available options."</p><p>Predominantly, this analysis reveals positive attitudes towards the service, the leading reported causes are convenience and risk reduction. According to existing literature, convenience is a widely accepted motivation for using ODPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Euromonitor, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Furunes &amp; Mkono, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, risk reduction emerges as a new motivation in this study. In addition, there are concerns about adopting biosafety guidelines by restaurants and delivery workers. Several publications (Deloitte, 2020; Diebner, Silliman, Ungerman &amp; Vancauwenberghe, 2020; Dore, Ehrlich, Malfara &amp; Ungerman, 2020) report that new delivery methods are being offered to minimize physical contact between customers and delivery workers in response to consumer concerns. For example, Domino's Pizza customers can indicate where they would prefer their order to be left (a safe and clean surface) by the delivery worker. Also, customers can select pre-payment and pre-tipping options <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fantozzi, 2020)</ref>. Meituan Dianping launched a contactless delivery initiative across China using autonomous vehicles to send grocery orders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hu, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>These findings suggest the necessity of studying whether there are changes in the relationship between customer satisfaction with ODPs and its determinants, according to the proposed conceptual model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Quantitative study</head><p>A quantitative study was designed to investigate whether there is a change in customer satisfaction with the ODP service and three antecedents: e-service quality, personal aspects of the delivery workers, and perceived food quality (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Measures and methods</head><p>Items for the study constructs were adapted from previous studies and measured in 5-points Likert scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). ODP satisfaction (e-SAT) was measured with three items from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Möhlmann (2015)</ref>. E-service quality (e-SQ) was measured with a summarized scale that resembles the conceptualization made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Parasuraman and Zeithaml (2005)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Harris &amp; Goode, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ryu, Lee &amp; Kim, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref>. Perceived food quality (PFQ) was measured with six items <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ryu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Namkung &amp; Jang, 2007)</ref>, and personal aspects (PASP) was adapted from the scale proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alhelalat et al. (2017)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the items for all the primary constructs; all items were translated from English into Spanish, slightly adjusted after a pilot study (n=18), and back-translated. There was a high level of coincidence between the original and back-translated versions of the items.</p><p>Unrestricted self-administered survey on the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fricker, 2008)</ref> is a convenience sample technique, which can be justified by the lack of access to ODPs customer databases and the context for studying ODP customers. An online questionnaire was distributed on social media (Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp) in two periods; the first one during February 2020 (before COVID-19 lockdown), and the second one from April 1 to May 4, 2020 (during the lockdown). A categorical variable was created to register the two periods (PERIOD=1 during lockdown). Food apps use frequency (FREQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Newman, Wachter &amp; White, 2018)</ref> and demographic variables were also measured: age (AGE), gender (GEN), income (INCO), and education (EDU).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Analysis</head><p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to test several validity criteria for measuring the study constructs: construct reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to determine differences in three proposed determinants and e-satisfaction evaluation. The analysis included summed dependent variables, a categorical variable describing the evaluation period as the main factor (before or during the lockdown) and control variables: age, income, education, and ODP use frequency.</p><p>The structural model in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> was tested with the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique in SmartPLS <ref type="bibr">(Ringle, Wende &amp; Becker, 2015)</ref>. PLS is a suitable technique for structural equation models (SEM) when the researcher explores a new theory, rather than confirming established theoretical models. Moreover, PLS is used when complex models with many indicators and relationships are tested, with non-normal data or small sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair, Hult, Ringle &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref>. A multi-group analysis (MGA) was performed to check if these relationships changed during the lockdown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>A total sample of 483 respondents was obtained (N Before =332; N During =151), and descriptive data for each group is shown in table 2. There are significant differences regarding age, income, and education. There is no significant difference in ODPs use frequency between the two subsamples. Demographic variables were used as control variables in further analyses, given its differences in the subsamples. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Confirmatory factor analysis</head><p>Construct reliability was assessed with Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability (CR). Both criteria showed values above the recommended threshold of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994)</ref>, the average variance (AVE) for all constructs reached values above 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>, but some items were removed from e-service quality without affecting the content validity. The Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio (HTMT) was calculated for discriminant validity, which is considered a more efficient criterion than Fornell and Larcker's <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Henseler, Ringle &amp; Sarstedt, 2015)</ref>. Values for HTMT were all below 0.85 as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hair et al. (2017)</ref>. Factor loadings were greater than the minimum suggested level of 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. Taken together, these results indicate that the measurement model was satisfactory (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Structural model</head><p>The complete sample analysis showed significant and positive relations between e-satisfaction and the three determinants concerning the structural model and supporting H1, H2, and H3. The relationship between e-SQ and PFQ as well as PASP and PFQ was positive and significant, supporting H4 and H5 (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). All control variables, except frequency, were non-significant. Structural models estimated with PLS should be evaluated based on their predictive power measured by the coefficient of determination (R2). Hence, R2 for PFQ and e-SAT were 0.314 and 0.499, considered moderate values <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, size effects (f2) were estimated for all endogenous variables in the model.</p><p>The results show that e-service quality is the main factor when evaluating customer satisfaction with ODPs, with a medium effect (0.15 ≤ f2 &lt; 0.35). Furthermore, PASP and PFQ showed small (f2 ≥ 0.02) size effects (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>).</p><p>Finally, the MGA showed no significant changes in any of the path coefficients when comparing the two temporal samples, although the impact of PASP lost significance during the lockdown. The path coefficient for PASP to e-SAT is not significant for the 'during' subsample, and at the same time is not significantly different from the 'before' path coefficient (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). Further analysis of total indirect effects showed a significant effect of PASP over e-SAT (mediated by PFQ) in both subsamples. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>We tested three determinants of satisfaction with online food delivery providers: e-service quality, personal aspects of delivery workers, and food quality, before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in Ecuador in order to observe whether the impact of the determinants had changed. An individual analysis of means of determinants showed that only personal aspects experienced a significant increase. A plausible explanation for such increase could be deeper customer empathy towards workers during this crisis; according to existing research, delivery workers are mostly young people with no stable jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Goods, Veen &amp; Barratt, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prakash, Behera, Sharma, Relan, Harshula &amp; Kaul, n.d.)</ref>. Recently, various press reports revealed that customers valued that delivery workers expose themselves to contagion to earn a living during the lockdown, as a demonstration of gratitude, many ODP customers ordered food and gave it to delivery workers (Expansion, 2020). Thus, we infer that concerns about personal appearance and verbal interaction during the lockdown stage took a secondary role, and favourable evaluations prevailed.</p><p>Nevertheless, this positive evaluation of delivery workers might not mean a greater satisfaction with ODPs. Despite our findings with the total sample revealed that the three determinants positively influenced e-satisfaction, when the subsamples were analysed separately there was a statistical significance loss for the direct relationship between personal aspects and e-satisfaction during the lockdown. However, the indirect effect of personal aspects over e-satisfaction (mediated by perceived food quality) prevailed in both periods. Consumer concerns about biosafety guidelines compliance by restaurants and delivery workers have minimized personal interaction during delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deloitte, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Diebner et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dore et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, a higher caution of consumers plus delivery practices with minimal personal contact designed by firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fantozzi, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hu, 2020)</ref>. The loss of significance of delivery workers' personal aspects, as a determinant of e-satisfaction can be attributed to this minimized personal interaction in times of the pandemic. Future research should analyse eventual changes in the structural relationship tested in the present, once the economic activity returns to normal or to "new normal" conditions in which some mobility restrictions and social distance guidelines would still apply.</p><p>The e-service quality is still the main factor to ensure customer satisfaction with ODPs, this result coincides with previous research <ref type="bibr">(Macías et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, the coefficient for e-service quality was higher (0.430 vs. 0.356) during COVID-19 lockdown than before. However, food quality and personal aspects are also factors that should not be neglected -due to observed direct and indirect effects, respectively -and must evolve under current circumstances. The qualitative analysis revealed that risk exposure reduction is a strong reason for customers to hold a positive attitude towards ODPs. This finding represents a contribution to the academic literature and has managerial implications. Hence, firms involved in this collaboration (restaurants and ODPs) should follow strict biosafety guidelines in preparation, packaging, and delivery stages to trigger customers favourable perceptions. In addition, companies must communicate their efforts and practices to meet safety requirements to raise consumer awareness. Regarding methodological implications for service evaluation in this context, future measurement scales could incorporate customer safety perception about food preparation and manipulation of food packages by delivery workers.</p><p>Furthermore, convenience is a widely accepted motivation for using ODPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Euromonitor, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Furunes &amp; Mkono, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>, also found in our qualitative analysis. Thus, we think that COVID-19 mobility restrictions add value to ODP service. Since customers were mostly positive about counting on the service during the lockdown, we anticipate a favourable predisposition in the future. Companies and new ventures must take advantage of the market opportunities to gain a share in locations where ODPs coverage is insufficient or null. In addition, new entrants in the ODP context should adopt the best practices in all the stages of the service process to fulfil customers' expectations and offer the most pleasing experience.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
