<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examines the differences in the impact of three leadership styles (transactional, transformational, and creative) on intra-organizational online knowledgesharing and employee creativity. Specifically, we use self-determination theory (SDT) to examine the impact of these three leadership styles on four aspects of online knowledge sharing (knowledge donating, knowledge collecting, lurking, and active lurking) and the moderating role of organizational innovation on these relationships.</p><p>Methodology: Data collected from 361 employees of B2B organizations in Vietnam support all our hypotheses. Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis.</p><p>Novelty/Originality: This paper extends the current knowledge management research on online knowledge sharing by studying two new behaviors (lurking and active lurking), linking diverse leadership styles to these behaviors and employee creativity, and exploring the moderating role of organizational innovation. Our findings shed light on the complexity of the relationship between leadership and online knowledge sharing. This study also provides useful implications for practitioners to help them choose the most appropriate leadership style for their digitalization process to ensure optimal outcomes. Findings: Transformational, transactional, and creative leadership were found to affect online knowledge sharing, in which creative leadership had the strongest effect. Online knowledge sharing was found to mediate the impact of three types of leadership on employee creativity. The results also showed that organizational innovation moderates the influence of leadership on online knowledge sharing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Technology diffusion has led to rapid digitalization in business-to-business (B2B) organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kask and Öberg, 2019)</ref>. One aspect of digitalization in B2B organizations is online knowledge sharing which uses digital tools for sharing knowledge among employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kask and Öberg, 2019)</ref>. The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the application of information technologies to facilitate remote work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Leipämaa-Leskinen et al., 2022)</ref>. Online platforms, such as Microsoft Teams, are effective in intra-organizational collaboration, connecting employees and enabling a mobile digital workforce <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>. However, in the digitalization process in B2B organizations, employees generally do not willingly share knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Chaker et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The pervasiveness of evasive knowledge hiding or holding in the digitalization process of B2B organizations is often attributed to the fear of job loss <ref type="bibr">(Chaker et al., 2021)</ref>. The hurdles to knowledge sharing lie in job insecurity when automation and artificial intelligence (AI) can reduce human's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>, though recent research has identified several antecedents for an AI-mediated knowledge sharing social exchange to effectively manage people <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Malik et al., 2022)</ref> and free up their time for other more productive tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Malik et al., 2021)</ref>. The repeated tasks that used to be done by humans can now be taken by machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>. In addition, information technology can do some tasks even better than humans. For instance, B2B organizations often need to store big data, AI helps with pattern recognition, analysis, and prediction, facilitating decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge is regarded as a valuable resource in the knowledge-sharing and management domain; without motivation, employees may not want to share their knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Oyemomi et al., 2016)</ref>. Few studies have examined how to motivate employees in B2B organizations to share knowledge online in the digitalization process. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) emphasizes motivation in online knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Deci,</ref> online knowledge-sharing in the digitalization process at the workplace. Organizational innovation is also covered as a moderator in the impact of leadership styles on online knowledge-sharing behaviors. The findings of this study offer a blueprint for the management of B2B organizations to consider their leadership styles to drive online knowledge-sharing behavior and employee creativity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-determination theory and leadership</head><p>The Self-Determination Theory (SDT) explains that individuals often have psychological needs for growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ryan and Deci, 2000)</ref>. The necessary conditions for growth and development are competence, autonomy, and relatedness, which are crucial to their psychological health and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ryan and Deci, 2000)</ref>. In addition, individuals tend to transform intention into action if their needs are fulfilled <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>SDT focuses on human motivation and differentiates autonomous motivation from controlled motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lee and Yeung, 2021)</ref>. Individuals with autonomous motivation often experiences "out of free will" with a sense of willingness, volition, and choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lee and Yeung, 2021)</ref>. Controlled motivated individuals tend to feel pressure to work on an activity or avoid punishment or guilt/shame <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Minbaeva and Santangelo, 2018)</ref>. Controlled motivation relates to external rewards, which motivate individuals in even those tedious tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Minbaeva and Santangelo, 2018)</ref>. In the workplace, SDT, from the knowledge management perspective, specifically suggests that employee behavior is affected by leadership styles that relates to autonomous or controlled motivation <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>. Leadership will flourish if it meets psychological needs, which is are preconditions for individuals' growth and development <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Leadership refers to the social influence between leaders and followers <ref type="bibr">(Dai et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Different leadership styles fulfil the needs of subordinates in different ways. In the leadership literature, a full range of leadership styles have been studied; however, transformational and transactional leadership have been dominant <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Panagopoulos and Avlonitis, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Transformational leadership involves individualized consideration and empowerment by articulating a clear vision; this leadership style is closely identified with autonomous motivation, which provides followers with a value-laden vision and empowers them to make changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>. In addition, transformational leadership help align followers' identification with organizational goals and leaders' vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>. As B2B organizations often have a large-scale network of B2B firms; thus, the alignment between the goals of employees and these organizations' goals is crucial. Therefore, transformational leadership is very important to tailor employees in the same direction of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Panagopoulos and Avlonitis, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Transactional leadership is related to external rewards which motivate individuals to take action <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hussain et al., 2017)</ref>. Transactional leadership is often identified with controlled motivation <ref type="bibr">(Chang et al., 2015)</ref>. Transactional leadership often links expectations and responsibilities with rewards and recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hussain et al., 2017)</ref>. This leadership style focuses on the exchange in which leaders satisfy followers' needs when the goals are met <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Masa'deh et al., 2016)</ref>. The leaders who employ this leadership style often foster the commitment of their followers for online knowledge sharing to propose new ideas and to achieve rewards or recognition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Masa'deh et al. (2016)</ref> argue that the transactional leadership style is essential to motivate them in online knowledge sharing. As B2B organizations have many employees, not every member knows each other; thus, the lack of incentives has been recognized as the reason for knowledge hiding or holding due to weak connections or social interaction ties <ref type="bibr">(Chaker et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In the context of digitalization in B2B organizations, creative leadership is indispensable.</p><p>Creative leadership is a leadership style that deliberately engages individuals in a novel goal -a new direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Puccio et al., 2011)</ref>. Digitalization with the use of new technologies makes tasks that were used to be done by humans are to a large extent now done by machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>. However, technologies and AI cannot come any closer to substituting humans for tasks requiring creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>. Creative leadership was featured many years ago, and creative leadership is an option. Today's context makes it no longer optional, as leaders cannot afford to lack in creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mainemelis et al., 2015)</ref>. Creative leadership often drives employees to different thinking skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Puccio et al., 2011)</ref>. Creative leadership is crucial to the sustainable development of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mainemelis et al., 2015)</ref>. However, creative leadership has not been placed focus in the B2B digitalization process.</p><p>Research on different leadership styles in the same context is scarce. Although some previous studies have linked supervisors' leadership, such as transformational leadership, and subordinates' behavior, little is known about different leadership styles that drive extra-role behavior and which leadership styles fit more to motivate individual behavior changes in their extra-role tasks like online knowledge sharing. Especially, creative leadership has not been placed in the same context with other leadership styles to compare their impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online knowledge-sharing behavior</head><p>Online knowledge sharing involves transferring expertise and skills through online platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nguyen and Prentice, 2022)</ref>. As digitalization continues to advance, online knowledge sharing has been expected to become even more prevalent and important in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nguyen and Prentice, 2022)</ref>. The adoption of digital technologies has led to major changes in the way employees work and communicate with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Li et al., 2017)</ref>. The rise of digital technologies has facilitated online knowledge sharing, allowing people to access and share information and ideas more easily and efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akhavan and Hosseini, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Intra-organizational online knowledge sharing is often viewed as a crucial component of knowledge management, as knowledge is often viewed as a powerful resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Li et al., 2017)</ref>. Intra-organizational online knowledge sharing benefits employees through enhanced learning from each other and improved decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nguyen and Prentice, 2022)</ref>. In online knowledge-sharing literature, two mainstreams to capture online knowledge-sharing behavior are dominant <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nguyen and Prentice, 2022)</ref>. The first approach examines online knowledge sharing as a holistic behavior with one directional perspective where knowledge goes from the provider to the recipient <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nguyen, 2021)</ref>. This approach has received criticism due to its oversimplifying measure of online knowledge-sharing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Nguyen and Prentice, 2022)</ref>. The second approach was recently employed, which views online knowledge-sharing behavior from two dimensions: knowledge donating and knowledge collecting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akhavan and Hosseini, 2016)</ref>. The former refers to the supply of knowledge where individuals share their expertise, skills, and experience with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akhavan and Hosseini, 2016)</ref>. The latter involves the demand for knowledge when an individual requests others to share knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akhavan and Hosseini, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>With the bidirectional perspective, the second approach has captured more dimensions of online knowledge-sharing behavior; however, emerging studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nguyen and Prentice (2022)</ref>) argue that another dimension of lurking needs to be included. Lurking is related to reading and accumulating the knowledge shared by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nguyen, 2021)</ref>. Lurking was seen as negative, as lurkers just read the knowledge shared without contributing themselves. However, lurking has been recently recorded with more positive views as it has been recognized as a common activity of online participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nguyen, 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nguyen (2021)</ref> developed the ISTO model of four reasons for lurking: individual, social, technological and organizational. Individuals may need time to get used to the platforms or read the previous posts before sharing/asking for information not to repeat others. Some technical issues also result in lurking behavior. The recent study by <ref type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2022)</ref> taps into two dimensions of lurking and differentiated active lurking from lurking.</p><p>Active lurking relates to the propagation and application of knowledge in the workplace, while lurking refers to reading the knowledge shared by others <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>A key obstacle to online knowledge sharing is the unwillingness to share knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Chaker et al., 2021)</ref>. Without motivation, knowledge owners do not want to share their most valuable knowledge assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akhavan and Hosseini, 2016)</ref>. Underpinning SDT, we develop a conceptual framework to investigate the influence of leadership with its three styles as predictors of online knowledge-sharing behavior and employee creativity. In order to address the limitations of previous approaches to capture online knowledge-sharing and bring more insights into employee behavior, this study includes four dimensions of online knowledgesharing: knowledge donating, knowledge collecting, lurking and active lurking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses development</head><p>Prior scholars have identified the link between leadership and online knowledge-sharing behavior in the knowledge management literature. Leadership often provides direction for employees to follow and form perceptions to contribute to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mehta et al. (2003)</ref> posit that leaders are crucial in the knowledge-sharing management process in an organization. Leadership provides a supportive climate and sufficient resources for online knowledge sharing. Transformational leadership is often regarded as an inspirational style influences followers' positive attitudes and individual development <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>. Transformational leadership is often viewed as a frame for the participation of employees in the decision-making process, as it motivates employees to create changes and be innovative <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>. Many tasks are collective and need to be handled by a team which implies a need for a leader who helps create a favorable working environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Panagopoulos and Avlonitis, 2010)</ref>. Transformational leadership often empowers employees and creates a supportive culture where employees feel free to discuss and exchange knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Chang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Leaders, who follow the transformational style, often motivate employees to contribute to organizational development by sharing their knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Dai et al., 2013)</ref>. Transformational leadership urges employees to share their knowledge with colleagues to overcome work challenges and difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Masa'deh et al., 2016)</ref>. Transactional leadership allows knowledge to be shared efficiently within an organization due to introducing a reward and recognition system <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Masa'deh et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Chang et al. (2015)</ref> indicate that the influence of transactional leadership with knowledge acquisition capability can help increase innovation.</p><p>Transactional leadership builds a reciprocal relationship between supervisors and employees <ref type="bibr">(Chang et al., 2015)</ref>. Leaders pursue a cost-benefit exchange to encourage employees to perform well. Followers under transactional leadership expect to comply with the leaders to exchange for rewards, praise, and recognition.</p><p>Creative leadership is often associated with creative problem-solving activities as such as brainstorming <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rickards and Moger, 2000)</ref>. Creative leaders use techniques that bring individuals together to discuss and seek creative and innovative outputs. Creative leadership links with everyday creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rickards and Moger, 2000)</ref>, often enhances creative performances and engages employees in knowledge-sharing to brainstorm or develop more initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rickards and Moger, 2000)</ref>. Creative leaders are inclined to recognize and maximize employee talents through collaboration and to learn from each other, which can effectively do knowledge-sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harris, 2009)</ref>. Creative leaders create a climate and conditions to make creativity thrive. Creative leaders often motivate knowledge sharing to remove barriers that prevent working together and equip employees with a platform for interaction and dialogue <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harris, 2009)</ref>. Supportive leadership styles have been linked to increase knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Navimipour and Charband, 2016)</ref>, especially in virtual settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ardichvili, 2008)</ref>. Further, supportive leadership is also a critical enabler of knowledge sharing and creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carmeli et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus: H1: All three leadership styles positively impact online knowledge sharing.</p><p>The relationship between knowledge sharing and employee creativity has been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ma et al., 2013)</ref>. Employee creativity performance will be high when the exchange of knowledge among employees is enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ali et al., 2019)</ref>. Creativity requires new knowledge; online knowledge sharing helps create knowledge pools as social capital, and all employees benefit from it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carmeli and Paulus (2015)</ref> argue that online knowledge sharing supports creativity as it saves employees' effort to explore things known by others. Those with experience in overcoming issues or difficulties can help colleagues through knowledge donating <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nguyen, 2021)</ref>. Those who face work issues can request help from co-work through knowledge collecting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akhavan and Hosseini, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Lurking is another type of organizational learning that helps increase employee creativity as employees learn from the knowledge shared by colleagues <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>. Active lurking contributes to employee creativity by applying knowledge shared in work tasks. The critical success factor that leads to employee creativity is online knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kremer et al., 2019)</ref>. Through the accumulated pools of knowledge, employees build up more initiatives, such as those to reduce production costs or to improve firm performance <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>. Sharing knowledge online enhanced employee creativity which helped decrease costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Singh et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus: H2: Online knowledge-sharing behavior has a positive impact on employee creativity.</p><p>Earlier arguments indicate the potential mediation role of online knowledge sharing in the effect of leadership on employee creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carmeli and Paulus, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Further, previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016)</ref> have indicated the mediation role of online knowledge sharing in the association between leadership and employee outcomes. For example, knowledge-sharing had a mediation effect on the impact of transformational leadership on team creativity and employee innovative behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ma et al., 2013)</ref>. Online knowledge sharing helps employees deal with work-related issues, promote intellectual stimulation, and help them view their work issues in a new way and address those creatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Singh et al., 2021)</ref>. When employees actively engage in online knowledge sharing, they are exposed to organizational learning opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gupta and Polonsky, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Leadership can create a favorable working environment to increase employees' online knowledge sharing to stimulate creativity and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ma et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ma et al. (2013)</ref> reported that knowledge-sharing mediates the impact of leadership on employee creativity.</p><p>Similarly, in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hussain et al. (2017)</ref>, knowledge sharing was found to be a mediator in linking transactional leadership and creativity in an organization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Raab et al. (2014)</ref> reveal that leadership influences employee creativity to increase innovation performance via knowledge sharing. <ref type="bibr">Dai et al. (2013)</ref> found that leaders can provide an appropriate climate to foster knowledge sharing -the exchange of knowledge which is beneficial to employees in their organizational learning, enhancing employee creativity and organizational innovation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Le and Lei (2019)</ref> also argue that transformational leadership helps increase employee knowledge sharing behavior, which enhances the exchange of information, skills and expertise, resulting in higher employee creativity. In addition, creative leadership motivates employees to collaborate to propose and develop more initiatives, often enhancing employee creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mainemelis et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus: H3: Online knowledge-sharing behavior mediates the impact of leadership on employee creativity.</p><p>Organizational innovation refers to introducing new or improved products/services or process improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nguyen and Malik, 2020)</ref>. Organizational innovation is key to competitive advantage in the fierce market environment for B2B organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Iranmanesh et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The recent study by <ref type="bibr">Nguyen and Malik (2021)</ref> indicates that organizational innovation may play a role as a moderator. The leaders in innovative organizations tend to push the online knowledge-sharing process to achieve organizational goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Singh et al., 2021)</ref>. A higher level of organizational innovation also means higher pressure on leaders to have new products or services to maintain organizational competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Singh et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Leaders are inclined to feel their role is more important to contribute to organization development, tend to motivate employees to think about organizational goals and contribute to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Panagopoulos and Avlonitis, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Online knowledge sharing is one type of behavior that shows their contribution. Leaders in innovative organizations tend to feel they need to drive subordinates to contribute to improving organizational performance through online knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The same is for leader behavior in an organization that needs a high level of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>. In a high-innovation environment, more pressure is placed on employee creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Le and Lei, 2019)</ref>. Knowledge exchange in an innovative organization is important to reduce redundancy and increase productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(García-Morales et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Al-Husseini et al. (2019)</ref> found that leadership indirectly affects employee creativity via its positive effects on employees' knowledge-sharing behavior. Recent studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Le and Lei (2019)</ref>) indicate that leadership significantly impacts employee's psychological and intellectual capital shared with colleagues, which, in turn, motivates them to use social knowledge capital for radical and incremental innovation to enhance employee creativity. H4: Organizational innovation moderates the impact of leadership on online knowledgesharing behavior.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the conceptual model with all the hypotheses. &lt; Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here &gt;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>This study adopted a positivist approach using the quantitative method to develop the research design. In this study, the research problems were defined where employees are often reluctant to share knowledge online. This study is to examine the impact of three leadership styles on online knowledge sharing behavior and employee creativity as well as the moderation role of organizational innovation. Thus, this study aims to test four hypotheses developed from the literature review. The literature review identified numerous studies related to the constructs elaborated in the conceptual framework. The conceptual framework will test hypotheses derived from the framework through the use of statistical procedures <ref type="bibr">(Cresswell, 2003)</ref>. According to the suggestion of Cresswell ( <ref type="formula">2003</ref>), positivism and the quantitative research method are deemed to be the most suitable for this study because a theory was advanced, and data were collected to test the conceptual framework.</p><p>The data were collected in 2021 in Vietnam. Our target participants were employees of B2B companies in Vietnam undergoing digitalization and engaged in intra-organizational online knowledge sharing. Convenience sampling method was used to collect data due to the feasibility to access the target audience within research budget constraints. Using researchers' connection with B2B organizations, 16 B2B companies agreed to support data collection by distributing an online survey link to their employees. All these companies were eligible because: (1) they all had online knowledge-sharing platforms such as Microsoft Teams or internal online forums, (2) they were on the digitalization with the process of transforming to use digital tools, technology, and ecosystems to change their business models.</p><p>The data collection was implemented in three steps. First, we developed our questionnaire using scales adopted from previous studies to ensure reliability. On the cover page, all the participants were informed about their voluntary participation and had no consequences if they withdrew. They were also informed that their responses would be treated confidentially and anonymously, and the research team would only use the data for research purposes.</p><p>Second, in terms of translation and pilot test, the original questionnaire was in English and then translated from Vietnamese via a back-translation process to ensure accuracy. Finally, a pilot test with 25 employees was implemented to ensure clarity of wording.</p><p>Third, the Qualtrics platform was employed to design the online questionnaire for the main survey. We placed two filtering questions after the survey's cover page to ensure the respondents' eligibility. An anonymous link was distributed to participating organizations.</p><p>Three-hundred sixty-one complete questionnaires were collected after three months of data collection and used for data analysis. About half the participants were females (54%) and in the age group of 26-35 years (54%). Those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher were 49% and 46%, respectively. About half of the participants (53.5%) were married, while single participants made up 40.7%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>We adapted scales from previous studies and used 5-point Likert scales (1 as strongly disagree and 5 as strongly agree. Transactional leadership was adapted from <ref type="bibr">Dai et al. (2013)</ref> with four items (α = .88). The transformational leadership scale had eight items (α = .93) which were adopted from <ref type="bibr">Dai et al. (2013)</ref>. Creative leadership with four items (α = .72) was adopted from Ye et al. <ref type="bibr">(2021)</ref>. Knowledge donating was adopted from De Vries et al. <ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref> with five items (α = .91). The scale of knowledge collecting was adopted from De Vries et al. <ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref> with four times (α = .87). Both lurking (α = .93) and active lurking (α = .95) scales were adapted from <ref type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2022)</ref> with four items each.

Back-translation techniques were employed to ensure the accuracy of the Vietnamese version. The pilot test was conducted to check the clarity of the questionnaire wording. Before data analysis, the dataset was gone through Harman's single factor test, which showed that the first variable explained less than 50% variance. The correlation among variables was generated with and without a marker variable, which resulted in no changes in the correlation values <ref type="bibr">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Multicollinearity was checked through the variance inflation factor, which indicated no value above 3.0 <ref type="bibr">(Neter et al., 1985)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This paper empirically tests the causal effect of three leadership styles on knowledge sharing and employee creativity. The results support the first hypothesis on the relationship between leadership and online knowledge sharing. The premise underpinning this relationship between leadership and online knowledge sharing is that various leadership styles encourage employees to exchange knowledge. Those who possess valuable knowledge are motivated to share knowledge. Those who need help are encouraged to reach out to address work issues.</p><p>Leadership helps lurkers read the knowledge shared more and apply it to their work. These results agree with what was found in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Le and Lei (2019)</ref> regarding the impact of transformational leadership on knowledge sharing. This study goes beyond it and contributes to the knowledge management literature by investigating three leadership styles in the same context, especially the inclusion of creative leadership. Their influence on online knowledgesharing behavior in different perspectives, including knowledge donating, knowledge collecting, lurking and active lurking.</p><p>The complexity of the relationship between leadership and online knowledge-sharing behavior under different aspects was uncovered through this study. We found some differences in the influence of each of the three leadership styles. Creative leadership encourages employees for knowledge donating and collecting, whereas transactional leadership plays a key role in lurking and active lurking. This helps to explain the contradictory results from previous studies in the knowledge management literature regarding the impact of leadership on online knowledge-sharing as they tend to examine a "general leadership style" and knowledge-sharing behavior without differentiating its different dimensions. Some researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baytok et al. (2014)</ref>) agree on the positive influence of transformational leadership on online knowledge sharing, arguing that transformational leadership plays a pivotal role in engaging employees in online knowledge sharing by providing favorable organizational culture to promote the exchange of information, skills and expertise. In addition, transformation leadership helps create a shared vision and provides systems and structures that need to promote online knowledge sharing in an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baytok et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">). However, Masa'deh et al. (2016)</ref> did not find any link between transformational leadership and knowledge-sharing behavior. Also, the impact of transactional leadership on online knowledge sharing behavior is questionable with large variance in results from past studies. Thus, the inclusion of different dimensions of online knowledge sharing behavior provides more insights into the influence of different predictors.</p><p>The results of this study indicate the influence of online knowledge sharing on employee creativity. Employee creativity is dependent on the effective exchange of knowledge.</p><p>Knowledge sharing is the transfer from knowledge donators to knowledge-collectors and lurkers. This result echoes the finding of <ref type="bibr">Tseng and Huang (2011)</ref>, who agree that the open and rapid sharing of knowledge makes employees surrounded by diverse knowledge, facilitating the creation of new ideas, utilization of resources and rapid progress. Previous studies acknowledge the influence of knowledge donation on employee creativity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ma et al. (2013)</ref>. However, this study goes beyond the findings from previous studies regarding the impact of online knowledge sharing behavior and explores other dimensions of online knowledge-sharing behavior, including knowledge collecting, lurking, and active lurking, which also contribute to employee creativity.</p><p>Interestingly, lurking is the behavior that contributes the most to employee creativity in this study. Reading and accumulating are crucial ways of learning and acquiring knowledge shared by others. Knowledge collecting is an active learning way to reach out when an employee needs help addressing work issues. Lurking and active lurking have recently been acknowledged as a way to acquire knowledge and learn. <ref type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2022)</ref> view lurking and active lurking positively to learn from the knowledge shared by others. This study distinguishes active lurking from lurking as employees read and need to propagate and apply the knowledge shared by others to their work. Active lurking contributes equally to employee creativity as knowledge donating and collecting.</p><p>Online knowledge-sharing behavior was proven to mediate the relationship between leadership styles and employee creativity in this study. These findings explain how leaders want to drive employee behavior into their creativity. Therefore, the influence of leadership is significant in setting a knowledge-sharing culture that is translated into employee creativity.</p><p>Furthermore, as online knowledge-sharing behavior is not compulsory, motivation, either autonomous or controlled, which leaders create, is crucial to engagement in online knowledge-sharing behavior. The stronger individual growth through organizational learning in the online knowledge-sharing process, the higher the employee creativity level. These findings are aligned with those by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Le and Lei (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Chang et al. (2015)</ref>, who found that appropriate leadership styles help create a favorable working environment for knowledge sharing to motivate employees to convert their knowledge into creativity and innovation.</p><p>Another interesting result is the moderating effect of organizational innovation. This study examines organizational innovation from a different angle as a moderator, which moderates the impact of leadership on online knowledge-sharing behavior. The results indicate that organizational innovation pressurizes leaders to drive employees' online knowledge behavior.</p><p>In highly innovative organizations, leaders tend to use online platforms to bring employees together for brainstorming, discussions, and collective learning. These results support <ref type="bibr">Nguyen and Malik's study (2020)</ref>, who found that organizational innovation moderates the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on knowledge-sharing behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical contributions</head><p>This study contributes to some aspects of SDT theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ryan and Deci, 2000)</ref> and knowledgesharing literature. First, as per our literature review, it is the first time four dimensions of online knowledge-sharing behavior are examined in the same context. Two mainstreams of online knowledge sharing lie in either knowledge donating and collecting or lurking behavior. This study fills the gap to cover the lines between these two mainstreams by including knowledge donating, collecting, and lurking together. In this study, lurking is a crucial way to improve employee creativity. Lurking has been viewed negatively and recently recognized as a positive way of learning and acquiring knowledge. In addition, lurking and active lurking are distinguished to bring more insights into employee behavior. Active lurking in organizational and employee creativity and innovation has been empirically examined by <ref type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2022)</ref>. Our paper builds up on <ref type="bibr">Nguyen et al. (2022)</ref> and extends to cover other dimensions of online knowledge-sharing behavior.</p><p>The three different leadership styles were examined in the same context, and comparisons across their impact on the different online knowledge-sharing behavior aspects were investigated. Including different leadership styles and their impact on online knowledgesharing behavior provides an additional layer to examine the relationship between leaders and followers and helps explain the discrepancy in the findings of previous studies which just focus on one leadership style. The results of this study also indicate the importance of creative leadership, which has been overlooked by previous scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mainemelis et al., 2015)</ref>. In addition, as one of the first, this study examines online knowledge-sharing behavior in the association between leadership and employee creativity in digitalization in the workplace. The findings of this study provide a new lens to approach the leader-follower relationship and show the importance of leader creativity to employee creativity.</p><p>This study is also the first to examine the impact of different leadership styles on different Furthermore, organizational innovation is often viewed as an outcome of online knowledge sharing; however, this study looks at organizational innovation as a moderator, which puts more pressure on leaders to contribute to organizational development. The moderator role of organizational innovation has not been unfolded much. <ref type="bibr">Nguyen and Malik (2021)</ref> tap into the surface of this role but mainly focus on the pressure on leaders in general, but their leadership styles have not been explored. This study uncovers different leadership styles and examines organizational innovation in the context of providing more layers of pressure leaders usually carry. Finally, this study contributes to the knowledge management literature to examine the role of online knowledge-sharing behaviors in the B2B context, as this has not received sufficient attention from previous researchers despite its importance in the global economy (Chen and Huan, 2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>Transactional leadership effectively encourages employees to exchange knowledge with rewards, recognition, or resources. As the lack of knowledge-sharing rewards was recognized as one key reason for knowledge holding and hoarding <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anaza and Nowlin, 2017)</ref>, leaders need to understand what employee needs and wants to use as incentive and motivation.</p><p>However, incentives may work quickly and should not be a long-term strategy with opposite results <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nguyen and Malik, 2020)</ref>. Transactional leadership keeps employees on track, especially in digitalization, where a mobile working environment may distract employees from their work tasks. A transactional leadership style serves as a nudge when employees fail or are off track to achieve their goals, giving timely feedback. Employees are more inclined to share knowledge if they feel the working environment is open for them to speak up and exchange knowledge.</p><p>Leaders help increase trust, praise the willingness to support each other, influence norms or culture among their subordinates, look to encourage voice in their team, and boost the reinforcement of knowledge sharing among employees. Leaders also can create a small team or group and give them the freedom to establish the team or group rules and ask team or group members for input explicitly. By doing it, the knowledge shared is valued by other team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kremer et al., 2019)</ref>. Leaders also can provide support and empowerment to promote online knowledge sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>This paper has a few limitations that future researchers may want to address. First, we use the data collected from employees working in Vietnamese B2B organizations, the generalizability of the findings of this study should be followed with caution. As Vietnam is recorded as having a high level of collectivism and power distance, it may influence the relationship between leaders and followers in intra-organizational online knowledge sharing.</p><p>Future research may include personal-level cultural dimensions to seek more profound insights into employee's online knowledge-sharing behaviors under different leadership styles. Second, the data were cross-sectional due to the limitation in data collection at a onetime point. Future researchers may want to conduct a longitudinal study to validate the findings of this study. Third, due to research budget constraints, we used convenience sampling method to collect data. Future scholars may want to consolidate the model using different data collection methods before the generalization of the findings. Finally, future research may explore other predictors of online knowledge sharing, such as self-efficacy <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2022)</ref> and outcomes of online knowledge sharing, such as employee productivity and job satisfaction.
