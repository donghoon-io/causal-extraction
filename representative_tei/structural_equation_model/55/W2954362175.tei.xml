<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of this research is to analyze the mediating effect of job satisfaction on the relationship between perceived organizational support (POS) and job performance for white-collar employees in an energy sector in İstanbul. The survey was distributed to 964 employees, while 700 valid questionnaires were included within the scope of the analysis. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out to determine factor distribution, while confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and reliability analysis were carried out to detect scale validities and reliabilities. Relations between scale variables were examined by a correlation analysis. Structural equation model (SEM) was constructed based on research hypotheses while the effect of POS on job satisfaction, the effect of job satisfaction on job performance and the mediating role of job satisfaction on this relation were tested through this model. All hypotheses are supported in this study.</p></div>

(1986)</ref> organizational support theory forms the theoretical framework of POS. This theory refers psychological background for the outcomes of POS. People believe that they will be rewarded for their contributions and get required support in hard times. Based on reciprocity norm, employees feel obligations to put their maximum efforts to support organizational goals <ref type="bibr">(Wann-Yih &amp; Htaik, 2011, p. 2)</ref>.</p><p>Employees carry out their jobs in a more effective manner when they feel the sense of approval, respect from their organizations, appropriate salaries and benefits and have information access <ref type="bibr">(Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002, p. 698)</ref>.</p><p>Although there was limited research regarding POS in an organizational behavior literature until mid 1990's, there is an increasing trend among the concept especially in the last decades <ref type="bibr">(Chelliah et al, 2015, p. 13)</ref>. POS is considered with many variables such as leader support, leader-member exchange, organizational justice, organizational commitment, intention to leave, organizational citizenship behavior, performance, job satisfaction, job stress, psychological contrat breach, perceived organizational prestige, emotional labor, trust etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Eisenberger et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Demircan Çakar &amp; Yıldız, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Eser, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kaplan &amp; Öğüt, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fatima et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ötken, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zhong et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Malik &amp; Naeem, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ingusci et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bukhari &amp; Kamal, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nwanzu, 2017)</ref>. POS of employees tend to increase when they believe that their organizations stand behind them and would lend helping hands during crises. A perception of an intense organizational support meet individuals' socio-emotional requirements and make them reveal positive behaviors such as job satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Cullen et al., 2014, p. 270)</ref>.</p><p>In the organizational literature, job satisfaction has been defined by several authors. <ref type="bibr">Hoppock (1935)</ref> described it as the integration of psychological, environmental and physiological conditions which cause a satisfaction by trust. According to <ref type="bibr">George and Jones (2008)</ref>, job satisfaction represent opinions of employees toward their jobs. An individual's satisfaction can be affected by salary, work nature, management, career advancement, work conditions, the quality of relations with his/her supervisor, subordinates and colleagues <ref type="bibr">(Aziri, 2011, pp. 77-81)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger (2002)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Riggle et al. (2009)</ref> showed the strong relationship between POS and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Bilgin &amp; Demirer, 2012, p. 471)</ref>. Organizational success strongly rests upon individual performance; that is why it should attentively be considered by researchers.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Gould &amp; Hawkins (1978)</ref>, Hawthorne studies, which associated employee productivity with satisfaction level, can be indicated to clarify the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance <ref type="bibr">(Hsieh, 2016, p. 93)</ref>. This relationship is highlighted in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Miao, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Özpehlivan, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kale, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Güngören, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wu et al., 2017)</ref> and as Landy (1989) implied, it is identified as the "Holy Grail" of organizational and industrial psychology <ref type="bibr">(Bowling, 2007, p. 167)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Burke (2003)</ref> argue that employees will have a positive psychological mood as a result of high level of POS and job satisfaction; Grandey (1997) adds that they become more willing to contribute to the organization <ref type="bibr">(Akkoç et al., 2012, p. 113)</ref>. There are various researches in the fields of POS, job satisfaction and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Muse &amp; Stamper, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wann-Yih &amp; Htaik, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akkoç et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cullen et al., 2014)</ref> considering this relationship.</p><p>In this article, the relation of POS with job performance is analysed by considering the mediating effect of job satisfaction. Research sample is composed of white-collar employees working in energy sector in Istanbul. In an organizational behavior literature, although there are studies considering research variables, there is no study which observes all variables together. Demographical results and scale information are given in measures and sampling section. The data obtained by the questionnaire was analysed through SPSS and SEM. Scale validities and reliabilities were investigated by EFA and CFA. Descriptive statistics are presented after discussing fit indices resulted from CFA. Hypotheses were tested through a path analysis. Finally at the conclusion part, research results are refered to previous studies while limitations are also stated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eisenberger et al. (1986)</ref> identify the term POS as beliefs of employees about how much their organizations appreciate their efforts and consider their welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Riggle et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">(Riggle et al., , p. 1027))</ref>. POS of employees will develop if an organization fulfills their socioemotional requirements and is ready to award their extra endeavors. Moreover, people perceive high level of support when they feel helping hands from their organization. The relationship between employees and an organization is stated through a social exhange theory developed by <ref type="bibr">Blau (1964)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr">Tansky and Cohen (2001)</ref> state that this theory comprises reciprocity while each party has expectations and sensations from each other <ref type="bibr">(Uçar &amp; Ötken, 2010, p. 87)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT</head><p>Besides, POS derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eisenberger et al.'s (1986)</ref> organizational support theory (OST) <ref type="bibr">(Bano, Ramzan, Anjum &amp; Dapeng, 2017, p. 107)</ref>. Employees develop impressions toward their organizations regarding the extent of how much the required resources are met and in what level they feel themselves as valuable individuals in their organizations <ref type="bibr">(Cullen et al., 2014, p. 270)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">JOB SATISFACTION</head><p>Despite its miscellaneous structure, job satisfaction is the most frequently investigated concept in organizational behavior researches. <ref type="bibr">Lu et al. (2012)</ref> belive that job satisfaction does not only refer to what people think about their work, but also to their sense against the nature of work. It would be significant to indicate that job satisfaction has a variety of constituents such as work nature, work conditions, remuneration, advancement occasion, communication, appreciation, some organizational procedures and policies, security and finally connections with administration <ref type="bibr">(Halcomb et al., 2018, p. 1)</ref>. Job satisfaction has been described by <ref type="bibr">Locke (1976)</ref> as a satisfactory and affirmative sentimental condition which results from employees' favorable appreciation of their work experience. The difference between what people want to acquire and what they obtain represents job satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Hassan et al., 2017, p. 481)</ref>. Job characteristics theory which was developed by <ref type="bibr">Hackman and Oldham (1976)</ref> state that, individuals will be more satisfied when they feel intrinsic motivation toward their work. Skill diversity, autonomy, task identity, feedback and finally task significance are accepted as the main peculiarities which provide an intrinsic employee motivation. Authors add that outcomes like individual satisfaction, turnover, motivation, absenteeism and performance are affected through some psychological conditions. According to this theory, job is seen as a core motivator by employees while their motivations and satisfactions rise out by the time those characteristics are involved within the job <ref type="bibr">(Gözükara &amp; Çolakoğlu, 2016, p. 254)</ref>. There are various aspects generating job satisfaction such as fair promotion system, all work conditions, leaders, appropriateness of salary amount, existential job and friendly connections. The term job satisfaction is divided into external and internal factors by <ref type="bibr">Tett and Meyer (1993)</ref>. They point out that pay, available job conditions, promotions and supervision factors are not enough to make an individual feel satisfied.</p><p>Besides external factors, there should be internal factors such as intimate relationships, emotions, inspired mood and personality characteristics <ref type="bibr">(Mohammad et al., 2018, p. 5)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">JOB PERFORMANCE</head><p>Job performance which is critical for both employees and employers has a determinative role on promotions, incentives and terminations. It can be simply identified as one's performing capability over his/her job-related responsibilities <ref type="bibr">(Caillier, 2010, p. 140)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Motowidlo (2003)</ref> implies that, job performance represents the total value of employee's performing capacity within a standart period and also his/her level of output on the basis of quality and quantity <ref type="bibr">(Mohamad &amp; Jais, 2016, pp. 676-677)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Motowidlo et al. (1997)</ref> classified the dimensions of performance in terms of task and contextual performance <ref type="bibr">(Demerouti et al., 2014, p. 59)</ref>. Task performance refers to the effectiveness of one's activities which are directly added to the technical part of the company or indirectly contributed by ensuring required supplies or services. Contextual performance leads to an organizational effectiveness; in this context, it forms not only the psychological and organizational, but also the social content. One's effort to handle task activities which are not obligatory in terms of formal procedures can be identified as contextual activities <ref type="bibr">(Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1997, pp. 99-100)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Eisenberger and Stinglhamber (2011)</ref> asserted that previous researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allen et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cropanzano et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eisenberger et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002)</ref> identified at least three statements for explaining the positive relationship between POS and job satisfaction. First of all, when required supplies and aid are provided by the organization, it will cause high level of POS for employees. At this point, employees become more eager to handle their responsibilities. Secondly, POS makes employees believe that they will receive rewards for their efforts. Finally, <ref type="bibr">Eisenberger and Stinglhamber (2011)</ref> suggest that employees will be satisfied when their socio-emotional requirements are met as a result of POS <ref type="bibr">(Emerson, 2013, pp. 17-18)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POS, JOB SATISFACTION AND JOB</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PERFORMANCE</head><p>As researchers explain, job satisfaction is a precessor of overall job performance. <ref type="bibr">Bateman and Organ (1983)</ref> attributed this relationship to social exchange theory. <ref type="bibr">Edwards et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Hackman and Oldham (1980)</ref> point out that employees who enjoy doing their jobs will make more effort in order to achive greater task performance <ref type="bibr">(Peng, 2014, pp. 75-76)</ref>.</p><p>The interest for the influence of employee behavior on job performance rested upon Hawthorne studies; and, following this, the particular opinion of "happy employee is a productive employee" became widespread among researchers <ref type="bibr">(Saari &amp; Judge, 2004, p. 398)</ref>. Some other studies concentrated on the direct or indirect influences of POS on an employee performance. Researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Eisenberger et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Riggle et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">DeConinck, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kurtessis et al., 2017)</ref> emphasize the fact that employees feel obligations to show attitudes toward achieving corporate goals, in response to the support they perceive from their organizations. This view originated from Blau (1964)'s social exchange theory <ref type="bibr">(Du et al., 2018, p. 214)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr">Eisenberger et al. (2001)</ref> mention, this attitude is stronger in people who admit the norm of reciprocity. Nielsen (2007) touch upon the view that highly-supported individuals tend to exhibit greater task performance <ref type="bibr">(Afzali et al., 2014, p. 625)</ref>. Some researches which point out the relationship between POS, job satisfaction and job performance are stated below (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> </p></div>

Moreover, job satisfaction has a mediator role on the relationship between POS and task-contextual performance, whereas affective commitment has not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">MEASURES AND SAMPLING</head><p>The research survey was distributed to 964 employees in 7 companies which operate in an energy sector in İstanbul; and, 700 questionnaires were included in the research. The survey response rate is 72.6%. The participants were asked a series of demographic questions such as age, sex, educational level, position, work experience in their current organization and their total work experience. POS, job satisfaction and job performance scales are used throughout this study. POS scale was formed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eisenberger et al. (1986)</ref>. It consisted of 10 items, the 6 th and 7 th of them were reverse-coded. Job satisfaction scale, which was formed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hackman and Oldham (1975)</ref>, had 5 items, none of them were reverse-coded. Eventually, 4 item job performance scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kirkman and Rosen (1999)</ref>. All scales were 5point Likert type, and the items were stated as: 1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disagree, 3: Neutral, 4: Agree, 5: Strongly Agree. 53% of the employees were between 31 and 40 ages. 48.4% of the employees were female while 51.6% were male. The demographic results showed that most of the participants had bachelor's degree (41.7%). The participants were mostly (45.6%) composed of the other category (intern, staff member, specialist, assistant specialist). The individuals who participated in the survey had 0-5 years of experience in their current firm (69.7%) and 6-10 years (38.6%) of total work experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">ANALYSIS METHOD</head><p>Before touching on an analysis method, it will be beneficial to state frequently used scales for POS, job satisfaction and job performance in an organizational behavior literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eisenberger et al. (1986)</ref> formed the first version of POS scale which is composed of 36 items. Later, its shortened versions were developed by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eisenberger et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Stassen &amp; Ursel, 2009)</ref>. This 6 or 8-item simplified version is reconstructed by considering previous scale items with the highest factor loadings. This scale is used in 5 or 7point Likert types in organizational researches. There are two reverse-coded items in shortened version.</p><p>There are various scales in an organizational literature to measure job satisfaction. One of the typically used scale in social sciences is the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) which was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Weiss et al. (1967)</ref> Job performance is measured by various scales in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fuentes-Fuentes et al., (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rahman and Bullock (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kirkman and Rosen (1999)</ref> developed unidimensional scales which are often used by researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Williams and Anderson (1991)</ref> worked on a 5item scale to evaluate employees' overall performance degree, competency and task completion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Goodman and Svyantek (1999)</ref> developed a 25-item job performance scale which includes items concerning both task and contextual performances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borman and Motowidlo (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Van Scotter et al.

LIMITATIONS Some limitations can be expressed at the end of this study. First of all, the research sample was only composed of employees from energy sector, so the results cannot be generalized over other sectors. It should be noticed that this analysis was conducted on employees of institutional companies; therefore, perceptions of white collar employees working at non-institutional companies may differ. It is recommended for future researchers to conduct this study in other sectors with samples from various nationalities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The mediator role was examined by constructing three different research models. In the first model, the direct influence of POS on job performance was evaluated, while the direct influence of POS on job satisfaction was questioned in the second model. In the third model, the influence of POS on job performance and job satisfaction, and the influence of job satisfaction on job performance were examined as a whole. It is proved that all fit indice values are at acceptable level. In order to talk about the mediator effect, standard β, which is statistically significant at Model 1, should turn into insignificant at Model 3. It is assumed that job satisfaction has a mediator effect on the relationship between POS and job performance. The β coefficient decreased from 0.115 to 0.061, while p value turned from significant (p&lt;0.05) to statistically insignificant (p&gt;0.05) at Model 3 so H3 is also supported. Job satisfaction has a full mediator role between POS and job performance. The hypothesis result for the mediator role is given below (Table <ref type="table">9</ref>). </p></div>
