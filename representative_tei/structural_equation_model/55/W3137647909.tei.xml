<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose-This paper draws on the dynamic capabilities approach, and aims to empirically investigate the impact of supply chain finance (SCF) on firm performance (e.g. operational risk and operational performance), the critical effect of environmental dynamism (ED) as moderator and supply chain risk (SCR) and a mediator in the relationship between SCF and OP.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach -This study is based on empirical data collected from a survey of 210 companies and their supply chains in mainland China. Structural equation modeling is used to test our proposed relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings -</head><p>The findings show that SCF significantly mitigates the SCR, which subsequently has a significant positive effect on organizational performance (e.g., cost performance and operational performance). The findings also show that when environmental dynamism (ED) is high, the relationship between SCF and SCR is stronger and vice versa. Moreover, supply chain risk (SCR) mediates the relationship between supply chain finance (SCF) and organizational performance (OP).</p><p>Hypothesis regarding the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on the paths joining supply chain finance (SCF) and supply chain risk (SCR) was also supported. Supply chain risk (SCR) has a significant negative effect on organizational performance (OP). However, hypothesis regarding the effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on supply chain risk (SCR) was not supported.</p><p>Research limitations/implications-This study has some limitations.</p><p>First, we conducted our research with Chinese organizations. This may result in low generalizability in other contexts. In addition, we employed survey method and cross-sectional data design in this study, which may generate the potential issue of common method bias (CMB). However, the findings of this study will help organizations across China and other emerging economies to adopt SCF as a secure financing mechanism to enhance working capital and mitigate risk.</p><p>In addition, our paper provides some new managerial insights for decision makers in organizations, while exploring different factors such as supply chain finance (SCF), supply chain risk (SCR), and environmental dynamism (ED), and their effect on organizational.</p><p>Originality/value-This study has greatly developed a general SCF adoption model that helps to guide empirical research investigating the critical impact of SCF on firm performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The current economic environment is beset with various challenges, including major competition, uncertainty, and high turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gligor et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brusset, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hazen et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Aslam et al. (2018)</ref> state that firms are increasingly adopting different strategies to remain competitive.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis led to reduction in the concession of new loans to organizations; there were major growth in the interest charged by banks <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010)</ref>. These events were generated by a strong rise in perceived corporate risk, as described by corporate credit ratings.</p><p>Indeed, the post-crisis distribution of corporate credit ratings among the most important rating agencies indicated a significant reduction in the number of non-financial corporations, as well as a growth in ratings <ref type="bibr">(Chava and Purnanandam,2011)</ref>. Moreover, the raised perception of credit risk and higher capital needs conducted by Basel II led to an overall raise in bank risk aversion, and a subsequent restriction of trade finance advantages toward further risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Asmundson et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>As a result, liquidity-scarce organizations tried to compensate for the contraction in financial institutions such as bank lending, by raising access to trade credit, increasing payment terms, reducing settlement terms with customers, and mitigating risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Klapper and Randall, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers proposed that executives often face trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency, where giving priority to one over the other is prejudicial <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Eisenhardt et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Others state that organizations can pursue both flexibility and efficiency by building ambidexterity capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kristal et al.,2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Liu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Blome et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Ojha et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aslam et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Lenders and financial institutions have adopted several financing strategies which help organizations to increase their working capital and achieve the superior operational and financial performance <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2013)</ref>. One of the most critical of these strategies is supply chain finance (SCF), which aims to increase financial flow <ref type="bibr">(Hofmann, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pfohl and Gomm, 2009)</ref> through solutions adopted by financial institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chen and Hu, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lamoureux and Evans, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>SCF can improve organizational performance by facilitating longer payment terms while offering better receivable facilities to their suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Wuttke et al.,2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Tanrisever et al., 2012)</ref> emphasized that firms widely adopt SCF to expand their payment terms in order to increase their working capital. SCF includes a wide range of solutions and strategies <ref type="bibr">(Gelsomino et al., 2016)</ref>, but all share common supply chain characteristics. For instance, the quality of relationships between supply chain players and financial institutions significantly impact the successful adoption of SCF solutions <ref type="bibr">(Wuttke et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, reverse factoring (one of the most critical SCF approaches in which a buyer organization smooths early payment of its trade credit involvements to suppliers) is based on the attribution of buyersupplier relationships to finance a risky supplier <ref type="bibr">(Caniato et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>However, many organizations do not adopt traditional financial credit rating perspectives, and are mainly focused on performance characteristics such as operational performance, operational risk and debt level <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Edwards, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wood, 1981)</ref>. Thus, SCF dramatically impacts business by offering risk-free credit facilities to the supply chain members for smooth operation of supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Basole and Bellamy 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">(Song and Wang 2013)</ref> argued that organizations with a high degree of financial risk urge their managers to employ different financial solutions to grow the firm's working capital.</p><p>Initially, financial institutions such as banks required security to mitigate the risks of granting credit <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Duan and Yang, 2009)</ref>. This affected the productivity of organizations and put pressure on their activities.</p><p>To overcome this situation, practice and research on SCF has improved OP and working capital <ref type="bibr">(Pfohl and Gomm 2009)</ref>. SCF has become a critical scheme for streamlining financial management at organizational level <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gomm, 2010)</ref>. However, little is known about the effects of SCF on OP. More specifically, there are no studies on the effects of SCF on OP (e.g., operational risk and operational performance) and supply chain risk mitigation schemes. To our knowledge, there has been a paucity of literature regarding the role of SCF in untangling OP and supply chain risk.</p><p>To address these research gaps, this paper attempts to investigate the effects of SCF on OP.</p><p>It explores both the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) and the mediating effect of supply chain risk (SCR) in the relationship between SCF and OP. This paper seeks to make four contributions to academic research. This study advances research on SCF by investigating its effects on OP (i.e., operational risk and operational performance). The second contribution of this paper is to recognize SCF as a risk mitigation scheme for an organization. Third, to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies which empirically builds a conceptual model between SCF, supply chain risk (SCR), environmental dynamism (ED), and OP. To the best of our knowledge, less work has been conducted to investigate the moderating effect of ED and the mediating effect of SCR in the relationship between SCF and OP. We tried to address this gap by investigating the moderating effect of ED and the mediating effect of SCR in the relationship between SCF and OP which has not been examined in previous literature. We use the resource-based theory (RBV) of the organization to predict the effects of SCF on OP. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a literature review. Section 3 presents our research methodology.</p><p>Section 4 presents the results. Discussion, implications of the study and future research directions are presented in section 5. Finally, section 6 presents the conclusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Dynamic capability view (DCV)</head><p>The dynamic capability view (DCV) is described as a "high-level practice that, in combination with its execution input flows, lends upon an organization's management a set of decision abilities for generating important outputs of a specific type" <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Winter 2003)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Teece, 2007)</ref>, dynamic capability refers to the capability of an organization to build and redesign its internal and external resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Coyne et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Prahalad and Hamel, 1990)</ref> found that the dynamic capabilities theory is based on the resource-based view <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Barney, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Barney, , 1991) )</ref> and the core competency theory.</p><p>According to the resource-based view, organizational performance is established from the capability and differences in resources an organization holds, which are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and nonsubstitutable <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. The scholar investigated theory of RBV to create a competitive edge for measuring organizational performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Barney, 1991)</ref> proposed that the firms have various types of resources including supply chain finance (SCF), and organization utilizes such resources to secure possible superior performance.</p><p>Hence, SCF is considered valuable resource that can greatly enhance the firm's capabilities and therefore lead toward higher an organizational performance. Previous scholars have employed the dynamic capability to addressing the utilization of the firm's resources for the achievement of higher firm's performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Melville et al., 2004)</ref>. To respond to changing environments, an organization has to build and relocate its different resources and capabilities (SCF) based on its management process and market positions. An organization must have capabilities to implement appropriate strategies required for uncertain, changing environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Liao et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, to ensure great competitive advantage in a dynamic environment, SCF is a critical source of competitiveness and organizational renewal. Further scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Damanpour et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teece et al.,1997)</ref> found that the ability to redesign organizational processes through different resources and capabilities is valuable in dynamic environments in which competitive advantages and positions erode swiftly because of innovations, customer requirements, market context, and legal systems.</p><p>While PrimeRevenue (2016) claims that SCF is the best approach to enhance the firm's working capital and reduce the supply financial risks which in turn, greatly enhance organizational performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hofmann and Belin, 2011)</ref> theoretically investigated the SCF solutions and proposed that SCF may mitigate the potential risk of default and enhance the working capital management and firm performance in dynamic environment (e.g., environmental turbulence). The current literature differentiates between ordinary capabilities (OC and dynamic capabilities (DC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Winter, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Teece, 2012)</ref>. Ordinary capabilities, also known as the resource base of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Pezeshkan et al., 2016)</ref>, are characterized by their in-depth integration into organization patterns to improve the efficiency of its functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Teece, 2012)</ref>; they may involve the adoption of the different practices that are essential to perform activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Teece, 2014)</ref>. The DC, also called higher order capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Teece, 2014)</ref> was implemented by <ref type="bibr">(Teece et al.,1997)</ref> as an expansion of the resource-based view (RBV) to describe the competitive advantage of an organization in turbulent markets and highly dynamic, changing environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Winter, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Teece, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Eckstein et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Teece, 2012)</ref> argued that the DC is organizational ability to generate and establish external resources to overcome changing business environments. Many conceptualizations of DC have been investigated in the literature.</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Teece, 2014)</ref> investigated a conceptualization of DC with three dimensions namely: the sensing capability, the seizing capability and reconfiguring capability. The sensing capability helps the organization to identify new opportunities that can meet customer demands and business opportunities; the seizing capability helps the organization to identify required resources to satisfy customer needs and business opportunities, while reconfiguring capability includes all functions that recombine bundles of resources and ordinary capabilities to innovate and respond to changes in the business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Teece, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Fainshmidt and Frazier, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Wilhelm et al.,2015)</ref> also found three dimensions of DC, sensing capability, learning capability and reconfiguring capability.</p><p>The learning capability plays the role of seizing capability described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Teece, 2014)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Wilhelm et al. ,2015)</ref>, learning capability is the ability to expand opportunities to efficiently face environmental changes. Learning capability is similar to the seizing capability as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Teece ,2014)</ref>. All these capabilities help organizations to increase customer demand and business opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Wu, 2010)</ref> while sustaining and growing by reacting to changes in the new environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Wilden et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Mikalef and Pateli, 2017)</ref>. They also enable organizations to adapt mechanisms to mitigate costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Wilden et al., 2013)</ref>; innovate profit <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Teece, 2007)</ref>; provide themselves new sets of decision choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Wilden et al., 2013)</ref>; and bring new skills, practices, and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Pezeshkan et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, the overall goal is to reach competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Wilden et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000)</ref> found that the expansion of other resources and even their transformation into new sources of competitive advantage, are attributed to DC. DC helps organizations to shape the market in ways that will increase value creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Augier and Teece, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Katkalo et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers claim that the capacity of organizations to sense threats and seize business opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Wilden et al., 2013)</ref>, then rapidly reconfigure their resources to build business value depicts different types of performance among organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Wilden et al., 2013)</ref>. All these previous studies are significant in understanding not only the effects of SCF, but also its impact on OP (cost and operational performance).</p><p>This study proposes that in environmental dynamism (ED) or in a rapidly changing business environment, organization may use its valuable resource such as supply chain finance (SCF) to mitigate supply chain risk (SCR) and achieve competitive advantage. In addition, this study uses supply finance as a required capability in order to gain a sustainable competitive position in environmental dynamism (ED).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Supply chain finance</head><p>The concept of supply chain finance (SCF) was initially used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Stemmler 2002)</ref>, the scholar emphasized that the principle of SCF is to integrate the finance with the supply chain mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Johnson and Templar, 2011)</ref> defined SCF as a critical solution for settling current credit issues by improving the overall financial performance of the organization and minimizing the financial and operational risk of interruption at the supply chain level. SCF can greatly mitigate the total supply chain cost of firms, especially the capital cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Waller et al., 1999)</ref>. Firms can obtain cost reduction advantage through SCF in following aspects. First, firms can lower inventory cost through SCF solutions For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Dong and Xu, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Waller et al., 1999)</ref> found that the vendor-managed inventory method reduces the inventory holding and managing cost of the focal firms. The improved accuracy can further decrease the inventory holding <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dong et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sari, 2007)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Valentini and Zavanella, 2003)</ref> claimed that SCF solutions can mitigate the stock out issues of firms due to the secure of supply chain.</p><p>Second, firms can lower the capital cost by using SCF solutions. Further scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Randall and Theodore Farris, 2009</ref>) also proposed that the cash-to-cash cycle is determined by the arrangements of inventory, account receivables, and account payables.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="bibr">(Wuttke et al., 2013b)</ref> proposed that weak working capital position of firms in supply chain is closely related to the use of SCF solutions for minimizing perceived liquidity risk.</p><p>Moreover, many companies often have limited access to financing opportunities and suffer from high financing interest cost, leading to the potential high cost of final products delivered to customers. Through SCF solutions, firms (the supply chain partners) can build collaboration to greatly improve the cash flow, share the financial risk and lower financing interest cost over the whole supply chain <ref type="bibr">(Berger and Udell,2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Klapper, 2006)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">(Wuttke et al., 2013a)</ref>, firms can minimize operational cost through SCF solutions by reducing the suppliers' cash flow risk, supply chain disruption risk, and transaction costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chen ,2016)</ref> argued that SCF involves both the inventory system and the financial system. Thus, exploring the apparatus of SCF is not just necessary, but major sources of capital are required for enhancing the SC efficiency and improving the SC partners' profitability of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chen, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">(Zhao and Huchzermeier ,2018)</ref> argued that SCF is an event triggered financing solution to perform the organization's operations. SCF is a profit-shifting and risk-shifting strategy in different market environments to enhance OP in financial institutions such as banks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chen ,2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Zhao and Huchzermeier, 2015)</ref> investigated the risk management for enhancing OP by considering the operational and financial management of organizational resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Gronum et al. ,2012)</ref> studied OP in SC networks, and argue that strong-ties enhance OP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Song et al.,2016)</ref> explored the organization SC network influence and SCF, and they found that bridge ties have a significant direct effect on the credit quality of organizations. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Zhu et al.,2017)</ref> developed an organization credit risk framework in the context of SCF and found that this model plays a critical role for financers to access the organization creditability, increase the cash flow, mitigate the risk of whole SC default and make effective credit decisions. Many organizations face a shortage of funds to meet their daily operational requirements, which directly or indirectly influence performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Song et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lekkakos and Serrano, 2016)</ref>. To overcome such difficulties, SCF is a critical and new financial solution provided by financial institutions and financial service providers to organizations, to increase their working capital with lower capital cost and lower risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Lamoureux and Evans, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pfohl and Gomm, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies for instance (Theodore <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Farris and Hutchison, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wuttke et al., 2013a)</ref>, also proposed that SCF solutions can significantly influence the capital cost of firms by minimizing the cash-to-cash cycle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gunasekaran et al. ,2004)</ref> argued that the performance of an organization describes how it patches up the ways for performing operational objectives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Johnson and Hofmann, 2014)</ref> pointed out that SCF is a strategy for shared responses of participants that need integration across the organizations for working capital optimization and OP. The conceptual model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The hypotheses are developed as follows.</p><p>[Add Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Conceptual model here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Supply chain finance, supply chain risk and organization performance</head><p>Traditionally, the inventory and other resources of an organization are financed by financial institutions which increased the risk for an organization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gomm, 2010)</ref> stated that particular threats to a specified asset could not be supposed. Instead, the risk is similar to an overall threat to the organization. SCF has become available in the market to overcome the traditional threat such as supply chain risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Johnson and Templar, 2011)</ref> described SCF as a critical solution to settle existing credit issues by enhancing the financial performance of organizations. As per PrimeRevenue (2016), SCF is the best strategy to increase working capital and minimize the supply chain risk (SCR). <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Song et al. (2016)</ref> used structural equation modelling to establish the relationship between network ties and firm credit concern. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ali et al., 2018)</ref> concluded that SCF adoption factors directly and indirectly improve supply chain effectiveness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Gao and Xing, 2015)</ref> proposed that buyers and suppliers always require credit to run their operations effectively and need risk-free financing solutions to meet their funding requirements, otherwise organizational performance will be affected. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gomm, 2010)</ref> explored cash management and financial structure within the supply chain as SCF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Camerinelli, 2011)</ref> examined SCF as the accumulation of products &amp; services that financial institutions provide to organizations to encourage physical flow and cash flow. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Wang et al. ,2017)</ref> emphasized that information reliability with financial flow greatly decreases the market disruption risk and affects supply chain performance. <ref type="bibr">(Caniato et al., 2016)</ref> developed a framework to improve the flow of financial management by means of SCF. <ref type="bibr">(Gelsomino et al.,2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Chen, 2016)</ref> proposed SCF includes the inventory system with the financial system. The scholars divided the SCF into two groups, trade credit (B2B) and crowdfunding. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chen, 2016)</ref> proposed that SCF is a profit-shifting and risk-shifting strategy for firms in different market contexts to greatly enhance firm performance in the presence of financial institutions such as banks. Further scholars for instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Chakuu et al., 2017)</ref> proposed that SCF is suitable for mitigating the overall supply chain risk (SCR) of firms. <ref type="bibr">(Song et al., 2018)</ref> compared the SCF solutions provided by banks and financial service providers that help organizations to obtain risk-free credit. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ali et al., 2019)</ref> suggested that SCF enhances organizational performance by greatly reducing supply chain risk (SCR).</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hofmann and Belin, 2011)</ref> argued that SCF can be regarded as a way to improve working capital which mitigates SCR and enhances operational performance (OP) of firms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Juttner et al.,2003)</ref> proposed that control of vulnerability (Risk) and mitigation are the main concerns related to the management of supply risk. This is described as the supply risk function to mitigate vulnerability at the firm level. Thus, an effective risk mitigation strategy provides successful decision making to address the unpredicted event of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Sodhi and Tang 2012)</ref>. Variations are being developed with major risks, such as disruption of the whole chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Waters, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Vu-Nguyen et al. ,2017)</ref> argued that adoption of effective vulnerability mitigation schemes improves working capital and mitigates the risk at organizational level.</p><p>A few studies have tended to the alleviation of risks in the supply chain but did not explore mitigation factors regarding different risk types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Eckstein et al.,2015)</ref> emphasized that'' the direct performance impacts are often necessary, but they seem unable of completely catching the involvement of the business fact". Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Sousa and Voss, 2008)</ref> proposed that the performance effects of some supply chain practices depend upon the environmental context. While prior studies clearly state that a turbulent external environment can either improve or disrupt an organization's most critical capabilities <ref type="bibr">(Afuah, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Chen et al. , 2015)</ref> argued that ED is a critical factor in DC theory, which emphasizes that the difference of competitive advantage caused by means of exploitation of organizational capability depends on ED. Environmental dynamism (ED) generates pressure on organizations to employ organizational capability to perform their operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Droge et al., 2004)</ref>. However, other scholars propose that the choices of customers are environmentally dynamic <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Lee &amp; Chu, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Venkatraman &amp; Camillus, 1984)</ref> argued that organizations must build a close link between the products/services they provide and customers' needs in order to keep market position. Organizations with a high level of ED behave positively in sensing business opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Lee &amp; Chu, 2013)</ref>. Earlier research employed the framework of agency theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Eisenhardt, 1989)</ref> in managing SCF to mitigate SCR, which subsequently enhances OP. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Eisenhardt, 1989)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Zsidisin and Ellram ,2003)</ref> stated that agency theory is related to the study of issues that occur when one member, the main, gives the task to another member. <ref type="bibr">(Eisenhard, 1989)</ref> proposed that buffer-oriented issues are derived from mitigation approaches while behavior-oriented issues are derived from mechanisms by which organizations focus on task-related functions towards mitigation of risks.</p><p>Hence, this study is conducted to examine the effect of SCF on OP (e.g., cost performance and operational performance). It also provides a new concept of SCF as a risk mitigation scheme at organizational level. Therefore, we predicted the following hypotheses.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Supply chain finance significantly and positively reduces supply chain risk Hypothesis 2: Supply chain finance greatly and positively impacts organizational performance Hypothesis 3: Supply chain risk significantly and negatively impacts organizational performance Hypothesis 4: Supply chain risk significantly mediates the relationship between supply chain finance and organizational performance 2.4. Moderating role of environmental dynamism Environmental dynamism (ED) refers to the volatility and unpredictability of organization's external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Miller and Friesen, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schilke, 2014a)</ref>. ED is a critical component in the DC theory <ref type="bibr">(Schilke, 2014a)</ref>, which emphasizes that the impact of DC on organizational performance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Chen et al., 2015)</ref> and other supply chain characteristics like SCF and SCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Boyle et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gligor et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rojo et al., 2018)</ref> depends on the degree of dynamism of the organization's external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Levinthal ,2000)</ref> suggested that the advantages of DC rely on the existence of underlying organizational practices, but also on the circumstances in which capabilities are used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000)</ref> proposed that in moderately dynamic markets, organizations usually pursue foreseeable ways. Thus, great DC in moderately dynamic environments relies on exploiting current knowledge. However, variations in high-change markets are usually nonlinear and less foreseeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alexander et al., 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">(Afuah, 2001)</ref>, environmental dynamism (ED) can influence supply chain finance (SCF) and supply chain risk (SCR).</p><p>Therefore, we can hypothesize:</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Environmental dynamism significantly and positively influences supply chain risk Hypothesis 6: Environmental dynamism significantly moderates the relationship between supply chain finance and supply chain risk.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sampling and data collection</head><p>To test our research hypotheses, we employed a survey approach to collect data from randomly selected companies and their supply chains in mainland China.</p><p>To obtain a representative sample, we employed the Yellow Pages of China Telecom in each of the five mainland China cities and the executives of the Chinese Supply chain Association as our sampling pool. This method is adequate for studies that test hypotheses, develop measurement scales, or establish theoretical research frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Lee and Shim, 2007)</ref>. For each randomly selected organization, we identified a key informant, who typically had a title such as supply chain managers who were in charge of the company's internal and external processes. We targeted these executives as they are mostly knowledgeable about organizational issues and their application in other business functions.</p><p>Moreover, we designed our questionnaire by adopting relevant measures from extensive literature.</p><p>We measured the items of our study using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Since we conducted our study in the Chinese context, we followed the technique of double translation as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Brislin, 1980)</ref>. We then used the classic translation-transcription method to translate the English questionnaire into the Chinese questionnaire.</p><p>We employed this method to support the reliability and validity of the scales, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Douglas and Craig, 2007)</ref>. Five Chinese researchers with expertise in SCM revised the main questionnaire and made their recommendations. The revised Chinese questionnaire items were then pilot tested. We interviewed 30 potential respondents to make sure that the measures are understandable in the Chinese context. To increase our response rate, we contacted three Chinese scholars to make further phone calls to help the data collection process. After merging the surveys of managers, there were only 210 usable responses, which represent a response rate of 13.69%.</p><p>Although we collected data using double-respondent matching, we also investigated common method bias, employing Harman's one-factor test <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The results indicated that 5 factors were extracted with adequate values greater than 1.0, representing about 73.04% of the variance, and the first cause represented 16.60% of the variance.</p><p>We then assessed the common method bias by comparing the fit between the one-factor model and the measurement model. The one-factor model indicated a weak fit (χ2(df)= 2551.71(268)), and was inferior to (p &lt; 0.01) the fit of measurement model ((χ2(df)=511.7( <ref type="formula">241</ref>)). Accordingly, common method bias was not a major issue in our study. Given the potential non-response bias, we compared both the early and late pools of our study as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Armstrong &amp; Overton, 1977)</ref>.</p><p>The pattern was then split into two groups (early 25% and late 25%). Both groups indicated no significant dissimilarity in organization size, organization age and total assets. Therefore, the outcomes revealed that non-response bias was not a significant issue in our study.

The scale of SCF was taken from the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Zhang, 2015)</ref> who measured this scale with four items (α =0.874). The scale of SCR was adopted from the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Juttner and Ziegenbein, 2009)</ref> who used seven items (α =0.891). The scale of OP was taken from the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kotabe, (1990)</ref> who used three items (α=0.943).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Measurement model</head><p>In this study, we employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity of measures as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and Appendix. The reliability of the measures was well explored. Composite reliability (CR) test explores internal consistency and reliability of latent constructs. The CR threshold is 0.70 or higher. Values between 0.60 and 0.70 are recommended in exploratory research and between 0.70 and 0.90 in other types of research; values below 0.6 are considered lacking reliability <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>[Add Table2 Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis here] Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> shows that each construct fulfilled the recommended value and that all constructs have reliability.</p><p>Cronbach's alpha is a common test for internal reliability of latent constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bryman and Bell, 2011)</ref> and recommended to be higher than 0.70 <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Urbach and Ahlemann, 2010)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Discriminant validity</head><p>Performing discriminant validity is a building block of model evaluation as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. Discriminant validity ensures the originality of a measuring construct and shows that the phenomenon of interest is not captured in other measures (latent variables) within the research model <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hair et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, this study employs both Fornell-Larcker and heterotrait monotrait ratio (HTMT) criteria for discriminant validity assessment.</p><p>The second criterion for discriminant validity assessment, HTMT, is usually applied for performing discriminant validity in PLS-SEM. Literature on PLS-SEM emphasizes that many researchers mainly employ the Fornell-Larcker criterion and cross-loadings for discriminant validity assessment in variancebased SEM. The standard criterion (i.e. Fornell-Larcker criterion) for discriminant validity assessment necessitates the square root of AVE to be significant than the correlation of the construct with all other constructs in the structural model.</p><p>The factor relationships between a pair of latent variables should be less than the square root of AVE of each variable as indicated in Fornell Larcker Criterion (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>) through factor correlation matrix. The measure of the validity suggests the square root of AVE shown in bold fonts across the diagonal of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> for each variable is always significant than the correlation value for any pair of variables. Thus, we greatly achieved discriminant validity, still heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio has to be tested because <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Garson, 2016)</ref> reported the short comings of Fornell-Larcker criterion analysis and was also supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>[Add Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> Fornell-Larcker here] Since a well-fitting model requires heterotrait correlations should be smaller than monotrait correlations, meaning that the HTMT ratio should be below 1.0.The proposed ideal value of HTMT ration should be below 0.90 as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. HTMT value close to 1 shows lack of discriminant validity; yet, some scholars for instance <ref type="bibr">(Henseler et al., 2015, p. 129)</ref> propose a conservative value of 0.85 for HTMT and a broader value of 0.90. According to this recommendation, if HTMT values are below 0.85, discriminant validity is not a critical issue. For t-statistics of the outer model, we used bootstrapping method having 5000 subsamples. The Bootstrap outcome approximates the normality of data as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Wong 2013</ref>). In the bootstrapping calculation, for two tailed test having significance level of 0.05, this study proposes that all the path coefficients are significant as all the values are above 1.96 <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Wong 2013)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref> indicates that HTMT values satisfy even the more conservative criterion, as all the values are below 0.85. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Linear regression model and hypotheses testing</head><p>To test the effects of supply chain finance on organizational performance (e.g. operational risk and operational performance), we run linear regression analysis by using PLS-SEM analysis.</p><p>The linear regressions results show that predictor has different impacts on organizational performance.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> shows the results of two linear regressions for organizational performance variables such as operational risk and operational performance in Model 1 and Model 2.</p><p>The goodness-of-fit Chi-square values are 86.245 and 96.298 for operational risk and operational performance, respectively. The test results show that all two models are significant, and organizations in some industries are more likely to use SCF to greatly reduce operational risk and enhance operational performance. In line with our hypotheses, <ref type="bibr">SCF (β=0.29,</ref><ref type="bibr">t=3.813,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;0</ref>.01: Model 1) positively and greatly reduces operational risk, therefore (H1 accepted). In Model 2 SCF (β=0.23,t=2.410, p&lt;0.01) significantly and positively enhances operational performance, therefore (H2 accepted).</p><p>Similarly, SCR (β=-0.36,t=1.280, p&lt;0.01) strongly and negatively influences operational performance, therefore, (H3 accepted). To confirm whether supply chain risk (SCR) mediates the relationship between supply chain finance (SCF) and organizational performance (OP), the indirect effect was tested by using the bias-corrected bootstrap-ping (1000 times iterations) approach as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Hayes and Preacher, 2010)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> shows the result of mediation analysis that indirect effect of supply chain finance (Indirect effect= .128) on organizational performance through supply chain risk was greatly mediated, thus confirming that (H4 is accepted). Therefore, this result proves that supply chain finance significantly mitigates the supply chain risk which, subsequently, improves the organizational performance. Moreover, the results of coefficients in both Model 1 and Model 2 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref> show that environmental dynamism (β=0.03,t=1.120, p=0.30) marginally and negatively influences organizational performance, therefore (H5 rejected). Moreover, we tested the moderating effect of environmental dynamism in the relationship between supply chain finance and supply chain risk by employing the product-term approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Cohen and Cohen, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with our hypothesis of moderation, the results show that environmental dynamism significantly moderates the direct relationship between supply chain finance and supply chain risk.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">6</ref>, the interaction between supply chain finance and environmental dynamism is greatly and positively related to supply chain risk (β=0.19, t=4.338, p&lt;0.01), therefore, (H6 accepted). In this study, we further considered t-test, measure of the coefficients of Pearson's determination (R 2 ), size of the effect (f 2 ) or Cohen's Indicator, predictive Validity (Q 2 ) or Stone-Geisser indicator and interpretations of path coefficients. The current study also determined the prediction accuracy of the model by using the variance portion (value of R 2 /Squared multiple correlations). Findings predict that supply chain finance accounted 38% variance in supply chain risk and 25% variance is accounted by all predictors of the research in criterion constructs (i.e. organizational performance) (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>, R 2 =2% is classified as having a small effect, R 2 =13% as a medium effect, and R 2 =26% as having a large effect. To get the Q2 value, blindfolding test was made by using smart-PLS and it was found to be above zero for all the values, while the Cohen's Indicator (f 2 ) obtained through the blindfold process. Following <ref type="bibr">Cohan's (1988)</ref> guideline which suggests that f 2 values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 are interpreted as small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively, it can be emphasize that in general, the exogenous variables have medium to large f 2 and q 2 effect sizes on the endogenous variables (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>). Therefore, we propose that our hypothesized model is reliable.</p><p>[Add </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we investigate the impact of supply chain finance on two types of organizational performance (e.g. operational risk and operational performance). We found that most of our hypotheses were greatly accepted; our findings and significance are discussed as follows.</p><p>First, our results show that supply chain finance is a critical driver of organizational performance (e.g. operational risk and operational performance). Thus, when we compare our findings with those from previous research on supply chain finance <ref type="bibr">(Hofmann, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gelsomino et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhao and Huchzermeier, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Johnson and Hofmann, 2014)</ref>, our ressults show that one of the goals for supply chain finance adopters is to resolve their operational risk and operational performance issues.</p><p>The outcomes suggest that supply chain executives are more likely to use supply chain finance if they feel pressures from insufficient organizational performance. This finding is consistent with prior literature that claims that supply chain finance is a reliable strategy to greatly enhance the firm's working capital and reduce the supply financial risk which, therefore, improve organizational performance (PrimeRevenue,2016).</p><p>In addition, our finding is in line with the prior study of <ref type="bibr">(Talluri et al.,2013)</ref>. The scholars proposed that supply chain finance is as a critical predictor of risk mitigation in the supply chain. Therefore, our study empirically identified supply chain finance as an effective risk mitigation scheme which supports supply chain managers to minimize their risk level in order to continue their operations in more effective way.</p><p>Second, we identify consistent results regarding the negative impact of supply chain risk on organizational performance (e.g. operational risk and operational performance).</p><p>Companies with a high level of supply chain risk potentially face operational risk issues, which raised the risk for an organization. As proposed by <ref type="bibr">(Christopher and Peck, 2004)</ref>, defined risk issue as a presentation of genuine unsettling impacts emerging from supply chain risks. This finding is consistent with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Juttner, Peck, and Christopher, 2003)</ref>, they found that control of risk and mitigation are the main concerns related to the management of supply risk which is defined as the supply risk assessment to mitigate risk issue in the whole supply chain.</p><p>These findings also greatly complement the study of <ref type="bibr">(Hoeing and Thun, 2009)</ref>, they systematically offered a viewpoint about specific risk-involved in the supply chain. Thus, it is interesting to find that supply chain risk significantly and negatively affects organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Sodhi and Tang 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Last, our findings show that in environmental dynamism, organization may use its valuable resource to reduce supply chain risk and achieve competitive advantage.</p><p>Moreover, the results show that environmental dynamism significantly moderates the relationship between supply chain finance and supply chain risk. This finding is in line with the previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Barney, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Liao et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schilke, 2014a)</ref>. Those scholars claimed that to respond to changing environments, an organization must have capabilities to adopt more effective strategies required for changing environments Therefore, to ensure a high competitive advantage in a dynamic environment, organizations use supply chain finance as a critical source of competitiveness and performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Theoretical implications</head><p>This study makes several contributions to theory. First, this paper contributes to the literature of risk mitigation strategies by identifying the supply chain finance as a significant risk minimization strategy for companies, and expands the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kurniawan et al., 2017)</ref> on risk mitigation strategies.</p><p>Second, our paper is one of the first attempts to offer large sample empirical examination of the impact of supply chain finance on organizational performance in emerging economies.</p><p>We not only identify the current status of the impact of supply chain finance on firm performance in China, but also identify the benefits and outcomes of SCF. We fill the research gap and respond to the future call of supply chain finance, its obstacles and influence on firm performance suggested the previous literature by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Chakuu et al.,2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gelsomino et al.,2016)</ref>.</p><p>We address this issue by conducting statistical analyses based on reliable data to test the overemphasis on conceptual modeling work in the field of supply chain management. Last, this research greatly contributes to supply chain management literature, including different operational factors such as operational risk and operational performance through SCF decisions.</p><p>In addition, we enrich the understanding of the relationship between supply chain management and financial management. Our empirical investigation significantly expands analytical study on the relationships between operational decisions and financial decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Protopappa-Sieke and Seifert, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, our findings propose that SCF offers great opportunity to both key members of the supply chain to minimize the overall firm risks and improve their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Managerial implications</head><p>From a practical perspective, this paper provides some relevant and significant managerial implications for practitioners, executives and organizations. First, our findings will help practitioners or executives to mitigate their organizations' risk by employing risk mitigation strategies, specifically SCF, to improve liquidity and working capital of their organizations. Second, the findings can be used to help the decision-making process in coordinating goods, capital, and information along the supply chain.</p><p>Finance executives should closely work with supply chain managers to mitigate supply chain cost by emphasizing on the integrated management of financial flows along their companies. It is necessary for supply chain managers to know about the risk types involved in the supply chains. Second, our findings imply that the insufficiency of firm performance can drive supply chain executives to make SCF adoption decisions. On the other hand, different factor such as operational risk and operational performance can significantly influence managers' decisions in supply chain finance. Last, this study provides a supportive decision making to SC managers while gaining a better understanding of the SCF, and firm performance, their benefits, and their potential obstacles. Therefore, supply chain managers may focus on the critical role of supply chain finance if they consider a high performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations and future research</head><p>Although the aim of the research has been greatly achieved by investigating the critical role of supply chain finance, but there are a few limitations, our sample is relatively limited and the study remains exploratory. First, our empirical research is based on data collected from companies and their supply chains in mainland China. The context may limit the generalizability of our results.</p><p>Further research can test our proposed model employing data collect from other counties or developed economies. In addition, further research can broaden their scope by collecting data from all supply chain partners connecting suppliers, companies and customers.</p><p>Second, only the impact of supply chain finance on performance is considered in our proposed model.</p><p>Other critical factors such as drivers, enablers, or even obstacles of supply chain finance adoption should be investigated in further research.</p><p>Third, we only consider operational risk and operational performance in general as the challenges and benefits of organizational performance. Other specific factors such as supply chain cost reduction could be investigated in future research and more significant findings are expected.</p><p>Due to the practice-based and exploratory nature of our study, further investigation needs more theoretical understanding of the impact of SCF models and confirmation of the knowledge derived from analytical models. A potential direction is to consider the influence of moderators and understand the boundaries of theories in SCF research. Fourth, although this study provides some reliable findings about the relationship between SCF and firm performance in China, it is not clear whether these relationships will be the same in other countries. Future study should investigate cross-cultural differences in the relationship between SCF and performance. In particular, studies which compare the impact of SCF on firm performance in developed versus developing economies will be more significant. Last, we essentially employ cross-sectional data to test the relationships, which are limited in inferring causal relationship. It will be fruitful for future research to investigate and develop experiments or even employ longitudinal data to test the causal relationships among our main variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This study proposes that supply chain finance is an effective solution for organizations in recent economic downturn and financial crisis. It is imperative for supply chain managers to understand the advantages of adopting supply chain finance and make rational supply chain finance decisions.</p><p>In addition, we propose a supply chain finance model to investigate its impact on organizational decisions and the performance implications. Supply chain finance is an increasingly critical area of research, as supply chains become more widely dispersed across the globe. This study addresses some key roles in supply chain finance, as well as raising a number of critical research questions that remain to be resolved. Therefore, our empirical findings offer significant insights to both academics and practitioners.</p></div>
