<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The financial management of a business is an integral part of strategic management. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are vulnerable to the presence of crisis events in the business environment. In this context, senior managers and owners need to react promptly to emerging changes in a given business segment. The aim of the article is to quantify the effect of crisis events in business and firm's CSR implementation in business on the financial performance in the SMEs. The empirical research incorporated 1,090 SMEs in the business environment of four Central European countries. The research hypotheses were evaluated using structural equation modelling. The empirical findings confirmed the positive impact of CSR implementation in the enterprise on its financial management. The research results did not confirm the negative effects of crisis events in business on the financial management. Crisis phenomena have direct effects on the sustainability of the enterprise; the organizational activities of the enterprise; the functioning of the enterprise in the market and the management of the enterprise. The findings are used as a basis for the preparation of strategic projects of national and international policies helping to cope with crisis phenomena in the business environment of the SME segment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The role of SMEs in sense of productivity measured by gross domestic product, improvement in innovation and also in social and environmental issues is indisputable <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Karadag, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartolacci et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gupta &amp; Gregoriu, 2018)</ref>. The influence of SMEs on environment from the environmental and social view is overwhelming <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Johnson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Civelek et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ključnikov et al., 2021)</ref>. The strategic role of SMEs requires them to follow and support decisions made by larger companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kriemadis et al., 2022)</ref>. At the same time, it should be emphasized that SMEs also face many other challenges and issues, including the lack of effective financial management <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Karadag, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barłożewski &amp; Trąpczyński, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Małkowska &amp; Uhruska, 2022)</ref>. Pressing environmental and social issues related to business performance, such as rising energy and raw material prices, elimination of waste and harmful substances in production processes, excessive resource consumption, environmental degradation, ensuring health and safety in the workplace, etc., pose both major challenges and significant opportunities for business <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Johnson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jones &amp; de Zubielqui, 2017)</ref>. These factors force also SMEs to react and to incorporate not only economic but also environmental and social responsibility practices in their business practices, which increase their competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(León-Gómez et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine have affected most industries and businesses. This is a different situation unlike the recession at the end of the 21st century, which affected the financial sector in particular. In light of these new developments and given the underestimation of systematic risk, the implementation and operation of a holistic entrepreneurial risk management in SMEs is of the importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Syrová &amp; Špička, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot of constraints for SMEs, but it has also created new opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Suder et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zadeh, 2022)</ref>. To cope with the new opportunities and constraints, SMEs are trying to use their ingenuity and strategy. Growth-oriented SMEs can use competitive mindsets such as flexibility, speed and innovation to identify and exploit opportunities arising from the crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Purnomo et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Korsgaard et al. (2020)</ref> sees the crisis as an opportunity to rethink the role of entrepreneurship as an essential component of efforts to build resilient, especially local, economies.</p><p>The above-mentioned crises and the overall challenges of the contemporary world related to environmental and societal changes necessarily affect SMEs and their financial performance. In this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Torugsa et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rao et al. (2023)</ref> enhance that for a sustainable long-term financial performance SMEs must implement CSR in its all three dimensions, the economic, social and environmental. They must monitor CSR practices to identify potential opportunities for collaboration with suppliers and customers and the sustainability of their business. Sustainability of business practices is therefore a prerequisite for the survival of SMEs and their growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Looser &amp; Wehrmeyer, 2016)</ref>. The positive effects of CSR on competitiveness and financial performance are described also by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lopez-Perez et al. (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartolacci et al. (2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amankwah-Amoah et al. (2021)</ref> warn that ignoring extreme environmental shocks and the impacts of global crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, can accelerate business failures and corporate bankruptcies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Johnson and Schaltegger (2016)</ref> note that environmental and social sustainability must be operationalized in everyday life of a firm.</p><p>The aim of using sustainability management tools is to support managers and entrepreneurs in finding ways to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of their business, and to use the positive impacts to remain competitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Johnson &amp; Schaltegger, 2016)</ref>. However, SMEs are often discouraged from implementing CSR due to problems such as too bureaucratic, expensive, time-consuming and complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gelbmann, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to the position of SMEs in the business environment, the desire to remain competitive, to maintain a sustainable business while respecting CSR, the immediate as well as mediated impact of crisis events, all these are facts that in their effect raise a number of questions related to both the implementation of CSR elements and the impact on the financial performance of SMEs, but also the question of the impact of awareness of the existence and consequences of crisis events on the financial performance of SMEs. Concluded, this research bridges this knowledge gap by addressing the following two research questions:</p><p>RQ1: Does owner's/manager's perception of CSR implementation in the SME have a positive effect on the financial performance of SME? RQ2: Does owner's/manager's perception of the crisis events in business have a negative effect on the financial performance of SME? Through answering these questions, this research produces results that can be used by individual SMEs to improve their financial performance facing crisis events or implementing CSR. It also can be useful for policy makers to find ways how to help SMEs during crisis or how to support them when trying to be environmentally and socially responsible.</p><p>The structure of the article is as follows. The introduction is followed by a critical look at outlining the need for effective financial management, the implementation of CSR and the need for awareness of the impact of crisis events on the lives of SMEs. The following section features a methodology, a summary of the findings and a discussion of the associated implications. Finally, the last part focuses on summary, implications and the potential future research interests.</p><p>In the introduction, context of the research should be established, the purpose and/or hypothesis that was investigated should be stated. The information on previous research on the subject can be included either in Introduction, or in the following section. Also, the main idea, importance, novelty, etc. can be indicated in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Theoretical background</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bawono et al. (2022)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Gupta and Gregoriu (2018)</ref> include financial management of SMEs, in particular the availability of the necessary amount of capital due to factors such as insufficient collateral, poor creditworthiness, short/no credit history, underdeveloped bank-borrower relationships, high transaction costs, and information asymmetry among the key problem areas they face, which cannot be separated from their sustainable development.</p><p>It is supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Illmeyer et al. (2017)</ref> who state that the role of financial management and controlling is indisputable for SMEʼs overall performance. Bad decisions regarding the capital sources, their allocation and bad risk assessment can have major impacts on SMEs financial performance (e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ključnikov et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hoque, 2017)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Sardo et al. (2022)</ref> SMEs exposed to a high risk of financial distress increase the ratio of external resourc-es in the capital structure by seeking to raise additional short-term debt more quickly and by further increasing financial risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">McGuinness and Hogan (2016)</ref> state that financially "vulnerable" SMEs with less liquidity, high reliance on short-term bank loans and higher levels of intangible assets tend to focus on trade credit financing in times of crisis.</p><p>Financial risk is considered to be one of the key risks in the SMEs business. The availability of capital for financing the SMEs business is one of the most common manifestation of their financial risk. The consequences can then manifest themselves in the form of rising operating costs, increasing debt, problems with repayment of liabilities and resulting in even higher financial risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Ślusarczyk &amp; Grondys, 2019)</ref>. As a result, a high level of financial risk can lead to the bankruptcy of the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kljucnikov et al., 2018)</ref>. Financial risk is indisputably considered to be one of the key SMEs risks and it is connected with exposure to a variety of external and internal factors of a financial nature (funding risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and currency risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Belás et al., 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agostino et al. (2012)</ref>, this risk increases significantly when SMEs borrow from one main bank and do not diversify their debt across multiple banks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rao et al. (2023)</ref> enhances the need to concentrate the focus rather on long-term performance of SMEs for their survival and growth. Compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hoque (2017)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mazzarol (2014)</ref> who state that for financial management of SMEs short-term cash flow management, more precisely the cash conversion cycle, is crucial. It can protect them from liquidity problems and help them to run the business effectively. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Sardo and Serrasqueiro (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Karas and Režňáková (2021)</ref> add that, in view of the high volatility of sales, liquidity and cash that SMEs face, SMEs are trying to apply a conservative working capital management strategy in their operational management in order to avoid defaulting on creditors. In order to increase the efficiency, working capital management strategies also recommend the use of long-term external resources on favourable terms.</p><p>However, except for the capital structure and working capital management strategy, there are different factors influencing the financial performance. In this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartolacci et al. (2020)</ref> as well as Gallardo-Vázquez and Lizcano-Álvarez (2020) enhance enhances CSR of SMEs to be a very important factor positively influencing SME's performance and competitiveness, compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kriemadis et al. (2022)</ref> who enhance total quality management implementation as an important factor for good financial performance. Quality-oriented SMEs showed to be much more financially sustainable compared to those with no total quality management orientation, especially in the two financial measures such as solvency and efficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Syrová and Špička (2022)</ref> searched the financial performance of SMEs related to enterprise risk management (ERM) and found that this relation was fully and positively influenced by organizational culture (mission dimension) and strategic risk management performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Karadag (2017)</ref> considers education level of SMEs owner/managers to be a strong and positively influencing factor of financial performance. He also searched company age that seems to have an important meaning for SMEs older than five years. It supports the importance of having experienced owner/managers for the company and its financial growth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rao et al. (2023)</ref> also highlight the role of the owner/manager as critical in overcoming obstacles such as limited access to finance, workforce skills and digitalization, promoting financial growth and managing crisis. Compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mayr et al. (2017)</ref> who suggest strategic relocation of the company's operations to be important to overcome economic crisis and to achieve sustainable turnover. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bawono et al. (2022)</ref> note that SMEs lack the resources and knowledge to use technology to help them increase efficiency in their production processes, conduct further analysis and measure their performance. They operate in socialized and networking environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Colovic et al., 2019)</ref>. However, improving the performance of SMEs is not always solved by obtaining resources in the form of loans. SMEs must be able to manage and use these resources effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bawono et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The problems of today's global world accompanied by climate change, soil, water and air pollution, and ecosystem change are affecting SMEs on both the cause and effect side, forcing them to seek new ways of production and consumption in order to achieve a sustainable business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bartolacci et al., 2020)</ref>. The dynamic environment puts pressure on SMEs to be able to act promptly and appropriately to market pressures and meet changing customer demands in the face of increasing competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Illmeyer et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is now considered a key part of business. Most companies therefore issue CSR reports to highlight their contribution to society in financial, environmental and social terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hosoda, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balcerzak et al., 2023)</ref>. Due to the fact of incorporating CSR practices into the global business operations of large enterprises, there is a risk that smaller enterprises as their suppliers could run into problems in trying to meet their CSR requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Perry &amp; Towers, 2009)</ref> and realize their need to engage in CSR practices.</p><p>The goal of CSR implementation is for businesses to generate profits with minimal environmental and social damage, thereby contributing to social improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Metzker &amp; Zvarikova, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Coppa &amp; Sriramesh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Balcerzak &amp; MacGregor Pelikánová, 2020)</ref>. CSR implementation can reduce labour turnover, attract better quality workers and increase productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Perry &amp; Towers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Annan-Diab &amp; Jensen, 2017)</ref>. In the same time it can help to improve employer brand and value proposition based on CSR principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Samoliuk et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>SMEs need to effectively incorporate both CSR and their ethical values into their corporate policies to ensure long-term sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lee-Wong &amp; More, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Liu et al., 2020)</ref>. Once customers perceive that SMEs behave in an economically, socially and environmentally responsible manner, they tend to trust them, and this trust strengthens the firm's position in the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Liu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Vo et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">León-Gómez et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the differences related to the size, industry and others, firms realize the necessary need to legitimize their activities using the CSR practices to stay competitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lopez-Perez et al., 2017)</ref>. Implementing CSR in the strategy of SMEs can help them to increase their competitive advantage, which can contribute to their overall sustainability, but only if they adopt a dynamic approach to CSR compatible with their strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gelbmann, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Torugsa et al. (2013)</ref>, it highlights the need for a proactive approach to CSR, which entails business strategies and practices that firms voluntarily adopt that go beyond regulatory requirements in order to manage social responsibilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Grimstad et al. (2020)</ref> show that firms' intrinsic motivation, e. g. voluntary engagement through free will without coercion, drives CSR more than extrinsic motivation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Zastempowski and Cyfert (2021)</ref> suggest that the implementation of the CSR increases the possibility and ability to introduce innovations. It can motivate SMEs managers to implement CSR in their business and to be interested in socially responsible projects and may help reduce the risks associated with implementing product and process innovations.</p><p>León-Gómez et al. ( <ref type="formula">2022</ref>) confirm it suggesting that innovation positively influences the link between CSR and performance. They interestingly notice that there is a pressure from customers on SMEs to create new products and services, hence the pressure on their innovation and notice this relationship between CSR represented by customers' requirements and firms' innovation. Similar findings are obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Oliinyk et al. (2023)</ref> with emphasis on the positive influence of social responsibility in the institutional environment of business on the innovativeness and performance of SMEs.</p><p>CSR implementation is significantly influenced by SMEs' specifics in comparison with big corporations such as the amount of resources available, strategies, drivers, importance of managerial values, level of involvement and stakeholder prioritization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Coppa &amp; Sriramesh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rosińska-Bukowska, 2022)</ref>. Baumann-Pauly et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) suggest that SMEs should not be viewed worse in comparison with large firms in implementing CSR. However, due to SMEs specifics and problems such as lack of financial and human sources, the CSR implementation in SMEs can be seen more complicated in comparison with their large counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Perry &amp; Towers, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>When implementing CSR activities there are several factors that it is needed to be taken into account. These are especially managers' perception, attitude, and behaviour. E. g. <ref type="bibr">Çera et al. (2022)</ref> found that female entrepreneurs and managers were more likely to agree with CSR concept than male and owners. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lee et al. (2016)</ref> found a heavy dependence of CSR on the owner´s personal value and initiative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Colovic et al. (2019)</ref> suggest that the motivation by SMEs values and beliefs, relationships with local community, regulations and business motives are important for adopting and implementing CSR.</p><p>SMEs often implement CSR practices without formalising it in their strategies or benefiting from it <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gelbmann, 2010)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Coppa and Sriramesh (2013)</ref> found the Italian SMEs practiced CSR rather in an informal way than in a systematic strategic conception and they do not use CSR as a strategic tool. Inside relationships and towards the customers and suppliers are managed rather informally and are based on personal networks. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nielsen and Thomsen (2009)</ref> note that it is primarily unsystematic, informal and is based especially on personal relation. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lee-Wong and More (2016)</ref> adds that despite an informal way of involving CSR practices into SMEs strategy, it should be perceived by their stakeholders. To strengthen the perception of SMEs informal practices Lee-Wong and More (2016) recommend to focus on the strengthening of internal communication in relation to the external environment and support it by updating the website and using social media. <ref type="bibr">Lee at al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nielsen and Thomsen (2009)</ref> also note that communication of CSR activities in SMEs is insufficient and must be reconsidered facing challenges of the global economy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Park et al. (2017)</ref> emphasises that appropriate formulation and communication of CSR practices within a company and its wide acceptance leads to a higher probability of achieving better corporate performance. In this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hetze (2016)</ref> enhances that a CSR report can influence the CSR reputation positively only when it is evaluated to be credible. To strengthen internal communication, it is important for companies to provide more opportunities for employees to communicate their ideas, feelings and strengthen employee involvement in CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lee-Wong &amp; More, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hur et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Coppa and Sriramesh (2013)</ref> consider employees to be the most important stakeholders for CSR. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lee et al. (2016)</ref> adds that when communicating CSR activities there are often problems related to the lack of sources or insufficient managerial skills. However, before planning future CSR activities, it is also important to evaluate past ones for feedback.</p><p>There is a criticism that "CSR in business" makes social responsibility conditional on making a profit, thereby limiting the scope of CSR activities that can be done profitably <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Looser &amp; Wehrmeyer, 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data collection and questionnaire</head><p>The data collection was carried out in four Central European countries (V4 countries: Czech Republic; Slovak Republic, Poland, Hungary). The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the subjective perception of selected factors (financial management of SME (FMS), corporate social responsibility (CSR) and crisis events in business (CEB)) in the SME segment in the business environment in Central Europe. The questionnaire could only be completed by the owner or top manager of a SME (less than 250 employees; respondent). Data collection was conducted between December 2022 and January 2023. Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI Research Method) was used with the support of an external agency. The main criterion for the selection of the respondent pool was to ensure stratified even selection of respondents by enterprise size in comparison with the percentage of enterprises in the business environment at the national level.</p><p>The questionnaire was completed by 1,103 respondents -26 (2.3%) of respondents did not give consent for their views to be published in scientific publications. These respondents were excluded from the statistical evaluation. The sample size consisted of 1,090 SMEs. As a result of the sample size analysis, the sample of SMEs must contain a minimum of 664 respondents (confidence level -99%; estimated proportion -50%). The sample of SMEs (n = 1,090) exceeds the minimum number of respondents by more than 1.5 times.</p><p>The respondent had to answer all the questions in the questionnaire. A Likert scale (5-point scale; e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Belas et al., 2023)</ref> was applied to determine the respondent's attitudes towards the selected statements (1 -strongly agree, ..., 5 -strongly disagree). Questionnaire structure: demographic questions on the enterprise; demographic questions on the respondent; respondent's attitudes on the defined statements. The questionnaire was designed in the national language of the respondent. The questionnaire included a control question to check the consistency of the respondent's answers. The statements were generated randomly when the respondent filled in the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Variables definition and their descriptive analysis</head><p>The questionnaire included the following statements. SMEs' financial management (FMS): FMS1: There is enough profit for our business. FMS2: The company has a sufficient amount of debt (not a high share of debt). FMS3: I am capable of handling our company's financial risks effectively. FMS4: Our business has no issues with obligations that can be paid (insolvency).</p><p>CSR: Corporate Social Responsibility CSR1: In our company, the idea of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is significant. CSR2: The future of SMEs will benefit from the use of the CSR idea. CSR3: CSR aides in the discovery of new business associates. CSR4: CSR has a beneficial effect on a company's financial performance.</p><p>Business crisis events (CEB) CEB1: The COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and its effects have not altered my opinion on the company's sustainability. CEB2: The administration of the corporation was not greatly impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. CEB3: The crisis between Russia and Ukraine has no detrimental effects on how our company operates in the market. CEB4: The crisis between Russia and Ukraine has no adverse effects on how our company's activities are organized. Uncertainty is not currently the primary issue facing Businesses, according to CEB5. The results of descriptive characteristics (skewness and kurtosis) of items confirmed, that the variables have the multivariate normality distribution (each value of S and K are less than critical ratio for variance). The highest level of agreement is for the FMS statement among respondents (M = 2.161) and the lowest level of agreement is for the CEB statement among respondents (M = 2.716). The least variability in ratings is among respondents in perceptions of the CSR factor (SD = 0.957) and conversely, the greatest heterogeneity in ratings is among respondents in perceptions of CEB (SD = 1.205).</p></div>

In the first step, the assumption of multiple normal distribution of the defined variables (items, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) was verified with the application of selected descriptive characteristics (skewness, kurtosis). In the second step, factor analysis (EFA, CFA) was applied to verify the reliability and validity of the questionnaire (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>If the values of the selected characteristics are higher than critical ratio (CRA) (Cronbach's Alpha (CA -CRA = 0.7); Corrected Item-Total Correlation (CITC -CRA = 0.5); Composite Reliability (CR -CRA = 0.7); Average Variance Extracted (AVE -CRA = 0.5); Factor Loading (FL); Communalities (COM -CRA = 0.5); Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (BTS; p-value less than level of significance); Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test (KMO -CRA = 0.5); e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>, then the relationships between claims and factors are accepted.

Our proposed factor Crisis Events in Business (CEB) was divided into two factors based on the results of factor analysis (CFA, EFA), which can be characterized as follows: CEBe -the effect of CEB on the owner/manager (perception of the sustainability of the business; the owner/manager's management of the business); CEBs -owner/manager's attitudes towards strategic management of the business in the context of crisis phenomena.</p><p>The validation of the significance of the final model is subject to Table <ref type="table">5</ref> with the following parameters: number of distinct sample moments = 91; number of distinct parameters to be estimated = 28; DF = 63; Chi-square = 116.18; Sig. = 0.000.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The research led to the finding that the implementation of CSR in SMEs as well as the presence of crisis phenomena in business (CEBe, CEBs) are factors that determine the financial management of SMEs. The relatively stronger positive relationship between CSR implementation and financial performance of SMEs (PC = 0.43) found in the research supports the acceptance of hypothesis H1. It also supports the understanding of CSR as an inherent and key component of contemporary business that positively affects the financial performance of SMEs and their competitiveness, thus confirming the views of Hosoda (2020); <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bartolacci et al. (2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Luo et al. (2022)</ref> concluded that proactive CSR in all three components (social, environmental and economic) has a positive impact on the financial performance of SMEs and their sustainable development. As this relationship is influenced by the attitude of SME owners/managers, the ideas of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Karadag (2017)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rao et al. (2023)</ref> highlighting the need for representation of experienced owners/managers for good financial performance, not only short-term but more importantly long-term performance and healthy financial growth of SMEs are thus supported. The positive effects of CSR implementation on the financial performance of SMEs in an overall perspective, in a more detailed definition, can lead to lower employee turnover, bring more skilled and loyal employees to the firm, and increase labour productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Perry &amp; Towers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Annan-Diab &amp; Jensen, 2017)</ref>, which, however, requires that CSR objectives are well articulated, further communicated and, above all, widely accepted in SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Park et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hetze, 2016)</ref>. Managers should consider and implement appropriate ability, motivation, and opportunity policies for employees because it increases SME performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Sánchez-Marín et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Chaudhary (2017)</ref> state that the implementation of CSR in SMEs is significantly linked to the positive attitude of employees and their work commitment. SME entrepreneurs who take a positive approach to CSR implementation, consider people as the company's core capital. They take a more optimistic approach to assessing the personnel risks and error rates of their employees and also better evaluate their efforts to improve their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rozsa et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Given the close interdependence of the CSR concept and business sustainability, Hypothesis 1 is supported by the findings of a very strong positive effect of the owner's or top manager's perception of business sustainability and the management of the business itself on the financial performance of the business (PC = 0.88). This confirms the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lee-Wong and More (2016)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Liu et al. (2020)</ref> on the need to implement CSR including ethical values in corporate policies to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Liu et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">León-Gómez et al. (2022)</ref> explain as a consequence of higher business credibility perceived by customers and, as a result, the strengthening of market position. Similarly, the views of Gelbmann (2010); <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Torugsa et al. (2013)</ref> are confirmed, who emphasize the need to implement CSR to ensure business sustainability and long-term competitiveness in the market.</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Valdez-Juárez et al. (2021)</ref> sees CSR as one of the two business strategies currently being adopted to maintain and increase the competitiveness of SMEs. They consider entrepreneurial orientation (EO) as the other key business strategy that has a significant impact on CSR as well as on the business performance of SMEs. Conversely, they consider CSR as a mediating variable between EO and business performance. It confirms that SMEs im-plementing EO and CSR can lead them to permanently adopt sustainable business practices and improve their business performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Uzhegova et al. (2019)</ref> found CSR to be the mediate factor of the relationship between network competence and competitive performance.</p><p>The role of the owner or the top manager, based on the proven strong positive effect of their management attitudes on the financial management of the company, is crucial not only in the implementation of CSR, but also in the context of managing crisis phenomena in business. In addition to supporting the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Karadag (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rao et al. (2023)</ref>, these findings are also supported by the findings of <ref type="bibr">Cera et al. (2022)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lee et al. (2016)</ref>, who agree that initiative, personal values, attitude, behaviour, perceptions of owners/managers are important factors in CSR implementation and crisis management and should be taken into account.</p><p>On the other hand, the attitudes of owners/managers to the actual crisis phenomena in the business in the context of strategic management (CEBs) proved to be a factor that positively influences financial management, but to a relatively lesser extent (PC = 0.19). Thus, these findings do not support e. g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Herbane (2019)</ref>, who finds it necessary to include policy settings for coping with and responding to unexpected sudden crises in the fundamental strategic long-term direction of corporate policies. Thus, the role of managers/owners appears to be crucial in managing crisis situations rather than viewing them in the context of SMEs' strategic development.</p><p>Other research findings did not lead to confirmation of Hypothesis 2. Crisis phenomena in business were not perceived negatively in relation to their impact on the financial management of SMEs. Thus, we cannot confirm the views of authors such as <ref type="bibr">Syrová and</ref><ref type="bibr">Špička (2022, 2023)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rao et al. (2023)</ref>, who, given the high vulnerability of SMEs seen mainly in the context of their specificities such as lack of necessary capital, skilled workforce, lack of digitalization, see crisis events as a high risk and perceive them rather negatively in relation to performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> add to these factors the need to respect the stage of the business, McGuinness and Hogan (2016) additionally highlight the financial position of SMEs when entering a crisis.</p><p>Failure to confirm Hypothesis 2 leads to support for views that see new opportunities rather than threats in crisis situations. This supports, for example, the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Saunders et al. (2014)</ref> who see crises as crucial in the process of business change, according to Miklian and Hoelscher (2022) using the right contacts as a business opportunity, similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Korsgaard et al. (2020)</ref> as an opportunity to rethink the role of entrepreneurship with an emphasis on strengthening local economies.</p><p>Concluded, the research findings showed that financial management is determined by the implementation of CSR as well as the existence of crisis phenomena, while the implementation of CSR and its application in the daily life of SMEs has a relatively significant positive impact on financial management. The implementation of CSR is also an important factor of sustainable business ensuring competitiveness through the perception of SMEs as a trustworthy, conscious market entity that sees its business not only in the context of economic sustainability but also in the broader context of socially and environmentally sustainable development.</p><p>The undeniable role of owners/managers in CSR implementation cannot be overlooked as well as the significantly related factors of motivation for implementation CSR. Overall, the motivations for implementing CSR in SMEs encompass both intrinsic factors such as values, beliefs, and societal contribution, as well as extrinsic factors such as economic incentives, brand reputation, and customer differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grimstad et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Colovic et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fjortoft et al. (2020)</ref> found that the type of motivation can be differentiated according to which part of CSR it supports. While intrinsic motivation is relatively strongly associated with the social component associated with interest groups such as employees and stakeholders, extrinsic motivation tends to be limited to the environmental component and suppliers.</p><p>In the context of keeping pace with technological developments and the dynamic approach typical of today's global world, it is appropriate to highlight the importance of innovation for business sustainability and the link to CSR.

The results of the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ruiz-Palomo et al. (2022)</ref> for innovation in SMEs show the following important facts. First, that financing barriers have a negative impact on innovation in business, which is reflected in technological innovation as well as management innovation. Furthermore, the fact that women are represented in the management of SMEs, has a very positive effect on innovative output regardless of the business sector, age or size of the SMEs, confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Tran et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The aim of the article was to quantify the effect of the crisis events and firm's CSR implementation in business on the financial management in the small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>The research findings suggest that the implementation of CSR activities, as well as the presence of crisis phenomena in business (such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict) have a significant impact on the financial management of SMEs. On the one hand, the implementation of CSR positively determines the financial management of the enterprise, on the other hand, what is quite surprising, the negative direct effects of the presence of crisis phenomena in the business environment on the current financial management have not been confirmed. From the perspective of the common "wisdom" and dominating empirical research this last factor is especially interesting. As a result, findings of the study suggest that the important gain to positive financial performance of SMEs is related to implementation of CSR. In the same time, the additional direct empirical novelty of the current research relates to the fact that negative effect of crisis events in business environment on the financial performance was not confirmed in the Visegrad countries, which can indicate the improving economic resilience of SMEs sector in the region, and its relatively good adjustment to operating in turbulent environment. This factor can be considered as an important confirmation of growing microeconomic competitive potential of the analysed countries.</p><p>The results of the research present significant practical findings for the SMEs themselves. Research findings can support their competitiveness and extend managerial knowledge of CSR including barriers and benefits associated with its implementation. Identifying the positive impact of CSR on the financial performance of SMEs should encourage owners and senior managers to develop CSR competencies. The study has also policy implications regarding the desirability of support for socially responsible SMEs from national and international organizations that are engaged in supporting the SME segment in the business environment of Central Europe. Investment support is a key prerequisite for the implementation of measures to contribute to meeting the energy and climate objectives. These measures are often economically recoverable only in long term, which is far beyond the investment capacity of SMEs. Therefore, it is important to ensure sufficient appropriate financing instruments and to set the systematic and legislative conditions at the same time. Therefore, the findings can serve as a basis for various national and international institutions to increase support (e.g. financial assistance) to SMEs. The findings can also serve to improve the quality of upcoming documents (or projects) and activities to support start-ups and the education of owners and senior managers.</p><p>The research was carried out in four Central European countries that are very close to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Data collection was carried out using the CAWI methodology based on the subjective views of owners or top managers of SMEs. The data collection was carried out at a time of increasing cost of living for businesses (energy, inflation) and uncertainty associated with the unpredictable development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p><p>In the next phase, the authors' research activities will focus on the verification of the obtained results on another sample of respondents from the V4 countries. Also, the deepening of knowledge between the application and implementation of CSR activities, crisis phenomena in business in relation to the sustainability of SMEs in the business environment will be investigated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
