<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Although obesity and physical activity influence psychosocial well-being, these effects may vary based on race, gender, and their intersection. Using 6-year follow-up data of a nationally representative sample of adults over age of 50 in the United States, this study aimed to explore race by gender differences in additive effects of sustained high body mass index (BMI) and physical activity on sustained depressive symptoms (CES-D) and self-rated health (SRH).</p><p>Methods: Data came from waves 7, 8, and 10 (2004-2010)  of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing national cohort started in 1992. The study enrolled a representative sample of Americans (n = 19,280) over the age of 50. Latent factors were used to calculate sustained high BMI and physical activity (predictors) and sustained poor SRH and high depressive symptoms (outcomes) based on measurements in 2004,  2006, and 2010. Age, education, and income were confounders. Multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the additive effects of BMI and physical activity on depressive symptoms and SRH, where the groups were defined based on race by gender.</p><p>Results: Group differences were apparent in the direction and significance of the association between sustained high BMI and depressive symptoms. The association between sustained high BMI and depressive symptoms was positive and significant for White women (B = 0.03, p = 0.007) and non-significant for White men (B = -0.03, p = 0.062), Black men (B = -0.02, p = 0.564) and Black women (B = 0.03, p = 0.110). No group differences were found in the paths from sustained physical activity to depressive symptoms, or from physical activity or BMI to SRH.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Sustained high BMI and high depressive symptoms after age 50 are positively associated only for White women. As the association between sustained health problems such as depression and obesity are not universal across race and gender groups, clinical and public health interventions and programs that simultaneously target multiple health problems may have differential effects across race by gender groups.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Increasing prevalence of obesity in the United States has become a significant public health concern (Office of Disease <ref type="bibr">Prevention and Health Promotion, 2014)</ref>. Although, research has consistently shown that obesity impacts psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Wynne et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Global BMIMC, 2016)</ref>, a growing body of evidence suggests that psychosocial correlates of obesity may depend on race <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kodjebacheva et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Murphy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kelley et al., 2016)</ref>, gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Assari and Caldwell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kodjebacheva et al., 2015)</ref>, and their intersection <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Assari and Lankarani, 2015a)</ref>. Whether race by gender groups differ in the link between sustained obesity and psychosocial distress is still unknown.</p><p>Research has suggested that culture may alter the link between physical and emotional problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Miyamoto et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Park et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Curhan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kitayama et al., 2015)</ref>. Compared to East Asians, negative emotions more strongly predict poor physical and mental health in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Curhan et al., 2014)</ref>. Even after controlling for sociodemographic variables, negative emotions elicit higher rates of inflammatory biomarkers in American adults than in Japanese counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Miyamoto et al., 2013)</ref>. It has been suggested that culture may moderate the association between expression of anger and biological health risk. For instance, Americans may have a higher biological health risk due to anger traits compared to the Japanese <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Park et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kitayama et al., 2015)</ref>. Similar differences have been found between Blacks and Whites <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Johnson, 1989)</ref>. In a series of studies, Assari has shown that depressive symptoms and negative affect better predict subsequent change in physical health outcomes such as chronic medical conditions and mortality for Whites than Blacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Assari and Burgard, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Assari et al., 2015b</ref><ref type="bibr">Assari et al., , 2016a,b;,b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Assari and Lankarani, 2016b)</ref>.</p><p>Despite a disproportionately higher level of stress, chronic disease, and low socioeconomic status associated with their minority status <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Williams, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Franks et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gold et al., 2006)</ref>, Blacks seem to have a higher chance of thriving despite all their environmental adversities, as evidenced by better mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Teti et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Ward et al., 2014)</ref>. Continuous exposure to adversities may have resulted in a systematic resilience for Blacks that help them maintain psychological well-being, even in the presence of new difficulties. Stress has also shown weaker effects on depression among Black men, compared to White men, which is consistent with such resilience <ref type="bibr">(Assari and Lankarani, 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>Body dissatisfaction and perceived unattractiveness to others is a mechanism behind the comorbidity between high Body Mass Index (BMI) and negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Jackson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Webb et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ehlinger and Blashill, 2016)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bandura, 1986)</ref>. The Social Ecological Framework also suggests that individuals' behaviors and emotions are shaped by their social interactions and environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ley et al., 2015)</ref>. Although, high BMI influences body image perception and body dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Altintas et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Coy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Das and Evans, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Stephen and Perera, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Webb et al., 2014a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Laus et al., 2015)</ref>, there is a wealth of literature suggesting that these associations depend on gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Altintas et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Coy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Laus et al., 2015)</ref>, race and ethnicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Mikolajczyk et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Richmond et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chithambo and Huey, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Thomas et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fletcher, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gitau et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Pope et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sabik, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Blostein et al., 2016)</ref>, and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Altintas et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Pope et al., 2014)</ref>.

(2016c)</ref>, latent factors can be used to model sustained health problems over time, and their correlates. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), in this study we investigated the links between sustained BMI, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and self-rated health over time, using multiple measures. In contrast to many studies in the literature that are typically cross-sectional or focused on the effect of baseline risk factor on subsequent trajectories, this statistical approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kendler and Gardner, 2016)</ref> allows for model associations between sustained health issues over time (please see our Methods section for more details about this approach and latent variables).</p><p>Despite the well-established links between multiple health problems such as BMI, SRH, physical activity, and depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Okosun et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Stunkard et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Jokela et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Romo-Perez et al., 2016)</ref>, little is known about race by gender differences in the links between sustained health problems over time. The current study aimed to test if sustained high depressive symptoms and poor SRH similarly reflect sustained high BMI and physical inactivity in Black men and women and White men and women, using a nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults over age of 50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Setting</head><p>Data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), from the time period of 2004-2010, were used to study the effect of sustained BMI and physical activity on depressive symptoms and SRH <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Assari et al., 2016c)</ref>. The HRS is a longitudinal cohort study of a representative sample of American adults over the age of 50 that began in 1992. Further detailed information regarding the HRS can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Heeringa and Connor, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Sampling</head><p>HRS participants were born between the years 1931 and 1941, inclusive. The HRS used a national area probability sample of United States households. The time period of 2004-2010 consisted of individuals in the HRS waves 7, 8, and 10. In the current study, we included individuals who considered their race to be White or Caucasian and Black or African American. At baseline (1992), there was a total sample size of 19,280 participants: 6705 White men (34.8%), 8860 White women (46.0%), 1468 Black men (7.6%), and 2247 Black women (11.7%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>Data were collected from participants using standard questionnaires and telephone or face-to-face interviews. Proxy interviews were used in situations in which participants were unable to respond for themselves. In addition to collecting extensive data on demographic, social, economic, and health information, the participants and their spouses were interviewed every two years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Body Mass Index Body mass index was measured using participants' self-reported height (measured in feet and inches) and weight (measured in pounds). Height and weight were converted to meters and kilograms respectively, and BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. The use of selfreported height and weight in the calculation of BMI has been validated <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Stewart, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Spencer et al., 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vigorous Physical Activity</head><p>Physical activity was measured by asking participants the following item regarding their participation in exercise: "On average over the last 12 months have you participated in vigorous activity or exercise three times a week or more? By vigorous physical activity, we mean things like sports, heavy housework, or a job that involves physical labor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(He and Baker, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jenkins et al., 2008)</ref>" Responses included 3 or more times a week, 1 or 2 times a week, 1 to 3 times a month, less than once a month, or never. Higher score reflects more sustained vigorous physical activity. A single-item self-reported physical activity measure has shown reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Milton et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depressive Symptoms</head><p>Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). The CES-D scale is a self-report scale used to measure current level of depressive symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Radloff, 1977)</ref>. A modified eightitem version of the CES-D scale was used for waves 7, 8, and 10 of the HRS; participants were given a CES-D score, with a higher score indicating more depressive symptomatology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Rated Health</head><p>Self-rated health was reported by asking respondents whether their health was excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. SRH was dichotomized into two categories of poor/fair vs. good/very good/excellent <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Stenholm et al., 2014)</ref>. Research has demonstrated that there is a strong association between poor SRH and increased risk of mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Idler and Angel, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Idler and Benyamini, 1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Latent Factors</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sustained Health Problems</head><p>For each health variable (BMI, SRH, physical activity, and depressive symptoms), we created a latent variable indicating vulnerability or a sustained health problem, using three observations in <ref type="bibr">2004, 2006, and 2010</ref> as measured indicators for a latent variable. To estimate stability of each variable, the loadings were tested across time points. The latent variables were conceptualized as indicators for stably high level of health problem(s) over the follow up period. That is, higher scores of our latent variable were indicative of more sustained health problems over 6 years, which can be potentially seen as longterm vulnerability. For instance, the path from BMI to depressive symptoms reflects the effect of sustained high BMI on sustained high depressive symptoms over a 6-year period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Note</head><p>Univariate and bivariate analyses were done in SPSS 20.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY). Bivariate associations were tested using Pearson's correlation and paired samples t-test. We used AMOS 18.0 for multivariable analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alessi, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arbuckle, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for multivariable data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. In the first step, we fitted model with no constraining of paths across the groups. In the next step, we released constraints and compared the fit with that of the previous model. We also tested models where the error variances for corresponding pretest and posttest measures were correlated. As the fit did not improve in the second model, we reported the model with released constraints. In our models, we performed multi-group SEM analysis where the group was defined based on race by gender. We compared the path coefficients between the groups for statistically significant difference.</p><p>Independent variables included physical activity and BMI. The dependent variables of interest were CES-D and SRH. Covariates used in the model were age, education, and income. Latent factors were used for the independent and dependent variables by assessing the data at three cross-sectional time points <ref type="bibr">(2004,</ref><ref type="bibr">2006,</ref><ref type="bibr">2010)</ref> during the study. Paths were drawn from the covariates to the dependent variables and from the independent variables to the dependent variables.</p><p>Fit statistics included were Chi square, the comparative fit index (CFI) [&gt;0.90], the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) [&lt;0.06], and X2 to degrees of freedom ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hu and Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lei and Lomax, 2005)</ref>. Unstandardized and standardized regression coefficients were reported. We implemented full information maximum likelihood (FIML) to account for missing data. We considered p less than 0.05 as significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Univariate Analysis</head><p>Table 1 lists the descriptive statistics for all of the variables included in the study for the pooled sample as well as based on race and gender. As shown in the table, White men had consistently more sustained physical activity than White women and Black men and women. Additionally, Black women had the highest sustained BMI across race and gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bivariate Analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> presents the correlation matrix of the study variables in the pooled sample. BMI and CES-D showed positive but weak correlation at all three time points with p&lt;0.01 and r ranging from 0.072 to 0.098. BMI and SRH were also positively correlated at all time points with p &lt; 0.01 and r ranging from 0.123 to 0.170.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multivariable Analysis</head><p>Our SEM showed good fit [p &lt; 0.001, CMIN = 1606.146, DF = 256, CMIN/DF = 6.274, CFI = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.012 (90% CI = 0.011-0.012)]. Loadings for our independent and dependent variables are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. For sustained high BMI, loadings ranged from 0.76 to 1.00. Loadings ranged from 0.71 to 0.78 for sustained high depressive symptoms. The range of loadings for sustained poor SRH was 0.74 to 0.83. Loadings for sustained high physical inactivity ranged from 0.55 to 0.69.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> also displays the two primary paths of interest in the current study; (1) the association between sustained high level of BMI and high depressive symptoms, and (2) the association between sustained high level of BMI and sustained poor SRH. There were group differences in the association between sustained BMI and CES-D. The association was significant and positive for White women (B = 0.03, p = 0.007), negative and non-significant for White men (B = -0.03, p = 0.062), negative and non-significant among Black men (B = -0.02, p = 0.564) and positive and non-significant among Black women (B = 0.03, p = 0.110). The association between sustained BMI and SRH were universal with no considerable group differences.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> also displays the secondary paths of interest, which include the association between sustained physical activity and CES-D and the association between sustained physical activity and SRH. These paths were systematic and demonstrated no group differences (all p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, the three covariates included in the SEM were age, education, and income. For Black men, age was protective for SRH (B = -0.10, p = 0.007). For all other groups, age was a risk factor, with B ranging from 0.04 to 0.09. The effect of age on CES-D was systematic (p &lt; 0.0001, B ranging from -0.23 to -0.05) and showed no group differences. Income and education were consistently protective for CES-D and SRH.</p><p>Figures 1A-D illustrate the Structural Equation Model (SEM) for race by gender group. For example, in each of the four figures, the primary paths of interest are exhibited using arrows from sustained BMI to CES-D and sustained high BMI to sustained poor SRH. The secondary paths of interest were from sustained physical inactivity to sustained high depressive symptoms and sustained physical activity to sustained poor SRH. The path from BMI to CES-D was positive and significant for White women, marginal and negative for White men, and nonsignificant for Black women (positive) and Black men (negative). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The current study used a nationally representative sample of Americans older than 50 to assess whether sustained high levels of depressive symptoms and poor SRH universally reflect sustained high BMI and physical inactivity across race by gender groups. The results suggest that sustained high BMI had a positive and significant association with sustained high level of depressive symptoms in White women but not in White men, Black men, and Black women. The effect of sustained physical activity on sustained high level of depressive symptoms and SRH, as well as the effect of sustained BMI on sustained poor SRH, were, however, universal and similar across race by gender groups. These findings suggest that demographic factors, environment, or cultural characteristics may influence how sustained obesity and depressive symptoms are associated <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Park et al., 2013)</ref>. Previous cross-sectional <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gavin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hicken et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Assari, 2014a,c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Assari and Caldwell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kodjebacheva et al., 2015)</ref> and longitudinal <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hawkins et al., 2015)</ref> research had shown that the link between obesity and depressive symptoms depends on the intersection of race and gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Assari, 2014b)</ref>. The way in which physical activity shapes our perceived health is, however, universal. If an individual is active, he or she will feel healthy and less depressed, irrespective of group membership. Similarly, an individual with high BMI will feel less healthy regardless of group. For sustained obesity and depressive symptoms, comorbidity is not universal.</p><p>These findings coincide with the results of other studies on the differential effects of the association between obesity and major depressive disorder by race and gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gavin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hicken et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Assari, 2014a,b,c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Assari and Caldwell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hawkins et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kodjebacheva et al., 2015)</ref>. The results of this study in Black men and women are in agreement with a number of studies examining the "Jolly Fat" hypothesis, which supports that higher body mass index and obesity in women is associated with less depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jasienska et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kim et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Yu et al., 2011)</ref>. This hypothesis is also demonstrated among adolescent girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Revah-Levy et al., 2011)</ref> as well as adult and elderly populations in Asian countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Li et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kim et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Yu et al., 2011)</ref>. The "Jolly Fat" hypothesis was also reflected among aging Asian men <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Li et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Han et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dong et al., 2013)</ref>. One study found that the desire to be of smaller size was not as great for Blacks compared to Whites, and Black women tended to feel that their size was considered satisfactory by their significant others <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kemper et al., 1994)</ref>. Black women have more positive attitudes toward obesity and less internalized stigmatization <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Latner et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Culture may influence cognitive and emotional elements that are essential for the perception of obesity and associated weight management behaviors <ref type="bibr">(Assari and Lankarani, 2015a,b)</ref>. One study found that urban, obese Black men who felt healthy or had fewer comorbid conditions had a greater misperception of healthy weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Godino et al., 2010)</ref>. Another study reported that about half of young African-American men with normal BMI desired to be heavier, while approximately 60% of overweight men were satisfied or wished to be heavier <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gilliard et al., 2007)</ref>. The absence of strong negative social pressure combined with a positive body image perception among Black women <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kumanyika et al., 1993)</ref> and the desire of Black men to be of larger size <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Jackson et al., 2010)</ref> contribute to a sustained higher BMI in this population. In addition, James Jackson has hypothesized that compared to Whites, Blacks engaged in unhealthy behaviors to cope with stressors of living in chronically stressful environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Jackson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mezuk et al., 2013)</ref>. Over the life course, Black men demonstrate increased rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use, while Black women respond by overeating <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Jackson et al., 2010)</ref>. However, in the current study, there were no gender by race differences.  Much of the literature concerning the effects of life's adversities on Blacks document the disadvantages and weaknesses but hardly the strengths that have resulted in this population. Examples include forms of "double jeopardy" for Blacks in health and healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Kirby and Kaneda, 2013)</ref> and academic learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Taylor and Walton, 2011)</ref>, the adverse effects of racism and discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Williams, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chae et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gibbons et al., 2012)</ref>, and the cumulative negative effects of multiple disadvantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Zemore et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pais, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Umberson et al., 2014)</ref>. However, Teti et al. found that Black men who tackled challenges such as racism, incarceration, and unemployment demonstrated resilience amid these stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Teti et al., 2012)</ref>. It has also been found that Black women exhibited resilience in spite of traumatic experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Henderson et al., 2015)</ref> and in order to cope with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Ward et al., 2014)</ref>. It is this resilience among Blacks that allows this population to thrive and remain optimistic, thus resulting in better mental health outcomes than their counterparts. However, the resilience that this population demonstrates is not specific to the measures in the current study, but rather a resilience that is displayed across a variety of risk factors and outcomes. It is a systemic resilience as a result of the life course, and it reflects the contextual factors of one's life. James Jackson developed the Law of Small Effects, an explanation that suggests that physical and mental health disparities are effects of accumulated small differences through the life course as Blacks age <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Jackson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Brown et al., 2014)</ref>. Because the Law of Small Effects indicates that there is no single cause of health disparities but rather an accumulation of a variety of factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Jackson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Brown et al., 2014)</ref>, we propose that interventions will influence Blacks with smaller effects than Whites, thus the Law of Small Effects.</p><p>Corey Keyes hypothesizes a "Black advantage" in mental health, possibly due to flourishing in the presence of adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Keyes, 2007)</ref>, to explain Blacks' lower rates of common mental disorders and a greater mental resilience despite adversities, stress, discrimination, and other risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Keyes, 2009)</ref>. Across all age cohorts, family satisfaction and contact with friends were found to be the most important contributing factors of general life satisfaction for Blacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams and Jackson, 2000)</ref>. Black-White differences may be due to culture, which shapes resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Keyes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Teti et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Ward et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Henderson et al., 2015)</ref>, body image and perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Altintas et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Coy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Das and Evans, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Stephen and Perera, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Webb et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Laus et al., 2015)</ref>, and social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams and Jackson, 2000)</ref>, all influencing mental health. Culture is a powerful influence on health outcomes as described by <ref type="bibr">Kitayama et al.</ref> in the cultural moderation hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Park et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>There are public health implications for the results of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Leon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Assari et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Krishna et al., 2015)</ref>. Although, Black men and women with sustained high BMI do not report high depressive symptoms, there should still exist efforts to reduce the sustained high levels of BMI among Black men and women, similar to Whites. In order to reduce burden of obesity, we need multidisciplinary approaches that address the context, culture, and environment of populations that may be allowed higher body mass without stigma. Active involvement, partnership and communication with Black communities is vital to better understand cultural factors that may operate as barriers for obesity prevention in subpopulations.</p><p>Clinical and public health interventions that target healthy BMI may have differential effects on comorbid health outcomes for Blacks compared to Whites. Tailoring according to group membership may influence the association between high BMI and mental health needs. Therefore, universal interventions may not be ideal for diverse populations, as Whites and Blacks with high BMI have different patterns of comorbidities. To maximize benefits, interventions and programs may be tailored to race and gender to match that of the target population. One study that implemented a weight loss intervention among Black women reported that those with the greatest fat mass loss improved insulin sensitivity while those with fat mass gain, which was common, had reduced insulin sensitivity following the 6month program <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Leon et al., 2014)</ref>. These results demonstrate that additional support may be beneficial for Black women in weight loss programs who fail to achieve optimal weight loss goals.</p><p>This study is subject to a few limitations. Attrition is a concern in longitudinal cohort studies. Loss to follow-up may have led to missing data that may skew the results. Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight and height for BMI calculation. Although, research finds that this measure is valid, self-reported data is still subject to bias and under/overestimation. Also, the use of the single-item physical activity measure may fail to capture participants' true physical activity levels. Lastly, the unbalanced sample size resulted in different statistical power across groups. The current study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature as it is one of the first studies on sustained health risk over time. A nationally representative sample, large sample size, length of follow up, and the intersectional approach are key strengths in the current study. This study used an innovative statistical approach introduced by Kendler <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kendler and Gardner, 2016)</ref>. Further research should be done on risk factors and outcomes associated with sustained health issues over time.</p><p>In conclusion, how sustained high level of BMI and sustained depressive symptoms are associated varies across race by gender groups. Sustained high depressive symptoms better reflect sustained high BMI level for White women than White men, Black men, or Black women. The association between sustained BMI and depressed affect is not uniform, but specific to the race by gender intersection. Clinical and public health interventions and programs that are tailored to the target populations may be more effective.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Structural Equation Model (SEM) based on race by gender.
