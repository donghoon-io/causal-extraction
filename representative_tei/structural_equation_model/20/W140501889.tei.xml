<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Businesses should strive to identify and nurture internal organisational factors that cultivate a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. This paper scrutinizes the contribution of the internal organisational factors, measured by market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction, to intrapreneurship, as measured by the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI). Information from a sample of 333 managers explores the relationships of corporate entrepreneurship with different work variables by means of Product-Moment Correlation, Multiple Regression Analyses and Structural Equation Modelling. Structural Equation Modelling confirms that four of the corporate entrepreneurship factors were predicted reasonably well by means of the market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction sub-scales. The article attempts to fill the research gap of identifying which market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction factors play an important role in facilitating corporate entrepreneurial actions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Continuous economic environmental changes force businesses to nurture their entrepreneurial environment in order to secure global competitiveness, growth and survival. There is a continuous need for research that identifies the factors that contribute to the development and growth of entrepreneurial ventures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bolton &amp; Lane, 2012)</ref>. Organisations should proactively identify and strategically align internal factors that could increase corporate entrepreneurial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett, Balloun &amp; Weinstein, 2012)</ref>. Dramatic global economic forces pressurise businesses to be vigilant of threats and to act swiftly operationally <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kuratko, 2011)</ref>. Businesses therefore have to continually re-examine their market orientation strategies and adapt flexible policies in serving different stakeholders. Managers and business leaders have a huge responsibility to establish and maintain corporations, sustain their functional success <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Heil, Maxwell &amp; Whittaker, 2003)</ref> and maintain organisational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fontannaz &amp; Oosthuizen, 2007)</ref>. However, business leaders often fail to identify the factors that lead to business performance and strategise accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Business growth strongly depends on corporate entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr">(Antoncic &amp; Antoncic, 2011a)</ref>. The cultivation of entrepreneurship, the driving force in established organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(O'Connor &amp; Yamin, 2011)</ref> plays an important role in organizational progress and performance <ref type="bibr">(Antoncic &amp; Antoncic, 2011b)</ref> and in sustaining a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kuratko, 2009)</ref>. Corporate entrepreneurial processes are necessary for continuous renewal and innovative processes to secure higher levels of efficiency and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lee, Peris-Ortiz &amp; Fernández-Guerrero, 2011)</ref>. Entrepreneurial regeneration therefore is imperative, especially seen in the light of the world economic deterioration and increased unemployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Van Wyk &amp; Adonisi, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Corporate entrepreneurship is however not an isolated factor that contributes to business innovation, but it is the result of the collective efforts of members of an organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst, Comeche, &amp; Galindo, 2009)</ref>. The three key leadership factors that play an important role in the maintenance of corporate entrepreneurship, are firstly management style and orientation, secondly taking proactive action and thirdly, engaging in innovative behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Goosen, De Coning &amp; Smit, 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Goosen, De Coning &amp; Smit, 2002b)</ref>. These factors significantly contribute to the financial performance of a firm <ref type="bibr">(Goosen et al., 2002a)</ref>. Entrepreneurial leadership is provided through a visionary approach and by making appropriate structures available for the facilitation and implementation of new ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Visser, de Coning &amp; Smit, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The deliberate design of corporate entrepreneurial antecedents does not always deliver the desired outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goodale, Kuratko, Hornsby &amp; Covin, 2011)</ref>. The context in which a business operates can either advance or limit the entrepreneurial actions in a business <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Welter &amp; Smallbone, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, management should use a variety of complementary mechanisms to facilitate intrapreneurial prospects in an organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goodale et al., 2011)</ref>. An awareness of environmental changes and an accurate response, is critical to the survival of companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jafari, Rezaeenour, Mazdeh &amp; Hooshmandi, 2011)</ref>. Business leaders should understand, and better still, anticipate how these changes transform the entrepreneurial landscape in which they operate. Management should furthermore promote corporate entrepreneurial activities and create an ideal work environment through open communication networking, supported by resource management practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Castrogiovanni, Urbano &amp;Loras, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The essence of corporate entrepreneurship is the creation of an environment that fosters corporate thinking and behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Antoncic &amp; Hisrich, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Goosen et al., 2002a)</ref>. A number of theories on corporate entrepreneurship agree on the importance of the facilitation of intrapreneurship and its influence on corporate performance and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hornsby, Naffziger, Kuratko &amp; Montagno, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morris &amp; Kuratko, 2002)</ref>. Businesses should pay as much attention to internal organizational strategies in cultivating a creative culture as they do to external economic, consumer and competitive factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett et al., 2012)</ref>. Key concepts that have shown to contribute to a creative climate of business performance are corporate entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barrett &amp; Weinstein, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barrett et al., 2012)</ref>, market orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barrett, Balloun &amp; Weinstein, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barrett et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jaworski &amp; Kohli, 1996)</ref>, organisational flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barrett &amp; Weinstein, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barrett et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barrett et al., 2012)</ref> and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Jaworski &amp; Kohli, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Van Wyk &amp; Adonisi, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In practice, corporate entrepreneurship needs to be supported by a pro-active market orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barrett &amp; Weinstein, 1997)</ref> and flexible management practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bhardwaj, Sushil &amp; Momaya, 2007)</ref>. The symbiotic relationship that exists between entrepreneurship and marketing activities allows businesses to be proactive and innovative <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barrett et al., 2009)</ref>. Furthermore, entrepreneurship and flexibility complement each other in maintaining a competitive advantage and creating superior value in a global economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Rundh, 2011)</ref>, as it aids businesses in being proactive in dynamic competitive environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Miles &amp; Darroch, 2006)</ref>, and in turbulent markets and variable conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bhattacharya &amp; Giapponi, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hitt, Ireland, Camp &amp; Sexton, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Oke, 2005)</ref>. In addition, job satisfaction plays an important role in the relationships among corporate entrepreneurship, market orientation and flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Van Wyk &amp; Adonisi, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The aim of this study is to explore the prediction of corporate entrepreneurship as dependent variable by means of market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction as independent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head><p>Corporate entrepreneurship is an important facet of strategic renewal, profitability, innovativeness and growth of organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Drucker, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Morris, Kuratko &amp; Covin, 2008)</ref>. Although there is no general agreed definition of corporate entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sharma &amp; Chrisman, 1999)</ref> there is consensus that corporate entrepreneurship is characterised by (1) the birth of new businesses within existing businesses, (2) the transformation or rebirth of organisations through a renewal of key areas of businesses, and (3) the innovation and renewal within an existing organisation. The strategic entrepreneurial orientation in businesses creates proactive innovativeness and risk-taking behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lumpkin &amp; Dess, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, Zahra &amp; Covin, 1995)</ref> which leads to strategic renewal and development of new business ventures <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Guth &amp; Ginsberg, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zahra, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Higher levels of corporate entrepreneurship are associated with higher levels of competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bhardwaj et al., 2007)</ref>, performance, growth and the survival of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Covin, Green &amp; Slevin, 2006)</ref>. For this reason, it is important to establish which factors contribute significantly to the corporate entrepreneurial functioning of a firm. The collaboration of different work teams within a firm can lead to different forms of entrepreneurial behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bojica, Del Mar Fuentes &amp; Gomez-Gras, 2011)</ref>. It is important for businesses to nurture the entrepreneurial attitude of employees to facilitate corporate entrepreneurial behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Van Wyk &amp; Boshoff, 2004)</ref>. The sharing and facilitation of knowledge and expertise can create a strategic advantage in organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Leibold, Voelpel &amp; Tekie, 2004)</ref>. It is, however, not always clear which organisational resources and capacities support entrepreneurial resourcefulness <ref type="bibr">(Phan, Wright, Ucbasaran &amp; Tan, 2009)</ref>. For this reason, the current study is an investigation into the influence of market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction on corporate entrepreneurship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corporate entrepreneurship and market orientation</head><p>Research has shown that market orientation forms a direct link with corporate entrepreneurship and provides the basis for a sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barrett &amp; Weinstein, 1997)</ref>. However, the literature indicates that the relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and market orientation is poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker &amp; Sinkula, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Merlo &amp; Auh, 2009)</ref>. Market orientation refers to the organisation-wide collection, responsiveness and utilization of market intelligence and the dissemination opportunities and strategies across departments <ref type="bibr">(Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jaworski &amp; Kohli, 1996)</ref>. A proactive market orientation indicates a willingness to adjust to the envisaged varying future needs of customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atuahene-Gima et al. 2005)</ref>. Market orientation thus promotes the maintenance of a competitive tactics <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Zachary, McKenny, Short &amp; Payne, 2011)</ref> and drives innovative incentives (Zortea-Johnston, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Darroch &amp; Matear, 2012)</ref>. Market orientation is a cultural orientation that guides strategies in response to threats and opportunities in the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cambra-Fierro, Hart, Polo-Redondo, Fuster-Mur, 2012)</ref> and fosters sustainable advantage by creating superior values for customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Slater &amp; Narver, 1994)</ref> consequently achieving improved financial results <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Loubser, 2000)</ref>. It is the vital link in activating the organisation to react to threats and opportunities in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kumar, Subramanian &amp; Strandholm, 2003)</ref> with the primary objective of delivering superior customer value <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jimenez-Zarco, Martinez-Ruiz &amp; Izquierdo-Yusta, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Market orientation, in joint relationship with entrepreneurial leadership, advances firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Li, Zhao, Tan, &amp; Liu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Van Zyl &amp; Mathur-Helm, 2007)</ref>. When market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation are in harmony, it results in an opportunistic culture that boosts profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker &amp; Sinkula, 2009)</ref>. This harmony is due to the synchronising of customer and competitor intelligence of market planning, strategic exploitation of opportunities, and careful calculation of risks and uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker &amp; Sinkula, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barrett et al., 2012)</ref>. In order to be truly entrepreneurial and excel in innovativeness, business should engage in parallel proactive market orientation activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Renko, Carsrud &amp; Brännback, 2009)</ref>. The constant scanning for market knowledge is critical in maintaining an incremental entrepreneurial orientation and translating it into higher performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bojica et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Market orientation goes beyond the collection and dissemination of information. Market orientation is a coordinated response to opportunities and threats, adding value to customer needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kumar et al., 2003)</ref>. Both customer and competitor orientations have a significant influence on business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kumar et al., 2003)</ref>. A proactive market orientation leads to positive results in the short-and long-term performance of businesses, facilitating forward planning, especially in turbulent times <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kumar, Jones, Venkatesan &amp; Leone, 2011)</ref>. Nurturing a market orientation enables businesses to operate proactively, rather than reactively in securing their competitive status <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kumar et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>A significant positive relationship is reported between market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation in a study of 88 small firms in San Diego <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker &amp; Sinkula, 2009)</ref> as well as 695 participants from different industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett et al., 2012)</ref>. The practicing of market orientation and corporate entrepreneurship should be seen in perspective to enable businesses to acquire knowledge of market conditions and make appropriate decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Maatoofi &amp; Tajeddini, 2011)</ref>. Flexibility and marketing goes hand-inhand and businesses have to adapt to variable consumer needs to maintain competitiveness and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hart, 2003)</ref>. We are of the opinion that businesses that seek higher forms of entrepreneurship and have an active market orientation, need to adopt a flexible character in order to function harmoniously and effectively. For the purposes of the current study market orientation is seen in the view of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kumar et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kumar et al. ( , 2011))</ref>, as the proactive generation of intelligence that leads to responsiveness to threats and opportunities, managed by the dissemination of intelligence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corporate entrepreneurship and flexibility</head><p>The highly complex environments in which businesses operate require planning systems that are flexible in order to allow frequent changes <ref type="bibr">(Kukalis, 1989: 567)</ref> and meet varying needs in the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Rundh, 2011)</ref>. Flexibility is defined as the extent to which the different business units react efficiently supported by administrative relations and situational proficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barrett &amp; Weinstein, 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Rundh (2011)</ref> defines flexibility as the ability of a firm to respond and introduce change, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barrett et al. (2009)</ref> describes it as a firm's ability to adapt administratively to situational knowledge. Strategic flexibility is seen as the capacity of a business to maintain competitiveness by continually adapting or responding to changing competitive environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hitt, Keats &amp; DeMarie, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Flexibility is vital for higher forms of innovation to take place <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ngamsirijit, 2010)</ref> while ensuring adaptability with improved performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bhattacharya &amp; Giapponi, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kaiser &amp; Overfield, 2010)</ref> and competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Horwitz, Allan, Brosnan &amp; Walsh, 2000)</ref>. Business leaders should manage flexibility in order to reduce their vulnerability and adjust to dynamic environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Koornhof, 2001)</ref>. Flexibility is needed to cope with uncertainties and dynamic processes that take place in vigorous lucrative environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buganza, Gerst &amp; Verganti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hoskisson &amp; Busenitz, 2002)</ref> to retain entrepreneurial momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Enderwick &amp; Ronayne, 2004)</ref>. Firms that show low flexibility are seen as rigid in their administrative relations by strictly adhering to bureaucratic practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Khandwalla, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Khandwalla, , 1987;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Miles &amp; Snow, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barrett &amp; Weinstein, 1997)</ref>, thus preventing the development of new resources and capabilities, inhibiting competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ireland, Hitt &amp; Sirmon, 2003)</ref>. Sufficient flexibility should be allowed in order to adapt efficiently and increase organisational resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ignatiadis, 2007)</ref>, especially where complex processes are involved in new product development <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buganza et al., 2010)</ref>. Turbulent markets require an integrated responsiveness, supported by flexible practices, to adapt competently and maintain international competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Georgoulias, Papakostas, Chryssolouris, Stanev, Krappe &amp; Ovtcharova, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hitt et al., 1998)</ref>. Businesses should however not be too lenient on control systems when applying flexibility practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ignatiadis, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A flexible structural design is likely to encourage free and open discussion of ideas among employees, which is helpful in the successful development of innovative intrapreneurial ventures <ref type="bibr">(Jaworski &amp; Kohli;</ref><ref type="bibr">1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Van de Ven &amp; Poole, 1995)</ref>. The creation of an entrepreneurial milieu is not achieved by the implementation of rules, because it is largely a spontaneous process -it is by nature an adaptable flexible process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chung &amp; Gibbons, 1997)</ref>. Additionally the dissemination of marketplace information requires flexible practices in order to filter through cross-functional boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Miles &amp; Snow, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Child &amp; McGrath, 2001)</ref>. In this way firms are able to react swiftly to customer needs and market opportunities while avoiding risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Enderwick &amp; Ronayne, 2004)</ref>. Changing customer demands and market responsiveness have to be met with flexible business policies which is essential to internationalisation of business <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Rundh, 2011)</ref>. In a study of 476 businesses in Nigeria it was found that strategic flexibility was significantly positively related to market performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Olalekan, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barrett et al. (2012)</ref> report a significant positive correlation between flexibility, corporate entrepreneurship and organisational performance in a sample of 695 participants from different industries.</p><p>A flexible response is of strategic importance in a competitive environment. This research will adopt a combination of descriptions of flexibility, namely: the ability of a business to maintain competitiveness and initiate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Rundh, 2011)</ref> by means of efficient administrative support <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett et al., 2012)</ref> in reaction to situational knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barrett et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corporate entrepreneurship and job satisfaction</head><p>Job satisfaction is the positive emotional state an individual experiences in the work situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Locke, 1976)</ref>. Job satisfaction is also seen as the difference between what the worker's idea of an ideal work situation is and what he actually experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Diener, Emmons, Larsen &amp; Griffin, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Locke, 1976)</ref>. It is the degree to which an individual's expectations of the job conforms to job experiences, influencing the overall attitude and performance of the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Spector, 1997)</ref>, affecting the well-being of an organisation as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Spector, 2008)</ref>. It is important that members of corporate entrepreneurial teams experience job satisfaction, as satisfied team members will probably be more committed to team efforts and less likely to quit their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst et al., 2009)</ref>. High levels of job satisfaction could benefit the overall performance of a business, while low levels of job satisfaction could cripple the functioning of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Galup, Klein &amp; Jiang, 2008)</ref>. A lack of job satisfaction in an entrepreneurial team may lead to a lack of participation in marketing activities and intrapreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kuratko, Hornsby and Bishop (2005)</ref> found that the corporate entrepreneurial factors of work discretion and rewards/reinforcement resulted in increased perceived job satisfaction, leading in turn to increased entrepreneurial actions. The study implies that job satisfaction plays a mediating role in entrepreneurial actions and business performance Job satisfaction of employees is vital in sustaining businesses and economies and the basis of business performance <ref type="bibr">(Antoncic &amp; Antoncic, 2011b)</ref>. Many studies confirm the positive relationship between job satisfaction and corporate entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Antoncic &amp; Antoncic, 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Comeche &amp; Loras, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kuratko et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Van Wyk &amp; Adonisi, 2008)</ref> and its importance as antecedent of the growth of a firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Antoncic &amp; Antoncic, 2011a)</ref>. In this investigation the measurement of job satisfaction takes into account both the internal job satisfaction experience, as well as the external job satisfaction conformation of expectations.</p><p>We maintain that a healthy responsive market orientation flexible policies and heightened job satisfaction should lead to advanced corporate entrepreneurship. The current study seeks to ascertain the impact of market orientation, organisational flexibility, and job satisfaction on corporate entrepreneurship in a South African context.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical results</head><p>The first research question concerning the relationships between corporate entrepreneurship and psychometric variables of market orientation, job satisfaction and flexibility was investigated by means of Pearson Product Moment correlations (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Only four of the eight corporate entrepreneurship sub-scales were predicted reasonably well. For this reason only four Structural Equation Models were built to investigate the prediction in the dependent variables. The strength of Structural Equation Modelling lies in its ability to measure the simultaneous inter-related dependent relationships between latent (unobserved) and manifest (observed) variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boshoff, 2009)</ref>. A Structural Equations Model with CE1, work discretion as outcome variable is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>The path coefficients in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> are moderate &gt; 0,3 to large &gt; 0,5. Confirmatory Factor Analysis for this model shows a reasonable fit with the data with a Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) = 0,8523, GFI Adjusted for Degrees of Freedom (AGFI) = 0,8216, Root Mean Square Residual (RMR) = 0,0605, Chi-square (df = 269, p &gt; Chi-square &lt; 0,0001) = 720,5685, RAMSEA Estimate (90% Cl 0,0649 to 0,0774 = 0,0771, Bentler's Comparative Fit Index = 0,8408 and Bollen (1988) Non-normed Index Delta2 = 0,8426.</p><p>The prediction of management support and risk acceptance (CE2) was further investigated by means of the Structural Equations Model seen in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of this study emphasise the important relationships of market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction with corporate entrepreneurship. A refinement of the regression of the different independent variables on the eight corporate entrepreneurial sub-scales as dependent variables indicate that only the sixth subscale, sufficient time, was not predicted by the different independent variables. Our study supports the relationships conceptualised in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> with the exception of sufficient time, which had no significant correlation or prediction at the 95 per cent level of confidence. The findings confirm the arguments that the different market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction sub-scales are important factors to take into consideration in the nurturing of corporate entrepreneurship and sustaining global competitiveness. The current study emphasizes the important role that management plays in establishing and maintaining a competitive corporate entrepreneurial environment by nurturing market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction practices.</p><p>Management should take cognisance of the negative relationship of the market orientation sub-scale of inertia to most of the corporate entrepreneurial variables. The market orientation sub-scales intelligence generation (MO1) and responsiveness (MO3), show a significant positive relationship to five and four of the corporate entrepreneurial sub-scales respectively. This is similar to the findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baker and Sinkula (2009)</ref> as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barrett et al. (2012)</ref> that a significant positive relationship exists between market orientation and entrepreneurship. It is important to note that the organizational boundaries sub-scale (CE7) has a significant negative relationship with intelligence generation (MO1) and responsiveness to the market (MO3). The significant negative relationships with organisational boundaries (CE7) should serve as a warning to management that inflexible management practices have negative associations with market orientation variables. By applying a proactive market orientation and aligning it with corporate entrepreneurial practices should secure competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kumar et al., 2011)</ref>, as well as boost innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Renko et al., 2009)</ref>, performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bojica et al., 2011)</ref> and profitability of an organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker &amp; Sinkula, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The flexibility sub-scales formality (F1) has significant positive relationships with five of the corporate entrepreneurial subscales, while authoritarianism (F2) has mainly significant negative relationships with the same five corporate entrepreneurial sub-scales. This implies that formal structures that support flexible reactions, foster corporate entrepreneurial actions. On the other hand, the strict rigid structures of inflexible authoritarianism inhibit corporate entrepreneurial behaviour. Management should note that inflexibility implicated the organisational boundaries subscale (CE7) significantly negatively relates to formality, but is positively related to authoritarianism. The monitoring of flexible management practices is essential in the reaction to customer needs <ref type="bibr">(Enderwick &amp; Ronanyne, 2004)</ref> to maintain innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jaworski &amp; Kohli, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Van de Ven &amp; Poole, 1995)</ref> and pervade cross-functional boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Miles &amp; Snow, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Child &amp; McGrath, 2001)</ref> as well as securing market performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barrett et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Olalekan, 2011)</ref>.

The current findings is in accordance with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kuratko et al. (2005)</ref> that job satisfaction contributes to entrepreneurial actions, which ultimately leads to organizational growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Antoncic &amp; Antoncic, 2011a)</ref>. It is further important for management to note the central role that job satisfaction plays in the over-all wellbeing of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Spector, 2008)</ref> and implicitly contributing to the stimulation of intrapreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>The globalisation of markets requires swift reaction to warrant a competitive advantage and superior performance. Management should support activities that sustain corporate entrepreneurial activities to maintain strategic competitiveness. This study suggests that detailed attention to external job satisfaction, formal flexibility and market orientations facilitate different corporate entrepreneurial activities. Businesses should develop strategies that support these practices that sustain corporate entrepreneurship.</p><p>Management should investigate methods to improve and support external job satisfaction, formal flexibility policies and market orientation strategies to meet the demands of corporate entrepreneurial activities. Simultaneously management should guard against inflexible authoritarian practices that inhibit creative corporate entrepreneurial initiatives. The nurturing of these strategies should warrant a competitive advantage.</p><p>This study offers important insights for both managers and researchers in the field of corporate entrepreneurship. The study advances our understanding of the influence of market orientation, organisational flexibility and job satisfaction on corporate entrepreneurship. An increased understanding of the relationship of these work variables with corporate entrepreneurship offers management a more solid foundation on which to base decisions on.</p><p>Corporate entrepreneurial conditions could have a substantial direct influence on the growth and survival of a business and indirectly on the economy as a whole. Policy makers in decision-making processes should take the factors that contribute to the functioning of corporate entrepreneurship in a business into account. Business management should bear in mind the importance of the market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction factors in planning strategies to advance corporate entrepreneurship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the current study and implications for future research</head><p>The results of the current study are viewed in the light of its limitations. Firstly, the sample comprises of only South African based businesses. Therefore, findings may not be generalisable to other countries. The findings can also only be generalised to organisations represented in the sample. A reproduction of the current study in other business sectors and in other countries is recommended. As indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Spector (1987)</ref>, common method variance and response bias could negatively influence the findings of the current study due to its self-report method.</p><p>In order to gain a better understanding of the complexity of the different work variables and its influence on corporate entrepreneurship, future research should investigate alternative variables related to corporate entrepreneurship. A broader framework of the relationship of different work variables with corporate entrepreneurship should offer better insight to policy makers to improve a corporate entrepreneurship climate. Future investigations should strive to identify the influence of additional internal organisational variables on corporate entrepreneurship. The integration of a variety of internal organisational factors that positively influence corporate entrepreneurship should broaden the conceptual framework on which management can base decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The ultimate aim of businesses is to invest in their performance. This paper integrates the processes and interactions involved between market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction in facilitating corporate entrepreneurship. The findings give a closer understanding of the individual contributions of the market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction factors to corporate entrepreneurship. The results of this study can be used by management to advance corporate entrepreneurial practices. A continuous seeking of opportunities to nourish and prolong sustainable corporate entrepreneurship should be investigated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The relationship between the different factors of market orientation, flexibility and job satisfaction with the corporate entrepreneurial variables</figDesc></figure>
