<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, entrepreneurship has become a key driver of employment and economic growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acs et al., 2005)</ref>. Governments and educational institutions show an increasing interest in promoting entrepreneurship. Universities in particular find that investing in entrepreneurial education is paramount for the social and economic development of society. Such education can help develop students' knowledge, skills and intentions to start a business <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahmed et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fietze and Boyd, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Garrido-Lopez et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ilonen et al., 2018)</ref>. From an academic perspective, a great deal of research has examined entrepreneurship and the factors that either push or pull entrepreneurs to start a business. But the majority of studies focus on established entrepreneurs, and little is known about younger adults and the factors that drive them to start a business <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Henderson and Robertson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Turker and Sonmez Selçuk, 2009)</ref>. Whilst some individuals are born entrepreneurs, others are made. They must acquire certain skills or capabilities that help them become entrepreneurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Henderson and Robertson, 2000)</ref>. Although there is debate over the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education for developing entrepreneurial intentions, universities and their entrepreneurship education programmes are seen as "critical for developing entrepreneurial skills, attitudes and behaviors" <ref type="bibr">(Volkmann et al., 2009, p. 9)</ref>. It is within the university environment where students can find initial inspiration that together with the education in business and management can generate entrepreneurial intentions. Drawing on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which posits that entrepreneurship is not only intentional but also pre-planned <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kirby and Ibrahim, 2011)</ref>, this paper studies the influence of personal attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour on university students' entrepreneurial intentions. This study enriches research based on the TPB model by considering students' entrepreneurial skills or capabilities, which are presumably acquired at university. Thus, the model presented herein contributes to the literature by incorporating the role of entrepreneurial education as well as the skills and capabilities that the students acquire. The paper shows that education might have an indirect effect on the development of entrepreneurial skills. This in turn fosters entrepreneurial intentions. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the entrepreneurial intentions of university students and the personal, social and environmental factors that influence their intentions to become entrepreneurs. The paper continues as follows: the second section presents a brief review of the literatura on the factors that influence entrepreneurial intentions. The third section presents the method used to test the hypotheses. The fourth section presents the results and discusses the primary findings. Finally, the fifth section provides the conclusions of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL FOUNDATION</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nabi et al. (2010)</ref>, three models can be used to test entrepreneurial intentions: Shapero's model of the entrepreneurial event, Ajzen's TPB and Lüthje and Franke's model. This study builds on Ajzen's TBP. The TPB is adopted in this paper because of its widespread acceptance among academics and its ability to predict human social behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen, 2011)</ref>. It also allows the measurement of entrepreneurial behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Heuer and Kolvereid, 2014)</ref>. The TPB considers three antecedents of intention, predicting that intentions depend on personal attitudes towards starting a new firm (behaviour), social influences (subjective norms) and perceived ability (perceived behavioural control). The TPB posits that an individual's intention to perform certain behaviours increases with perceived ability and that people start businesses if they believe they have the ability to do so and the activity is socially accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kirby and Ibrahim, 2011)</ref>. In this study, two additional variables are incorporated into this widely accepted model: the skills and capabilities of the study population and the entrepreneurial environment (i.e. university education). This proposed model enables analysis of whether these five constructs encourage the entrepreneurial intentions of national and international university students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entrepreneurial intention</head><p>The field of entrepreneurial intention has attracted the attention of scholars in recent years. The literature distinguishes between two different lines of research. One arises from social psychology and analyses behaviours and the mental processes that occur when transforming attitudes and beliefs into effective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bandura, 1997)</ref>. Following this first approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1991)</ref> developed the TPB, which has become popular amongst social psychologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Liñán and Fayolle, 2015)</ref> and has become one of the most influential models to explain human behaviour. The other line of research addresses entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bird, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Roy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Shapero, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shapero and Sokol, 1982)</ref> and defines an individual's entrepreneurial intention as a "selfacknowledged conviction by a person that they intend to set up a new business venture and consciously plan to do so at some point in the future" <ref type="bibr">(Thompson, 2009, p. 676)</ref>. The TPB defines intentions as the key predictors of human behaviours. In other words, intentions can predict an individual's behaviour, so understanding the formation of entrepreneurial intentions provides insight into the venture creation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Galanakis, and Giourka, 2017)</ref>. Thus, intention-based models offer a great deal to entrepreneurship research because entrepreneurial activity is a planned behaviour and understanding intentions can help detect potential actions. This study, however, focuses exclusively on intentions because the majority of university students are still in the phase of learning and acquiring the knowledge and capabilities they will need in the future to pursue a career in business and management. Thus, the concept of behaviour is not considered in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Miralles et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Trivedi, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal attitudes</head><p>Personal attitudes can be described as the extent of positive or negative evaluations of venture creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kyvik, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Liñán et al., 2013)</ref>. These attitudes are evaluations of specific behaviours that are attractive or advantageous. Depending on how individuals evaluate behaviours, their subsequent intentions are shaped in one form or another <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Therefore, attitudes towards entrepreneurial behaviour such as starting one's own business vs working as an employee can be regarded as an antecedent of entrepreneurial intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Liñán et al. (2011)</ref> found that high entrepreneurial intentions lead to a positive attitude towards starting a business. This finding is supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lortie and Castogiovanni (2015)</ref>,who reviewed a number of relevant papers on this topic and found 16 articles that confirm a positive relationship between attitudes and intentions. Thus, the first hypothesis is formulated as follows:</p><p>H1. Personal attitudes positively influence entrepreneurial intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective norms</head><p>Subjective norms are an individual's perceptions of the values that others consider important regarding that individual's choice to create a venture. For some, subjective norms are the weakest predictors of intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liñán et al., 2013)</ref>. Scholars have reported that the direct effect of subjective norms on intention is weak or non-existent <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Autio and Acs, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Krueger et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Miralles et al., 2017)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liñán and Chen (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kolvereid and Isaksen (2006)</ref> have reported that subjective norms appear to affect attitude and perceived behavioural control. Whilst entrepreneurial values from society can affect an individual's own beliefs and perceptions, so can social norms from family, friends or other relations. These in turn can affect attitudes and perceptions of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Benavides-Espinosa and Roig, 2011)</ref>. Strong perceptions of social pressure to be an entrepreneur might be reflected in a more constructive attitude towards entrepreneurship and in greater behavioural control in starting and establishing a firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Albulescu and Tămăşilă, 2016)</ref>. Thus, the second hypothesis is formulated as follows:</p><p>H2. Subjective norms positively influence entrepreneurial intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived behavioural control</head><p>Perceived behavioural control is defined as the "perceptions of the respondent that he/she can execute specific behaviour/s" <ref type="bibr">(Bird, 2015, p. 154)</ref>. It refers to the individual's control over the actions that are necessary to perform behaviours. It usually comprises evaluations of skills, intellectual capability and the ability to overcome setbacks or effectively deal with barriers. According to <ref type="bibr">Ajzen (2002, p. 667)</ref>, "a high level of perceived control should strengthen a person's intention to perform the behaviour, and increase effort and perseverance". Perceived behavioural control can provide useful information about the actual control a person exercises over the situation. It can therefore be used as a direct predictor of behaviour. Related to this concept are the perceptions of the behaviour's feasibility, considered an essential predictor of the behaviour. Individuals typically choose to adopt behaviours that they believe they will be able to control and master. Thus, the third hypothesis is formulated as follows:</p><p>H3. Perceived behavioural control positively influences entrepreneurial intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cheng et al. (2009)</ref> affirm that entrepreneurship education has commonly been narrowly defined as education that provides the necessary skills to launch a business. When the purpose of the educational programme is to provide students with the entrepreneurial skills required for work, the best type of education and training will be acquired from a business <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hytti and O'Gorman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mahto and McDowell, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Olugbola, 2017)</ref>. Ultimately,entrepreneurship programmes are designed to have a positive impact on entrepreneurial intentions and instil entrepreneurial knowledge and skills in individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kolvereid and Isaksen (2006)</ref> found that students who went through entrepreneurship programmes and activities displayed stronger entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions than those who did not participate in entrepreneurship programmes. The same study also showed that individuals who completed entrepreneurship programmes rated themselves as more creative, more analytical, more capable of motivating others to gain support and assistance in realising opportunities, better networkers, and more capable of adapting to situations and handling different situations with ease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Baron and Markman (2000)</ref> observed specific social skills such as the ability to assess others, adapt to changing or diverse social situations, initially and consistently make a Good impression on others and successfully persuade others. Thus, the fourth hypothesis is formulated as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entrepreneurial skills</head><p>H4. Entrepreneurial skills positively influence entrepreneurial intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entrepreneurial environment: university education</head><p>University education provides members of society with the knowledge and competencias they need to develop professional careers. Teaching and research are the cornerstones of university education, but the progress of society and the influence of globalisation has added a third mission, namely economic development, to the university domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Stauvermann and Kumar, 2017)</ref>. Aligning these three missions is crucial for building an entrepreneurial university <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Etzkowitz et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ribeiro et al., 2010)</ref> where entrepreneurship is central to the progress of the economy and society <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Audretsch et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sanz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Weber, 1978)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Franke and Lüthje (2004)</ref>, students who perceive a positive environment and who are enroled in entrepreneurship programmes at university develop more entrepreneurial intentions. Other scholars have also acknowledged that an entrepreneurial educational environment has a significant impact on entrepreneurial intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cheng et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Martínez-Climent et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Packham et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Schwarz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kabók et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, universities today must incorporate this type of education in their curricula because doing so can have a direct effect on skills development, which ultimately exerts an indirect, positive effect on entrepreneurial intentions. Thus, the following hypothesis is formulated (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>): H5. University environment has a direct, positive influence on skills development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure1. The proposed research model METHOD</head><p>This section describes the study design, the validation of the measurement instruments and the method used to test the hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical study design</head><p>There is growing interest in entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention. This study examines entrepreneurial intention in a university context. Prior studies that have also examined entrepreneurship within universities include those by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fayolle et al. (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Franke and Lüthje (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Guerrero and Urbano (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pittaway and Cope (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zhang et al. (2014)</ref>. A questionnaire was used to collect the data for this study. This questionnaire was built following a review of different models that have used measurement scales, including those developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Franke and Lüthje (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Liñán et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liñán and Chen (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lortie and Castogiovanni (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pruet et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Spreitzer (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhao et al. (2005)</ref>. The questionnaire had four sections. The first section collected general respondent details. These data were used to calculate descriptive statistics for the sample. The second section had 20 items that formed the scales for entrepreneurial intention, personal attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. The third section comprised 12 items on entrepreneurial skills. The fourth section comprised 13 items on university environment. All responses were recorded on a five-point Likert scale. Several approaches were used to obtain the sample for this study. For international students, an online questionnaire and emails in English and Spanish were used. This procedure yielded 276 valid questionnaires, some of which were removed from the data set because they were incomplete. Students from 74 universities across 34 countries participated in the survey (see Appendix 1). Regarding the gender of respondents, 53.98 per cent were women and 46.02 per cent were men. The age range was 17-55 years. The median age was 22 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement instruments</head><p>Existing scales were used to measure the variables entrepreneurial intention, personal attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liñán et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liñán and Chen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pruet et al., 2009)</ref>. For the variables entrepreneurial skills and university environment, specific scales were developed for this study based on a review of the theory on these variables. This procedure enabled specification of the domain and dimensions of each construct. The measurement scales were tested for reliability and validity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chin and Marcolin (1995)</ref> affirm that these psychometric properties should be confirmed for each model because the reliability and validity of constructs can change depending on the theoretical model that is employed. However, the items were filtered to simplify the model. Justification for the underlying models of the scales has already been provided, so reliability of the proposed scales was tested using Cronbach's α, as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Churchill's (1979)</ref> recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of reliability</head><p>The most widely used measure of reliability is Cronbach's α <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cronbach, 1951)</ref>, which enables confirmation of the degree of internal consistency <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Calculating Cronbach's α for each factor separately does not consider the influence on the reliability of the other constructs. As Table <ref type="table">I</ref> shows the values were greater than 0.7 for all scales except the personal attitudes scale. Cronbach's α for personal attitudes was close to 0.7, so this scale was kept in the model. This practice is supported by the literature and prior studies. To obtain the necessary data to check for composite reliability (CR) and convergent validity, confirmatory factor analysis was first performed in EQS 6.1. Maximum likelihood estimation was used for the confirmatory factor analysis. The GFI was examined and the model was interpreted. This analysis showed that several items needed to be removed to achieve a good fit. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> displays the results of the reliability analysis. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> confirms that the CR for all factors was greater than 0.7. The CR can also be tested using <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fornell and Larcker's (1981)</ref> average variance extracted (AVE) procedure. The values for the AVE were all greater than 0.5, so they were deemed acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity of the measurement instrument</head><p>Content validity is defined as the degree to which the scale covers all dimensions of the concept it is supposed to measure. The items that make up the scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Vila et al., 2000)</ref> should provide a representative measure of the contents of the concept that is measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sánchez and Sarabia, 1999)</ref>. There is a lack of consensus as to how to determine whether a measure has content validity. This process largely depends on the literature review and the researcher's judgement, so no specific indicator can be stated in this case. Convergent validity was tested by examining the t-statistics for the factor loadings. If all loadings measured the same construct, they would be statistically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">II</ref> provides the results of the confirmatory analysis. As shown, all variables in the model were validated. The non-significant items were eliminated from the confirmatory factor analysis, keeping those that were significant. The results in Table <ref type="table">II</ref> show that the estimates were good and had a high level of significance. All t-statistics were greater than 3.291. They were therefore significant for p&lt;0.001. The standardised values were high. All standardised values were greater than 0.5. All goodness-of-fit (GFI) indicators were greater than 0.8 and close to 0.9. The only indicator that did not meet the optimal criteria was the SRMR. The value for the SRMR was between 0.05 and 0.08, which is considered acceptable, although the optimal value is less than 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. Cronbach's α and comparison between CR and AVE</head><p>Discriminant validity indicates the degree to which a given construct differs from other constructs in the same model. For discriminant validity to hold, any given construct should correlate weakly with other latent variables that measure different phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sánchez and Sarabia, 1999)</ref>. Three criteria can be used to test discriminant validity. One of these is the confidence interval test <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table II. Confirmatory factor analysis of the model</head><p>The correlations between the six variables were studied. Variables F3 and F4 were very highly correlated. F3 was also quite highly correlated with F5 and F2. Therefore, the results indicate that discriminant validity did not hold, so the model needed simplifying. F3 was removed from the model, and the correlation matrix was recalculated. The highest correlation was between F1 and F4 (0.881). The confidence interval was calculated by taking this value plus or minus two times the standard error. The standard error was 0.044. Thus:</p><p>Lower limit = 0:881-(2 * 0:044) = 0:793; Upper limit = 0:881+(2 * 0:044) = 0:969:</p><p>The value 1 lay outside the interval, thereby confirming discriminant validity. Finally, a scale has nomological validity when the construct that is measured is capable of revealing relationships with other constructs that conceptually or theoretically should exist. This step was carried out for the structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the structural model</head><p>The causal relationships described by the hypotheses were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). During this stage, the parameters of the specified model were estimated and statistically tested. First, the GFI was studied to evaluate how well the data fit the proposed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Luque, 1999)</ref>. The two most widely used measures are the χ2 statistic or likelihood ratio and the GFI index. The likelihood ratio only indicates the significance of the overall model. A significance of p &lt;0.05 for the value χ2 indicates that the observed covariance matrix and the estimated covariance matrix differ significantly and that the model should therefore be rejected. Given the limitations of the likelihood ratio, however, the standard recommendation is not to restrict the analysis exclusively to this overall fit index <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cea, 2002)</ref>. It is instead advisable to complement this statistic with other statistics, such as those shown in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table III. Recommended values for the goodness of fit</head><p>The GFI indices of the theoretical model did not meet the criteria for acceptance, so the next step was to proceed with the analysis of the model. As discussed earlier with respect to the analysis of the discriminant validity, perceived behavioural control was eliminated from the model because of its high correlations with most other variables. Accordingly, it was impossible to test H3. There was a relationship with respect to F5 given by the Lagrange multiplier. This relationship is theoretically justified, so the variable was included in the model. Furthermore, university environment does not have a direct relationship but rather offers a context in which capabilities are developed. Therefore, the fit of the re-specified theoretical model, here referred to as the revised model, was evaluated. As Table <ref type="table">IV</ref> shows the GFI indices for the revised model improved with respect to the theoretical model. These values were considered acceptable (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table IV. Comparison of the goodness-of-fit índices for both models</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSIÓN</head><p>This section presents a discussion of the results that were obtained for the revised model. The results show that H1 was significant. The t-value was 2.032 and the standardised loading was 0.981. Thus, the results show that personal attitudes directly and positively influence entrepreneurial intention, as justified by the theoretical framework. H2 had a high level of significance. The t-value was 6.824 and the standardised loading was 0.982. The results thereby show that subjective norms also directly and positively influence entrepreneurial intention, as justified by the theoretical framework. As mentioned earlier, perceived behavioural control was highly correlated with entrepreneurial intention and personal attitudes. Perceived behavioural control was therefore removed from the model, rendering it impossible to test H3. Other empirical studies have also been unable to test this variable (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kolvereid and Isaksen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lortie and Castogiovanni, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Simon and Kim, 2017)</ref>. For H4, the t-value of 2.155 was also significant. The standardised loading in this case was 0.840. Furthermore, an additional relationship (R1) indicates that the entrepreneurial skills variable also influences personal attitudes, as reflected by the t-value of 10.839 and the standardised loading of 0.738. The personalities and characteristics of entrepreneurs may vary considerably. However, all entrepreneurs seem to have in common certain entrepreneurial skills and a willingness to take risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Wach and Wojciechowski, 2016)</ref>. Through effective entrepreneurship education, students can learn these skills. This learning can act as a springboard to help these students become successful entrepreneurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rae, 2006)</ref>. Entrepreneurial skills were found to be important in this model. They influence entrepreneurial intention directly and positively whilst influencing personal attitudes, which also influence entrepreneurial intention. H5, however, was non-significant. This hypothesis was therefore rejected. Entrepreneurial skills can stem from the university context as well as the ability to explore future job opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Guerrero and Urbano, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Veciana, 1999)</ref>, and the university plays a prominent role. However, this role is not decisive. The reason for this finding, in this case, is that the university environment does not directly influence the development of entrepreneurial capabilities, although it does so indirectly through courses and seminars. This study drew upon the standardised model and validated scales from the literature. The analysis was performed using SEM in EQS 6.1, which offers a robust analysis tool. The results of the analysis were satisfactory, although perceived behavioural control had to be removed from the model. However, the entrepreneurial skills variable added considerable value to the model. This variable was included in the model because it captures the development of capabilities and knowledge acquisition of future entrepreneurs that are enroled in university programmes. The university context is an excellent environment in which to train future entrepreneurs. For this reason, the university environment was also included in the model, although the influence of this variable was less direct. The entrepreneurial skills variable was a critical variable in the model because it exerted a direct influence on entrepreneurial intention, as well as an indirect influence through personal attitudes. This finding has practical implications for policymakers and especially university management because it shows the importance of offering high-quality entrepreneurial education and training. The educational environment should perhaps be subject to further examination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>For each individual, entrepreneurial intention is an intuitive process. But individuals need the right capabilities to fully pursue this entrepreneurial intention. This variable was therefore included in the model. Furthermore, the university provides an excellent environment for individuals to develop the capabilities that others are born with. One of the strengths of this study is the inclusion of this variable in the model. Surprisingly, however, university environment was non-significant, implying that this type of environment does not exert a direct influence, although the university context is important for university students to develop their capabilities. Universities should perhaps play a much more dynamic and practical role in entrepreneurial development in the classroom. For instance, universities should consider including courses on business creation as it raises students' attitudes towards becoming entrepreneurs. These courses provide students with practical knowledge as they learn from real-world scenarios and with theoretical knowledge on business creation. Additionally, incorporating businessoriented teaching techniques that provide business creation training will positively foster entrepreneurial intentions. For example, according to <ref type="bibr">Costin et al.'s (2018)</ref> teaching experience, business simulations can help develop entrepreneurial skills. Simulations can replicate real-world scenarios, and "are useful to learn about the complexities of running a small firm where the application, not the definitions, of business concepts, functions, and operations are most important" (p. 138). This study has certain limitations that provide opportunities for future research. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Liñán et al. (2013)</ref>, this study has examined the antecedents of intention that serve as precursors for business start-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Krueger and Day, 2010)</ref>. Future research should also examine the entrepreneurial behaviour of those students who intend to start a business and are about to do it or have recently started. Considerable attention has been paid to the students' intentions to start a business but little is known about the next step where a student actually go a step further and become an entrepreneur. Since the survey of this study collected data only from students, an extension of the study could include other university actors who are also involved in the entrepreneurial process. There are interesting implications for both academics and policymakers. The university environment plays a critical role today in shaping students' attitudes and behaviours. In increasingly unpredictable environments, entrepreneurs have to be better prepared for today's challenges and continuous changes. The university can provide a platform to explore the drivers of entrepreneurial intentions but more importantly it can help to develop entrepreneurial capacities. It is within the university environment where students and prospective entrepreneurs can ignite their entrepreneurial spirit.</p></div>
