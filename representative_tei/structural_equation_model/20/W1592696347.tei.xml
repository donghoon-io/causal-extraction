<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently Human Resources Management (HRM) functions such as recruitment, selection, training and performance evaluation are expected in considering environmental management (EM) issues. Environmental protective acts with adequate ecological knowledge and socioeconomic behavior and skills are referred to in this paper as green competencies. However, a systematic approach for developing and understanding key factors that enhance individuals' green competencies is lacking. This study contributes to green human resource literature by integrating environmental consumer behavior literature with traditional skills and competencies literature to help firms to select the right individuals to achieve their environmental goals. Using Robert's competencies framework and structural equation modeling (SEM), this paper empirically examines the influence of individual green competencies on organizations' green practices and performance objectives. Our model is tested using a sample of 1,230 employees working in key industries in the Chinese coastal city of Ningbo. The results indicate that acquired green competencies are more positively associated with individuals' green competencies and green behavior. The study empirically demonstrates that verifying acquired green competence attributes such as environmental knowledge, green purchase attitude and intention during employee selection would certainly be helpful for firms to identify individual green performance potential.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Environmental research categorically shows that industrial pollution is a major threat to sustainability in the modern world <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Xiang, Stuber and Meng 2011)</ref>. Therefore, attempts to improve sustainability through product and process redesign, and strategic environmental plans have become the focus of industrial activities in firms and at the government-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jabbour et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jackson, Renwick, Jabbour and Muller-Camen 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jabbour et al. 2014</ref>). However, extant research highlights that firms' intentions to adopt environmental practices and achieve sustainability is often influenced by certain drivers and barriers. For example, research suggests that stakeholder pressure, attainment of green certifications (such as ISO 14001), and adoption of environmental management system (EMS) are some of the principal drivers that improve firms' quests to improve sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Marcus and Fremeth 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jabbour et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Yang, Lin, Chan, and Sheu 2010)</ref>. Such drivers not only facilitate firms' abilities to meet environmental targets but also positively influence their financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Jacobs, Singhal and Subramanian 2010)</ref>. However, a majority of firms still consider environmental initiatives as a burden on their profit potentials and adopt short-term compliance strategies to meet targets set by the regulatory authorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Marcus and Fremeth 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Research often adopts different approaches to explore the issues related to sustainability. For instance, the operational process view (Input/process/output) is widely used to understand causes for environmental degradation. This stream of research focuses on processes such as lean practices, eco-efficiency improvement, carbon foot print reduction, certification and outputs such as metrics development, triple bottom line indices development, performance reporting and monitoring. Another stream of research explores challenges that arise from overproduction, urbanization and demographic changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Xiang, Stuber and Meng 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vadiati and Kashkooli 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wang, Qian, and Yu 2013)</ref>. These studies generally use sustainability indices such as socioeconomic development, environmental impact, institutional capacity, ecological and environmental potential indices as popular tools for both monitoring progress toward sustainable development and formulation of efficient policies.</p><p>Surprisingly, studies that centered on one of the important elements responsible for the worsening of the natural environment within institutions holds the key to environmental protection; humans as individuals, have been very scarce. This is because the damaging environmental impact we are witnessing today alongside global economic development is due to human activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kinnear, Taylor and Ahmed 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Grunert 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gan et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Recent studies have identified the role of human resources management (HRM) as an entity in supporting and promoting the adoption of environmental protection practices <ref type="bibr">(Renwick, Redman, and Maguire, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jabbour, C.J.C., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jabbour, Santos and Nagano 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sarkis, Gonzalez-Torre and Adenso-Diaz 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Studies suggest that major enablers of professional competencies include individual characteristics, behaviours, skills, knowledge, attitudes, self-reflection, beliefs, and employee satisfaction, amongst other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Birdir and Pearson 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Horng, et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Zhao et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wagner, 2014)</ref>. These individual characteristics are critical to the successful implementation of any green practice and/or policy in a firm. It is not surprising therefore that the critical role of environmental training in achieving success in environmental management, conservation and recycling of resources has been highlighted <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jabbour, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, to effectively align its practices of recruitment, selection, training and performance evaluation with environmental protection practices, HRM needs to understand as well as to reasonably be able to predict employee's green involvement and green competencies. This would enable effective integration of green issues with HRM practices and to achieve effective Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Renwick, Redman and Maguire 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The importance of green human practices for environmental protection and the role of green consumer behavior are often highlighted in HRM and marketing literature. However, very few studies attempt to integrate green consumer behavior with human resources skill development and their combined effect on green performance. Hence, this study bridges the gap by integrating consumer behavior with human skills and competencies literature to develop a conceptual model to identify a competent green individual.</p><p>In addition to the above, to the best of our knowledge, there are no large scale empirical studies on China that have explored the green competencies of individuals that would enable the prediction, sensitization and strategic management of such individuals to enhance firms' environmental protection efforts and environmental friendliness. Previous studies mainly focused on the developed and industrialized world <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ramus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sarkis et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wagner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wagner, 2014)</ref> and it is hard to find any study with respect to China <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tan and Lau 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Zhao et al., 2014)</ref>. This is despite China being the world's most seriously polluted country in regards to automobile and industrial emissions coupled with a huge population <ref type="bibr">(TIME, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tan and Lau, 2010)</ref>. Precisely the dearth of research on people's green competencies that contributes to the enhancement (or otherwise) and sustainability of a firm's greenness is a key motivator for this paper. Understanding people's green competencies will be particularly useful not only for developed countries but also for emerging economies such as China, who are now keen towards a green movement in the face of experiencing environmental degradation for a long period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tan and Lau, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tantawi et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Zhao et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>This study develops a green competencies framework for the individual/employee and simultaneously attempts to evaluate these green competencies by examining the relationship between 'natural' and 'acquired' green competencies of people with green performance, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Roberts's (1997)</ref> competency framework. By developing and testing the green competencies framework, the study helps to understand the tight alignment of HRM with the given green business operations objectives of a firm.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 of the paper provides a brief review of extent literature with respect to green human resource management, types of green competencies and green performance. Section 3 explains the conceptual model and the hypotheses of our study. Section 4 presents the methodology and sample characteristics of the research. Section 5 reports the results and discussion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Green Human Resource Management and Green Competencies</head><p>Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) becomes problematic if firms try to solve green challenges on an adhoc basis. For example, firms often use bits of technology and other isolated environmental management solutions without necessarily bringing in organizational changes. This leads to suboptimal green performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Wagner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Renwick, Redman, and Maguire, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jabbour, 2013)</ref>. This is even further reinforced by employees increasing environmental consciousness and their subsequent demand and expectation from employers to incorporate environmental issues in the form of corporate social responsibility practices in their workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ramus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Crane, Matten, &amp; Moon, 2008)</ref>. This is not surprising given that past studies have long attributed a worsening global natural environment with economic development all over the world and human activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kinnear, Taylor and Ahmed 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Grunert 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gan et al. 2008)</ref>. Indeed, it is reported that about 40% of environmental problems have been caused by human activities, in terms of their behavior, production and consumption patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Grunert 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gan et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>While the environmental initiatives of a firm influences its employees' green behavior beyond their individual behavioral motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ramus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chou, 2014)</ref>, adopting green practices depends on both the firm's position and its explicit strategy towards tackling environmental issues and on its employees' alignment with and support for environmental protection <ref type="bibr">(Ramus, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ramus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Ramus and Killmer, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chou, 2014)</ref>. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sweetman (2007)</ref> opined that irrespective of the quality and comprehensiveness of a firm's environmental policy and designed practices nothing substantial will be achieved without the active support of employees across the organization. This has now resulted in the realization that a firm can become green only if it has a workforce with substantial green skills and green competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ramus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gunasekaran and Gallear, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jabbour, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jabbour et al., 2015)</ref> resulting in the increasing quest to understand GHRM. In fact to achieve true and lasting environmental sustainability, the literature proposes that innovative fusion of GHRM and green supply chain management (GSCM) practices and policies is needed <ref type="bibr">(Jabbour and Jabbour, 2015)</ref>. This is substantiated with the findings that the greater the degree of alignment between HR and environmental issues the higher would be the adoption of green practices by firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Renwick, Redman and Maguire 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bohdanowicz, Zientara and Novotna, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wagner, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Competencies are the behaviors and attitudes required of people to do their job effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wood 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brownell 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Zopiatis 2010)</ref>. Extant literature suggests that professional competencies include individual characteristics, behaviours, skills, knowledge, attitudes, selfreflection, personal factors, values and beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Horng et al. 2011</ref>). These listed competencies were noted to contribute significantly to career success <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Birdir and Pearson 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Horng et al. 2011)</ref>. Recently, competency research models have been widely used to determine and align individual capabilities, knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, habits, abilities and personal characteristics with organizational performance core competence in different fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Çizel, Anafarta and Sarvan 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Zopiatis 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Past studies on HRM have attempted to identify individuals' traditional competencies and subsequent selection for specific positions in organizations since Robert <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wood's (1997)</ref> seminal work on "Working in Hotel and Catering" on the competencies needed for the profession of "chef" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Jauhari 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brownell 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Zopiatis 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wagner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jabour et al., 2015)</ref>. A major issue in GHRM is the identification of key green competencies (GC) of potential employees. GC competencies are considered an important practitioner topic that has not received attention from researchers.</p><p>GC are the requisite ecological knowledge, skills and other socioeconomic behavior an individual has to help him/her behave and act rightly and responsibly towards the overall well-being of his/her immediate environment. Understanding GC of individuals can significantly enhance the GHRM role in its functions such as hiring and training employees towards green objectives of firms. This is because GC motivates individuals to always ensure they only engage in resource-conserving and environmentally-friendly activities. We believe that such self-motivating competencies, collectively, will ensure the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) requirement for a 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' <ref type="bibr">(WCED 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Studies in the field of consumer psychology and green consumerism have attempted to identify the characteristics of environmentally-conscious consumers through their ecological attitude-knowledge as early as the 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kinnear, Taylor and Ahmed 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dunlap and Van Liere 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zho et al., 2014)</ref>. In their study to identify the characteristics of environmentallyconscious consumers in Canada, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kinnear, Taylor and Ahmed (1974)</ref> -were first to put forward the concept of perceived consumer effectiveness. They found that personality variables were better predictors than the socioeconomic variables. Other scholars found individual personal attitudes and beliefs to be significant in predicting green behavior (in term of their purchases) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gan et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fraj and Martinez 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chan, 2001)</ref>. Other than environmental knowledge, attitudes and values of individuals have been found to be major factors that influence green competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ramayah, Lee, and Mohamad, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zho et al., 2014)</ref>. For example, Chinese consumers are rather insensitive to environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tantawi et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tan and Lau, 2010)</ref>. Even in the more developed parts of China such as Hong Kong, people are just at the stage of green awakening <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lee, 2009)</ref>. This insensitivity exists despite China having 16 of the world's 20 most seriously polluted cities and being coined 'the world's manufacturing factory.' Extant literature on green behavior is mostly based on two established theories; the theory of reasoned action <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980)</ref> and the theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Roberts (1997)</ref> suggested viewing competencies in four categories: 'natural', 'acquired', 'adapting' and 'performing' competencies to solve organizational problems.</p><p>Robert's framework is regarded as a practical way of incorporating both concepts of competencies (in the US) and output-type of competences (in the UK) as the four clusters that can be used at different stages of HR cycle of selection, performance management and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cousins 2002)</ref>. This study adopted <ref type="bibr">Robert's (1997)</ref>  The natural green competencies (NGC) of people are the underlying traits and personality dimensions of the individuals. Basically, natural competencies are generally derived from individuals' observations and mentoring received at their formative stages on the dominant green behavior of their immediate social groups such as parents, relations and friends. This mimetic behavior develops the natural feeling of environmental concern, which without additional acquired green competencies, may be the only determinant of one's long-term green behavior. Studies suggests that employees' motivation to engage in green behaviour is partly based on their individual personal predisposition and environmental values <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ramus and Killmer, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pichel, 2008)</ref>. When employees' environmental values match that of the organization, the employee will respond positively and experience greater job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hoffman, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chou, 2014)</ref>. The logic of this study is that the natural competencies and personal commitments of employees will make it easier for organizations to activate their green behavior through mild-persuasion compared to the prevailing rigid organizational policies, practices and/or regulatory demands. NGC competencies are difficult to develop because it is a slow process but individual possessing such NGC can be identified and easily assessed through personality questionnaires as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Roberts (1997)</ref>, based on individuals strong attitude and inclination towards greener activities and environmental concern (EC). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yeung (2004)</ref>, environmental concern (EC) is "an attribute that can represent a person's worries, likes and dislikes about the environment'. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kim and Choi (2005)</ref>, describe EC as "an individual's general orientation toward the environment and an individual's concern level as to environmental issues". Determining what people know about the environment, how they feel about it and what actions they take (or would likely take) to help the environment is critical to establishing a sustainable green development <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tantawi et al. 2009)</ref>. EC is therefore a general attitude that refers to the way people value environmental protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lee 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tan and Lau (2011)</ref> think that the concept of EC is more often used to describe people's attitude towards the natural environment. Others believe that the concept of EC can refer to both general attitude towards the natural environment and attitudes towards any specific green behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Milfont and Duckitt 2004)</ref>. From the above discussion, EC refers to the general attitude toward the environment. A specific attitude is regarded as a relatively stronger predictor of behavior on a particular attitude object, while a general attitude is the tendency for individuals to engage in relevant behaviors within a category of attitude objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Tan and Lau 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mainieri et al. 1997</ref>). As a result, a specific attitude, rather than general attitude, is better and more effective in predicting a specific behavior. The study used EC as a proxy in measuring the natural green competencies (NGC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Acquired green competencies</head><p>Acquired green competencies are the green knowledge and skills that an individual has accumulated through previous experiences <ref type="bibr">(Cousins, et al. 2008</ref>). This includes education, qualifications and professional knowledge on environmental issues that leads to individuals' strong convictions and feelings towards adopting and acting in environmentally friendly manner. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chou (2014)</ref> posits that formal education and training help to strengthen knowledge and impact of green behavior that enable individuals to adjust and internalize green behavior and/or green attitudes in general. In other words, the individual's environmental actions and behavior is guided by the acquired competences through learning and general information gained on environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chou, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>A key means of acquiring green competencies is environmental knowledge (EK). EK refers to "a general knowledge of facts, concepts and relationships concerning the environment and its major ecosystems" <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fryxell and Lo 2003)</ref>. EK is "one's ability to identify or define a number of ecologically-related symbols, concepts and behavior" <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Laroche et al. 2001</ref>). The acquisition of EK is considered as a precondition of the related behavior, and this has been found to be both true for simple and sophisticated behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Frick et al. 2004</ref>). The acquisition of EK further enhances the adapting competencies of individuals. This refers to individuals' ability to accept changing environmental conditions. EK consists of abstract knowledge (AK) (knowledge about the environmental issues, such as environmental problems, causes, solutions and so on) and concrete knowledge (CK) (knowledge that can be utilized or acted upon, such as factual knowledge) <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schahn and Holzer, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mostafa, 2007)</ref>. It is generally believed that AK is more likely to influence green behavior <ref type="bibr">(Tan, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tanner and Kast, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>While EK raises individual concerns and awareness, it does not necessarily result in behavioral changes <ref type="bibr">(Zsóka, 20103;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tan, 2011a)</ref>. Attitude however, defined as "an enduring set of beliefs about an object that predisposes people to behave in particular ways toward the object" <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Weigel, 1983)</ref>, results in behavioral changes. In fact, EK and pro-environmental attitudes are highly interrelated <ref type="bibr">(Zsóka, 20103)</ref>. The literature suggests, however, that a general attitude is relatively poor in predicting a specific behavior when compared with a specific attitude with a strong predictor of an appropriate kind of behavior <ref type="bibr">(Tan, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tan and Lau, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sun and Wilson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mainieri et al. 1997)</ref>. In an environmental context, an attitude towards green behavior (a specific attitude), refers to people's feeling and beliefs on adopting this specific environmentally-friendly behavior <ref type="bibr">(Tan, 2011a)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tan and Lau (2010)</ref>, individuals will engage in green behavior such as green purchase only when it meets their primary needs and when they understand how a green product can contribute to the improvement of the environment. This explains why, for example, consumers who express concerns for the environment may not engage in the actual green purchase behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Laroche et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fraj and Martinez 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tan and Lau 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tan and Lau 2011)</ref>. As a result, we divide green attitudes into general (i.e., green purchase intention (GPI) and specific, (i.e., green purchase attitude (GPA)), and explore their relationships with green competencies respectively. We adopted environmental knowledge (EK), green purchase attitudes (GPA) and green purchase intention (GPI) as proxies to measure individuals' acquired green competencies. Individuals with superior adapting competencies will be able to accept, react to and cope with new environmental realities using their natural and acquired competencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Green performance</head><p>Green performance is the final output or observable behavior resulting from the combination of natural, acquired and adapting competencies. This study uses green purchase behavior (GPB) as a proxy for green performance. GPB is pro-environmental behavior in which a person acts in an environmentally friendly manner or purchases and consumes only products that are environmentally friendly <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Follows and Jobber, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Tan, 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mainieri et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kaufmann, Panni and Orphanidou 2012)</ref>. Green consumerism is a broad concept including environmental preservation, pollution minimization, responsible resource use, animal protection, and species preservation.</p><p>There is an argument in literature why GPB can be considered as a proxy for green performance. There is one stream of research that shows individual behaviour is significantly linked to job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Penney et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Spector and Fox, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rotundo and Sackett, 2002)</ref>. Using the theories of personality and performance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Penney et al. (2011)</ref>, posits that the primary mechanism by which individual behaviour affects job performance is motivation.</p><p>Their study argues that "personality traits are associated with broad intentions to pursue certain types of goals, and to the extent that those goals are congruent with job requirements, traits are likely to facilitate effective performance" <ref type="bibr">(Penney et al., 2011, pg. 298)</ref>. In line with the above, organizational scientists are in agreement that overall job performance are evaluated in terms of three broad dimensions such as task performance, contextual performance, and counterproductive behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Penney et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rotundo and Sackett, 2002)</ref>. Briefly, task performance refers to activities that directly or indirectly contribute to the organization's technical core <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Borman and Motowidlo, 1997)</ref>, while contextual performance contributes to organizational effectiveness and task performance through employees' behaviours such as volunteering, helping others, and possession of extra enthusiasm. The last aspect, counterproductive behavior, refers to employee's behaviors that could potentially harm the organization or its members <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rotundo and Sackett, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Spector and Fox, 2005)</ref>. Certainly, GPB can only be associated with the first two performance definitions.</p><p>There is another stream of research that considers individual employee's behaviours (such as work quantity and quality, job skills, and job knowledge) as proxy for task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rotundo and Sackett, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Campbell, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koopmans et al., 2011)</ref>. Individual behaviors or actions that are relevant to the goals of the organization have also been used as a form of individual work performance (IWP) <ref type="bibr">(Campbell, 1990, pg. 704)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Campbell (1990)</ref>, IWP depends on behaviours or actions that are under the control of the individual employees, excluding behaviours that are workplace constrained. This is similar to our use of GPB which is totally outside the constraints of the work environment but directly in line with overall objective of the green and/or lean organisations.</p><p>GPB reflects the effective green behavior of individuals whose acts are based on their self environmental consciousness and convictions. Such individuals purchase only natural and eco-friendly products that use biodegradable packaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Schwartz and Miller, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Minton and Rose, 1997)</ref>.

Individuals who exhibit lean behaviors resist any form of waste, in contrast with individuals with "fat" behaviors who easily participate in non-value added activities. More interestingly, Emiliani, (1998), posited that lean behaviour is positively associated with financial performance and quality of everyday life in the workplace.</p><p>Based on literature on individual behaviour and effective job performance, this study has suggested the use of GPB as a proxy for green performance as effective green behaviour of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Schwartz and Miller, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Minton and Rose, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Albayrak, Caber, Moutinho and Herstein, 2011)</ref>.

This significantly eases GHRM practice of identifying and hiring of employees who are committed to the environmental protection and the greening organization through self-motivated engagement and support for the organisation's waste reduction/lean practices <ref type="bibr">(Jabbour and Jabbour, 2015)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conceptual model and Hypothesis development</head><p>A conceptual model linking natural, acquired and adapting green competencies to green performance, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Roberts's (1997)</ref> framework, is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. This study adopts environmental concern (EC) as the 'natural' green competency of individual. We also consider the 'acquired' green competencies as combinations of individuals' environmental knowledge (EK), green purchase intention (GPI) and green purchase attitude (GPA). Briefly, the model relates to individuals' natural green competencies and acquired green competencies as a subset of effective green competencies with green performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>__________________________</head><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here __________________________ We adopt EC as the individual's general attitude towards the natural environment in the current study. It is only when an individual is both concerned and worried about the his or her impact on the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Yeung, 2004)</ref> and generally oriented to positive environmental actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kim and Choi, 2005)</ref> than such individuals will likely help to prevent environmental degradation and be willing to engage in sustainable green development <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tantawi et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>EC is therefore a general attitude that refers to the way people value environmental protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lee 2009)</ref>. It has been shown that this personal and/or general environmental norm (i.e. EC) positively predicts employees' energy conservation attitude and behavioral patterns in the workplace <ref type="bibr">(Scherbaum, Popovich and Finlinson, 2008)</ref>. As a general attitude, EC is considered to be a poor predictor of green behavior when compared with green purchase attitude, a specific attitude refers to as the way people value green products, which plays a more significant role in explaining green purchase behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mainieri et al, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tan and Lau 2011)</ref>. However, being more or less accurate in measuring an outcome does not negate the usefulness of a scale, especially where an approximation is sufficient. Based on the above, we hypothesize the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Natural competencies will play a positive role to mold an individual to adapt to the environment and to develop individual's effective green competencies.</head><p>Past studies suggest that EK significantly predicts one's environmental friendly behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hines, Hungerford and Tomera 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wang, Liu and Qi 2014)</ref>. The specific role of EK in determining green purchase behavior (GPB) is well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ramus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tanner and Kast 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fraj and Martinez 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jabbour, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wang, Qian, Yu, 2013)</ref>. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tanner and Kast (2003)</ref> found that EK is one of the key predictors of green purchase behavior and stated that an appropriate level of knowledge is absolutely needed for green purchase behavior. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Fraj and Martinez (2007b)</ref> found consistent evidence that indicates EK is a predictor of green purchase behavior in their study of Spanish consumers.</p><p>They provide evidence that the possession of related knowledge is necessary for the behavior.</p><p>In other words, the more knowledgeable a person is in environmental issues the more he or she is likely to engage in GPB. Furthermore, GPI and GPA are components of green competencies that are acquired through learning and experience over time.</p><p>Studies advocate environmental training to enhance individuals' environmental knowledge and awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sarkis et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jabbour, Santos and Nagano, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jabbour, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jabbour et al., 2015)</ref>. Recent studies suggest that the motivation and training of employees not only positively impact firms' achievement of their environmental goals but also act as a major driver in achieving green maturity by firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Renwick et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wagner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jabbour 2013</ref>). In the context of Chinese firms, research finds firms that provide their employees with intense levels of training witnessed the most intense environmental sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ji et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Liu et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>What the above studies suggest is that it is highly uncommon for people to naturally have all components of competencies and thoughts regarding their environment and its management.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr">Chou (2014, p443)</ref> suggested that "formal education and training sessions strengthen knowledge of consequences that flow from a lack of green behavior and enable a behavioral adjustment that is helpful in establishing personal environmental norms and internalizing green behavior in general situations or with regard to specific tasks." Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Ramus and Steger (2000)</ref> opined that creating and enhancing green competence through education, communication and incentives systems positively affect employees' green behavior. Following this argument, we hypothesize that:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: Acquired green competencies will play a positive role to influence an individual to adapt to the environment and to develop individuals' effective green competencies.</head><p>For effective alignment of HRM activities with EM objectives, acquired green competencies are more desirable compared with natural green competencies. This is because acquired competencies consist of specific attitudes, rather than the general attitude that natural competencies represent. Research finds that acquired competencies are a stronger predictor of behavior in a particular situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Horng, et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tan and Lau, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sun and Wilson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mainieri et al. 1997)</ref>. This is because individuals have some level of natural competencies, depending on their immediate environment. However, these natural competencies are significantly enhanced to a more advanced level by additional acquired competencies through environmental knowledge (EK), information and general awareness from training and exposure to related environmental issues, amongst others. This explains why employees living in large urban environments with exposure to various environmental problems, such as polluted air and water, noise pollution, and waste disposal problems have greater awareness than their counterparts in the countryside <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Straughan and Roberts 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mostafa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barber, Taylor and Strict 2010)</ref>. EK and general awareness of the negative impact of environmental degradation, a specific competence, leads to a more positive attitude towards environmental issues than natural competencies. Following the above analysis, we posit the following: H3a: Acquired green competencies are more strongly related to effective green competencies when compared with natural green competencies H3b: Natural green competencies are less strongly related to effective green competences when compared with acquired green competencies H4: Individuals' effective green competencies (natural plus acquired) are positively associated with his or her green performance</p></div>

The t-test results showed no significant difference at the 0.05 level, indicating that response bias was not an issue with the survey data. As recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Podsakoff and Organ (1986)</ref>, we further conducted Harman's single-factor test to assess common method bias. The result of the un-rotated factor loadings showed the factor with the largest eigenvalue accounted for 36.29% variance, that is, no factor accounting for over 50 percent of the variance; indicating that common-method bias is not a significant problem in this study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Data analysis and results</head><p>We employed structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to investigate the green competence model. We followed the two-step approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref> by first examining the measurement model and then the structural model to analyze the data, using AMOS 20 package. Measurement model, including convergent validity, discriminant validity and common method bias, as reported above, were assessed in order to ensure that all measures used in the analysis were reliable and valid.</p><p>Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) based on principal component analysis was conducted to identify the structure of the relationships between the scale items employed in this study. We used Varimax rotation of the EFA that captures the greatest information using the least number of factors. This approach helped minimize the number of variables with high loads in a factor, resulting in improved ability of the factor or construct interpretation. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows Cronbach's alpha for all variables ranging from 0.73 to 0.92, indicating adequate reliability of our instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Following from EFA, we carried out confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to establish the convergent validity of the data used. Convergent validity exists when a group of scales measuring a single common factor, established by the statistical significance of the loadings at a given alpha, e.g., p = 0.05. A loading of 0.7 is suggested as a minimum level for item loadings on established scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Our result indicates all items have higher loadings. Composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) were calculated using the procedures suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>. Composite reliability (CR) for each of our constructs is above 0.70 and Cronbach's alpha values of all factors are well above the minimum recommended value of 0.70 <ref type="bibr">(Nunally, 1978)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> provides detailed values and indicates adequate convergent validity. This indicates all items in the study have their highest loadings on their respective constructs only, providing further support for discriminant validity.  Overall, all our hypotheses are supported (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). Detailed results for each of our findings are as follows: Our first hypothesis (H1) that natural competencies played a positive role (β=0.43, p&lt;.001) to influence an individual to adapt to the environment and to develop individuals' effective green competencies. Individuals' acquired green competencies also played a significant positive role (β=0.89, p&lt;.001) to mold an individual to adapt to the environment and to develop individuals' effective green competencies. As predicted, H3a and H3b were supported as acquired green competencies have a strong relationship with effective green competencies (β=0.89, p&lt;.001) when compared with natural green competencies (β=0.43, p&lt;.001) and vice versa. Also, individual's effective green competencies (combined natural and acquired), H4, are positively associated with green performance as measured by employee's green behavior (β=0.99, p&lt;.001). Overall therefore, all our hypotheses are supported and we provide detailed discussions of our results and its implications in the discussion section below. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussions</head><p>This study empirically demonstrates that, firstly, both natural and acquired green competencies of individuals are vital in shaping their overall effective green competencies.</p><p>The findings of this study corroborate HRM literature, which suggests that individual characteristics, behaviors, skills, knowledge, attitudes, and self-reflection, amongst other personal factors, influence their competencies and professional performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brownell, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Zopiatis, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Horng, et al. 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, our findings reveal that influences of individuals' natural and acquired green competencies on their overall effective green competencies are quite different. Acquired green competencies contribute significantly more (i.e., β=0.89) than a natural green competencies contribution (β=0.43) to the individual's effective green competencies (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). All the measurement constructs (GPI, EK and GPA) of acquired green competencies construct contribution are significant.</p><p>The above findings suggest that acquired competencies are better contributors to individual effective green competencies as supported by literature which refers to natural competencies such as EC as a general tendency, rather than a specific attitude, towards green behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Milfont and Duckitt, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tan and Lau, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mainieri et al. 1997)</ref>. These studies conclude that acquired competencies, being a highly specific attitude, is a stronger predictor of behavior towards green behavior. The findings suggest firms that intend to do well in environmental aspects have to concentrate more on the individual employee selection process.</p><p>The process should give due importance towards acquired competencies such as environmental knowledge, green purchase attitude and green purchase intension. Similarly firms have to device suitable training packages to improve environmental knowledge, attitude and recognize green purchase intention. The results also indicate that additional effort to establish a green culture would be an added advantage to trigger employees' green potential.</p><p>The study further empirically demonstrates that the resultant direct effect of individuals' effective green competencies on green performance. The results indicates a strong and positive (β=0.99) relationship on green performance. Given that the green performance is measured using specific attitude, rather than general attitude, and the fact that the effective green attitude combined both natural and acquired competencies, we expect the individuals with such effective competencies would enable firms to meet their environmental/green performance targets.</p><p>Our findings towards green competencies development is similar to the quality culture development study carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Srinivasan and Kurey (2014)</ref>. The study reports that quality culture could be developed well if the focus is on leadership emphasis, message credibility, peer involvement, employee ownership, and autonomy. Hence, it is obvious from our study that creating green culture depends on a leadership focus on environmental aspects, message credibility, peer involvement, employee ownership and autonomy.</p><p>The findings of our study provide important practical implications. Managers, especially the human resources managers responsible for aligning employees' green competencies with firms' green performance objective, need to focus specific attention on identifying potential employees with acquired green competencies. They can do this by examining individual's degree of environmental knowledge and attitudes towards green behaviors in recruitment and selection process. For existing employees, the findings suggest that HRM should focus on well-designed environmental training that centers on improving employees' specific attitudes, rather than using the usual general green awareness, and to evaluate and retrain employees with updated facts as they emerge to achieve desired green objectives of the organization.</p><p>Our findings highlight the importance of how managers in general and HR managers in particular must take an active role in promoting green practices. As leaders, managers should offer clear and unambiguous green performance indicators and expectations for evaluating green performance to their employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.0">Conclusion</head><p>This study attempts to capture the green competencies of individuals and to identify the influential elements that enhance individuals' green competencies through empirical evidence from Chinese employees working in manufacturing, raw material extraction, IT and other sectors. This study indicates that while both individuals' natural and acquired green competencies enhance their overall effective green competencies and green performance, acquired green competencies play a dominant role in shaping their effective green competencies. This study suggests that human resources managers should pay attention on identifying potential employees based on acquired green competencies and design specific environmental training that enhances existing employees' environmental knowledge and attitudes towards green behavior. Doing this will enable human resource managers to achieve the alignment of their employees' green competencies with their firm's green performance objectives.</p><p>In addition to the practical implications for managers and policymakers regarding green competencies of employees suggested by our findings (see section 5 above); this study makes a number of additional contributions as follows. This study contributes to the grey aspects of environmental skills literature. The study also captures the effect of a green competence model in an emerging economy's context. This is important considering the fact that despite China having the world's most seriously polluted cities and worst polluting industries <ref type="bibr">(TIME, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tan and Lau, 2010)</ref>, studies on GHRM is mostly lacking on China <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tan and Lau 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Zhao et al., 2014)</ref>. It is also particularly worrying that China is only now awakening to the environmental movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tan and Lau 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tantawi et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Zhao et al., 2014)</ref>. Our study contributes further as the research model is quantitatively tested using a large-sample (1230) .</p><p>While we acknowledge the unique characteristics of each country and their respective state of environmental awareness and policies, we strongly believe that our model is applicable to many nations, especially fast-developing nations, such as the so-called BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) block. We based our assertion on <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gunasekaran, Jabbour and Jabbour (2014)</ref> which opined that the BRIC countries would have a major impact on the future of our environment and climate negotiations issues. Our model will therefore be useful for the managers in these emerging economies to understand and apply green competencies of their workforce to achieve sustainability development.</p><p>Our study also has few limitations that can be addressed in future research. Firstly, the current study is limited in its data collection coverage. For generalizing, future large-scale data collection that covers major provinces in China is needed. As of now the questionnaires were answered self-reportedly, so the risk of social desirability effect exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lee, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Future research should attempt to avoid any bias associated with social desirability effects.</p><p>Our study demonstrates the positive impact of effective green competencies on green performance based on structural equation modeling techniques. Future studies could use other methodologies such as hierarchical or multi-level modeling to test the robustness of our findings. A detailed study is essential to understand the influence on competence on green culture and performance. Finally, as suggested above, it would nice to undertake the examination of our model in the context of other nations, especially the BRIC nations, to support or disprove from our assertion its possible application and to gain insights into any unique findings from such studies.   </p></div>
