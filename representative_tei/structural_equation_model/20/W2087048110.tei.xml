<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Rationale: Minority patients with lung cancer are less likely to receive stage-appropriate treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Recently diagnosed patients with lung cancer were recruited from four New York City hospitals (Mount Sinai Hospital, Montefiore Hospital, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and Harlem Hospital) between January 2008 and November 2011. Potential participants were identified using centralized registries from the hospitals' pathology departments and/or tumor registries. We also regularly contacted lung cancer treatment providers at the hospitals; screened oncology, radiotherapy, and pulmonary clinics weekly; posted flyers advertising the study; and collaborated with clinicians serving on tumor boards.</p><p>Eligible patients (English-or Spanishspeaking, age 18 yr or older, and diagnosed with primary lung cancer within the previous 12 mo) were invited to participate in the study. Patients were excluded if they had been diagnosed with another malignancy within the previous 5 years or were without decision-making capacity. Once patients signed an informed consent form, they underwent standardized in-person baseline interviews. We attempted to enroll patients early after their lung cancer diagnosis. Patients were followed for 12 months after enrollment. Medical records were reviewed using a standardized instrument. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of each of the four hospitals.</p><p>Data were collected on participants' sociodemographic characteristics. Using patients' self-reported information regarding race and ethnicity, we classified patients as black, Hispanic, or nonminority (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">E1</ref> in the online supplement). Individuals of Hispanic ethnicity were classified as Hispanic, regardless of race. Asians were classified as nonminority because their results did not differ significantly from those of whites. Patients were grouped according to the tumor, node, metastasis staging criteria on the basis of reviews of medical records <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Comorbidity information (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart disease, diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, and depression) was collected by self-report and chart review. Performance status was assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group instrument.</p><p>We used the theoretical framework of the Self-regulation Model (SRM) to evaluate participants' disease and treatment beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. The SRM proposes that patients' health-seeking behaviors and treatment decisions are motivated by their underlying cognitive and emotional representation of disease and treatment. The five components of the SRM are (1) identity (interpretation of symptoms), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) causes (etiology), (3) timeline (trajectory of disease), (4) consequences (perceived impact), and (5) control (expectations for cure). Questions pertaining to illness representations in these domains were adapted from the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire and prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. These questions have been validated in English and Spanish versions of the questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</p><p>Common folk beliefs about cancer treatment as well as spiritual beliefs were adapted from prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22)</ref>. We used the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale (GBMMS) to evaluate medical mistrust and discrimination experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>. The scale includes three domainssuspicion, group disparities, and provider support-and has been shown to be reliable and valid for analysis of medical mistrust among minorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>. All survey responses related to beliefs and attitudes were recorded on a four-point Likert scale. Patients who responded "strongly agree" or "agree" were classified as holding the specific belief.</p><p>The study outcome-stageappropriate treatment (including surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy)-was defined on the basis of the most recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations for lung cancer treatment. Patients were classified as having received stage-appropriate treatment if they underwent NCCNconcordant therapy within 1 year of diagnosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>We evaluated differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of black, Hispanic, and nonminority participants using a x 2 test, Kruskal-Wallis test, or analysis of variance and assessed the unadjusted association between minority status and treatment. Items measuring cultural factors such as lung cancer and treatment beliefs, spirituality, fatalism, and medical mistrust were compared among racial/ethnic groups, and associations between these items and treatment were tested using x 2 tests. We used logistic regression analysis to assess whether race/ethnicity was associated with stage-appropriate treatment after controlling for age, sex, marital status, income, insurance, number of comorbidities, and performance status. The impact of negative surgical beliefs was also evaluated in analyses limited to</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ORIGINAL RESEARCH</head><p>patients with cancer at potentially resectable stages (I-IIIA).</p><p>We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate whether cultural factors mediated racial disparities in treatment. On the basis of published literature, theoretical considerations, and results of the univariate analyses, we selected a subset of items to represent the cultural factors of negative surgical beliefs, fatalism, and mistrust for the mediation analysis. Because these factors represent abstract constructs and are not directly measured (i.e., they are latent factors), we used exploratory factor analysis to identify which measured items best represented the cultural factors of interest. We identified two items as indicators for negative surgical beliefs, two items for fatalism, and six items representing the GBMMS suspicion subscale for medical mistrust. Given this parsimonious set of potential mediators, we evaluated the structural model shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Path coefficients in the figure represent direct-effect estimates from one variable to another. Direct-effect estimates from race/ethnicity to the cultural factors (negative surgical beliefs, fatalism, and mistrust) represent the change in standard deviation (SD) from the mean scores of these cultural factors for blacks and Hispanics compared with nonminorities. Estimated direct effects from the cultural factors to treatment represent the change in the probability of treatment associated with a 1-SD change in the cultural factor score. Direct-effect estimates of race and ethnicity on treatment represent the difference in the probability of receiving treatment between blacks and Hispanics compared with nonminorities. The SEM was also used to assess the indirect effect that race and ethnicity have on treatment through its effect on the latent factors (negative surgical beliefs, fatalism, and mistrust). The proportion of the total effect of race on treatment attributable to the mediators was calculated by taking the ratio of the indirect effect divided by the total effect. The SEM was adjusted for age, sex, marital status, income, insurance, comorbidities, and performance status. Estimates using the SEM were calculated using weighted least squares. The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation and Comparative Fit Index were used to assess goodness of fit. Analyses were conducted with SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and Mplus7 software (Muthén and Muthén, Los Angeles, CA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A total of 1,542 patients were screened for eligibility between January 2008 and November 2011. Among these patients, 1,058 did not meet our entry criteria (58% without lung cancer, 33% diagnosed more than 1 year prior, 3% with other malignancies, and 6% for other reasons). Among the 484 eligible patients, 368 (76%) were enrolled. Those patients who were not enrolled either refused to participate or were could not be contacted. Cancer stage information was missing in 16 patients, leaving a final cohort of 352 participants.</p><p>Overall, 74 participants (21%) were black and 70 (20%) were Hispanic. Participants' sociodemographic and lung cancer characteristics are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. There were no differences in age, sex, smoking history, or performance status between blacks, Hispanics, and nonminorities (P . 0.05 for all comparisons). Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to be married (P , 0.001), more likely to have an income less than $15,000 The distribution of several beliefs about lung cancer causes and treatment was different among minorities and is described in our previous work (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> in the online supplement) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Blacks and Hispanics were more likely than nonminorities to believe that "high blood pressure can cause lung cancer" (P = 0.03), and blacks were more likely than nonminorities to believe that "surgery causes lung cancer to spread" (P , 0.01). There was no difference among groups in beliefs about treatment complications or side effects or in beliefs related to the identity, timeline, consequences, and controllability domains of the SRM (P . 0.05 for all comparisons). Fatalism and mistrust were more frequently reported by blacks and Hispanics than by nonminorities. As we previously described, minorities were more likely than nonminorities to hold fatalistic beliefs. Blacks and Hispanics were also more likely to agree with many beliefs in the GBMMS suspicion domain, such as, "People of my ethnic group cannot trust doctors and health-care workers" or "People of my ethnic group should be suspicious of modern medicine" (P , 0.01 for all comparisons) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultural Factors and Stage-Appropriate Treatment</head><p>Beliefs about identity, causality, timeline, control, and consequences were not associated with treatment rates (P . 0.05 for all comparisons) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Participants who believed that "surgery causes lung cancer to spread" (P = 0.04) and "surgery will have bad side effects or complications" (P = 0.04) were less likely to receive stage-appropriate treatment. These findings were also observed among those patients with potentially resectable lung tumors (P = 0.007). Beliefs about radiotherapy or chemotherapy were not associated with treatment. Neither specific fatalistic beliefs nor medical mistrust items were associated with treatment (P . 0.05 for all comparisons).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Analysis</head><p>Mediation analysis with the SEM including surgical beliefs, fatalism, and medical mistrust as latent factors found a good model fit (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: 0.013 and Comparative Fit Index: 0.994). Similar to findings in univariate analyses, blacks (estimate: 0.673, P , 0.001) and Hispanics (estimate: 0.528, P = 0.006) were more likely than nonminorities to hold fatalistic beliefs (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The direct-effect estimate of 0.673 in the black race to the latent variable fatalism represents an increase of 0.673 SDs in fatalism scores for blacks compared with nonminorities. Similarly, the SD increase in fatalism scores for Hispanics compared with nonminorities </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Studies have shown that minorities with lung cancer are more likely than nonminorities to be diagnosed at advanced stages, less likely to undergo treatment, and consequently have higher mortality rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>. Even after controlling for potential confounders, we found that blacks were less likely than nonminorities to have received stage-appropriate treatment. Blacks were more likely than nonminorities to harbor negative treatment beliefs, fatalism, and medical mistrust, and mediational analyses suggested that these cultural factors partially explained the observed racial disparities. Conversely, we did not find these treatment inequalities for Hispanics. These findings suggest that attention to certain cultural factors may help improve lung cancer treatment rates among minorities while other mechanisms for the persistent disparities are investigated. Black men have the highest incidence of and mortality due to lung cancer and do not receive the same lung cancer treatment as whites <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>. Patients with early-stage lung cancer may achieve relatively good long-term survival if treated with surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. However, blacks with early-stage lung cancer receive invasive staging less often and do not have surgery at the same rate as whites do <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27)</ref>. Blacks with advanced-stage lung cancer also undergo chemotherapy and radiation less frequently than whites <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Studies show that such disparities have persisted despite increasing awareness of them among physicians and policymakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28)</ref>. These patterns translate into worse outcomes for minorities and highlight the need for a better understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Similarly to previous studies, we found that blacks were less likely than nonminorities to receive stage-appropriate treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27)</ref>. Conversely, we did not observe treatment disparities among Hispanic patients. There are a few possible explanations for these findings. Hispanics who agreed to participate in our study may have been more engaged with and/or may have had better access to care. However, this potential bias should also apply to blacks because we enrolled all patients from the same hospitals. The urban hospitals from which we recruited serve communities with large numbers of Hispanics. There may have been greater availability of services to provide culturally sensitive care for Hispanics, which may have attenuated disparities in treatment Underuse of surgical resection among blacks with early-stage disease is particularly worrisome, given that twothirds of these patients could achieve 5-year disease-free survival with surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. Blacks are both less likely to be recommended for and to accept surgical treatment for lung cancer than nonminorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30)</ref>. Doubts about surgical effectiveness or beliefs that exposure to air during surgery can cause cancer spread may explain these findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31)</ref>. We also found that blacks were more likely than nonminorities to believe that surgery can cause cancer spread; however, our adjusted models showed that these beliefs did not explain treatment disparities and suggested that there are other factors driving decreased rates of surgical treatment among black patients.</p><p>Other cultural factors, such as fatalistic beliefs and medical mistrust, may result in lower rates of follow-up with providers, adherence to staging workup or preoperative testing, or higher treatment refusal rates. Fatalism has been found to be negatively associated with cancer screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>. Similarly, lung cancer patients who have more negative perceptions of postsurgical prognosis are more likely to refuse surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref>. Medical mistrust has also been associated with lower breast cancer treatment rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33)</ref>. Structural equation modeling suggested that cultural beliefs explained 30% of the treatment disparities. These cultural beliefs may influence patients' care-seeking behaviors or treatment decisions. Clinicians should be aware of these belief differences and consider addressing them with their minority patients. Further investigation is needed to determine whether other cultural factors contribute to lung cancer care disparities.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. Although our patients had diverse racial/ ethnic backgrounds, we recruited them from one urban area. Early-stage lung cancer was also overrepresented in our sample. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to other clinical settings. Although we attempted to recruit patients early in their disease course (median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 3 mo), some patients may have been interviewed during their treatment course. Thus, we cannot establish a causal link between patient beliefs and treatment received. We also did not measure provider-related factors, such as potential bias or provider beliefs, that may have contributed to the observed disparities. Furthermore, our sample size may not have been sufficient to detect cultural factors with weaker associations with treatment.</p><p>Compared with nonminorities, we found that blacks with lung cancer were less likely to receive stage-appropriate treatment, whereas we did not observe such differences among Hispanics. Cultural factors such as negative surgical beliefs, fatalism, and medical mistrust are found more commonly among minorities than among nonminorities and may influence minority patients' care-seeking behaviors or decisions to undergo treatment, and these factors may partially explain racial disparities in lung cancer care. Clinicians should be aware of these cultural belief differences and address them to reduce gaps in cancer care among minorities. n</p><p>Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
