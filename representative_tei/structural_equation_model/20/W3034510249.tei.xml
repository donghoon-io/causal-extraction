<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study explores the impact of supply chain collaboration on eco-innovations in the context of 220 Chinese manufacturing supplier firms involved in global supply chain networks. It investigates how supplier and customer collaborations help firms to enhance product eco-innovations, and/or process eco-innovations, and how the institutional context (i.e., regulatory, market, and community pressures) influences these relationships. The structural equation modeling approach is used to analyze the data captured from medium and large manufacturing enterprises in three major sectors: automotive; electronics; and textiles. The results show that community pressure has a positive effect on supplier collaboration, which further leads to enhanced process eco-innovation. On the other hand, the findings indicate that while market pressure enhances customer collaboration this does not reinforce product eco-innovation. Contrary to our expectation, regulatory pressures do not impact supplier or customer collaboration for innovation. Overall, different institutional factors indicate divergent effects on supply chain collaboration and product/process eco-innovation. The importance of normative pressures, such as those applied through the local community and interest groups, for eco-innovations in production processes is further discussed as a typical feature of the institutional environment of Chinese supplier firms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The capability to innovate traditionally is considered a critical factor for the long-term success of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Lengnick-Hall, 1992)</ref>. Over recent decades, this capability has gradually transcended the mere economic dimension and firms have increasingly become aware of ecological and social requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amui, Jabbour, de Sousa Jabbour &amp; Kannan, 2018)</ref>. Firms need to consider these requirements in the development of new products, processes, and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Hart &amp; Dowell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gao, Xu, Ruan, &amp; Lu, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Mülling Neutzling, Land, Seuring &amp; do Nascimento, 2018)</ref>. By definition, eco-innovations, as the ecological (green) subset of sustainable innovations, comprise "the process of developing new products, processes or services which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impact" <ref type="bibr">(Fussler &amp; James, 1996, p. 303)</ref>. Thus, eco-innovations display a lower environmental footprint than predecessors; either in terms of the environmental impact caused during the manufacturing stage (i.e., process eco-innovations), or in terms of the environmental impact of the product as it is being used over its life-cycle (i.e., product eco-innovations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Rennings, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">OECD, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Costantini, Crespi, Marin, &amp; Paglialunga 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Due to changes in the regulatory environment, market pressure, and shifts in stakeholders' expectationsincluding consumers, buying firms, NGOs, local communities, and the broader societyfirms are under increasing scrutiny to improve their sustainability performance and to yield eco-innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Horbach, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu, Cordeiro, &amp; Sarkis, 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Ociepa-Kubicka &amp; Pachura, 2017)</ref>. This is also increasingly the case in China as the world's second largest economy where the environmental degradation associated with rapid economic growth in the past decade has led to increasing pressure from civil society and central government to enhance the environmental performance of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Marquis, Zhang &amp; Zhou, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Van Rooij, Stern &amp; Fürst, 2016)</ref>. Supply chain collaboration is an important factor in successfully developing innovations and eco-innovations as strategically working together with suppliers and/or customers can help to develop solutions for environmental and social problems <ref type="bibr">(Nieto &amp; Santamaria, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dangelico, Pontrandolfo, &amp; Pujari, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Roscoe, Cousins, &amp; Lamming, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Melander, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mülling Neutzling et al., 2018</ref>; for a detailed overview see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams, Jeanrenaud, Bessant, Denyer, &amp; Overy, (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Melander (2017)</ref>). Although some studies have addressed the drivers for product and process eco-innovations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lee &amp; Kim, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Doran &amp; Ryan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Garrone, Grilli, &amp; Mrkajic, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Zhang &amp; Zhu, 2019)</ref>, the influence of different collaboration forms on process, as well as product eco-innovations and their underlying institutional pressures, remains opaque.</p><p>Consequently, this study's objectives are to investigate: a) the impact of institutional pressures towards eco-innovations on two different types of supply chain collaboration (i.e., supplier and customer collaboration); and, b) whether these collaboration types influence the development of process and product eco-innovations. A focus on the context of Chinese manufacturing suppliers active in global supply chains in automotive, electronics, and textile industries allows this study to capture the dynamics of collaboration and the development of eco-innovations in critical production locations <ref type="bibr">(Zhu et al., 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen, Cheng, &amp; Dai, 2017a)</ref>. It is expected that these supplier firms adopt environment-friendly processes and products as a way to achieve and maintain higher degrees of legitimacy in response to regulatory, normative, and market pressures. In addition, they aim to maintain and enhance their relationships with buying firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Dyer &amp; Singh, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Scott, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Campbell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Zeng, Chen, Xiao, &amp; Zhou, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Zhu, Qu, Geng, &amp; Fujita, 2017)</ref>. Moreover, it is timely to investigate this in the context of China given its critical role as the world's leading manufacturing base in supply chains, and also the increasing attention to environmental and social aspects of Chinese firms, both domestically and along their supply chains. There have been increasing calls for more responsible social and environmental business practices by societal actors and government in China. This is illustrated by Xi Jinping's address to the National Congress in 2017 where he called for an accelerated building of ecological civilization and announced that "we will take tough steps to stop and punish all activities that damage the environment" <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Xi Jinping, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>By integrating an institutional theory perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Scott, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Scott, 2001)</ref> with a relational perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Dyer &amp; Singh, 1998)</ref> to investigate product and process eco-innovations in Chinese supplier firms, this study contributes to the understanding of supply chain collaboration and eco-innovation in two ways. First, it brings an institutional perspective to explain the nature of supply chain collaboration within Chinese supplier firms, arguing that the nature of perceived institutional pressures shapes the type of collaboration with either suppliers or buyers/customers. Second, it investigates how institutional pressures impact supply chain collaboration and how this in turn might affect a firm's inclination towards process and/or product eco-innovations. So far, only a few studies have been conducted which differentiate these general definitions, previous studies also suggest differentiation between incremental and radical eco-innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Klewitz &amp; Hansen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Roscoe et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Over the past decade, many studies have contributed to the analysis of antecedents of eco-innovation as well as the link between eco-innovations and firm performance. A variety of external and internal factors, such as: service capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Fernando, Jabbour and Wah, 2019)</ref>; dynamic capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Wu, Liao, Chen, Lin, &amp; Tsai, 2016)</ref>; human resource factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Jabbour, Neto, Gobbo Jr., de Souza Ribeiro, &amp; de Sousa Jabbour, 2015)</ref> and training <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Neto, Jabbour, &amp; de Sousa Jabbour, 2014)</ref>; as well as absorptive capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Zhang, Liang, Feng, Yuan, &amp; Jiang, 2020)</ref>, have been investigated, with different impacts on the development of eco-innovations.</p><p>In their meta-analysis of these topics, Zubeltzu-Jaka et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) identify four categories of drivers which have been regularly found in prior studies: technology push; market pull; regulatory push-pull; and, firm specific factors. However, in their own analysis, they find that "firms with collaborative networks and/or more environmental concerns are more prone to eco-innovate, emphasizing the role of "technology push" as the main cluster of determinants, regardless of whether a typology of eco-innovation is included as a moderator in the metaanalysis" <ref type="bibr">(Zubeltzu-Jaka et al., 2018, p.1)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to performance implications, the literature provides a rather mixed, opaque, and inconclusive picture of the relationship between concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Doran and Ryan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Tang, Walsh, Lerner, Fitza, &amp; Li, 2018)</ref>. Whereas some studies find a negative relationship between eco-innovations and firm performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Liu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Driessen, Hillebrand, Kok, &amp; Verhallen, 2013)</ref>, others indicate a positive relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dangelico, 2016)</ref>. These mixed findings induced <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Tang et al.'s (2018)</ref> study that, in the context of China, finds that managerial concern for environmental issues is an important moderator in this relationship.</p><p>In their systematic literature review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Pacheco, ten Caten, Jung, Ribeiro, Navas, and Cruz-Machado (2017)</ref> investigate eco-innovation determinants in the context of manufacturing SMEs, a subset of firms for which they find adequate research is underdeveloped. Critical determinants identified by them include: governmental policies which support the development and implementation of eco-innovations; the availability of resources (i.e., people, technology, knowledge); the perception of the strategic relevance of eco-innovations; technological advisory oriented to the environment; product and process eco-innovation-oriented methods; cooperation and partnership within supply networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Pacheco et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Tang et al. (2018)</ref> point out that very few studies related to eco-innovations have focused on China in the past despite its importance as one of the largest economies in the world with a vast manufacturing sector, and thus representing one of the biggest environmental footprints. Exceptions include the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Guoyou, Saixing, Chiming, Haitao, and Hailiang (2013)</ref> who study the impact of stakeholders on eco-innovations in Chinese manufacturing firms. They find that while foreign customers are crucial in influencing firms' eco-innovation strategies, community and regulatory stakeholders have no significant impact in this regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Guoyou et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cai and Zhou (2014)</ref> explore potential internal and external drivers of eco-innovations in China in different industries. Their results confirm the important role of the demand side for environmental eco-innovations as well as environmental regulations, but at the same time they emphasize the role of internal drivers as a bridge function in these links <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kesidou &amp; Demirel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cai &amp; Zhou, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Peng and Liu (2016)</ref> study the impact of managerial perceptions (i.e., managerial environmental risk awareness and managerial cost-benefit awareness) and resource acquisition (i.e., from business and political networks) on eco-management, eco-process, and eco-product innovation activities. Their main contribution lies within the suggestion that it is not the external environment per se that influences eco-innovation, but the managerial perception and interpretation of these environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Peng &amp; Liu, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Chen et al. (2017a)</ref> developed a measurement index system to measure the regional eco-innovation development in 30 Chinese provinces during the period of 2000 to 2014. They find that eco-innovation in China is increasing, while the intensity of eco-innovation is higher in the more developed East compared to the less developed West. Furthermore, their study finds that technology push, market pull, and environmental regulation pull have a positive, but differentiated, influence on eco-innovation throughout China <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2017a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Institutional Theory</head><p>According to institutional theory, organizations exist in specific implicit and explicit contexts (i.e., institutional environments) which consist of "symbolic and behavioral systems containing representational, constitutive, and normative rules together with regulatory mechanisms that define a common meaning system and give rise to distinctive actors and action routines" <ref type="bibr">(Scott, 1994, p. 86)</ref>. These institutional environmentsrepresented by governing bodies, the wider public and/or local communities, the media and industry associationsprovide guidelines, rules, cultural settings and routines to which these organizations tend to adhere in order to gain legitimacy as a prerequisite to access to resources for their survival and to uphold their social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bansal, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Campbell, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Although institutional theory states that organizations are subject to both pressures from technical aspects and at the institutional level, the main tenet of institutional theory is that organizations tend to become isomorphic over time as a result of institutional pressures comprising of coercive, normative, and mimetic pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Colwell &amp; Joshi, 2013)</ref>. Whereas coercive pressure evolves from institutions in a firm's environment which formulate the rules and guidelines with which a firm needs to comply, mimetic pressure stems from voluntary actions through imitation of legitimate and successful peers in an organization's institutional environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983)</ref>. Thus, mimetic pressure evolves from behavioral uncertainty on how to solve a specific problem, perform a specific activity or reach a specific goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983)</ref>. Finally, normative pressure results from norms specified by institutions, such as professional or industry associations, and thereby presents a "socialization of an organization within its institutional environment" to ascertain conformity with institutional demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Oliver, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Colwell &amp; Joshi, 2013, p. 75</ref>).</p><p>The institutional environment in which Chinese supplier firms operate exerts significant pressures on these firms to conform to what constitutes appropriate and legitimate behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Zeng et al., 2017)</ref>. Prominent barriers with respect to the least eco-innovative countries are:</p><p>uncertain demand from the market; uncertain return on investment or a payback period too lengthy for eco-innovations; lack of funds within the enterprise; and insufficient access to existing subsidies and fiscal incentives (Ociepa-Kubicka &amp; Pachura, 2017). In particular, companies in emerging economies are afraid of financial risks which raise uncertainty and this leads them to refrain from the incorporation of innovative initiatives (Ociepa-Kubicka &amp; Pachura, 2017).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Linking institutional theory and supply chain collaboration outcomes</head><p>So far, a wide range of studies has focused on the direct effects of institutional pressures on eco-innovations. Whereas vast confirmation of the impact of regulatory effects on ecoinnovations has been found <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Zhang et al., 2020)</ref>, results regarding the link between normative and mimetic pressures and eco-innovations are more mixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Rennings, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Horbach, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Frondel, Horbach, &amp; Rennings, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Horbach, Rammer, &amp; Rennings, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Triguero, Moreno-Mondéjar, &amp; Davia, 2013)</ref>. However, in this section, it is argued that effects between institutional pressures and eco-innovations are mediated through supplier and/or customer collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Sharfman, Gray, &amp; Yan, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Previous research has commonly categorized supply chain sustainability practices into two categories: collaboration and monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Vachon &amp; Klassen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Parmigiani, Klassen, &amp; Russo, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gimenez &amp; Tachizawa, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Danese, Lion, &amp; Vinelli, 2019)</ref>. Whilst monitoring focuses on evaluation and control rather than on supply (i.e., the upstream side), collaboration activities can entail different external stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, NGOs, universities and research institutes, competitors, etc., with the overall aim to improve the environmental performance of products and processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Our main hypotheses revolve around the assumption that the different institutional pressures (i.e., regulatory, market, and community) motivate firms towards a higher engagement in supply chain collaboration (i.e., supplier and customer collaboration) with the ultimate goal of increased eco-innovation development/implementation behavior.</p><p>This correlation is posited because Western buying firms, governments, NGOs, international organizations, media, and other stakeholders, increasingly expect firms to improve their sustainability performance. However, Chinese supplier firms may need to enhance their capacity and capabilities for eco-innovations, for example through collaboration, as environmental issues are not among the core competencies of these firms and the return of investment of eco-innovations are usually more uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(De Marchi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ardito, Petruzzelli, Pascucci, &amp; Peruffo, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, engaging in such forms of collaboration towards eco-innovations provides a way to hedge against lost investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cainelli, De Marchi, &amp; Grandinetti, 2015)</ref> and to maintain and enhance legitimacy. Cooperation and collaboration are important drivers for effective eco-innovation engagement and development (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Foray &amp; Grübler, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lee &amp; Kim, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Wagner &amp; Llerena, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Melander, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>As prior studies indicate that different outcomes depend on the type of supply chain collaboration, we distinguish between supplier collaboration and customer collaboration as its two main forms. These extant studies suggest that institutional pressure for collaboration varies among upstream and downstream supply chains. Upstream supply chains will follow cooperative approaches to train and help suppliers, while downstream supply chains will adopt coercive approaches, such as command and control, based on customers' requests <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Hoejmose et al., 2014)</ref>. A review on collaboration and sustainability by <ref type="bibr">Chen et al. (2017)</ref> acknowledges the difficulty in comparing the impact of collaboration with suppliers and customers and</p><p>suggests that future research should analyze whether differences in upstream collaboration and downstream collaboration could create different sustainable outcomes. Hence, this study aims to understand the impact of institutional pressures on upstream and downstream collaboration and sustainable outcomes.</p></div>

Moreover, as mentioned in the introduction, the Chinese government and communist party have, in recent years, placed more emphasis on the reduction of environmental impacts of companies which can be expected to intensify the implementation and enforcement of environmental regulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Marquis et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Xi Jinping, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>As a result of these regulatory pressures, some firms build on supply chain collaborations as they realize they are not capable of achieving ambitious environmental goals on their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Vachon &amp; Klassen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Ramanathan, Bentley, &amp; Pang, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Customers depend on suppliers to achieve their environmental targets, as prominent examples of joint efforts over the supply chain to reduce emissions in logistics and operations illustrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Oglethorpe, 2010)</ref>.

The items used for market pressure are: current and future market demand from customers of lower environmental impact products; and, the influence of other firms that have gained substantial benefits through reduced environmental impact of their products and processes. The items used for community pressure are: neighborhoods' residents; environmental groups; and societal expectations for sustainable development and a harmonious society. Items used for regulatory pressure are existing and future environmental regulations. It should be emphasized that the regulatory construct can be conceptualized to represent a concrete and singular object where there is no need to have multiple items, this means the predictive validity will be the same when we measure the construct with single or multiple items <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bergkvist and Rossiter, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Product and process eco-innovation variables.

This means the private sector contributes to 60% of China's GDP, is responsible for 70% of innovation, covers 80% of urban employment, and generates 90% of China's exports. Given that private enterprises on average are significantly smaller than stateowned enterprises (SOEs), the large majority of firms in our sample are private enterprises with just over 10% SOEs.</p><p>All of the firms have patents, while the majority (more than 80%) hold invention patents that represent more significant innovative patents within the Chinese patent system. We tested the non-response bias using the number of design patents and inventions held by the firms in two waves of data collection (150 and 70).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Discussion</head><p>Of the three pressures considered in our study, normative pressures from the local community and civil society groups are the most significant factor that drives Chinese firms to engage in collaboration with suppliers to develop eco-innovations in order to enhance their production processes. We find that regulatory and market pressures, by and large, do not motivate Chinese supplier firms to engage in collaboration for product and/or process oriented eco-innovation.</p><p>A number of explanations can be provided for these findings.</p><p>Firstly, our sample covers manufacturing firms in traditional sectors such as automotive, textiles, and electronics in which the production processes can generate significant environmental impacts on the local environment. To reduce these environmental impacts firms would have to find ways to improve environmental performance of production processes.</p><p>While environmental regulations are in place in China, there is widespread evidence that complying with regulations only provides limited incentives for local firms to develop innovations, also given the relatively lax local enforcement of regulations, 'command without control' as it is so aptly labelled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Lo (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kostka (2016)</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Guoyou, et al., 2013 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Cai and</ref><ref type="bibr">Li, 2018)</ref>. Although attention to environmental issues has become one of the priorities at national level, locally the political and regulatory establishment still tend to favor employment and growth over environmental aspects, part of the reason being that evaluation of local officials has, until recently, been foremostly based on economic performance in their regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Lo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Wang, Wijen &amp; Heugens, 2018)</ref>. Given that for the majority of suppliers in the automotive, textile, and electronics sectors the local authorities are the main regulatory frame of reference, rather than the central authorities (who directly supervise entities such as larger SOEs), pressures to develop eco-innovations based on regulatory incentives are weak.</p><p>Recent research indicates that only the most economically advanced localities in China may be willing to sacrifice economic growth for environmental protection, while others follow the mantra 'pollute first, control later' <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Pang, Zheng, Shi &amp; Zhang, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, the specific design of regulation influences innovation. Regulations that set longer-term environmental targets for companies and industries may have a stronger effect on eco-innovation than shorterterm command-and-control regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Jänicke &amp; Lindemann, 2010)</ref>. Also, a combined and coherent policy mix of market-based, regulatory, and information-based (information disclosure) instruments can trigger innovation responses from firms, but these still tend to be weak in China's environmental governance <ref type="bibr">(Del Rio et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Liao, 2018b)</ref>. Altogether therefore, this may explain why regulatory pressure has a limited effect on Chinese firms' engagement in collaboration for eco-innovation.</p><p>The significant impact of communities on supplier collaboration and process innovation shows that Chinese supplier firms are concerned about their reputation, and this often implies reputation within the local community, next to their reputation within the supply chain.</p><p>Attention to environmental issues by citizens, local communities, and environmental interest groups has risen significantly in China in the past decade or so <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Teets, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Zhang, Mol &amp; He, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Hofman, Moon &amp; Wu, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Li et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, if various locally active groups, such as local communities, neighborhoods, and environmental interest groups, put pressure on Chinese firms by labelling them as local polluters, companies are more likely to take action and find ways to reduce the environmental impacts of their production processes, e.g., by working with equipment suppliers and knowledge providers. A further reason is that these groups will exert pressure on local officials to take action against these firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Teets, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Li et al., 2017)</ref>. So, firms are more likely to respond to these pressures to maintain their local reputation with local interest groups as well as with the local political establishment.</p><p>These pressures, however, are less likely to trigger a response in product eco-innovation as the environmental impacts associated with products are mostly not local in nature, rather they have more to do with the environmental impact along the whole life-cycle of the product, including the packaging, use-phase and end-of-life phase of the product. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Xie, Zhu, and Wang (2019)</ref> who found a significant effect of manufacturing firms' process ecoinnovations on their green image.</p><p>Secondly, we find no significant effect of different institutional pressures on collaboration for product eco-innovation. Although this is in line with <ref type="bibr">Un and Asawaka's (2015)</ref> findings on process innovations, for product eco-innovations these findings are rather surprising. We argue that although Chinese supplier firms may engage in product ecoinnovation, they are hesitant to do this in partnership with customers or suppliers. While they may adopt technologies and suggestions from suppliers and customers (also the positive effect from market pressure to customer collaboration indicates some level of engagement with customers), the main reason not to engage in innovation collaboration is to minimize the likelihood that product innovation ideas are being copied or taken by outsiders <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(Zhang, Zeng, Mako, &amp; Seward, 2009)</ref>. Opportunistic behavior in supply chain collaboration has been pointed out as a major detrimental factor that can prevent effective partnerships for innovation, and the institutional environment for safeguarding intellectual property rights and contractual obligations plays an important role in reducing opportunistic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Wang, Zhang, Wang, &amp; Sheng 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Melander, 2018)</ref>. Although the legal framework for intellectual property protection is advancing in China, it is still not considered effective for most Chinese supplier firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(Zhang et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Huang, Geng, &amp; Wang, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>A third intriguing finding is the dual influence of market pressure on collaboration for eco-innovation. Market pressure is dominantly framed as market pressure for products with enhanced environmental performance, and such demand would be expected to lead to some level of collaboration with customers, as confirmed in our findings. While the collaboration does not lead to product innovation by the firms in our sample, we do not know whether this leads to product innovation by the customers of our sample firms. A number of suppliers in our sample can, as original equipment manufacturers, in fact contribute to the customer's final product innovation. With regard to supplier collaboration we find that higher market pressure has a negative effect on the level of collaboration with suppliers. Reasons for this may be the more exclusive nature of the relationship with the customer and to prevent any opportunistic behavior of suppliers, such as taking some of these innovative ideas to other customers, as the framework for intellectual property protection is too weak to counteract this opportunism.</p><p>Overall, we also infer from our study that Chinese supplier firms are more oriented towards process eco-innovation because they may be more concerned with cost saving and supply side factors, next to normative pressure from the community and interest groups. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Un and Asakawa (2015)</ref> who find a significant effect for upstream collaborations (i.e., supplier collaboration) on process innovations, but no effect of downstream collaborations (i.e., customer collaboration) on process innovations. As one potential reason behind this they argue that "the focus of process innovation is primarily on improving manufacturing efficiency and product quality based on how the inputs and components are managed in the production process. The product itself tends to be already determined, and thus, the firm needs to collaborate with partners whose focus is on its production" <ref type="bibr">(Un &amp; Asakawa, 2015, p. 151)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, in recent years there is more focus on firms developing a 'designed in China' brand, but most of the supplier firms in our sample are focused on providing products based on specifications imposed by customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Implications for theory and practice</head><p>A number of theoretical implications can be drawn from our study which is one of the first to apply an integration of institutional theory and relational theory into eco-innovation development in the Chinese context. For our sample of 220 firms in the automotive, textiles, and electronics sectors, we find that community pressure leads to collaboration with suppliers to develop process eco-innovations. We therefore establish the relevance of institutional pressures for eco-innovation collaboration. Our findings for both regulatory and market pressures indicate that more complex underlying components, such as the nature of regulation and the strength of the intellectual property protection regime, need to be taken into account to get a more fine-grained picture of the impact of these pressures on collaboration for ecoinnovation. We provide some further insight into how these institutional pressures impact differently upon product eco-innovation and process eco-innovation, this is an important finding that needs to be taken forward in further research. As indicated in a broader study on innovation, the collaboration and innovation mechanisms for these different types of innovation seem to be significantly different <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Un &amp; Asakawa, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, with the trend moving from original equipment manufacturers (OEM) towards increasing original design manufacturers (ODM) and own brand manufacturers (OBM) in China increasing attention for product innovation relative to process innovation may be expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altenburg et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen, Wei, &amp; Hu, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our research has implications for policy makers and managers. With environmental issues now a priority for the Chinese government, the design of effective regulatory pressures is a critical issue for policy makers. Enhancing the effectiveness of regulations to stimulate eco-innovations in firms and ensuring implementation from the central level to the local level needs to be a key concern. Our findings indicate that the current regulatory pressures do not provide incentives for Chinese supplier firms to engage in collaboration for eco-innovation.</p><p>Developing more fine-tuned regulatory incentives to develop eco-innovations is therefore needed, together with significant local support for companies to engage in eco-innovations.</p><p>Moreover, our findings indicate the importance of other stakeholders such as communities and NGOs to pressure local companies towards eco-innovation. Providing scope and support for these stakeholders to continue to engage in monitoring the behavior of firms can be an effective tool to enhance environmental performance and eco-innovations in local firms.</p><p>Managers can also draw some lessons from our research. Firstly, engaging with suppliers can be an effective way to develop process eco-innovations and potentially improve both environmental and economic performance. However, the path towards developing ecoinnovations and enhancing environmental performance will take time and effort. Working together with various stakeholders, such as suppliers and potentially local stakeholders, helps to enhance reputation and potentially accelerate the change process towards becoming a more environment-friendly supplier. Supply chain management therefore needs to combine aspects of relational governance and trust building with suppliers and customers next to the more traditional contractual governance.</p><p>Finally, we believe our research is also of relevance for business schools and the teaching of supply chain management. Supply chain collaboration for eco-innovations cannot be based on a one-size-fits-all approach. Our research clearly indicates that the Chinese context has a specific influence on the nature of collaboration and the incentives for eco-innovations.</p><p>Teaching in business schools on supply chain management needs to consider different approaches when discussing developed economies and emerging economies. The findings from our research, in combination with research from, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arranz et al. (2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Guoyou et al (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Jabbour et al., (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Liao (2018a)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Silvestre (2014), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Zeng et al., (2017)</ref>, can provide the building stones for a curriculum in supply chain management that is sensitive to the contextual factors in emerging economies which influence relational governance and eco-innovations within the supply chain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations and future research</head><p>The current research has a number of limitations that also provide suggestions for future research. The present study captures the effect of collaboration from the firm's perspective and not from the full supply chain. To gain a better understanding of supply chain collaboration and eco-innovations, future research can capture the dyadic and triadic effect with the views on collaboration benefits and the eco-innovation outcomes from both suppliers and customers.</p><p>Furthermore, we did not study the effect of more specific characteristics of firms, such as ODM and/or OBM orientation, supply chain governance, and corporate governance, on supply chain collaboration and eco-innovations. This is a possible way forward to identify factors that affect customer collaboration for product eco-innovations.</p><p>Furthermore, this study does not take into account further informal institutional variables, such as guanxi, defined as "the cultural characteristic of interpersonal relationship ties that affect firms' business decisions and behaviours and collaborations between buyers and suppliers" <ref type="bibr">(Geng, Mansouri, Aktas, &amp; Yen, 2019, p. 2)</ref>. Previous studies have emphasized guanxi's importance in Asian emerging economies and in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Lee, Ooi, Chong, &amp; Lin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Yen &amp; Abosag, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Geng et al., 2019)</ref>. Particularly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Geng et al. (2019)</ref> find a significant moderating role of guanxi on institutional pressures (particularly community pressure) that impacts the adoption of environmental practices in China. Future research on the influence of institutional pressures on eco-innovations through means of supply chain collaboration could build on these results.</p><p>Lastly, two recent studies investigate further potential factors in eco-innovations: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arranz et al. (2019)</ref> emphasize the influence of regional innovation systems as a driver for ecoinnovations, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Pan, Chen, Sinha, and Dong (2020)</ref> show the non-monolithic character of state-ownership which suggests a curvilinear influence on eco-innovations. Thus, besides the importance of capabilities and resources, regulation and stakeholder pressures, these studies provide interesting pathways for future research on eco-innovations. However, this study neglected the potential impact of these geographical factors as well as state-ownership, and these are relevant aspects to include in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Using an institutional and relational theory perspective, this study develops a conceptual model to identify the influence of three major institutional drivers including market, community, and regulatory pressures on upstream as well as downstream supply chain collaborations and their eco-innovation outcomes. Based on samples from three Chinese manufacturing industries, the study identifies market pressure and community pressure as the major drivers for Chinese firms to collaborate with their suppliers. Supplier collaborations induce firms to become involved in process eco-innovation. Interestingly our study shows that Chinese firms are not eager to collaborate with their customers to develop product eco-innovations and regulatory pressure has no influence on customer or supplier collaboration. The current study can be further extended by exploring more fine-grained institutional factors and pressures, more specific aspects of relational governance, and the impact of these on product eco-innovations and process eco-innovations.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data collection</head><p>We collected a list of companies registered in the Chinese manufacturing directory and used several filters to shortlist firms based on size, involvement in innovation and eco-innovations, ownership, location, and environmental management systems. In terms of size, we focused on medium-to large-sized firms with more than 100 employees. As not all firms are involved in eco-innovations only those active in the area were targeted in order to increase the validity of our findings. Thus, the firms were screened based on their involvement in eco-innovations, such as product and/or process innovations that are environmentally friendly (i.e., they reduce waste and emissions when compared to existing technologies and products), or energy-saving.</p><p>We checked for ISO9001, ISO14001 management systems and patenting activity as an indication of eco-innovation activity. The following locations were selected as they provide a distribution of different regions within China which includes more developed coastal regions and less developed inland provinces: the Yangtze River delta; the Pearl River delta; the North region (Beijing, Heilongjiang, Tianjin, Hebei); and the Southwest region (Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Hubei).</p><p>To validate the instrument a pilot study was conducted in four firms situated in Zhejiang</p><p>Province and which satisfied the sampling criteria. Since the respondents are Chinese, the questionnaire was translated into Chinese and for this we used double translation method as suggested by previous studies.

Based on the above-mentioned criteria, 1,000 companies were randomly shortlisted.</p><p>Since it is very difficult to collect data from Chinese firms without having a previously established relationship, we hired a data collection agency to collect the data during the period of April 2013 to October 2013.
