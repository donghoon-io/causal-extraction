			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The literature has shown that open innovation (OI) can be a winning strategy in improving firm performance. However, in order to adopt and implement it, managers need to resolve practical problems, such as understanding the role played by OI capacities and openness on firm performance. In response to these needs, this study aims to investigate the hierarchical relationships between openness, OI capacities and performance using a structural equation model (SEM) approach. This paper also attempts to compare the levels of openness between firms in different industries to discover similarities and differences in OI phenomena. The analysis of data obtained from a survey of Korean firms shows significant interrelations between openness, OI capacities and firm performance. Our results go further in developing understanding of the building blocks on which successful OI is built and particularly suggest that desorptive capacity which underpins the out-bound OI process, is in turn strongly supported by knowledge management capacity. It is hoped that the results of this study can enrich our understanding of the OI mechanism and provide managerial and policy implications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Open Innovation (OI), the term coined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chesbrough (2003)</ref>, has become a widespread business strategy across many industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gassmann et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, Mortara and Minshall, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, West et al., 2014)</ref>. Early case studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Dyer et al., 2004, Huston and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sakkab, 2007)</ref> have shown how this emergent innovation strategy can be applied in practice, and recent quantitative analyses based on large data sets have shown evidence of significant interrelationships between OI and firm performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kim and Park, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Mazzola et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Roper et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Podmetina et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Schroll and Mild, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>However, the specific mechanism underpinning OI has remained largely unexplored. Although some researchers have investigated how organisational (e.g., internal R&amp;D) and external factors (e.g., public policy and market turbulence) are associated with OI <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dahlander and Gann, 2010)</ref>, little attention has been paid to the inter-play between the different capacities necessary for managing knowledge in the OI process <ref type="bibr">(Robertson et al., 2012, Brunswicker and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">van de Vrande, 2014</ref>). In the literature, various knowledge exploration and exploitation capacities have been mentionedincluding, 'search' (or 'accessive') <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Laursen and Salter, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Fontana et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Lichtenthaler and Lichtenthaler, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Spithoven et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Robertson et al., 2012)</ref>, 'desorptive (or signalling)' <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Spence, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Fontana et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Lichtenthaler and Lichtenthaler, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Robertson et al., 2012)</ref> and 'integrating' capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chiaroni et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Lichtenthaler and Lichtenthaler, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Mortara et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Robertson et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, West and Bogers, 2014)</ref>.. However, the understanding of these OI related capacities is so far fragmented and incomplete. Until now, both search and integrative capacity as competences underpinning the broader 'absorptive capacity' <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen and Levinthal, 1990)</ref> have been actively investigated in the context of in-bound OI. However, other capacities related to out-bound or coupled OI have been given little attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brunswicker and van de Vrande, 2014)</ref>. Second, OI studies which attempted to apply capacity frameworks have remained mostly at a theoretical level. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lichtenthaler and Lichtenthaler (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robertson et al. (2012)</ref> indicated that other capacities, such as 'integrative' and 'desorptive', complement 'absorptive' capacities in the implementation of OI, but the validity of these theoretical suggestions have rarely examined in empirical studies. Third, it is not yet clear how these OI related capacities are linked with each other. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robertson et al. (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brunswicker and van de Vrande (2014)</ref>, who asserted that a higher order of capacity for managing other more basic OI capacities (or sub-capacities) may play an important role in OI implementation. However, there have been few attempts to understand possible interrelationships between subordinate OI capacities or quantify a higher order capacity. Last, the linkage between OI capacities and firm performance is not clear: for example, what is the most important capacity? This understanding could be highly important, particularly for managers. After recognising the influence of OI capacities, they will be able to adequately reallocate resources in their organisations to improve performance.</p><p>To address these research gaps, this paper attempts to explore the mechanisms underpinning the OI process by establishing a hierarchical model encompassing firms' openness, capacities and firm performance, and tests it using the partial least square (PLS) structural equation model <ref type="bibr">(SEM)</ref>. The study also attempts to discuss differences between firms in different industries using our proposed, a high order OI capacity, 'Openness Indices'.</p><p>The remainder of this paper comprises five sections. In the next section, relevant literature on OI and related capabilities are reviewed. A hypothesized SEM is proposed in section 3, and section 4 describes data and methodology. Section 5 presents the results of the analysis and hypotheses tests, and a discussion of the results. Limitations and future research areas are suggested in the final section of the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Research Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Open innovation process and related capacities</head><p>OI is defined as "the use of both purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation and to expand the markets for the external use of innovation" <ref type="bibr">(Chesbrough et al., 2006, p1)</ref>. Firms can benefit in a variety of ways from opening up their boundaries: for example, they can exploit the complementary assets of their partners, maximize income by selling unused intellectual properties (IP), save on the time and costs for developing innovation, attract potential customers by involving them in the production process, and establish new technology standards by forming partnerships <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dahlander and Gann, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">, Vanhaverbeke and Cloodt, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, West et al., 2014)</ref>. As OI stresses the flow of information through permeable boundaries, different capacities are required in OI's three process of knowledge flow: 1) in-bound process when knowledge flows into the firm from the outside, 2) out-bound process when internal knowledge flows outside, or 3) coupled process when both in-and out-bound process occur at the same time <ref type="bibr">(Gassmann and</ref><ref type="bibr">Enkel, 2004, Enkel et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In the in-bound process knowledge is acquired from a number of external sources, such as suppliers, customers, competitors and universities to complement internal innovation resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chesbrough and</ref><ref type="bibr">Crowther, 2006, Enkel et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>However, to benefit from external knowledge and engage in the knowledge acquisition process, firms first have to develop their 'absorptive capacity' <ref type="bibr">(Cohen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Levinthal, 1990, Laursen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Salter, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arbussa and Coenders (2007)</ref> paraphrased a firm's absorptive capacity as the capability to scan the external environment for new technology and the capability to integrate new external knowledge into its innovation process. In this regard, sub-capacities, such as 'search' and 'integrative' capacity play important roles in the in-bound process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arora and Gambardella, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Mortara et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Robertson et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, West and Bogers, 2014)</ref>. Search capacity can be defined as a general ability to look for potential valuable sources of information <ref type="bibr">(Spence, 2002, Arbussa and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Coenders, 2007)</ref>, and it helps firms to identify appropriate information from broad external sources. Firms might set up intelligence systems and activities for this purpose as happened at Kodak <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mortara et al., 2010)</ref>. Integrative capacity refers to the ability that incorporates the relevant external knowledge into the innovation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lichtenthaler and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lichtenthaler, 2009, Robertson et al., 2012)</ref>, and thereby it helps digesting external knowledge and to transform it into new knowledge. These two subcapacities establish the absorptive capacity.</p><p>The out-bound OI process aims to exploit internal knowledge in a variety of ways both in current markets and in innovative new markets <ref type="bibr">(Van Der Meer, 2007, Mortara and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Minshall, 2014)</ref>. In the out-bound OI process, firms with strong 'desorptive capacity' voluntarily disclose knowledge to less informed economic agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Spence, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">, Penin, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Lichtenthaler and Lichtenthaler, 2009)</ref>. Firms often reveal important pieces of knowledge voluntarily through scientific publications, conferences, patents and the Internet. There are many reasons for doing so, such as to gain feedback from suppliers and users, to expand networks, reputation and business opportunities and to increase higher order knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Penin, 2005)</ref>. By 'signaling' their technical and scientific capability, firms can attract potential partners and establish new opportunities for collaboration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Panagopoulos (2003)</ref> suggested that firms are more likely to collaborate with external partners if some minimal level of knowledge protection is guaranteed.</p><p>Lastly, in coupled OI processes, knowledge can flow both inwardly and outwardly <ref type="bibr">(Gassmann and</ref><ref type="bibr">Enkel, 2004, Enkel et al., 2009)</ref>. As knowledge moves in and out simultaneously, it is very important to manage the knowledge flow, inspecting and following up on what external knowledge has been acquired and what internal knowledge has been signalled externally. This systematic management of knowledge not only enables firms to deal with ambi-directional knowledge flow efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahn et al., 2013)</ref>, but can also help them to implement other capacities related to in-bound and out-bound OI. In this regard, we argue that a firm's knowledge management capacity, which not only mediates openness and performance but also affects 'search' (in-bound OI) and 'desorptive' capacity (out-bound OI), is a key factor in coupled OI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Openness and firm performance</head><p>Research has shown a significant relationship between openness and firm performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Laursen and Salter's (2006)</ref> seminal paper employed a search as a proxy variable for openness by introducing the 'breadth of search' and 'depth of search' concepts as two distinctive measures of openness. Their study showed that external search and linkages with external partners are positively associated with sales of new or improved products. Their approach has been developed further in many subsequent studies. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chiang and Hung (2010)</ref> showed that search breadth can affect incremental innovation whilst depth influences radical innovation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> also found a significant association between a greater innovation scope and depth and innovation performance.</p><p>In literature several types of openness have also been investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kim and Park (2010)</ref> investigated the effect of external R&amp;D and found its significant influence on innovation output. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Faems et al. (2010)</ref> investigated 'technology alliance portfolio diversity' and found its positive association with product and financial innovation performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Parida et al. (2012)</ref> showed that 'technology sourcing' is positively associated with radical innovation performance whist 'technology scouting' is associated with incremental innovation. There was also an attempt to investigate the direct effect of OI adoption without the use of openness proxy variables. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mazzola et al. (2012)</ref> examined twelve different in-bound, coupled and out-bound OI modes and found that their influence on firm performance can be both positive and negative.</p><p>Prior work has revealed some empirical evidence of the advantages of OI strategies, but it has also revealed that the implementation of OI does not automatically imply improved firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cheng and Huizingh, 2014)</ref>. Indirect OI measures have been often adopted and showed relatively clearly their impact on firm performance. Amongst these, the most widely adopted are that involving the 'breadth' and 'depth' of OI, which respectively describe the intensity of external information source and their variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Laursen and Salter, 2006)</ref>. Some other direct measures, such as external R&amp;D investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kim and Park, 2010)</ref> and the adoption of any individual OI activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mazzola et al., 2012)</ref>, did not show such consistency. The contradictory results available to date may originate from some difficulties in identifying appropriate metrics for OI <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Podmetina et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, West et al., 2014)</ref> and the complexities involved in the implementation of OI throughout the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dahlander and Gann, 2010)</ref>. The use of directly measured variables may increase reliability and reproducibility of the results. However, it is not easy for researchers to clearly separate the effect of OI from the firm's entire innovation process. Since various external factors (e.g., public policy and regulation) on top of internal conditions (e.g. internal R&amp;D, culture etc.) can simultaneously affect the adoption OI, direct variables may only result in a partial account of reality. This implies that indirectly measure may be better suited to identify how each innovation process can affect firm performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research foundation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Hypotheses</head><p>Based on the literature review, this paper attempts to analyse the hierarchical relationships between latent variables in the OI process: i.e., openness, OI capacities and firm performance. We construct a model (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) consisting of the following three 'blocks':</p><p>(1) Openness: the propensity of the firm to implement OI practices (2) OI related capacities: search and integrative 1 (in-bound OI), knowledge management (coupled OI) and desorptive (out-bound OI)</p><p>(3) Firm performance Our research model assumes that the variables in each block are hierarchically interrelated. The logic behind this assumption can be explained as follows. First, a firm's degree of openness can affect its establishment of OI capacities, in the sense that innovation strategy is dependent upon its attitude towards innovation. According to the theory of reasoned action, "attitude towards an object is viewed as related to intention to perform a variety of behaviours with respect to that object" <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975, p14)</ref>. In this regard, a firm that has already established a positive attitude towards OI will be more likely to have well developed OI capacities. Hence:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1) A firm's openness is positively associated with open innovation capacities.</head><p>Second, capacities in the OI process can be interrelated. In in-bound OI, after acquiring the necessary external information, a firm needs to integrate it with internal information to generate a higher level of knowledge that will be used for internal innovation. Hence, we hypothesise that 'search' capacity influences 'integrative' capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2) 'Search' capacity is positively associated with 'integrative' capacity.</head><p>Also, as the knowledge flow is a key factor in OI implementation, effective knowledge management will influence both search (in-bound) and desorptive (out-bound) capacity.</p><p>1 We suggest that an absorptive capacity is a high order capacity encompassing search and integrative capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>By checking knowledge flow thoroughly a firm can identify what knowledge is</head><p>insufficient (so is to be complemented) and which knowledge has to be shared and which maintain internally. Hence: H3) 'Knowledge management' capacity is positively associated with search and desorptive capacity.</p><p>Lastly, the capacities which by proxy represent the different OI processes will influence firm performance. 'Search' and 'integrative' capacity enable firms to increase the stockpile of knowledge and to exploit specialised external information by accessing complementary assets <ref type="bibr">(Levinthal and</ref><ref type="bibr">March, 1993, Teece et al., 1997)</ref>, and this in turn will improve performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berchicci, 2013)</ref>. Also, 'desorptive' capacity (i.e. exposing internal knowledge and making it ready to external partners) not only enables firms to crystalize their internal knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Penin, 2005)</ref>, but also provides firms with additional income by exploiting unused IPs <ref type="bibr">(Chesbrough, 2003, Laursen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Salter, 2014)</ref>. Further, as 'knowledge management' can affect both 'search' and 'desorptive', it may influence performance directly and indirectly via these two capacities. We employ an overall firm performance, in the sense that openness can affect every aspect of a firm's strategy and innovation. Hence:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Variable measurement</head><p>Since the variables in the research model are latent ones, they were measured using multiple manifest variables (see Appendix for the summary of questions). The firm's degree of openness was defined as 'the propensity of a firm for implementing OI' and measured by 1) the inclination towards establishing collaboration with external parties over a totally self-managed innovation, 2) the inclination towards sharing knowledge with the external world, 3) top managers' inclination towards finding external contributors to innovation, and 4) the level of trust between parties.</p><p>Capacities and firm performance were also measured by multiple manifest Finally, we measured firm performance using various indicators, including strategic, financial and technological performance, such as achievement of business strategic purpose, an increase in organisational learning, an increase in total revenue, a decrease of development cost, an increase of operating profits, an increase in technological level, an increase of export and an increase in the degree of in-house development. The definitions of each factor, its selected measurement variables and its related references are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Statistical techniques</head><p>The structural equation model (SEM) has been generally used as an appropriate technique for testing a theory about the relationships between various latent factors <ref type="bibr">(Bollen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Long, 1993, Zeng et al., 2010)</ref>. SEM allows the estimation of both direct and indirect effects among factors. Further, we can obtain indices of individual groups based on the factor score obtained from segmented groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Sohn and Mok, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We adopted a PLS (partial least square) method to estimate the parameters of the proposed SEM. We preferred PLS over the maximum likelihood (ML) approach which is frequently used as an estimation procedure for SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fornell and Bookstein, 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Fornell, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Sohn and Moon, 2003)</ref>. This is because ML has weak points, in the sense that it needs the assumptions of multivariate normality, interval scaling, and large sample sizes, while PLS does not require such assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fornell and Bookstein, 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Fornell, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Sohn and Moon, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Before analysing SEM, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) has to be conducted for the purpose of validating the relationships between defined measurement variables and the factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>. Further, in order to compare the level of openness according the nature of firms; we suggest indices for each factor. For example, firm performance factor was related to the eight measurement variables in the context of SEM, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. for individual respondent can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝜂 ! = 𝑠 ! ×𝑦 !! + 𝑠 ! ×𝑦 !! + 𝑠 ! ×𝑦 !! + 𝑠 ! ×𝑦 !! + 𝑠 ! ×𝑦 !! +. . . +𝑠 ! ×𝑦 !!<label>(1)</label></formula><p>(where, 𝜂 ! is the latent variable (Firm performance), and is the regression score in the PLS procedure.)</p><p>In order to find a scaled index varying from 0 to 100, the following formula can be used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Index = ! η ! !!"# η ! !"# η ! !!"# η ! ×100<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Where E η ! is the expected η ! of individual respondent, and max η ! and min η ! indicate the expected maximum and maximum value of the latent variable, respectively. Using the formula (2), we are not only able to calculate the index of a specific factor but also able to compare the levels of each factor between different firm groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lee et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Sohn and Jung, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, Sohn and Kim, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Index Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Indices</head><p>Using the suggested indexing approach, we evaluated the indices of the six latent factors. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows the weight of each measurement variable that was used for index calculation of each latent variable. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Except for firm performance, the integrative capacity index was the highest, followed by 'openness', 'knowledge management', and 'search', while 'desorptive' index was the lowest. The results suggested that out-bound OI is rare, whilst in-bound has often occurred more intensively. These findings are in line with those found in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Van de Vrande et al., 2009, Chesbrough and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brunswicker, 2013)</ref>.  2) Openness indices according to the type of business We compared the levels of openness (i.e., openness index) according to the business sector which surveyed firms belong to: manufacturing, OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), technology transfer, service and product sales. The question about the main business models was a multiple choice, hence any firm could choose more than one business sector. If a firm chose two business sectors, the datum was duplicated but the index was obtained for each individual business sector. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the resulting indices. Manufacturing has lowest index (i.e., the lowest degree of openness), while a service has the highest, followed by product sales and OEM. Secondly, we compared the levels of openness indices according to both listing in stock market and firm size as given in Figures <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">6</ref>. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the KOSDAQ-listed firms have the highest openness index (67.9). Also the results show that medium-sized firms establish a more active attitude than large firms, whilst the gap between small and large firms is not substantial (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Structural equation model results</head><p>We applied the PLS procedure to estimate the path coefficients of the proposed SEM in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The significance of the path coefficient was evaluated by T-test with 1,500 bootstrap re-sampling and the results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. All path coefficients appeared to be significant at the 10% level, except for two paths between 1) knowledge management and search capacity and 2) knowledge management and firm performance (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Openness positively influenced directly on other latent factors and affected performance indirectly. 'Knowledge management' did not have a direct effect on firm performance, but did have a positive impact indirectly via 'desorptive capacity'. However, contrary to expectation, 'knowledge management' did not show a positive direct association with 'search' capacity. These results can support H1 and H2, but partially validate H3 and H4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Direct and indirect effects analysis</head><p>We also analysed direct and indirect effects of the factors to find the one most influential on firm performance. Here, the direct effect is the path coefficient, while the indirect effect is calculated by multiplying each path coefficient from one latent factor to a target factor. A total effect is the sum of the direct and indirect effect of each factor.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, openness directly or indirectly influenced on all latent factors and particularly it had the greatest effect on 'knowledge management'. 'Search', 'integrative' and 'desorptive capacity' had a direct influence on technology performance and 'openness', whilst 'knowledge management' had only indirect influence on it. Among OI capacities, 'Search capacity' had the greatest total effect on firm performance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>This paper has attempted to look inside of innovation process by investigating the relationships between a firm's propensity towards openness, OI capacities and firm performance. The PLS SEM analysis results based on survey data suggest that the proposed hierarchical relationship is valid in the OI process. Also, by introducing a set of metrics we attempted to evaluate the degree of openness and assess how each knowledge-building capacity directly or indirectly impacts a firm's technological performance. The following conclusions can be drawn from the findings of this study.</p><p>Firstly, a firm's positive and active attitude towards openness can affect all kinds of OI capacities related to in-bound, coupled and out-bound OI. A firm can increase its openness propensity when it voluntarily collaborates, shares experience, trusts external partners and when its managers feel more inclined towards collaboration.</p><p>This increased openness will then encourage and stimulate various OI related abilities, such as 'searching', 'integrating', 'knowledge management' and 'desorptive' capacities.</p><p>Secondly, OI capacities triggered by a firm's openness directly and indirectly affect firm performance. Except for knowledge management, all OI capacities directly influenced firm performance, while knowledge management capacity indirectly influenced firm performance via desorptive capacity. This suggests that these capacities are essential elements in improving firm performance. By developing various capacities firms can engage in diverse commercialisation routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahn et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Ahn et al., 2015)</ref>. This confirms the strength of the OI philosophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chesbrough et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, West et al., 2014)</ref> showing that opening firm boundaries will offer many new opportunities compared to closed innovation processes where internal knowledge is exploited mostly in existing markets following a linear innovation path <ref type="bibr">(Mortara et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge creates new value by crossing firms' boundary in many ways, and the various capacities are all needed to operationalise OI in full. It is fundamentally also true that a firm's openness attitude will enable a firm to engage in a new value creation process by helping it to overcome psychological hurdles (e.g., not-invented-here or notshared-here syndrome) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Katz and Allen, 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Burcharth et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Antons and Piller, 2014)</ref>, which in turn contributes to performance enhancement <ref type="bibr">(Laursen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Salter, 2006, Ahn et al., 2015)</ref> Thirdly, the relationships between search, integrative and firm performance confirms the importance of absorptive capacity in the OI process.</p><p>Knowledge imported from external information sources may not of itself directly contribute to performance enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Spithoven et al., 2011)</ref>. Since not all knowledge in innovation is explicit, tacit knowledge has to be interpreted and reprocessed in order to be exploited for internal innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Freel, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Salter et al., 2014)</ref>. Thus, only after being properly processed and integrated with internal knowledge, this value added knowledge will be able to contribute performance enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Salter et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">, Spithoven et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Fourthly, out-bound OI does play an important role in improving performance. As our index analysis results indicate (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), the 'desorptive' (out-bound OI) index was the lowest, suggesting its infrequent adoption in the sample, but, its direct effect on performance ranked the highest of all the tested capacities (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>). This suggests that despite its infrequent adoption and hurdles in its implementation (e.g., high costs for IP management) the effect of out-bound OI on firm performance cannot be ignored.</p><p>In fact, as this type of OI aims to directly commercialise knowledge by selling it to other organisations, it may well make a major contribution to a corporation's performance. This also indicates that scholars, who have so far focused much attention on the in-bound knowledge flow and its associate absorptive capacity, should rather concentrate in understanding in more depth the elements and subordinate capacities relating to OI. We particularly contributed to this aspect by showing the strong link between desoprtive capacity and knowledge management capacity.</p><p>In fact, knowledge management did not affect search capacity but did affect desorptive capacity. In out-bound OI, firms have to expose some internal information, but this can decrease their technological confidentiality while increasing uncertainty levels <ref type="bibr">(Bianchi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Laursen and Salter, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oakey, 2013)</ref>. Thus, due to the risks involved in out-bound OI, its implementation is likely to be more influenced by systematic management which will play a gatekeeper role in the knowledge transfer process.</p><p>Lastly, the degree of openness was different according to firm type. We suggested an index analysis based on the proposed equation in section 4.2. Using this approach, the indices of various factors were measured and compared according to the nature of the firm and industry. It is interesting to note that, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, service firms tend</p><p>to be more open in various business sectors. This can be explained if we consider that service firms are, by nature, open, as they need to share information and knowledge with their suppliers and customers as part of their day-to-day business activity. In general, service firms did not have a proper R&amp;D department. Therefore, they tend to obtain knowledge and information from outside. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> and 6 also show interesting results. KOSPI firms showed a lower openness score than other types of firms, and large firms showed a lower score than medium-sized firms. These results have something in common. In general, large established firms are listed in the KOSPI stock list, while high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are listed in KOSDAQ.</p><p>Thus, it is suggested that in comparison with SMEs large firms are likely to be less open.</p><p>As larger firms tend to have better internal R&amp;D resources than smaller ones, they may not depend critically on external information or partners, and this in turn establishes a strong leaning towards internal innovation. Yet, as Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows, among SMEs, medium sized firms showed a higher openness score than small firms. This is in line with the findings in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van de Vrande et al., 2009)</ref>, in the sense that internal R&amp;D demanding certain resources plays an important role in enhancing absorptive capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen and Levinthal, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Spithoven et al., 2011)</ref> and systematic IP management also demands substantial experience and resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahn et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, medium-sized firms rather than small firms can take a more open attitude towards OI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Implications and limitations</head><p>We hope that the results of this study will provide feedback information for policy makers who want to stimulate innovation in industry. If they use the suggested approach, they can easily recognize and compare not only the level of openness but also the level of each OI capacity in different groups. The model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> represents a starting point for a wide span comparison of OI implementation approaches. It could be strengthened by including a more detailed set of OI activities and it could be applied in different contexts. For example future studies might extend the application of the model to larger samples of companies, enabling a global comparison of the level of openness in firms and industries. In addition the results presented here could be expanded by further analysing the relationship between openness, knowledge building and performance in each individual industrial sector.</p><p>Though there are potential benefits from this research, the study suffers from some research limitations. First, although PLS which is robust to small sample was used with bootstrap re-sampling, analysis of larger samples will more clearly show similarities and differences between firms with different characteristics and increase the general applicability of the result. Second, data was collected only from one country.</p><p>Since innovation reflects socio-cultural background of a country <ref type="bibr">(Edwards et al., 2005)</ref>, a higher level of understanding will be obtained by carrying out a comparative study of two or more countries. Last, longitudinal data can be used to discover the long-term effects of OI. In our results, no direct relationship was found between knowledge management capacity and firm performance and between knowledge management and searching. Since there can be time lag between fundamental innovation activities and end performance, knowledge management might affect searching and firm performance in the long run. However, as cross-sectional data was used, we could not examine whether this interpretation was correct. Future research addressing these limitations will enhance our understanding of OI.</p></div>

'Integrative capacity' was measured in terms of two proxy variables: the degree of external technology playing a key role in the company's product development and the degree of external technology applied to various parts in internal R&amp;D. 'Knowledge management capacity' was measured in terms of the management of the R&amp;D outputs: allocated responsibilities for managing the innovation results, availability of systematic tools for managing innovation results, and provision of regular training for managing results. 'Desorptive capacity' was measured in terms of the use of the following activities to voluntarily disclose knowledge: publishing in business/academic journals, exposure of internal knowledge to the outer world via participation in conferences/meetings/trade associations, listing patents domestically/internationally, and listing internally developed knowledge in technology transfer centres/institutes.</figDesc></figure>
