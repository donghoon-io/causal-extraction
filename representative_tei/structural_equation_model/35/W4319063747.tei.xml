<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Coupling the practice-based view (PBV) of firms with dynamic capabilities theory (DCT), we assess the effect of Fintech adoption (FA) on organizational sustainability performance (SP) through circular economy practices (CEP). Additionally, this research examines the moderating roles of a firm's access to finance (AF) and absorptive capacity (AC) in the interplays between the constructs. Three hundred responses were collected from Bangladeshi manufacturing SMEs using a structured questionnaire. We examined our conceptual model using a two-staged structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach. The empirical findings unveiled that Fintech adoption significantly drives organizational CEP and SP and that CEP acts as a mediator between the FA and SP linkage. Furthermore, the findings also confirmed the moderating effect of AF on the FA and CEP association and the impact of AC on the CEP and SP association. Hence, this scholarship adds pivotal insights to the extant literature by establishing the roles of multiple mediators and moderators in the interplay of FA and firms' SP. Given the paucity of primary-data-based research, this empirical study addresses the gaps in the Fintech, CE, and sustainability literature and yields crucial implications for theory and practice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Due to institutional pressure and environmental legislation, small, medium, or large businesses now prioritize sustainability. The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector is an integral aspect of the global economy, in which sustainability principles garner worldwide attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gani et al. 2022)</ref>. Governments are imposing stricter regulations to reduce the negative environmental impacts of manufacturing and related activities, which has prompted firms to adopt the concepts of sustainable production <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Huang and Badurdeen 2017)</ref>. Consequently, preserving ecological sustainability and social responsibility and recognizing drivers that promote SME growth are the primary challenges facing stakeholders and policymakers in the changing business landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Yumei et al. 2021)</ref>. Given the dominance of SMEs in the global economy, they are expected to be accountable for around 70% of worldwide industrial waste pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Caldera et al. 2019</ref>). These organizations must manage pollution mitigation and align their company strategies with sustainable business practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Malesios et al. 2021)</ref>. Now, firms prioritize environmental sustainability due to public knowledge and consumer preference for environmentally friendly products <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Rehman et al. 2021</ref>). However, many manufacturing SMEs have inefficiencies in producing goods and services <ref type="bibr">(Bresciani et al. 2022b)</ref>. Manufacturing SMEs confront numerous obstacles when attempting to incorporate sustainability practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Iacovidou et al. 2021</ref>). Literature has presented several barriers, such as a lack of financial resources, a high initial capital cost, and a lack of expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Caldera et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gupta et al.</ref> 1 3 2020a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Jesus et al. 2021)</ref>. Moreover, there is less consensus in the literature regarding the determinants that influence a firm's sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dey et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. 2022)</ref>. Recent studies posit that Industry 4.0 technologies can play a crucial role in efficiently utilizing resources, which can contribute to the sustainability performance of businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Jabbour et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Khan et al. 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ali et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tang et al. 2022)</ref>. In a similar vein, we argue that I4.0 technology, like financial technology (Fintech), can be a crucial antecedent of SMEs' sustainability performance.</p><p>Fintech refers to the most contemporary technology utilized in creative financial goods and services and is regarded as one of the most ground-breaking and inventive industries of recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Liu et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Najaf et al. 2023)</ref>. Although the Fintech industry is yet in its early phases, the rising trend of investments in this technology implies acceptability and confidence among stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen et al. 2021)</ref>. Fintech uses widespread machine-to-machine connectivity and the internet of things (IoT) in the financial services industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Huynh et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. However, the existing research has not adequately investigated the relationship between Fintech adoption (FA) and the sustainability performance of firms, especially in the context of SMEs. Prior literature on FA examines the impact of Fintech on firms' financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Liu et al. 2021)</ref>, renewable energy use <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Croutzet and Dabbous 2021)</ref>, access to finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbasi et al. 2021)</ref>, and agricultural sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anshari et al. 2019)</ref>. However, only a few empirical research evaluates the direct and indirect effects of FA on the sustainability performance of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Vergara and Agudo 2021)</ref>. In addition, environmental management scholars recommend exploring the presence of different mediators in the relationship between FA and sustainability performance.</p><p>To address this research gap, this study also evaluates how circular economy practices (CEP) mediate the relationship between FA and SP of SMEs. "The circular economy is a concept that encourages the most efficient use of resources by employing recycling, reuse, and recovery techniques" <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al. 2022, p. 2)</ref>. Under Industry 4.0, the CE is related to various technological breakthroughs, including Fintech, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, e-commerce, and big data analytics <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dalenogare et al. 2018</ref>). These technological advancements improve the current infrastructure by safeguarding sustainability objectives through innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Huynh et al. 2020)</ref>. Thus, the inclusion of CEP is of utmost relevance, as it can guide SME managers on how to efficiently employ financial resources to enhance the sustainability performance of businesses. Additionally, prior studies have established access to finance (AF) as a significant barrier to CE <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jesus et al. 2021</ref>) and absorptive capacity (AC) as a crucial predictor of firms' SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Delmas et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aboelmaged and Hashem 2019)</ref>. However, evidence of their moderating effects on the FA-CEP and CEP-SP linkages is scant in the literature.</p><p>Despite advancements in the literature on technology adoption and environmental sustainability, the linkage between organizations' technology adoption and sustainability performance remains understudied and deserves deeper investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Yan et al. 2022)</ref>. The environmental sustainability literature has primarily focused on strategic drivers, including ecological strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Rehman et al. 2020)</ref>, sustainability orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Rehman et al. 2022)</ref>, corporate social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kraus et al. 2020)</ref>, and green practices, including green leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Akram et al. 2022)</ref>, green innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Rehman et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bresciani et al. 2022a</ref>) that increases firms' environmental sustainability performance. However, there is a dearth of literature on how manufacturing companies' technology adoption can facilitate the business's transition to a CE model and improve environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Ramakrishna 2022</ref>). In the context of Fintech, most of the FA literature comprises reviews and case studies; thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. (2021)</ref> call on researchers to examine the influence of FA on firms' SP through primary-data-based empirical analysis. Another gap in the extant literature is that it does not offer a good understanding of the crucial role of financing in implementing green practices such as CEP and boosting firms' green competitive advantage (Guang-Wen and Siddik 2022). Recent scholarships have advocated that better AF enables SMEs to adopt green supply chain management and implement CEP <ref type="bibr">(Gonçalves et al. 2022)</ref>. Thus, bridging the aforementioned research gaps, this scholarship intends to address the following research question: What intricate associations exist between SMEs' FA, AF, CEP, AC, and sustainability performance?</p><p>We draw insights from the practice-based view (PBV) of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bromiley and Rau 2014)</ref> to explore the role of Fintech adoption and circular economy practices in enhancing SMEs' sustainability performance. The PBV perspective offers an appropriate theoretical lens for assessing firms' sustainability performance as it provides insights into how imitable and transferable practices can improve organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Khan et al. 2022)</ref>. The PBV attempts to explain performance in part through "imitable activities or practices, often in the public domain, amenable to transfer across firms" <ref type="bibr">(Bromiley and</ref><ref type="bibr">Rau 2014, p. 1249)</ref>. We believe that technological practices such as Fintech implementation and circular economy practices can be imitable and transferable from one firm to another and can be utilized to improve environmental and economic performance. This study also underpins the dynamic capability theory (DCT) <ref type="bibr">(Teece et al. 1997b)</ref> to conceptualize AC as a critical DC of firms that helps explore and exploit necessary knowledge to improve firms' sustainability performance. The DC perspective of sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities offers the fundamental framework to develop individual and firm-level absorptive capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Teece 2014)</ref>. Thus, we argue that the DCT provides a sound theoretical lens to assess how SMEs can attain superior sustainability performance through exploiting absorptive capacities in their circular economy practices.</p><p>This study attempts to examine the interconnections between FA, AF, CEP, AC, and SP and, in doing so, makes several significant theoretical contributions. First, this scholarship adds to the scant research on Fintech adoption and its influence on corporate SP. Our research is one of the first to assess Fintech innovation as a critical antecedent of the CEP and SP of manufacturing SMEs. Second, we evaluate the CEP's ability to mediate interactions between FA, SP, and AF and SP. Thus, outline the mechanism through which financial factors such as financial technology and capital might impact the environmental sustainability of SMEs. Third, to the researchers' knowledge and following a review of research databases, no prior research has empirically explored the impact of FA and AF on these two outcomes in the setting of SMEs. However, research indicates that a lack of technology and finance poses significant obstacles to SMEs' adoption of CEP and sustainability initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ghisetti and Montresor 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Sohal et al. 2022)</ref>. Fourth, our research enhances the understanding of the crucial moderating role of AF and AC in achieving CE and sustainability goals, paving the way for future research. Finally, this study draws insights from two theoretical approaches (i.e., PBV theory and dynamic capabilities theory). This study expands the research on Fintech adoption and businesses' environmental outcomes (CEP and SP) by integrating the two theories and examining the distinct mechanisms of access to finance and absorptive capacity. Hence, this study contributes to the theoretical development of PBV and DC theories concerning adopting financial technology and how it boosts CEP and SP through better AF and AC. Moreover, the results of this research provide significant insights for Bangladeshi manufacturing SME entrepreneurs on how to leverage I4.0 technologies like Fintech to achieve superior environmental sustainability.</p><p>The subsequent sections of the study include a discussion of the theoretical framework and the development of hypotheses. The part on hypothesis development is followed by the section on research methods, which includes sample and data collection methods, measurements, and analysis techniques. Following the explanation of the methodology, the findings of the analysis are presented and interpreted in the subsequent section, followed by a discussion. The discussion section compares the results to the existing literature and addresses the theoretical, managerial, and policy implications. The final section covers the limitations and future directions of the research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice-based view</head><p>The practice-based view (PBV) is concerned with elucidating the influence of imitable or publicly accessible organizational practices on firm performance. <ref type="bibr">Bromiley and</ref><ref type="bibr">Rau (2014, p. 1249</ref>) define practices as "a defined activity or set of activities that a variety of firms might execute." The PBV provides a novel and distinct perspective on strategy literature, supplementing existing perspectives like the resource-based view (RBV) of organizations. However, the PBV centers on "imitable activities or practices, often in the public domain, amenable to transfer across firms" <ref type="bibr">Bromiley and</ref><ref type="bibr">Rau (2014, p. 1249</ref>). Unlike the RBV, which describes an organization's competitive edge in terms of unique resources, the PBV describes organizational performance in terms of generally recognized and attainable activities that businesses may engage in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bromiley and Rau 2016)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hitt et al. (2016)</ref>, the original RBV emphasized macro-level outcomes. As the theory has progressed, scholars have proposed that its outcome variable become increasingly focused on micro-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Foss 2011)</ref> or mid-level outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Sirmon et al. 2011)</ref>, including such innovation and sustainability or environmental performance. Unlike frameworks like the RBV, which concentrates on competitive advantage, the PBV allows for the study of sustainability practices on the full spectrum of performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Carter et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Betts et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Given that sustainability is a societal objective that must be accomplished, there is a compelling case for SMEs and their managers to enact and disseminate sustainability-related processes that are easily imitable and transferrable rather than pursuing a competitive edge through unique and inimitable resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brömer et al. 2019)</ref>. Despite their significance, there is limited literature that utilized the PVB framework. As a few notable exemptions, <ref type="bibr">Khan et al. (2021c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Khan et al. ( , 2022) )</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tang et al. (2022)</ref> used the PBV as a theoretical lens to explore the effect of CEP on the SP of organizations. Similarly, this study supports the PBV approach, which suggests that easy-toimitate sustainability practices (such as circular economy practices) will strongly influence SMEs' sustainability performance. The PBV paradigm is a valuable theoretical lens for analyzing the performance outcomes of SMEs since it provides insights into the shifts in company performance resulting from the adoption of imitable and transferable practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Tiwari et al. 2020)</ref>. Prior research identifies circular economy and financial technology deployment as the critical practices that may be included in green supply chain management to boost the sustainability performance of businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Khan et al. 2022)</ref>. Regarding CE for SMEs, the PBV offers a supportive stance since it asserts that CE practices may be transferred across firms without the need for robust isolation mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Tang et al. 2022)</ref>. SMEs can apply the 3R (reduce, reuse, and recycle) principles of CE, for instance, by emulating the operations of publicly listed large manufacturing enterprises. In addition, the PBV gives a theoretical foundation for enterprises' adoption of innovative technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Rivera and Cox 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dubey et al. 2022)</ref>. A practice viewpoint on technology adoption emphasizes duality, dynamics, reciprocal relationships, connectedness, and dispersed agency to guide technology adoption theory and practice. Understanding these concepts facilitates the successful adoption of technologies, such as Fintech, that influence organizational and social performance, such as economic prosperity, enhanced productivity, entrepreneurship, sustainability, and other economic, social, and environmental improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kannan and Perez-Aleman 2022)</ref>. Hence, we draw upon firms' PBV to investigate the role of SMEs' technology adoption and CE practices in enhancing sustainability performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic capabilities theory</head><p>The dynamic capability (DC) perspective is a notion that refers to an organization's capacity to react to and conform to dynamic environments by integrating and reorganizing available resources effectively <ref type="bibr">(Teece et al. 1997a)</ref>. DCs increase growth and profitability by boosting the organization's adaptability to a complex and turbulent environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ali et al. 2022)</ref>. DCs are inherently useful for adapting to competitive market situations. DC theory (DCT) is regarded as a process of obtaining and developing new skills that contribute to the enhanced performance of an organization <ref type="bibr">(Gupta et al. 2020b</ref>). In the literature, several manifestations of the DC paradigm have been presented. Most prevalent is <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Teece's (2014)</ref> framework, which comprises three primary components: "sensing," "seizing," and "transforming." Sensing is an organization's capacity to uncover, assess, and evaluate technological options that may be leveraged to address the organization's customer needs and strategic goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Wamba et al. 2020)</ref>. Seizing capacity refers to utilizing appropriate methods and resources to capitalize on recognized opportunities to capture business value <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cheng et al. 2022)</ref>. The transforming capability, also known as the reconfiguration capability, covers all operational processes that reconfigure resource sets and common capabilities to respond rapidly to market movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hendry et al. 2019</ref>). This study adopts the DC viewpoint as its theoretical framework to establish absorptive capacity as a dynamic organizational capability that can enhance CEP leading to improved sustainability performance. Since the PBV does not offer a valuable framework for understanding the role of AC in impacting SMEs' sustainability performance, we integrated the DC theory into our study.</p><p>As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Volberda et al. (2010)</ref>, the origins of AC can be linked to theories of dynamic capabilities that emphasize the cumulative character of knowledge. The application of AC as a dynamic capability enables a company to increase its international knowledge base and capitalize on external competence sources. Based on dynamic capabilities, AC covers three interrelated learning processes: exploration, assimilation, and exploitation, which can improve business outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Sáenz et al. 2014)</ref>. Literature on AC viewed AC as a dynamic capability related to generating and using the knowledge that boosts a company's ability to obtain and maintain a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Zahra and George 2002)</ref>. AC is considered a dynamic capacity inherent in a company's routines and processes, making it possible to examine the stocks and flows of a company's knowledge and link them to developing and maintaining competitive advantage. Incorporating the DC theory, we investigate the function of AC as a dynamic organizational capability in enhancing SMEs' sustainability performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fintech adoption and sustainability performance</head><p>Financial technology (Fintech) is a crucial topic and application that should prompt research in many industries since digital connectivity is critical for sustainable performance and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hammadi and Nobanee 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Leong and Sung (2018, p. 75)</ref> define Fintech as "any innovative ideas that improve financial service processes by proposing technology solutions according to different business situations, while the ideas could also lead to new business models or even new businesses." Extant literature suggests that Fintech, as an example of a sector that has evolved because of Industry 4.0, has the potential to help SMEs shift towards a more sustainable business model <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. Fintech uses innovation and advanced technology to enhance, develop, and automate financial services to aid and support enterprises, shareholders, and customers handle their financial activities using sophisticated applications and software <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Vergara and Agudo 2021)</ref>. Fintech's influence on lending is indicated by the development of various routes to obtaining monetary funds <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. A case in point is peerto-peer (p2p) financing, wherein SMEs and shareholders can lend or borrow funds to develop social or sustainable initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Mild et al. 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Moro-Visconti et al. (2020)</ref> argue that Fintech services offer small businesses an option for sustainable financing through microfinance and crowdfunding. Recent studies on the linkage between digital finance and environmental sustainability have placed sustainable 1 3 digital finance and Fintech at the focus of their investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Yan et al. 2022</ref>).</p><p>Digitalization has the potential to substantially expedite the deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions since accelerated automation and advanced data analytics lead to reduced energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Liu et al. 2022)</ref>. Fintech greatly impacts social, environmental, and ecological benefits in promoting fund usage for energy efficiency in this setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Deng et al. 2019)</ref>. The adoption of Fintech has a major impact on a firm's consumption, savings, and investment decisions, and hence has become a driving factor for renewable energy usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Croutzet and Dabbous 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Muganyi et al. (2021)</ref> highlight that a firm's utilization of Fintech may influence its environmental sustainability performance by increasing environmental investments, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing resource efficiency. Moreover, I4.0 technologies can be utilized to improve the social sustainability performance of an organization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Tasleem et al. 2019)</ref> argue that businesses use their commitments, duties, and activities to meet stakeholders' social expectations and create value for society by implementing various technologies. Financial technologies can promote investments in corporate social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Liu et al. 2021)</ref>, enhancing firms' social sustainability performance. Guang-Wen and Siddik (2022) report that by adopting Fintech, firms can achieve superior environmental performance through green financing and innovation. Since several prior studies have established the linkage between firms' technology adoption and sustainability performance, we draw insights from the PBV of firms to posit that Fintech adoption, if integrated as a practice throughout the supply chain, can drive the sustainability performance of firms. Thus, we hypothesize that: H1: Fintech adoption is positively related to firms' sustainability performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fintech adoption and circular economy practices</head><p>The circular economy (CE) is a current buzzword, and as such, it receives a great deal of rhetorical attention. The meanings of trending concepts tend to diffuse, and scholars assert that the CE concept is no exception. Drawing upon 144 CE literature, <ref type="bibr">Kirchherr et al. (2017, p. 229)</ref> define CE "as an economic system that replaces the 'end-of-life' concept with reducing, alternatively reusing, recycling, and recovering materials in production/distribution and consumption processes." The CE principles are implemented comprehensively from resource exploitation to component and product production, consumer usage, and a cascade of sharing, repair, reuse, redistribution, and refurbishment activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. CE necessitates the restoration, renewal, and upheaval of economic systems, posing profound challenges to the evolutionary processes of business practices (de Sousa <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jabbour et al. 2019)</ref>. Digitalization is regarded as one of CE's catalysts thanks to its capacity to develop insights and information into assets and goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Antikainen et al. 2018)</ref>. Blockchain technology and financial technologies are considered critical drivers of the circular economy, as technologies tied to Industry 4.0 enhance resource utilization and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kristoffersen et al. 2020)</ref>. Drawing on the PBV of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Tang et al. 2022)</ref>, we posit that Fintech may play a pivotal role in ameliorating CEP in SMEs. Fintech intends to contribute to the shift from linear to CE business models (CEBMs) by enabling SMEs to access technologies like mobile payment platforms, IoT, and artificial intelligence necessary to attain the strategic flexibility required for CEBMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Rialti et al. 2020</ref>). Consequently, CEBMs enabled by Fintech can position citizens at the heart of environmentally and sustainably essential decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. (2021)</ref> highlight how Fintech, a sector that emerged as a result of the impact of Industry 4.0, could assist SMEs in implementing CEP in terms of value proposition, value generation, and value delivery. Fintech can facilitate the adoption of CEP by offering both sell-side and buy-side payment solutions that can be tailored. Prior research has also established that peer-to-peer lending could facilitate the growth of CEP among firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Fischer and Pascucci 2017)</ref>. Moreover, Fintech solutions promote information disclosures, risk assessments, financing and investor-matching, and insurance services, thereby expediting an organizationwide shift to CE and carbon neutrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Ramakrishna 2022)</ref>. Hence, we postulate that: H2: Fintech adoption is positively related to firms' circular economy practices.</p></div>

Moreover, for a myriad of reasons, inadequate access to funding tends to be a greater obstacle to the adoption of CEP among SMEs than among large enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ghisetti and Montresor 2020)</ref>. First, SMEs are usually more financially limited than large corporations <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Lee et al. 2015)</ref>, making them more susceptible to the financing costs of implementing the tracking and development operations that CEP usually entails <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Toxopeus et al. 2021)</ref>. Second, the initial costs and delayed return seem to be more relevant for SMEs than for large corporations, given their greater sensitivity to the additional costs of resource efficiency research <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ghisetti and Montresor 2020)</ref>. Third, the question of the lower residual value of CE resources hinders the SME's access to bank funding to a larger extent than it does for large corporations due to their relative disadvantage when it comes to available collateral <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Hyz 2011)</ref>. Finally, yet importantly, external financing proves to be more challenging for SMEs given the widespread shortage of manpower and management processes in analyzing and exploiting potential resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Beck and Demirguc-Kunt 2006)</ref>. Drawing on these arguments, we posit that greater AF would facilitate investment in SMEs' circular economy practices.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating effects of circular economy practices</head><p>I4.0 technologies can be incorporated into value chains by acquiring and constantly exchanging data to offer real-time information regarding equipment, manufacturing, operations, and material movements; this assists management in tracking, monitoring, and making long-term decisions concerning post-consumption good recoveries <ref type="bibr">(Khan et al. 2021a</ref>). Such recovery-based techniques substitute the typical linear "take, make, use, and dispose" approach with a circular one that provides social, economic, and environmental advantages to businesses and supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Geissdoerfer et al. 2017)</ref>. Some researchers hypothesized that CEBMs would be the most viable operational vehicles for building sustainable business models in I4.0 contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bressanelli et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Khan et al. 2021a)</ref>. CE is a paradigm that aspires to the sustainable use of resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(McDowall et al. 2017)</ref>, requiring a transition from the linear system to the circular system of "reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, remanufacture, and redesign" <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Jabbour et al. 2020</ref>). Thus, integrating I4.0 technologies can improve a firm's CEP, which, if successfully managed, can lead to superior sustainability performance. This scholarship, therefore, expects CEP to mediate the relationship between an SME's adoption of Fintech and its sustainability performance. There are a few grounds for this expectation. For instance, FA may not directly impact an organization's SP, but it may be used to restructure business models into circular and sustainable ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. Fintech seeks to assist in the shift from linear to CEBMs by offering SMEs access to technologies such as mobile payment solutions, IoT, and artificial intelligence that are essential for ensuring the dynamic capabilities needed for CEBMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Rialti et al. 2020)</ref>. Prior studies, on the other hand, have established CEP as a substantial contributor to the sustainability of businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Geissdoerfer et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. 2022)</ref>. Hence, we contend that FA can support SMEs in deploying CEP regarding value proposition, value generation, and value delivery, which may result in superior SP. Based on this rationale, we hypothesize that: H6: Circular economy practices mediate the relationship between Fintech adoption and sustainability performance.</p><p>Furthermore, financial resources are critical for firms' sustainability performance. However, we argue that the association between AF and a firm's SP is rather indirect. There could be different intervening factors like green financing, circular economy practices, and green supply chain management that mediate the impact of AF on firms' SP. Lack of financing is one of the most crucial barriers for CEP, particularly for SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ghisetti and Montresor 2020)</ref>. The shift to CE necessitates the assessment of the financial rewards attached to it, prompting a rethinking of the economic connections among the several stakeholders dealing with the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Geissdoerfer et al. 2017)</ref>. This is especially pertinent for SMEs, which face greater financial restrictions than large corporations. Subsequently, SMEs' implementation of sustainable practices is frequently hindered by the existence of financial hurdles <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderating effects of access to finance</head><p>Prior studies argue that adopting I4.0 technologies substantially affects developing CEBMs. However, one of the significant barriers to the transition toward CE is the lack of financial resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jesus et al. 2021</ref>). Technology implementations are not adequate for an organizational shift to CE models. We argue that access to finance can be influential in enhancing the impacts of different drivers of CEP in a firm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study context</head><p>A survey of Bangladeshi manufacturing SMEs was conducted to evaluate the suggested hypotheses. These SMEs were selected because they operate in a dynamic and competitive market that necessitates strategic approaches for growth and success, such as the latest technology adoption and CEP. Regarding country selection, we have chosen Bangladesh as a context for our empirical study for diverse reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Holgersson 2013)</ref>. SMEs are the backbone of the Bangladeshi economy, employing 7.8 million people directly while supporting 31.2 million (LightCastle Analytics Wing 2020). SMEs contribute around 25% of the nation's GDP and have the potential to contribute much more. Moreover, as a developing country, Bangladesh is making considerable advances in meeting the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Rahman 2021)</ref>, which has contributed to the growth of several industries, including SMEs. However, Bangladesh's vulnerable SMEs took the brunt of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Many businesses were permanently shut down, while others suffered financial losses.</p><p>In addition, financial obstacles frequently prevent these SMEs from implementing sustainable practices. Prior research on the adoption of CE and sustainability actions by SMEs has also revealed that SMEs need financial incentives to compensate for the opportunity costs associated with reconfiguring their operations. In this regard, I4.0 technologies, such as Fintech platforms, facilitate SMEs' implementation of CE and sustainability activities by offering alternative funding channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021</ref>). Initially, Bangladeshi SMEs resisted embracing sustainable practices and adhering to environmental legislation. However, as international organizations finance SMEs to comply with environmental standards, the scenario is progressively improving. International development organizations have funded Bangladeshi manufacturing SMEs to enhance worker safety, green manufacturing technologies, and environmental considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Islam 2021)</ref>. In Bangladesh, Agence Francaise de Développement (AFD) has contributed 50 million euros to green SME investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Islam 2021)</ref>. The Sustainable Enterprise Project (SEP) of the World Bank is directly assisting 40,000 Bangladeshi small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in implementing environmental initiatives and diversifying their portfolios incorporating ecological stewardship, waste and emissions control, and improved workplace health and safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Yoshijima et al. 2020</ref>). These small businesses continually adopt technological advancements to achieve environmental sustainability (The Financial Express 2022). Bangladeshi SMEs are using Fintech platforms that offer digital lending and collaborative credit scoring for SMEs (The Business Standard 2022). Hence, it is crucial to investigate how adopting Fintechs may enable Bangladeshi SMEs to transit to a CE business model and attain superior sustainability performance. and SP of Bangladeshi SMEs. We pre-tested the questionnaire by two academics and four SME managers to ensure the validity of the survey instrument. The primary purpose of the pre-test was to identify questions that respondents could find unclear. Participants' feedback suggested that a few items were ambiguous; therefore, we simplified those to improve precision. As a result of input from the pilot survey, minor adjustments were made to the survey questions. The survey data was collected from SME managers with a thorough understanding of their firm's operations and performance. We employed simple random sampling to choose the respondents. The questionnaire was distributed to 410 SMEs along with a cover letter describing the study's aims and emphasizing that participation was voluntary. Furthermore, respondents were informed that their responses would be kept entirely anonymous and used solely for academic research. Following a reminder, 300 usable and complete surveys were returned, yielding a response rate of 73.17%. This study's data was collected between July 2021 and January 2022.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>We assessed all the model's hypotheses using several questionnaire items. All indicators were extracted from formerly published studies. We modified some indicators to fit the setting of the study. The exogenous variables were quantified using a five-point Likert scale. Prior to the primary inquiry, the instrument was created based on the method outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Mishra et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hair et al. (2012)</ref>. Three SME experts were provided with the complete set of study constructs. On a three-point Likert scale, participants were then asked to score the extent to which they considered these questions properly reflected their respective concepts: 3 indicates a high degree of accuracy, 2 suggests moderate accuracy, and 1 indicates no accuracy. The survey instrument included all items that were evaluated "three" by at least two professionals and were not graded "one" by any of the professionals. This study's measuring instruments were derived from previous literature on the topic. There is a dearth of literature on adopting Fintech at the firm level, particularly in the context of SMEs. Therefore, seven FA items were extracted from a study on banks' adoption of Fintech by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dwivedi et al. (2021)</ref>, modified according to the context of this research, and measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Respondents were asked if using Fintech has promoted innovation, provided new channels, complied with the country's legislation, and so on. Next, access to finance was incorporated in this study as a moderator between FA and CEP. Five items were derived from the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Wasiuzzaman (2019)</ref> to measure the AF construct. The participants were asked about the cost, availability, range of financial services, and the size of the loans available to them. Next, the mediator, CEP, was measured using 4 items adopted from Zeng et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Zhu et al. (2005)</ref>.

In addition, PLS-SEM imposes fewer limitations on sample size and non-normal distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Leong et al. 2013)</ref>. Given that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yielded p-values less than 0.001 for each item, the analysis concluded that the data are not multivariate normal. PLS-SEM was considered more appropriate for this study than CB-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Islam et al. 2019</ref>). In addition, the PLS literature strongly recommends G*power analysis for calculating the proper sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hair Jr. et al. 2016)</ref>. Thus, we evaluated the sample size with the G*Power 3.1.9.7 software, an update of earlier versions. Our sample size of 300 had sufficient statistical power, exceeding the minimum sample size of 118 determined by G*power, with a power level of 0.80, 10 predictors, an alpha value of 0.05, and an effect size of 0.15. Since PLS-SEM can only detect linear associations, the artificial neural network (ANN) approach was used in the second stage of analysis to assess the relevance of the predictors by identifying the complicated linear and nonlinear associations among the constructs. As non-linear interactions exist between the variables, we further performed ANN analysis using the significant predictors from the SEM analysis to rank their normalized importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Yan et al. 2022)</ref>.

Regarding the procedural steps, participants were assured of their responses' anonymity and confidentiality. Moreover, simple sentences were employed, and uncommon jargon was eliminated from the questionnaire to prevent misunderstandings. Regarding statistical solutions, Harman's single-factor test was undertaken according to the criteria of <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Podsakoff et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model</head><p>First, we assessed the reliability and validity of all the measures employed in this research. The outcomes are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below. The average variance extracted (AVE), Cronbach's alpha (CA), and composite reliability (CR) are  <ref type="table">2</ref> as metrics of reliability and validity. The values indicated that the validity and reliability meet the established standards. All constructs exceeded the acceptable value of 0.70 for CR <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Wasko and Faraj 2005)</ref>. CA values for each construct were also above the 0.70 thresholds, indicating excellent construct reliability as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hair et al. (2016)</ref>. The principle underlying convergent validity (CV) is that the theoretical foundation for associated measures is statistically related. AVE values greater than 0.5 were utilized to diagnose CV <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fornell and Larcker 1981)</ref>. The CV is further supported by the fact that each model item has a considerable and significant standard loading on its target construct. Except for the AF1 item (0.676) of the access to finance factor, all outer loadings were greater than 0.70. However, in line with the guidance of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hair et al. (2016)</ref>, it was retained for further investigation as the loading was statistically significant, and its removal did not improve the CR of the respective factor. The AVE values of our model constructs ranging from 0.562 to 0.727 corroborate the CV of the measures (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Discriminant validity (DV) was then tested, employing the Fornell-Larcker criterion to empirically establish that all the constructs are distinct from one another. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> displays that the square roots of the AVEs are greater than the inter-construct correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fornell and Larcker 1981)</ref>. To ensure acceptable DV, the diagonal values in the associated rows and columns should be substantially bigger than the off-diagonal elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Roldán and Sánchez-Franco 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model</head><p>The dataset was examined for potential multicollinearity issues before analyzing the structural model. The inner variance inflation factor (VIF) scores were checked for each construct to ensure the absence of multicollinearity. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hair et al. (2011)</ref>, a VIF score below 5 shows a lack of multicollinearity. The highest VIF value recorded was 2.603, confirming the absence of multicollinearity. After ensuring that the model does not present any multicollinearity problem, it was suitable for PLS-SEM.</p><p>We used SmartPLS 3.3.3 to assess the structural model and test the proposed hypotheses in this investigation (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The bootstrapping technique was carried out with 5000 subsamples and 300 observations to assess the significance of the linkages among our model's constructs. Since PLS does not provide overall goodness of fit metrics, R 2 and </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">GoF = ( √ (AVE * R 2 )) 0.642</formula><p>Q 2 are the principal methods for determining the predictive potential of the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Wasko and Faraj 2005)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> demonstrates that all R 2 values are greater than 0.1 (CEP = 0.518, SP = 0.766), indicating strong explanatory power of the latent variables. As a result, the capability for prediction is established <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Falk and Miller 1992)</ref>. Additionally, Q 2 proves the predictive relevance of endogenous components. A Q 2 value greater than 0 indicates that the model is predictively relevant. The results show that the predictive relevance of our constructs is high (CEP = 0.390, SP = 0.504; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Tenenhaus et al. (2005)</ref> developed the goodness of fit (GoF) index, a standardized method for assessing the model's fit. The GoF statistic is computed by taking the square root of the product of the mean AVE and mean R 2 values (for endogenous variables). <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Wetzels et al. (2009)</ref> determined the proper cut-off values for evaluating the outcomes of the GoF estimate as follows: GoFsmall = 0.1, GoFmedium = 0.25, and GoFlarge = 0.36. The GoF value of our model is 0.642, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>, reflecting an excellent model fit.</p><p>After assessing the model's multicollinearity, predictive relevance, and goodness of fit, we analyzed the direct and indirect paths between FA, AF, CEP, AC, and SP. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> contains each hypothesis's path coefficients, standard errors, and t-values.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> reports both the direct and indirect effects of the model constructs. First, we observed that FA significantly positively impacts firms' SP (β = 0.126, t = 2.700, p = 0.0007), H1 was confirmed. Moreover, FA strongly influences firms' circular economy practices (β = 0.515, t = 10.728, p = 0.000), supporting H2. The effects of FA on CEP were observed to be substantially larger and more significant than its effects on a firm's SP. Next, AF has a significant and positive association with firms' CEP (β = 0.408, t = 7.837, p = 0.000), confirming H3a. Additionally, the findings confirmed the strong linkage between AF and firms' SP (β = 0.152, t = 4.500, p = 0.000). Hence, H3b was also accepted. Furthermore, circular economy practices were observed to have a strong positive effect on a firm's SP (β = 0.245, t = 5.055, p = 0.000), thereby validating H4. Lastly, the direct impact of AC on SP was also confirmed (β = 0.450, t = 8.328, p = 0.000), thus supporting hypothesis H5 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>The mediation analysis revealed that CEP has a robust mediating effect on the FA-SP linkage (β = 0.126, t = 4.612, p = 0.000), supporting H6. Next, we observed that firms' CEP also mediates the association between AF and SP (β = 0.100, t = 4.214, p = 0.000); thereby, H7 was also confirmed. To incorporate AF and AC as moderators in our SEM analysis, we created an interaction variable with standardized indicators to prevent collinearity issues and compare coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Henseler and Chin 2010)</ref>. The analysis demonstrates a significant but negative moderating effect of AF (β = -0.232, t = 6.560, p = 0.000), implying that greater access to finance mitigates the impact of FA on a firm's SP. Thus, H8 was accepted. Finally, we observed a positive and significant moderating role of AC in the CEP-SP linkage (β = 0.135, t = 3.591, p = 0.000), indicating that better AC strengthens the relationship between a firm's CEP and SP. Hence, all the hypotheses were supported. Figures <ref type="figure">4</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref> illustrate the moderating effects of AF and AC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second stage: artificial neural network approach</head><p>Drawing insights from Liébana-Cabanillas et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>), we used the significant variables of the PLS-SEM path analysis as input neurons for the ANN model in the subsequent stage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). The ANN analysis in this study was conducted using the SPSS neural network (NN) module. The ANN algorithm can capture both linear and nonlinear linkages and does not require a normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Leong et al. 2013)</ref>. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) utilizing the FFBP algorithm was reported in the current study. MLP has three layers: input, hidden, and output. SPSS 20.0 supported tenfold cross-validation with a data partition of 90:10 for testing and training. The hidden neurons were generated in an impulsive manner, and the sigmoid function was applied to both the hidden and output layers. According to the number of non-zero synaptic weights connected to the neural network's hidden layer, the importance of the predictor variables was established (Leong  <ref type="bibr">. 2020)</ref>. Given that only significant factors from SEM are employed in ANN models, the conceptual model can be split into two ANN models, and an illustration of one of them is portrayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>.</p><p>Model 1 (output-SP) has four inputs: FA, AF, CEP, and AC, while model 2 (output-CEP) only has two: FA and AF. To prevent model overfitting, a tenfold cross-validation approach was conducted, with 90% of the data used for network training and 10% for testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Leong et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Liébana-Cabanillas et al. 2017)</ref>. Root mean square of error (RMSE) was used to evaluate the accuracy of NN models <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al. 2017)</ref>. The RMSE values for To assess the predictive ability of each input neuron, we performed sensitivity analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>) to derive the normalized importance of each neuron by dividing its relative importance by its maximum importance and presenting the result as a percentage <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Leong et al. 2013)</ref>. As per the ANN sensitivity analysis provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>, the most significant determinants of SP are absorptive capacity, followed by Fintech adoption, circular economy practices, and access to finance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study's findings indicate the relative importance of firm-level FA in influencing CE and sustainability performance. Several contributions are made to the literature on the causal relationship between FA, AF, CEP, and AC and sustainability performance. First, the finding revealed that Fintech adoption favorably affects the sustainability performance of businesses. This finding is consistent with prior studies that associated Fintech with triple-bottom-line sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Muganyi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. For instance, a firm's use of Fintech may impact its environmental sustainability performance by boosting environmental investments, reducing carbon emissions, and improving resource efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Muganyi et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, Fintech adoption improves peer-to-peer (p2p) financing, allowing SMEs and shareholders to lend or borrow funds to build environmental or sustainable initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Mild et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. Fintech can also encourage investments in corporate social responsibility, thereby improving the social sustainability performance of SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Liu et al. 2021)</ref>. It is expected that in SME sector, where financial barriers are well documented, adopting financial technologies can aid businesses in obtaining funds for investing in environmental and sustainable projects. A significant linkage between FA and SP cements the PBV that argues that technological practices like Fintech adoption that can be imitated and transferred across firms lead to superior performance.</p><p>Second, our findings suggest that FA is positively associated with circular economy practices in firms. This finding is in line with previous studies which reported a strong effect of I4.0 technologies like Fintech on firms' circular economy practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kristoffersen et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Ramakrishna 2022)</ref>. Recent CE literature emphasizes that Fintech enables SMEs to access technology such as mobile payment platforms, IoT, and artificial intelligence, which are essential to achieve the strategic flexibility necessary for CEBMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Rialti et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. 2021)</ref>. Fintech may facilitate the CE by augmenting financial information with product details, including material characteristics, emissions along the supply chain, guidelines for disassembly/recycling, and product profiles and images for the resale/share economy. Furthermore, Fintech advancements simplify data disclosures, risk assessments, financing, investor matching, and insurance, accelerating the system-wide shift to a circular economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Ramakrishna 2022)</ref>. Third, we observe that improved access to finance drives circular economy activities  substantially. The existing literature has previously demonstrated that access to financial resources is one of the most significant obstacles to adopting CE <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Iacovidou et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Jesus et al. 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, SMEs have more significant financial obstacles than large firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Lee et al. 2015)</ref>, making them more vulnerable to the financing costs of implementing the tracking and development activities that CEP typically requires <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Toxopeus et al. 2021)</ref>. Consequently, access to capital can boost SME investment in circular economy practices. Fourth, the findings revealed that access to finance has a direct effect on SMEs' sustainability performance. Firms with greater access to credit can invest the gathered funds in lowering energy usage, business waste, resource consumption, and the cost of waste treatment, therefore enhancing the organization's environmental and sustainability performance. This finding is analogous to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Ullah et al. (2021)</ref>, who argue that access to internal and external financing leads to superior sustainability performance in SMEs. Prior research suggests that a crucial impediment to the effective implementation of green and sustainable business practices in lean SMEs is a financial constraint, given the absence of immediate quantifiable benefits, high operating costs, and declining sales because of the premium price of green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Caldera et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kahupi et al. 2021)</ref>. Fifth, our findings suggest that circular economy practices are significantly associated with firms' sustainability performance. This finding is in line with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Corona et al. (2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">), Rodríguez-Espíndola et al. (2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">), and Walker et al. (2022)</ref>, who argue that CEP is an important determinant of organizational SP. The negative environmental effect of corporate activities can be minimized by employing circular economy practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Khan et al. 2022)</ref>. Circular economy (CE) emerged as a modern ideology that improves businesses' economic, environmental, and social factors to shift the entire society toward greater sustainability through the engagement of all stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dey et al. 2020)</ref>. CEP is imitable practice that can be transferred across firms. Hence, this finding also validates the PBV, which asserts that imitable and transferrable practices like CEP can drive organizational sustainability performance <ref type="bibr">(Khan et al. 2021c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tang et al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Sixth, we observe a strong positive association between a firm's absorptive capacity and sustainability performance. This positive association suggests that if a company can effectively manage its capabilities and knowledge resources, it will improve its corporate sustainability. This finding is congruent with numerous studies that have reported a positive linkage between AC and SP over the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Shahzad et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Dzhengiz and Niesten 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bhupendra and Sangle 2022)</ref>. AC contributes to the implementation of sustainable practices since a successful execution involves combining knowledge from many sources, which frequently transcend organizational borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(McWilliams and Siegel 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Delmas et al. 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Dzhengiz and Niesten (2020)</ref> argue that firms with a higher AC can assimilate, convert, and exploit knowledge to generate environmental competencies and capabilities, which drives sustainability performance. This finding supports the DCT since AC is a dynamic capability that facilitates the improvement of managerial competencies and organizational capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dzhengiz and Niesten 2020)</ref> to enhance performance in a changing environment. The finding also demonstrates that CEP mediates the FA-SP and AF-SP associations. This observation resonates with past studies indicating that I4.0 technologies, such as Fintech, are drivers of the circular economy, which, if successfully implemented, may enhance an organization's sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Khan et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tang et al. 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pizzi et al. (2021)</ref> conclude that CEBM mediates the association between Fintech adoption and organizational sustainability. Moreover, extant literature suggests that SMEs with better AF can invest in green and CE initiatives, leading to better sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Caldera et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Jesus et al. 2021)</ref>. The findings also revealed the moderating effect of AF on the FA-CEP linkage and moderating effect of AC on the CEP-SP association. Since one of the critical features of Fintech is that it can provide access to financial resources to SMEs for CE investments, already having a better AF may dampen the effects of FA on CEP. It could be a reason for the negative moderating effect of AF on the association between Fintech adoption and circular economy practices. The moderating impact of AC supports prior research that suggests that firms with higher absorptive capacity can better implement CEP to ensure sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dzhengiz and Niesten 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Marrucci et al. 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and implications</head><p>This research aimed to assess the influence of Fintech innovations on the circular economy practices and sustainability performance of Bangladeshi manufacturing SMEs. Furthermore, the moderating impacts of access to financing and companies' absorptive capacity among the relationships were examined. Our two-staged SEM-ANN investigation demonstrated that Fintech substantially impacts the CEP and SP of businesses. Fintech innovations may mitigate environmental challenges and boost the productivity of businesses with high pollution levels in several ways. Fintech innovation promotes the expansion of green financing via green loans and investments, thus promoting green growth and ecological sustainability. In addition, Fintech contributes to the transition from linear to CE business models by providing SMEs with access to the technologies, such as mobile payment platforms, IoT, and AI, required to achieve the strategic flexibility needed for CE implementation. We observed that enterprises' access to financing amplifies the influence of FA on SP. In addition, circular economy practices have a favorable effect on the sustainability performance of organizations, and firms' absorptive capacity strengthens this relationship. Furthermore, better access to financial resources improves CE adoption and manufacturing firms' ensuing sustainability performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>This study makes several theoretical contributions to the existing literature on Fintech, CEP, AC, and sustainability performance. First, our research enhances the sparse literature on SMEs in emerging economies by extending the conceptual framework of PBV and DCT. Regarding PBV and DCT, this study has significant implications for enhancing CEP and attaining superior sustainability performance in a highly competitive context. Our study extends the research on Fintech adoption and environmental effects (CEP and SP) of firms by merging the two theories and studying the various processes through which access to financing and absorptive capacity affect the outcome. Second, despite the remarkable global growth of Fintech, little is known about the impact of Fintech adoption on a company's sustainability practices in the age of the fourth industrial revolution (I4.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pizzi et al. 2021</ref>). This study offers a better comprehension of how organizations may enhance their sustainability performance by embracing and utilizing financial technology, thereby bridging the research gap. Our research provides empirical evidence to support the claim that deploying financial technology is critical for improving CEP and SP.</p><p>Our findings suggest that adopting Fintech positively affects CEP and SP, which is compatible with the PBV theory. This conclusion is consistent with results from other regions of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Khan et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tang et al. 2022</ref>). Thus, it can be argued that the PBV theory is not geographically constrained and may be used worldwide to achieve CEP and SP objectives. Hence, our research expands the scope of the PBV hypothesis.</p><p>Third, our research contributes to the extant literature by establishing a direct linkage between CEP and sustainability performance. It implies that an increase in circular economy activities significantly affects the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi SMEs. This finding is a critical contribution to the existing research in developing economies, given the preponderance of studies demonstrating a direct relationship between CEP and SP conducted in developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dey et al. 2020)</ref>. Using the PBV paradigm, our finding expands the discourse on the importance of green practices, particularly CEPs, in the sustainability performance of organizations. Fourth, the present work extends the CE literature by assessing the mediating effect of CEP on the interplay between FA and SP. Existing work has predominantly focused on the CEP as a product of I4.0 technologies <ref type="bibr">(Khan et al. 2021c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tang et al. 2022</ref>) and a promoter of organizations' SP <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dey et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Khan et al. 2021b</ref>) while ignoring its mediating function. Our study focuses on the mediating impact of CEP between FA and SP. The empirical evidence reveals that CEP positively mediates the relationship between FA and SP. Thus, findings suggest that adopting Fintech enables SMEs to invest in CEP initiatives, including reducing, reusing, and recycling materials which can substantially boost firms' SP. Given the paucity of studies exploring the crucial mediating function of CEP in the FA-SP relationship, our findings contribute to the literature.</p><p>Fifth, this study incorporates AF and AC as crucial moderators and demonstrates that AF directly affects CEP, and AC directly affects firms' SP. Our research adds to the AF and AC literature by establishing their roles in the transition toward circular economy and sustainability. A voluminous 1 3 literature has documented financial barriers as one of the significant barriers to a circular economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Caldera et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Jesus et al. 2021)</ref>. However, in the context of SMEs, this is one of the pioneer studies that empirically examined the role of access to capital in enhancing CEP. Moreover, several studies have established the positive effect of AC on organizational sustainability. We adopted the DC view of firms to explain how AC as a dynamic capability can strengthen the impact of CE on firms' SP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial and policy implications</head><p>Our study findings have substantial implications for SME managers in emerging economies. We suggest that a combination of Fintech, better access to finance, and absorptive capacity is pivotal for enhanced circular economy practices and sustainability performance of SMEs. Fintech offers a vast array of funding and peer-to-peer lending alternatives, enabling SMEs to alleviate their financial constraints. Managers of SMEs can evaluate whether a company's activities have a favorable or deleterious effect on each SDG. Using contemporary Fintech innovations like "Robo-advisors," they can channel the capital of small investors to sustainable projects. Using blockchain technology, SMEs can monitor CE activities and assess the environmental effect of their resources. Fintech cannot, however, improve the sustainability performance of SMEs on its own. To enhance sustainability performance, SMEs must employ green and circular economy practices and develop dynamic absorptive capacity.</p><p>Policymakers worldwide have started exploring the enabling role of I4.0 technologies in the sustainable transition of businesses, with a particular emphasis on SMEs, given their pivotal role in a substantial portion of the global economic system. Earlier research advocated the prevalence of obstacles that hinder SMEs' implementation of environmental practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Caldera et al. 2019)</ref>. Our findings indicate the possibilities associated with including Fintech to address such barriers. Therefore, within the framework of policy measures linked with Industry 4.0, Fintech can accelerate the implementation of CEP by SMEs while simultaneously boosting their sustainability performance. Therefore, regulatory bodies in emerging economies must consider integrating technological reforms into their environmental legislation, which will aid in developing crucial mechanisms of incentives and punishments, such as the revocation of company licenses, monetary fines, and carbon tax, in the event of environmental law violations. Lastly, laws and regulations should emphasize the localization of fintech and sustainability goals following the capabilities and ambitions of individual nations. As each nation's capability to embrace and prepare for fintech and sustainability practices vary, the government must understand these ideas and implement them into national and local economic goals. With guidance and regulations in place, rules may be devised and enforced more flexibly, boosting the SME sector's possibility of adopting Fintech effectively and complying with the nation's sustainability objectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research avenues</head><p>Despite providing potential directions for further research, this research is not without its limitations. First, since we employed a cross-sectional research methodology, we could not confirm the variables' causal implications. Future researchers might adopt a longitudinal design to determine the time lag and long-term effects. Next, there is a dearth of literature on the association between Fintech and CE. Most of the literature predominantly focused on the association between CE and Industry 4.0 technologies in general or blockchain technology. Thus, we call for future research to explore the effect of Fintech on CE and sustainability practices in different contexts.</p><p>Additionally, our work employs variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and an ANN for data analysis and model validation. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) and contemporary techniques like fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) with a larger sample size could also be used in the future to corroborate the findings. Additionally, this study did not employ robustness checks for the SEM findings. Future researchers may assess unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity issues. Furthermore, we incorporated SP as a single construct in our conceptual model. However, a growing body of research acknowledges that SP is a multidimensional concept that combines the triple bottom line of environmental, economic, and social performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Jha and Rangarajan 2020)</ref>. Consequently, future researchers may employ a multidimensional SP construct to investigate how FA and CEP influence the sustainability performance of firms. In conclusion, despite a growing number of studies on Industry 4.0 technologies emphasizing the importance of examining the circular economy practices and sustainability performance of SMEs from a multi-country viewpoint, utilizing data from multiple sectors, our exploration is limited to a single country and a single industry. Future research can expand our model to different sectors and countries to confirm the theory and findings' universal applicability and validity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Finally, we measured the sustainability performance of the SMEs using 6 items from Zhu et al.
