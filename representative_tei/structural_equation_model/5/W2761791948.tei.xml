<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper examines how SES relates to individual happiness, while also controlling for family functioning; the latter measured by the Family Attachment and Changeability Index 8 (FACI8). An individual-, household-, and subjective SES index are developed via multiple correspondence analyses (MCA). Using data from the 2012 South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS), the paper employs structural equation modelling (SEM) to explore the relationship between happiness, SES, and family functioning. Multiple-group SEM (MGSEM) is employed to examine the association between happiness and family functioning across quartiles of the three SES indices. The results reveal that higher SES is significantly related to greater happiness, with the role of household-and subjective SES being stronger than individual SES. Furthermore, improved levels of family changeability are positively associated with happiness, whereas there is no relationship between happiness and family attachment. Overall, levels of family changeability and individual happiness are likely to benefit from improvements in socioeconomic status.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The past few decades have witnessed an enormous expansion in the subjective well-being literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Diener, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Frey &amp; Stutzer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dolan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Diener &amp; Ryan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">MacKerron, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levinson, 2013)</ref>. Research has uncovered numerous predictors of subjective well-being across a variety of national and international contexts, expanding the understanding of individual well-being and facilitating the formulation of well-targeted policy. One of the most important determinants of happiness as reported in the existing literatureis socioeconomic status (SES), displaying a significant, positive association with subjective well-being <ref type="bibr">(Conger &amp; Donnellan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kolenikov &amp; Angeles, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Conger et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The existing subjective well-being literature, however, has mainly considered the traditional individual-level SES indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fuentes &amp; Rojas, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Subramanian et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Conger et al., 2010)</ref>, in particular education, income, employment status, and occupational status, while an individual's objective and perceived broader socioeconomic environment also matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Powdthavee, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Anderson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cundiff et al., 2013)</ref>. The SES environment of the household in which an individual resides is expected to directly impact on a person's well-being. According to the social causation hypothesis, the general socioeconomic environment has a potentially significant effect on individual well-being and development. The broader SES context can also influence family functioning patterns, thereby affecting the well-being of individuals within those families <ref type="bibr">(Botha et al., 2017a)</ref> resulting in an indirect effect of the broader SES context on individual well-being. Factors like household assets and living standards, moreover, can be important contributors to family stress <ref type="bibr">(Rothwell &amp; Han, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Han &amp; Rothwell, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kabudula et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Botha et al., 2017a)</ref> as well as individual well-being and family relationships <ref type="bibr">(Botha et al., 2017a)</ref>. Thus, this paper takes an expansive view of SES, beyond the more traditional individual-level factors of income and education <ref type="bibr">(Conger &amp; Donnellan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sheppard et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rothwell &amp; Han, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Han &amp; Rothwell, 2014)</ref>. This paper employs three composite SES indices <ref type="bibr">(Phongsavan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Georgiades et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kabudula et al., 2016)</ref> originally developed in <ref type="bibr">Botha et al. (2017a)</ref>. These indices reflect the traditional individual SES, household SES, and subjective SES. The advantage of using three different SES measures makes it possible to determine how happiness is associated with various dimensions of SES. Another distinct advantage is that objective SES (i.e. individual-and household SES) as well as subjective SES can be explored simultaneously to determine if objective and subjective SES relate differently to happiness.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Guillen-Royo et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Feeny et al. (2014)</ref> have used composite wealth-or asset indices to explore how they relate to individual happiness. Using Taiwanese data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Guillen-Royo et al. (2013)</ref> used a material wealth index consisting of the number of assets owned by the household. The results revealed that people are happier if they live in households scoring higher on the wealth index, suggesting that people value material possessions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Feeny et al. (2014)</ref> explored data from two villages in Melanesia and constructed a wealth index via principal component analysis that included 14 variables reflecting the household assets and dwelling characteristics. The authors reported a significant positive relationship between happiness and household wealth.</p><p>Besides the household-level SES indicesmeasuring its wealththe current study also incorporates family functioningi.e. how household members interactas a predictor of individual well-being. Previous research using South African data has reported a significant positive relationship between happiness and family functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014)</ref> as well as between family functioning and SES <ref type="bibr">(Botha et al., 2017a)</ref>. Family functioning is a multidimensional concept that reflects the intra-family relational processes by which family members interact and work towards attaining family goals and functions <ref type="bibr">(Morris &amp; Blanton, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patterson, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014)</ref>. There is an established interplay between the quality of family functioning and socioeconomic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Conger et al., 2010)</ref>. Another distinctive element of this paper is the consideration of whether the role of family functioning in explaining happiness differs across the SES gradient.</p><p>The focus of this paper is on South Africa. South African research investigating happiness in particular is relatively limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014)</ref>, especially compared to other countries, and thus further research into the determinants of happiness in South Africa is required. South Africa also has an interesting context that makes it worthy of further investigation. There are significant differences in living standards and SES within the population and particularly across racial groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Møller, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Statistics South Africa, 2015)</ref>, which still reflect the legacy of apartheid <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Møller &amp; Saris, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leibbrandt et al., 2012)</ref>. The wide range of cultural differences within the country also affects how individuals view their own well-being, family relationships, and the broader socioeconomic context of families <ref type="bibr">(Amoateng et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nkosi &amp; Daniels, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Møller, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Botha et al., 2017a)</ref>. This paper, within this context, investigates more broadly the determinants of happiness in South Africa, but in particular focusing on the roles of (objective and subjective) SES and family functioning, thereby integrating the socioeconomic-and family environments into the study of individual happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Data and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data</head><p>The 2012 wave of the South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS), conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council <ref type="bibr">(HSRC, 2012)</ref>, is used in this paper. SASAS is a nationally representative survey conducted annually since 2003 as a repeated cross-section, and monitors changes in the attitudes and values of South Africans over time. The 2012 SASAS formed part of the South African module of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) module on Family and Changing Gender Roles. The choice of the 2012 SASAS was based on the fact that it is the only SASAS wave that makes it possible to address this paper's topic, as it includes the FACI8 instrument, a happiness question and the relevant SES variables. The survey is designed to provide a representative sample of individuals at least 16 years of age within households that are geographically dispersed across South Africa's provinces. Samples are drawn from the HSRC's master sample, which consists of 1 000 Population Census enumeration areas and is stratified by province and population group. For each interview round, a sub-sample of 500 enumeration areas are then drawn from the master sample. The SASAS round used in this paper had 2,547 original respondents, and the data are weighted to ensure that the sample is representative of the broader South African population.</p><p>Given the nature of the questions in the family functioning instrument employed in this paper, single-person households are excluded from the analysis since families generally consist of two or more members <ref type="bibr">(Waite, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patterson, 2002b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams et al., 2015)</ref>. In addition, this paper excludes particular two-person households where such households comprise a single parent with a child younger than 12 years. Research has reported that children younger than 12 do not engage in meaningful bargaining, and the assumption is made that children younger than 12 generally do not make major decisions within the household <ref type="bibr">(Harbaugh et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lundberg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dauphin et al., 2011)</ref>. As such, perceptions of family functioning would not apply beyond the one household member. Removing these households resulted in a total sample of 2,126 observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Variables</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Happiness</head><p>Happiness is measured by a standard 7-point (taking values 1-7) question that asks: "If you were to consider your life in general, how happy or unhappy would you say you are, on the whole?" Response categories include "completely unhappy", "very unhappy", "fairly unhappy", "neither happy nor unhappy", "fairly happy", "very happy", and "completely happy".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Socioeconomic status (SES)</head><p>As noted in section 1, the SES indices were initially developed by <ref type="bibr">Botha et al. (2017a)</ref> and comprise an individual-, household-, and subjective SES index. The SES indices and their components are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1A</ref>. Index components, emanating from the 2012 SASAS, were selected based on guidelines from previous literature <ref type="bibr">(Barbarin &amp; Khomo, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang &amp; Gustafsson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fotso &amp; Kuate-Defo, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Howe et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sheppard et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cundiff et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Guillen-Royo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reising et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kabadula et al., 2016)</ref> and data availability. The individual SES index includes the respondent's income, education, and employment status. The household SES index includes total household income as well as household characteristics such as asset ownership (i.e. whether the household owns certain assets such as a washing machine and stove) and infrastructure (i.e. electricity access, toilet facilities, and so on). The subjective SES contains items that measure a respondent's perception of the household's SES relative to other households (for example, the perceived income position of the household compared to that of other households in the neighbourhood).</p><p>Because all variables in the SES indices are categorical, the SES indices were constructed using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) <ref type="bibr">(Greenacre, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sourial et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kabudula et al., 2016)</ref>, a generalization of principal components analysis in the presence of categorical data. The MCA for the individual SES index explains 86.8% of the total inertia in the first dimension, whereas the household SES MCA explains 91.8% of the principal inertia in the first dimension. For the subjective SES index, the MCA explains 81.6% of the principal inertia in the first dimension. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">A2</ref> contains the MCA weights assigned to each distinct SES component. All weights have the expected sign; that is, positive (negative) weights for items expected to be positively (negatively) related to SES. In order to examine whether the level of SES matters as well as to conduct multiple-group analysis (discussed in section 2.3) across SES groups, the continuous SES indices are also used to construct SES quartiles 1 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Altman &amp; Bland, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Onwujekwe, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Messer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Niyonsenga et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Family functioning</head><p>The Family Attachment and Changeability Index 8 (FACI8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McCubbin et al., 1996)</ref> is used as measure of family functioning. The SASAS 2012 dataset is the most recent nationally representative South African survey that includes the FACI8 instrument. FACI8 is a self-report measure with two sub-scales, Attachment and Changeability, each with eight items. The Attachment scale measures the attachment of family members to each other, whereas the Changeability scale measures the flexibility of family members' relationships with each other. The sub-scales are comparable to the Circumplex Model of Marital and Family System's co]hesion and flexibility dimensions <ref type="bibr">(Olson &amp; Gorall, 2003)</ref>, with family cohesion (or togetherness) defined as "the emotional bonding that […] family members have toward one another," and family flexibility as "the amount of change in its leadership, role relationships, and relationship rules" <ref type="bibr">(Olson &amp; Gorall, 2003:516, 519)</ref>. While the FACI8 sub-scales are theoretically related, they should be analysed as distinct dimensions of family functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McCubbin et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>1 Although quintiles are often used in applied work, this paper uses quartiles instead. This choice was driven by preliminary analyses that highlighted potential issues in employing quintiles when examining the SES indices, in particular due to the strong relationship between SES and race in South Africa. As an example, it is often the case that the lowest quintiles were made up of only Black and Coloured respondents, whereas the highest quintiles consist mainly of White and Indian respondents. To allow for more meaningful analyses and a more even sample size distribution across SES categories, quartiles were more appropriate. Even when using quartiles, though, race had to be excluded from the multiple-group models, as discussed in section 2.3. This was because only one White person and no Indian/Asian persons fell into the first two SES quartiles, with the majority in the bottom two quartiles being Black and Coloured individuals. Thus, in some instances the bottom two quartiles represent only certain racial groups. The lack of observations in the White-and Indian/Asian samples in the bottom two quartiles also complicated model convergence.</p><p>FACI8 has been used in previous South African research (e.g.: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Masquillier et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wouters et al., 2014)</ref> and also validated with the SASAS 2012 data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Botha et al., 2016)</ref>. Table 3A contains all FACI8 items. Respondents are required to state how often a certain circumstance currently happens in the family, with responses consisting of "never" = 1, "sometimes" = 2, "half the time" = 3, "more than half the time" = 4, and "always" = 5. To ensure positive scores on both sub-scales, the Attachment sub-scale is reversed ("never" = 5, "sometimes" = 4, "half the time" = 3, "more than half the time" = 2, "always" = 1). Cronbach alpha coefficients are acceptable at 0.78 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Streiner, 2003)</ref> for both FACI8 sub-scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Control variables</head><p>A number of control variables are included, the choice of which are based on previous research from the happiness and family functioning literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">: Greeff, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fuentes &amp; Rojas, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gerdtham &amp; Johannesson, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tiffin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dolan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Guillen-Royo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mansfield et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sarracino, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Feeny et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hsu et al., 2016)</ref>. The controls are age and age squared, gender, race, marital status, health status, household size, religion status, geographical area, female-headed household status, and household structure. Gender consists of "male" (comparison group) and "female" categories, whereas race denotes a person's racial group and consists of "Black" (comparison group), "Coloured" (the official South African classification for people of mixed-race), "Indian or Asian", and "White". Marital status includes "never married" (comparison group), "separated/divorced", "widowed", and "married". Health status denotes an individual's subjective health status and includes "poor/fair", "good", and "very good/excellent" perceived health.</p><p>Household size reflects the number of persons in the household, whereas religion status equals one if a respondent is religious and zero if not (comparison group). The geographical area denotes whether the household is located in a rural or urban (comparison group) area. A variable is also included to indicate whether the respondent lives in a female-headed household (comparison group) or maleheaded household. Household structure includes "skip-generation and multi-generation households" (comparison group), "single-parent households with at least one child", "a couple without children", "a couple with at least one child", and "other households" (including family forms such as mixed families with non-relatives living in the household, and siblings only).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data analysis</head><p>The data were analysed using Stata version 14.2 and missing values were removed from the analysis via listwise deletion. The SEM model is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. Given the many control variables, the "controls" box is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> to reflect all control variables, as including boxes and paths for each variable would render the figure very cluttered.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> Consistent with theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McCubbin et al., 1996)</ref>, the FACI8 sub-scales appear with correlated error terms and reflect the measurement model. For the structural component of the model, the relevant SES index is specified as covariate for happiness, Attachment, and Changeability. In turn, Attachment and Changeability are specified as determinants of happiness. The same controls are included for the Attachment and Changeability equations. Subjective health status is added as control in the happiness equation only, in light of previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gerdtham &amp; Johannesson, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014)</ref> that has found health status to be a predictor of happiness.</p><p>The SEM models are estimated via maximum likelihood (ML), which assumes multivariate normality. While the happiness variable and FACI8 items can be viewed as ordinal variables and thus not normally distributed, this paper assumes cardinality of the outcomes and uses ML. This assumption is supported by previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Johnson &amp; Creech, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Babakus et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dolan, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hutchinson &amp; Olmos, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beauducel &amp; Herzberg, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rhemtulla et al., 2012)</ref> arguing that the treatment of ordinal variables with five or more categories as continuous and using ML is unlikely to have a serious impact on the results. To guard against violation of any normality assumptions, the Satorra-Bentler (S-B) scaled χ 2 statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Satorra &amp; Bentler, 1994)</ref> is also used as diagnostic and models are estimated with S-B standard errors that adjust for non-normality. Goodness-of-fit indices used to assess model fit are the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). For an acceptable model fit, RMSEA ≤ 0.06, SRMR ≤ 0.08 and CFI ≥ 0.90 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schreiber et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aarons et al., 2007)</ref>. This paper also uses multiple-group SEM (MGSEM) to examine whether the role of family functioning in explaining happiness differs across SES quartiles. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> In other words, is the relationship between Attachment and happiness as well as between Changeability and happiness similar across SES groups? Because the FACI8 sub-scales form part of the full SEM models, multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) was first used to determine measurement invariance among the two latent sub-scales. These analyses were originally conducted and reported in <ref type="bibr">Botha et al. (2017b)</ref> and are thus not discussed fully in this paper. In summary, however, Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4A</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5A</ref> present the results, which demonstrate measurement invariance of the latent family functioning constructs for all three SES indices.</p><p>The MGSEM analysis follows the establishment of measurement invariance. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> For each SES measure, a multiple-group model without any constraints on the unstandardized structural parameters is first estimated. A second model is then estimated where in the structural component the Attachment coefficients are set equal across SES groups and the Changeability coefficients are set equal across SES groups. A χ 2 difference test determines whether the fit of the constrained model, which is nested within the unconstrained model, is significantly worse than the unconstrained model fit. If the χ 2 difference statistic is not statistically significant, the constrained model does not do significantly worse than the unconstrained version and thus would support the constraints imposed on the structural coefficients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Descriptive analysis</head><p>Summary statistics are included in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Some sample characteristics include that the average age of respondents is about 37 years. Just more than half of the sample is female, roughly 72% are Black and 31% are married. The mean household size is five persons, whereas almost a third of respondents reside in rural areas. Finally, a third of people live in female-headed households. The average happiness score of 4.99 is relatively high on a 7-point scale.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> reports Spearman correlation coefficients, which show that all SES indices are positively correlated with happiness. Happiness is most strongly related to the subjective SES index (ρs = 0.479, p &lt; 0.001), followed by the household SES index (ρs = 0.389, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the relatively high correlation between household SES and subjective SES (ρs = 0.669, p &lt; 0.001) suggests that greater objective (household) SES as expected is related to higher subjective perceptions of household SES.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>, the results show that, for all three SES indices, average happiness is higher among the higher SES quartiles (except for individual SES, where mean happiness is slightly higher in quartile 1 than in quartile 2), and these differences are statistically significant. For instance, for the individual SES index, the mean happiness score is 4.84 among persons in the first quartile compared to 5.55 for those in the fourth quartile. For subjective SES, persons in the first quartile report a mean happiness score of 3.89 relative to a score of 5.84 among persons in the fourth quartile. For household-and subjective SES, ad-hoc tests showed that the happiness differences between all quartiles are statistically significant (all p &lt; 0.001). For individual SES, mean happiness is significantly higher in quartile 3 relative to quartile 1 (p &lt; 0.01), whereas happiness among those in quartile four is significantly higher than all other quartiles (all p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> presents cross-tabulations between happiness and SES. The results clearly indicate that reported happiness is lower among the lower SES quartiles. For instance, within the first individual SES quartile, around 15% or persons reporting being either completely unhappy or very unhappy, compared to only 3.2% among those in the fourth individual SES quartile. Furthermore, while roughly 25% of household SES quartile four respondents are either very happy or completely happy, only about 7% of those in the first household SES quartile are at least very happy. Overall, therefore, greater proportions of individuals report higher (lower) levels of happiness in the higher (lower) SES quartiles.</p></div>

All models demonstrate acceptable goodness-of-fit statistics (RMSEA: 0.027-0.028; CFI: 0.911-0.914; SRMR: 0.026-0.027). There is a significant and positive relationship between happiness and the individual SES index (b = 0.179, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.120) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>): People are on average happier the higher their individual SES. Considering the individual SES quartiles (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref>), those in quartiles three (b = 0.177, p &lt; 0.05; β = 0.049) and four (b = 0.448, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.123) are significantly happier compared to individuals in the first quartile, while people in quartiles two (χ 2 = 21.3, p &lt; 0.001) and three (χ 2 = 10.7, p &lt; 0.01) are also less happy compared to those in quartile four.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref> suggests a strong positive association between reported happiness and household SES (b = 0.386, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.258), which implies that people are happier when they live in high-SES households. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref>'s results indicate that all levels of household SES are important in determining happiness, as individuals in the lowest SES quartile are significantly less happy compared to those in the top three quartiles (all p &lt; 0.001). In addition, persons in quartile four are significantly happier relative to those in the second (χ 2 = 23.4, p &lt; 0.001) and third (χ 2 = 15.7, p &lt; 0.001) quartiles.</p><p>As with the household SES findings of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref>, there is a strong positive relationship between happiness and a person's perception of their household SES (b = 0.551, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.356) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">9</ref>). From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">10</ref>, people in the first subjective SES quartile are less happy compared to those in quartiles two to four (all p &lt; 0.001).

This relationship is most pronounced for household-and subjective SES, suggesting that a person's broader socioeconomic context, objective and perceived, is a stronger predictor of happiness than individual SES only. Moreover, given the composition of the household SES index, factors such as household assets and household infrastructure quality are important predictors of individual happiness.</p></div>

As household-and subjective SES are positively related to family Changeability, part of the happiness advantage of higher household-and subjective SES is represented by the positive relationship with family Changeability. Given the association between family functioning and SES, the use of MGSEM can show if the happiness-family functioning association depends on the particular SES gradient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Multiple-group analyses</head><p>Table <ref type="table">11 reports</ref>  The relationship between happiness and family functioning is not significantly different across individual-and household SES quartiles. While the relationship between happiness and family Changeability is similar across subjective SES groups, the association of happiness with family Attachment does differ across subjective SES groups. In particular, there is a significant positive relationship between happiness and Attachment within the highest subjective SES quartile only. This implies that family Attachment matters only for those who perceive themselves as being really well off, whereas this is not the case for those who consider their household SES to be lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>The primary objective of this paper was to examine the role of SESas measured by both objective and subjective individual-level and household-level indicesin explaining reported happiness using South African survey data. The findings show a strong positive relationship between household SES and happiness, as well as between subjective SES and happiness. Greater individual-level SES is also related to greater happiness, but the association with happiness does not seem as strong as with household-and subjective SES. In broad terms, the findings are supported by previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Guillen-Royo et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Feeny et al., 2014)</ref> that found that greater happiness is associated with higher household wealth or asset index scores.</p><p>Because an individual's family environment is intricately related to SES and individual happiness, the paper also considered family functioning as an important factor in the interplay between happiness and SES. Better household-and subjective SES are positively related to family Changeability, whereas better levels of family Changeability are also associated with better happiness scores. There are no significant associations between SES and family Attachment or between happiness and family Attachment. Thus, persons in higher-SES households generally report higher levels of flexibility in their family relationships, and more family flexibility is related to greater happiness. However, the emotional bonds and attachment of family members are independent of SES, and happiness is not related to family Attachment either.</p><p>The multiple-group analysis revealed that the role of family functioning in explaining happiness does not change across individual-and household SES groups. Individual-and household SES gradients are thus not important predictors of how family functioning relates to happiness. Across subjective SES groups, the relationship between happiness and family Changeability is statistically similar, but the association of family Attachment with happiness is significantly different across subjective SES groups.</p><p>In particular, among persons who feel their household's SES is much better higher compared to other households' SES, happiness is positively associated with family Attachment. This latter finding could imply that emotional bonding within families only becomes more important as determinant of individual happiness in high-SES families, for whom the more basic needs have been met.</p><p>In terms of the additional control variables, there is evidence of a U-shaped relationship between happiness and age, which is consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alesina &amp; Giuliano, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Frijters &amp; Beatton, 2012)</ref>. Women are happier than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alesina &amp; Giuliano, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2013)</ref>, and married individuals are happier compared to the never married <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sarracino, 2013)</ref>. In accordance with existing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gerdtham &amp; Johannesson, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014)</ref>, improved perceived health status is associated with greater levels of happiness. Happiness is significantly lower among Black persons relative to all the other race groups, which is consistent with previous research on South African data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botha &amp; Booysen, 2014)</ref>. There do not seem to be any meaningful relationships of happiness with factors such as household structure and religion.</p><p>A limitation of this paper is that no comments can be made about causality since the data are cross-sectional. The availability of panel data would make it possible to control for unobserved heterogeneity and move towards making assertions about causal relationships between happiness and SES. Another limitation stems from the fact that the question measuring happiness is only asked of the respondent and not all other household members, so as to allow happiness to be measured at an individual level, particularly where the focus is on the association of happiness and household-level SES. It is therefore also not possible to consider potential intra-family differences in reported happiness.</p><p>In relation to the contribution of this paper's results to the existing literature, the findings have shown that it is important to consider a broad range of SES indicators when studying the role of SES in explaining individual happiness. Notably, the broader family context of an individual is also important, and here better SES is also generally related to better levels of family Changeability. For South African families and the individuals within those families, attaining higher SES is important, as it is positively associated with both happiness and family Changeability, with the latter further contributing to better levels of happiness. Furthermore, the findings suggest that although objective SES is a significant predictor of happiness, a person's subjective perception of SES is also a central determinant of individual happiness. From a policy perspective, in order to improve individual happiness, programmes aimed at improving individual SES but especially household SES factors across all SES gradientssuch as the quality of infrastructure and household assetsmay be particularly useful. Moreover, family strengthening programmes aimed at fostering better family Changeability patterns are likely to further enhance individual happiness. Finally, there is evidence to suggest that programmes targeted at building greater Attachment within families should be aimed at high-SES households.

According to the chi-square difference test results, for the individual-(𝜒 𝐷 2 = 5.3, p = 0.510) and household (𝜒 𝐷 2 = 6.4, p = 0.376) SES indices, the constrained models do not fare significantly worse relative to a model without constraints. This implies that the association between happiness and family functioning is similar across individual-and household SES quartiles. The findings for subjective SES are slightly different. The model with equality constraints on the structural family functioning paths does significantly worse than a model without such constraints (𝜒 𝐷 2 = 14.8, p &lt; 0.05). Examination of the score test results indicate that a constraint of the Changeability → happiness path coefficients is valid (χ 2 = 3.0, p = 0.390), suggesting that the association between Changeability and happiness does not differ according to subjective SES quartile. For Attachment, however, the score test indicates that constraints on the Attachment → happiness path coefficients are not valid (χ 2 = 11.6, p &lt; 0.01). Thus, there is a significant difference across subjective SES groups in how Attachment is associated with happiness. A subsequent model that constrains the Changeability → happiness path coefficients across SES quartiles but not the Attachment → happiness path coefficients does not do significantly worse than a model without any constraints (𝜒 𝐷 2 = 3.0, p = 0.388). In terms of the individual Attachment coefficients for each SES quartile, Attachment is significantly positively associated with reported happiness in the top subjective SES quartile only (b = 0.157, se = 0.060, p &lt; 0.01).</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3" xml:id="foot_1"><p>The MGSEM analyses exclude race as covariate based on the skewed distribution of SES across South Africa's racial groups. For example, in some cases only one White person and no Indian/Asian persons fell into the first two SES quartiles, with the majority in the bottom two quartiles being Black, followed by Coloured individuals. This implies that in some instances the bottom two quartiles represent only certain racial groups. The lack of observations in the White-and Indian/Asian samples in the bottom two quartiles complicated model convergence.</p></note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4" xml:id="foot_2"><p>Although the S-B scaled χ 2 difference test(Satorra &amp; Bentler, 2001)  is generally preferable, the software used in the analysis does not currently allow for estimation of the S-B χ 2 in the examination of group constraints. Thus, the MGSEM analyses employ the default maximum likelihood χ 2 difference test statistic. Although this statistic does not correct for non-normality, its maximum likelihood estimates are nevertheless relatively robust even in the presence of non-normality (Acock, 2013).</p></note>
