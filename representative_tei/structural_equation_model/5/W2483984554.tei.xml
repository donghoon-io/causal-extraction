<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The current study aims to develop a model in the scope of youth tourism that illustrates structural relationships among the following constructs: 1) frequency of participation in several tourism activities; 2) frequency of social interaction with residents; 3) perception of tourism impacts on several domains of quality of life (QOL); 4) perception of tourism impacts on overall QOL. To achieve this objective, a survey was carried out with university students and 412 completed questionnaires were obtained. The model was tested with partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Results show a strong positive impact of tourism activities on social interaction and a positive impact of both tourism activities and social interaction on all domains of QOL -physical health, social relationships, psychological features and environmental conditions. The paper ends with recommendations for improving the impact of tourism on youth visitors' QOL.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The impact of tourism on quality of life (QOL) of both residents and tourists has become an important research topic in recent decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andereck and Nyaupane, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolnicar et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, the youth market is a relevant and growing tourism market segment that is still at the beginning of a potentially long tourism career <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Richards, 2007)</ref>. The great potential of tourism to improve QOL is also recognised. However, there is little research on the impact of tourism on QOL of the youth market. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolnicar et al. (2013)</ref> highlight, QOL is an individual and a dynamic concept, revealing the importance of analysing the impact of tourism on QOL of several tourism markets.</p><p>The study of the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL and of the factors related to tourism experience that may influence this impact is of utmost relevance for academics, politicians and tourism industry staff. For managers and planners of tourism destinations, information concerning the impact of tourism on tourists' QOL and the factors that may influence this impact are insights of utmost relevance for designing successful tourism development strategies.</p><p>Despite some research about the impact of tourism on tourists' QOL (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolnicar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moscardo, 2009)</ref>, the literature regarding the relationship between tourism and QOL remains fragmented and in a stage of infancy. Moreover, few studies analyse the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL and the factors that may influence this impact. Furthermore, the literature review reveals an absence of empirical studies analysing the causal relationship among tourism activities carried out during a trip, tourist-host social interaction and impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL. The present study aims to overcome this gap, developing a structural equation model to analyse the relationships between two important dimensions of youth tourism experience (tourism activities carried out during a trip and tourist-host interaction) and the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL (both in terms of QOL domains and of overall QOL).</p><p>To accomplish the objectives of this paper, following this introduction, a literature review about some characteristics of the youth tourism market and regarding the three constructs analysed in this research -types of tourism activities carried out by youth tourists during a trip, tourist-host interaction and the potential impact of tourism on tourists' QOL -is provided. Further, the research model and hypotheses are reported. The data collection methods and the data analysis methods used to test the structural research model proposed are described. Finally, the results of the empirical study are presented and discussed. The paper ends with the most important insights of this research in order to provide guidelines to increase the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL. Limitations of this research and suggestions for future studies to increase the knowledge in this issue will also be provided.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Youth tourism market</head><p>The youth market is growing and is expected to be responsible for about 300 million international youth trips per year in 2020 <ref type="bibr">(WYSE Travel Confederation/UNWTO, 2011)</ref>. The number of returning trips to destinations is likely to be higher in this market, which is in the early stages of its travel cycle. The youth market is also very important since it is likely to be more fearless than other segments and, consequently, more resilient to natural features and acts of terrorism <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richards, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">WYSE Travel Confederation/UNWTO, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Some very important travel motivations of young visitors are being entertained and novelty (having new experiences, including visiting new destinations and learning something new) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Zhang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. Another important travel motivation, which is highly related to novelty, is increasing knowledge, namely by learning new things and knowing other cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kim and Jogaratnam, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tourism Research and Marketing, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. For many youth visitors, tourism trips are also seen as good opportunities for relaxing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Zhang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref> and for socialising <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Richards, 2007)</ref>. The importance of socialisation for the youth tourism market will be further analysed in Section 2.3.</p><p>Nowadays, young visitors already have considerable travel experience -about six international short trips and five long trips (with more than seven nights) in a five-year period (Tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Research and Marketing, 2013)</ref>. In the planning of the trip young visitors usually assign high importance to value for money and cheap travel options, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Phau et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Richards, 2007)</ref>, and frequently use internet and family or friends as information sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richards, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Zhang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. When traveling, the youth tourism market often uses hotel or other cheaper, or even free, means of accommodation -e.g., hostels, camping and houses of friends and relatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richards, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref> -and carries out a wide range of tourism activities. Tourism trips were revealed to have important impacts on the youth tourism market. They contributed to a great appreciation and understanding of other cultures, to a higher self-knowledge and self-awareness and, in certain cases, even to change the lifestyle, strengthen values and change career options <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richards, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tourism activities carried out during a trip</head><p>The participation in tourism activities is an important component of the tourism experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kim, 2010)</ref>. Several studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Richards, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">WYSE Travel Confederation/UNWTO, 2011)</ref> attest that youth visitors tend to participate in a high number of activities during tourism trips.</p><p>Some of the preferred tourism activities of youth visitors are going to beach <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frändberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Thrane, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref> and sightseeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frändberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shanka et al., 2002)</ref>. Visiting cities and shopping are also popular activities in this market segment <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Thrane, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. Despite the fact that young visitors tend to appreciate many other tourism activities such as cultural activities (e.g., visiting museums, historic sites, participating in cultural events), nature activities, fun activities (e.g., eating and drinking, going to nightclubs) and sports activities, more heterogeneity seems to exist regarding the willingness to undertake the aforementioned kinds of activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frändberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Richards, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Zhang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Thrane, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. Even though the youth market reveals a high propensity to engage in tourism activities compared to other market segments, research also shows some variability in this market, regarding the willingness to undertake tourism activities. Literature reveals that the participation of young people in tourism activities depends on many factors such as sociodemographic (e.g., age, nationality) and motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Zhang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tangeland, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Thrane, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref>. Additionally, the comparison of studies carried out in different countries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frändberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009)</ref> also suggests that the characteristics of the destination may also influence young visitors' involvement in activities during tourism trips.</p><p>The propensity to participate in a high number of activities is also associated with higher expenditures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Finsterwalder and Laesser, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tangeland, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, the practice of tourism activities may also help satisfy several motivations of visitors, such as novelty, expanding knowledge, making contact with other cultures and socialising (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ryan and Zhang, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Su et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tangeland, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, ensuring that destinations provide appropriate conditions for practising the tourism activities that fulfil the needs of their target markets is of remarkable importance, in order to boost the positive impacts of tourism for both destinations and the visitors. Considering that young visitors have a high motivation for social contact, as previously mentioned, the next section will discuss the relevance and characteristics of social interaction in the scope of tourism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Tourist-host interaction</head><p>Social contact between tourists and hosts is a critical factor for tourism experience, simultaneously influencing tourists' and hosts' satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kastenholz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Reisinger and Turner, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sinkovics and Penz, 2009)</ref>. This concept is complex and has been the object of several definitions. However, as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Reisinger and Turner (2003, p.37</ref>) social contact in tourism can be defined as "the personal encounter that takes place between a tourist and a host". Frequently, tourist-host interaction is brief, formal, temporary, non-repetitive, open to deceit, exploitation and mistrust, unequal and unbalanced in terms of its meanings for both sides <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(De Kadt, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kastenholz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Reisinger and Turner, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Reisinger, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sinkovics and Penz, 2009)</ref>. However, studies on the youth market reveal that socialising and knowing other cultures emerge as important travel motivations of young visitors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bicikova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref>. Consequently, young tourists may look for a special relationship with their hosts in order to obtain information and to gain deeper knowledge regarding the values, customs and cultural assets of the host communities.</p><p>The literature review about tourist-host interaction research reveals that this is a recent field of research, with a lack of both theoretical foundation and empirical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012)</ref>. The few studies carried out in this field (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kastenholz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Murphy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pizam et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reisinger and Turner, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sinkovics and Penz, 2009)</ref> suggest that there is no consensus in terms of how to measure this construct, what factors may determine the intensity and nature of encounters between tourists and hosts and what the consequences of these encounters are.</p><p>In terms of indicators to measure tourist-host interaction some studies used the intensity of interaction to measure this construct (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pizam et al., 2000)</ref>, while others used the frequency of interaction in several contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kastenholz et al., 2013)</ref>. There are also some studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reisinger and Turner, 1998)</ref> that analysed types of social contact preferred by visitors. In order to assess this construct it is of paramount relevance to consider that there are several contexts, as De <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kadt (1979)</ref> emphasises, where tourist-host encounters occur, such as when tourists and hosts exchange information and ideas, when they use the same tourist attractions and facilities and when tourists acquire goods and services from hosts.</p><p>Studies that analyse the factors that may influence the tourist-host interaction in the youth tourism market are very scarce. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Eusébio and Carneiro's (2012)</ref> study is one of the few published studies that identifies determinants related to university student tourists (travel motivations, travel behaviour, cultural familiarity and similarity, tourists' perceptions of tourism impacts and sociodemographic profile) which influence touristhost interaction. However, in the general literature about tourist-host interaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kastenholz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pizam et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reisinger and Turner, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Reisinger, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sinkovics and Penz, 2009)</ref>, the socio-demographic profile and cultural background of both participants in the contact, travel motivations, cultural familiarity and similarity and perceived costs and benefits of the contact stand out as important factors influencing tourist-host interaction. From this literature review, the researches that examine the impact of tourism activities carried out during a trip on tourist-host interaction are generally fragmented and restricted to certain tourism activities.</p><p>Regarding the consequences of tourist-host interaction, the studies carried out in this field focused mainly on the impact of tourist-hosts encounters on visitors' satisfaction and on their intention to return and, also, on hosts' satisfaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Andereck et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pizam et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Reisinger and Turner, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sinkovics and Penz, 2009)</ref>. Studies that examine the impact of tourist-host interaction on tourists' perceptions of impacts of tourism on their QOL are very scarce.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Impact of tourism on QOL</head><p>There is no consensus in the literature regarding the concept of QOL <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sirgy et al., 2006)</ref>. Several words have been used as synonyms of this concept, such as well-being and people's satisfaction with life. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Theofilou (2013)</ref> the QOL concept can be seen as the individual's perceptions of how good his(her) life is. This overall concept of good life includes several domains (e.g., work, family, leisure, social relationships, income and health). Then, it is possible to observe that, on the one hand, the opportunity to participate in tourism activities is already an important domain of people's QOL and that, on the other hand, tourism has a great potential to improve other domains of QOL (e.g., social relationships and health). Despite the potential positive impact of tourism on people's QOL, little knowledge has been generated in this field. Moreover, studies that examine the factors that may influence the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL are very limited. However, an increase in research on the role of tourism on tourists' QOL has been observed in the last decade (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carneiro and Eusébio, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dann, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolnicar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCabe et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Michalkó et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moscardo, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nawijn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sirgy et al., 2011)</ref>. Studies carried out in this field show that tourism may influence positively and negatively the QOL of each tourist <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(McCabe et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moscardo, 2009)</ref>. The nature and magnitude of the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL will depend not only on individuals' psychological and socio-demographic characteristics but also on their travel behaviour. However, the results of the few studies that, to date, examine the factors that influence the impact of tourism on tourists' QOL are not consensual (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexander et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolnicar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Travel motivations emerge as one of the most analysed potential determinants of the impact of tourism on QOL. Despite the tourism activities carried out during a trip and the tourist-host interaction being identified as two important dimensions of tourism experience, a very limited number of studies have analysed their influence on youth tourists' QOL. Moreover, no study was found using structural equation modelling to analyse the impact of tourism activities carried out and tourist-host interaction on tourism impacts perceived by youth tourists on their QOL.</p><p>To measure the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL, it is of utmost relevance to select the most suitable indicators to measure this construct. The QOL literature reveals that this is a complex and multidimensional concept that can be measured through objective and subjective measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dann, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCabe et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Michalkó et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Neal et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sirgy et al., 2011)</ref>. Consequently, in tourism studies several procedures have been used to assess the impact of tourism on tourists' QOL. The majority of studies published, in order to capture the impact of tourism on several domains of QOL, frequently use scales with several items (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolnicar et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCabe et al., 2010)</ref>. The WHOQOL-BREF scale, a short version of the WHOQOL-100 used by the World Health Organization to measure QOL worldwide, has been used in some studies that analyse the impact of tourism on tourists' QOL (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCabe et al., 2010)</ref>. However, the potential of the WHOQOL-BREF scale is largely unexplored in tourism research. Consequently, given that in this study QOL is understood as an individual's subjective evaluation of several life domains (e.g.. physical health, psychological state, social relationships, financial resources), an adapted version of the WHOQOL-BREF scale was used to measure the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>In order to study the relationship between tourism activities carried out during a trip, tourist-host interaction and impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL, the conceptual model presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> was designed.

The empirical study presented in this paper aims to test the research model proposed and the hypotheses through structural equation modelling. First order constructs (dimensions) of the second order (multidimensional) constructs</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Participation in tourism activities and tourist-host interaction level</head><p>Some studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Tangeland, 2011)</ref> reveal that obtaining social benefits (e.g., meeting new people) is already, for several segments of visitors, an important motivation to participate in tourism. Participating in one activity may enable tourists to meet new people who perform the same activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Tangeland, 2011)</ref>, especially if the activity is carried out in groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tangeland and Aas's (2011)</ref> research suggests that participation in nature-based activities is more related to the facilitation of people's integration (e.g., the activity being organised or being a group activity) than it is to other characteristics like the activity being designed for families or children, providing learning opportunities or permitting one to experience risk or challenges. It also highlights that facilitation of integration is more important for some visitors such as single-parents, couples without children and singles.</p><p>Contact with local residents may be of special value to visitors since the residents frequently hold relevant knowledge about the destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Su et al., 2014)</ref>, being thus able to act as cultural brokers, disseminating information about the destination, namely on local customs, local products and typical activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kastenholz et al., 2013)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Su et al. (2014)</ref> the travel behaviour of tourists may affect the type of tourist-host interaction, including its intensity, and some tourism activities (e.g., visiting local families, dancing, singing, taking photos with local clothes) serve as a platform for tourist-host interactions. Kim (2012) also found that engagement in recreation activities is very important to experience close social contact with people having different cultural or ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>A small number of previous studies also show that the visitors with a highest propensity to participate in a considerable number of activities, or to undertake them most frequently, have the highest interaction with local residents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carneiro and Eusébio, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012)</ref>. This highest propensity is not only due to engaging in activities together with residents, but also because some activities promote formal interaction with residents in their workplace (e.g., buying products or buying entrance tickets when visiting tourism attractions) or informal, in other sites of the destination (e.g., when asking for information about a specific activity). Hence, some researchers provide evidence that walking in the street and going to food and beverage establishments to eat and drink provide considerable opportunities for tourist-host contacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carneiro and Eusébio, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kastenholz et al., 2013)</ref>. Opportunities for tourist-host interaction when visiting tourism attractions seem to be still reduced in the majority of tourism attractions, although there is some evidence of interesting social contacts in specific attractions, such as events <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carneiro and Eusébio, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kastenholz et al., 2013)</ref>. The research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bond et al. (2015)</ref> on religious tourism shows that, although not all activities promote equal levels of social contact, some activities, namely visiting certain attractions, foster a considerable interaction and provide a major contribution to relationship building. Thus, it is hypothesised that: H1 Participation in tourism activities will have a positive effect on tourist-host interaction.</p></div>

Nevertheless, it is recognised that undertaking physical activities (e.g., sports activities) during tourism trips, in a different place and, especially, in unpolluted environments, may help develop physical skills, reduce stress and increase physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Moscardo, 2009)</ref>. Some visitors report that their participation in physical activities is largely due to health and fitness reasons and, sometimes, to test their physical abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sibson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Szczechowicz, 2012)</ref>. Undertaking leisure activities with other persons is also likely to boost life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Trainor et al., 2010)</ref>. Many people also associate physical leisure activities with pleasure, fun, enjoyment and refreshment, remarking the important role these activities could have in promoting psychological wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sibson et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Wei and Milman's research (2002)</ref> highlights the existence of a significant positive relationship between the number of activities in which senior visitors participate and the seniors' level of psychological wellbeing.</p><p>By promoting social interaction, tourism activities can also have an important role in contributing towards meeting new people and, thus, expanding social networks, as well as spending quality time and carrying out activities alongside other persons, permitting them to develop social skills (reducing difficulties in adapting to and interacting with others and developing interpersonal social skills) and strengthening social bonds <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Moscardo, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sirgy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tse, 2014)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Su et al.

Moreover, engaging in certain activities such as cultural activities (e.g., visiting museums, visiting historic sites, participating in events), educational activities (e.g., studying languages) or even physical activities may induce some changes regarding one's environment. They may permit a deeper knowledge of other places and customs, making contact with different ways of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kim, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Su et al., 2014</ref>) and may bring other potential benefits of tourism already identified by some authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kim, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sirgy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tse, 2014)</ref>, such as developing certain skills -e.g., developing time-management and language skills, an increased ability to manage life and to make decisions -and developing more positive attitudes towards the environment -e.g., being more positive concerning work, being more available to adapt to new environments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Survey instrument and sampling approach</head><p>In order to test the model presented in the last section a questionnaire was administered to university students of the Aveiro University in Portugal. The questionnaire included questions related to travel behaviour, the impact of tourism on QOL and socio-demographic profile. In order to answer the questions about the travel behaviour and the impact of tourism on QOL, respondents were asked to consider their tourism trips undertaken in the last five years. As far as behaviour is concerned, respondents were requested to indicate, during the tourism trips, the frequency with which they undertook several tourism activities -including nature, cultural, recreational and training activities -and the frequency with which they were in contact with residents in various places -monuments, events, food and beverage establishments, places of nightlife animation, nature places and in the street. Both questions were answered using a five-point Likert-type scale from 1 'never' to 5 'very frequently'. These questions were prepared based on literature concerning tourism activities undertaken by young visitors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Richards, 2007)</ref> and on tourist-host interactions (in this case, several items were selected in order to represent the contexts of interaction identified by De <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kadt, 1979)</ref>. Respondents were also asked to provide information about the impact of the tourism trips on several domains of their QOL -physical health, social relationships, psychological features and environmental conditions -and on overall QOL.</p><p>In this case individuals had to indicate their level of agreement with several statements using a five-point Likert scale from 1 'completely disagree' to 5 'completely agree'. The statements were created based on items of the WHOQOL-BREF scale and on some literature of QOL from the field of tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carneiro and Eusébio, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Skevington et al., 2004)</ref> (see Appendix). The questionnaire ended with questions regarding socio-demographic features.</p><p>The population of the study corresponded to the students of one university located in the centre of Portugal -the University of Aveiro. This university, in 2011, encompassed more than 12,000 students, from all the regions of Portugal and a considerable amount of foreign students, from a wide range of fields of study -about 55% of Sciences and Engineering and about 45% of Social Sciences and Arts. Moreover, the population of students under study is quite balanced in terms of gender (50% male and 50% female). Respondents were selected using a quota sampling approach based on gender and area of study. In the period of April and May of 2011, the questionnaires were administered personally by researchers. A total of 412 completed questionnaires were obtained. In the sample there is a higher proportion of females (56%), singles (97%) and young tourists living in cities (58%). The respondents are very young (the average age was about 21.71).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data analysis methods</head><p>Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), using the SmartPLS 3.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ringle et al., 2014)</ref>, was used to validate the measures developed and test the hypotheses. PLS-SEM, a prediction-oriented variance-based approach, focusing on endogenous target constructs, which aims at maximising their explained variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>, is well suited to handling complex models incorporating both reflective constructs (when the construct causes the measurement of the indicator variables) and formative constructs (when the indicator variables cause the measurement of the construct) and has less restrictions regarding assumptions about data <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. This analysis also accommodates non-normally distributed data, which often occurs in behavioural studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chin, 1998)</ref>, since it uses bootstrapping to empirically estimate standard error for its parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gefen and Rigdon, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Henseler et al., 2012)</ref>. Consequently, there was no need to check the normality in the distributions. Moreover, constructs with fewer items or just one can be used. Due to its flexibility, PLS has emerged as a popular alternative to covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) in empirical tourism research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amaro and Duarte, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">García et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Findings and discussion</head><p>PLS path modelling analysis encompasses two stages. First, the evaluation of the measurement model, focusing on the analysis of each construct, is carried out. In a second stage the structural model was assessed in order to test the hypotheses underlying the conceptual model proposed in this study</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Measurement model</head><p>The model proposed in this research includes both reflective and formative constructs. All first-order constructs are reflective, while the second-order constructs (containing two layers of constructs that, in this study, correspond to Participation in tourism activities and Tourist-host interaction level) are formative. The assessment of the measurement model will thus comprise the evaluation of reflective constructs and, subsequently, the evaluation of formative constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Reflective constructs</head><p>As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hair et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Henseler et al. (2009)</ref>, the assessment of reflective constructs was carried out by analysing the reliability of the multiple-item scales, convergent validity and discriminant validity.</p><p>The reliability of the constructs was analysed using composite reliability, since it has been considered a more accurate measurement than Cronbach's alpha <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, in the measurement model under analysis, the composite reliabilities of all constructs are higher than 0.77, surpassing the reference value of 0.7 suggested by several authors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bagozzi and Yi, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fornell and Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hair Jr. et al., 1998)</ref>. Moreover, all factor loadings are equal to or greater than 0.66, exceeding the threshold value of 0.6 suggested in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The convergent validity was evaluated through the average variance extracted (AVE). As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, all first-order constructs have an AVE higher than 0.50, attesting to a good convergent validity of the scales used.</p><p>Finally, discriminant validity was assessed following Fornell and Larcker's (1981) guidelines, to examine if a construct is more strongly related to its own measures than to any other construct. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the correlations between constructs, where the square root of each construct's AVE (the diagonal elements) is higher than its correlations with any other construct. These results indicate an appropriate discriminant validity of the constructs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Formative constructs</head><p>Once the overall quality of the reflective constructs' measures was confirmed, the second-order constructs included in the conceptual model proposed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>)participation in tourism activities and tourist-host interaction level -were considered.</p><p>The assessment of the quality of second-order constructs comprised three stages. First, the quality of first-order constructs (which influences the second-order constructs) was tested in the previous section, and all requirements were met. In the second stage, the multicollinearity among the first-order constructs was examined. Finally, the weights and significance level of the first-order constructs on the second-order constructs were analysed.</p><p>The multicollinearity was analysed through the variation inflation factor (VIF). The VIF values vary between 1.003 and 2.859, and are lower than 5 as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hair et al. (2012)</ref>, thus revealing no collinearity problems. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, all first-order construct weights are significant and higher than 0.10, positively influencing the secondorder constructs, as suggested in the literature. Cultural and nature activities emerge as the first-order constructs with more influence on the formative construct participation in tourism activities. On the other hand, interaction in the open air and in tourism attractions are the first-order constructs which have a higher impact on tourist-host interaction level. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Structural model</head><p>After having ensured the measurement model reliability and validity, the structural model was estimated in order to test the hypotheses proposed in the conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In this context, both the model's predictive power and the relationships between the constructs were examined (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). To evaluate the predictive power of the research model the explained variance (R 2 ) and Stone-Geisser's Q 2 technique were used. Findings presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> reveal that the model has a considerably good prediction power since the R 2 values vary between 0.182 and 0.406 and the Q 2 values (model's predictive relevance) range from 0.172 to 0.397, showing the predictive importance of endogenous constructs. The constructs with higher variance explained by the model were the perceived tourism impacts on environment and on overall QOL (R 2 = 0.406 and R 2 =0.313, respectively) followed by tourist-host interaction level (R 2 = 0.270). On the other hand, the model only explained 18.2% of the variance of perceived tourism impacts on psychological features. As far as the hypotheses are concerned, the findings reveal that only two hypotheses are not supported (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</p><p>The first hypothesis predicted that participation in tourism activities had a positive impact on tourist-host interaction level, which was confirmed, registering the strongest impact of the model (β = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001). This reveals the strong power of tourism activities to stimulate tourist-host interactions, as discussed in the literature review section <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carneiro and Eusébio, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Su et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The findings also demonstrated a positive and significant influence of participation in tourism activities on all domains of QOL (hypotheses 2 to 5), especially on physical health (β = 0.29, p &lt; 0.001) and on environment (β = 0.29, p &lt; 0.001). When considering total effects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>), this impact is greatly intensified in all the domains of QOL, with the total impact being higher on environment and on physical health. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moscardo (2009)</ref>, the results highlight that carrying out tourism activities may improve physical health. Findings also support some literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sirgy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tse, 2014)</ref> which suggests that tourism activities may contribute to getting to know other places and to having more positive attitudes towards the environment (e.g., increasing access to information, increasing knowledge, creating more opportunities for being in healthier environments).</p><p>Regarding hypotheses 6 to 9, tourist-host interaction level was found to significantly influence all the QOL domains, with its highest impacts being on environment (β = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001) and, understandably, social relationships (β = 0.30, p &lt; 0.001). These findings emphasise the relevance of promoting social encounters between tourists and hosts in order to maximise the impacts of tourism on the youth tourists' QOL.</p><p>Finally, hypotheses 10 to 13 proposed that the impact of tourism on all QOL domains analysed influences the overall QOL. Results show that only two domains of QOL reveal a significant positive impact on overall QOL. Psychological features recorded the strongest and most positive effect on overall QOL (β = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001), followed by environment (β = 0.21, p &lt; 0.01). Although there is a need to expand research in this field, these findings corroborate other studies carried out (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eusébio and Carneiro, 2011)</ref>, revealing the importance that the perceived impacts of tourism in the psychological domain and on environmental features has in improving tourists' overall QOL.</p><p>Moreover, it should be stressed that both participation in tourism activities and tourist-host interaction level also have a significant indirect impact on the perceived impact of tourism on youth tourists' overall QOL (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>), which shows that it is of utmost importance to offer tourists the opportunity to engage in various tourism activities and to interact with hosts in several contexts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and implications</head><p>The research model developed and tested in a sample of university students through PLS-SEM and presented in this paper, provides important insights regarding the factors that may influence the perception of the impacts of tourism on youth tourists' QOL, given the scarce number of studies in this field. The model examines the relationships between two important dimensions of the tourism experience -participation in tourism activities and tourist-host interaction -and perceived tourism impacts on youth tourists' QOL. The model proposed meets all the requirements regarding both the measurement and the structural models and explains around 31.3% of the variance of the perceived impacts of tourism on youth tourists' overall QOL.</p><p>The findings, which refer to a case study performed at a Portuguese university, reinforce the relevance of the engagement in tourism activities to increase tourist-host interactions and the crucial role of both tourism activities and tourist-host interaction in improving the impact of tourism on all the domains of QOL considered in the studyphysical health, psychological features, social relationships and environment -and, indirectly, to improve overall QOL. Moreover, the results also revealed the significant role of psychological features and environment domains of QOL in improving the impact of tourism on overall QOL. Despite the results corroborating some findings about the constructs analysed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dolnicar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim and Jogaratnam, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCabe et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pizam et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reisinger and Turner, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sinkovics and Penz, 2009)</ref>, the absence of studies that simultaneously examine the relationships between all these constructs makes the comparison of the results with other findings difficult.</p><p>This study provides several theoretical contributions that permit some advances in the research regarding tourism impacts on QOL. It enables to increase the knowledge concerning two important dimensions of the tourism experience -participation in tourism activities and tourist-host interactions -as determinants of the tourism impact on QOL. Another important contribution is the empirical evidence generated regarding the moderating role of tourist-host interaction between the participation in tourism activities and the impact of tourism on several domains of QOL. The research also provides relevant insights concerning the measurement of the QOL construct in tourism and on the relationships between several domains of this construct and the impact of tourism on overall QOL. This study also permits us to expand knowledge on the youth tourism market that, as previously stated, is an important market segment, since it is very resilient to constraints such as natural features and acts of terrorism and is in the first stages of the travel career <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richards, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">WYSE Travel Confederation/UNWTO, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The findings of this study also provide important implications for planners and managers of tourism destinations that intend to attract the youth tourism market. First, as the results evidence that participation in tourism activities has an important role in increasing the impact of tourism on QOL, it is important to provide tourism products that promote the participation in various kinds of tourism activities (e.g., cultural, sportive and recreational activities). Considering the important role of tourism activities in stimulating tourist-host interaction it is crucial to offer tourism activities that involve the participation of local residents as guides or in co-producing activities (e.g., gastronomy and handicraft workshops) where both tourist and host may have an active role. Moreover, given the important role of tourist-host interaction in improving the tourism impacts on QOL it is of paramount relevance that the managers of the tourism industry provide an environment and atmosphere during tours which encourage social interaction with local people.</p><p>Despite the theoretical and practical contributions of this study, some limitations may be identified. First, the present study is limited in scope, since it focuses on the youth tourism market, specifically on students of a Portuguese university. It would be interesting to replicate this research and test the research model proposed among the youth tourism market in other countries to analyse the potential influence of cultural differences and to replicate it in other market segments (e.g., senior market). In the present study only the social encounters between tourists and hosts were analysed. Furthermore, only the frequency of these encounters in several places was examined. In order to improve the measurement of this concept, future studies should incorporate broader analyses of social contact in tourism, including interaction between tourists and the frequency of different types of interactions (e.g., sharing meals with other visitors and hosts, exchanging gifts with other visitors and hosts). Moreover, as the aim of this study was not to identify the best method to analyse the structural relationship under study, we have not proceeded with comparisons/robustness tests using alternative estimation methods. This exercise would be an interesting topic for further research in this field. Finally, the model could be improved by incorporating other factors that may influence the impacts of tourism on tourists' QOL (e.g., motivations) in order to increase the predictive power of the model. This is a promising research area which still is in its initial stages, and it is especially important to develop research that contributes to design tourism products that permit an improvement of the impact of tourism on youth tourists' QOL.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Research model proposed (see online version for colours)</figDesc></figure>
