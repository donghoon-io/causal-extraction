<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Employee psychological reactions to micro-corporate social responsibility (CSR) have recently been expanded in interdisciplinary management science research. The shreds of evidence in this regard are inconclusive, fragmented, and underdeveloped about how employee cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of attitudes toward micro-CSR relate to each other and shape employee societal behavior (SB). In application of dual-process theories of attitude-behavior relations, we investigate the intra-relationships of perceived CSR-community (PCSRC; cognitive dimension of attitude), CSR engagement (CSRE; behavioral dimension of attitude), CSR positivity (CSRP; affective dimension of attitude). Also, we explore how these variables influence employee SB with a moderated-mediated model. Based on the opinions of 440 Bangladeshi employees as respondents, a structural equation modeling analysis confirmed the positive links from PCSRC to SB, PCSRC to CSRE, CSRE to SB, PCSRC to CSRP, CSRP to SB, and CSRP to CSRE. It also reported that CSRE mediated the relation between PCSRC and SB. It further examined that CSRP did not moderate the direct relation between PCSRC and SB, and the indirect relation between PCSRC and SB via CSRE at low, medium, or high employee CSRP. There are very crystal study implications that address policymakers to adopt CSR policy and its implementation strategies, accordingly, to employees' psychological reactions to micro-CSR.</p></div>

CSR as a broad area of study is popularly identified as "the commitment of business to contribute to sustainable economic development, working with employees, their families and the local communities"(World Business Council for Sustainable <ref type="bibr">Development, 2001)</ref>. In a similar vein, micro-CSR is designed as "the study of the effects and experiences of CSR on individuals (in any stakeholder group) as examined at the individual <ref type="bibr">(shareholder, supplier, consumer, community, customer</ref>, or employee) level of analysis" <ref type="bibr">(Rupp &amp; Mallory, 2015, p. 216)</ref>. In a recent review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnett et al. (2020)</ref> argued that the micro-CSR domain reconceives itself as a science of design.

A recent meta-analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhao et al. (2020)</ref> revealed that to date, the micro (employee)-CSR research has primarily explored halo effects of employee attitudes toward CSR on traditional behavioral outcomes, such as corporate identity, organizational trust, workplace creativity, organizational justice, task performance, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intention (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnett et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rupp &amp; Mallory, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020 for reviews)</ref>.</p><p>A few studies have investigated employee psychological reactions to micro-CSR and SB, although several researchers found positive associations between employees' attitudes to organizational CSR initiatives and socially responsible behaviors for the sustainable development of an economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhao et al., 2020)</ref>.

Also, we found limited studies that have explored how the components of employee attitudes such as the cognitive dimension of attitudes toward micro-CSR (notably perceived CSR-community <ref type="bibr">[PCSRC]</ref>), the behavioral dimension of attitudes toward micro-CSR (notably CSR engagement <ref type="bibr">[CSRE]</ref>), the affective dimension of attitudes toward micro-CSR (notably CSR positivity <ref type="bibr">[CSRP]</ref>) are intra-related and how and when these components of employee attitudes restyle their SB in an emerging market (notably in Bangladesh) context.</p><p>Employee SB indicates "an individual employee's socially responsible actions and manners that support overall social welfare and community well-being even outside their organizational work context" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>.

Therefore, in the application of attitude-behavior relations (ABRs) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wicker, 1969)</ref> of dual-processing theories (DPTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gawronski &amp; Creighton, 2013)</ref>, the current study addresses some vital research gaps by exploring the links from PCSRC to SB, PCSRC to CSRE, CSRE to SB, PCSRC to CSRP, CSRP to SB, and CSRP to CSRE. Many micro-CSR studies lack the rigor of exploring the mediators and moderators of the CSR perception-employee outcome relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hur et al., 2021)</ref>. Expanding the possible mediators and moderators is essential in answering the unaddressed question of causality between CSR perceptions and employee outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hur et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, it also examines the mediating role of CSRE in the relation between PCSRC and SB. It further investigates the moderating effects of CSRP in the direct relation between PCSRC and SB and indirect relation between PCSRC and SB via CSRE with a comparison at the low, medium, and high levels of CSRP. The four specific research questions of this current study are as follows. 1. How does employee PCSRC affect SB and CSRE; CSRE influence SB? 2. How does employee PCSRC affect CSRP; CSRP influence SB; CSRP relate CSRE? 3. How does CSRE mediate the relations between PCSRC and SB? 4. When does the effect of CSRP strengthen the direct relationship between PCSRC and CSRE and the indirect relationships between PCSRC and SB via CSRE?</p><p>To test the proposed relations accordingly to research questions, we get survey data from Bangladesh. Bangladesh is now adorning the demographic dividend benefits (almost 65% of its population is working age, between 15 and 64) to demark its succeeding targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mahmud et al., 2020)</ref>. With many prospects, Bangladesh is currently suffering from global issues (e.g., global warming, climate change, Rohingya refugee crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, increasing economic uncertainty, restricted access to quality education, poverty, hunger, environmental degradations, lack of good governance, and employee rights). These challenges are ushered by augmented pressure from various stakeholders to pay corporate resources to create business value, better community development, a safe environment, and societal progress in a globally responsible, accountable, and sustainable means <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mahmud et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al., 2021b)</ref>. Employee PCSRC, CSRE, and CSRP attitudes toward organizational socially responsible actions are dominant factors of a firm to donate corporate resources for restyling employee SB towards better community development and positive social change in Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b)</ref>. It is ultimately a memorable occasion for Bangladeshi employees to be the co-partner of the regime and development partners to achieve its SDGs and accomplish its growth ambition of becoming an uppermiddle-income country by handling multiple economic challenges and social crises. Therefore, the inquiry of employee psychology such as attitudes, associations among the components of attitudes, and workforce psychological reactions to specific socially responsible activities (notably PCSRC) and SB is an urgently needed research agenda for policymakers and the academic world to upsurge the labor force in CSR involvement, gain investments in human capital, and raise productivity through increasing its vital stakeholder-business integration and contributing corporate resources as a voluntary business practice in Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Girschik et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mahmud et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vizcaıno et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory, Model, and Hypothesis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory and Model</head><p>For the past four decades, many studies in social cognitions and socially responsible behaviors have been developed and directed by a class of social psychological theories popularly recognized as DPTs. DPTs have mainly been rooted in the prime assumption that human beings' mental processes, attitudes, and other psychological reactions to social actions are classified into two general classes: those have operated automatically in a social system, and those have functioned in a socially controlled environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gawronski &amp; Creighton, 2013)</ref>. Early DPTs inclined to be domain-specific in that they absorbed particular social contextual phenomena such as attitude-behavior relationships. The most prominent phenomenon specific DPTs are ABRs models widely used to explore how people's particular attitudes influence their specific behaviors.</p><p>In this study, in applying ABR models of DPTs, we interpret employee attitudes as comprising three dimensions, specifically cognitive, behavioral, and affective attitudes that shape and change the SB of an employee. The cognitive dimension of employee attitude refers to "the employee perceptions of the organization's commitment to society" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Klimkiewicz &amp; Oltra, 2017)</ref>. We proposed PCSRC as an example of cognitive dimension of employee attitude that is defined as "the firms' specific socially responsible activities to social welfare, such as charitable giving, donations, community development investments, social awareness programs, and collaboration with government officials and nongovernmental organizations for positive social change" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b)</ref>. The behavioral dimension of employee attitude represents to "the level of employee engagement in voluntary works, business ethics or CSR issues" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Klimkiewicz &amp; Oltra, 2017)</ref>. We adopt CSRE as an example of behavioral dimension of employee attitude that is identified as "employee interest in CSR issues, such as business ethics, volunteering behaviors, willingness to deepen into eco-friendly actions, and active doers to link the society and business and communicate their mutual relationships" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b)</ref>. Finally, the affective dimension of employee attitude refers to "the employee assessment of critical social characteristics and CSR policy of an organization" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Klimkiewicz &amp; Oltra, 2017)</ref>. We design CSRP as an example of affective dimension employee attitude that is recognized as "employee general feelings and positive attitudes toward a firm's better community developmentoriented socially responsible policies and actions that highlight employees' norms and manners of assessment of critical organizational culture, context, and CSR characteristics" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b)</ref>.</p><p>Expanding on how people's attitudes are shaped, changed, and directed, a class of DPTs of ABRs describes the processes through which individual attitudes guide their behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gawronski &amp; Creighton, 2013)</ref>. Thus, we attempt to investigate the links from PCSRC to SB, PCSRC to CSRE, CSRE to SB, PCSRC to CSRP, CSRP to SB, and CSRP to CSRE. ABR models have also been stimulated by frequent discussions about whether and to what extent people's attitudes influence their behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gawronski &amp; Creighton, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, we desire to explore the mediating mechanism of CSRE in the relation between PCSRC and SB. By shifting the focus from asking "Do attitudes guide behavior?" to the inquiry, "How do attitudes guide behavior?" ABR models of dual-process conceiving provided imperative insights into the conditions under which people's attitudes do or do not influence their discretionary behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gawronski &amp; Creighton, 2013)</ref>. Thus, we construct a conceptual model to investigate the moderating effects of CSRP in the direct relation between PCSRC and SB and indirect relation between PCSRC and SB via CSRE with a comparison at the low, medium, and high levels of CSRP. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> represents the overall conceptual model to be empirically tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Development</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PCSRC, CSRE, and SB</head><p>In the twentieth-first century, management science research is a time-driven shift from evaluating CSR's effects as a cumulation of all dimensions to account for a specific social turn <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Maon et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>. Given the recent global widespread attention and employees intensification in awareness of better community development and social responsibility, it is thinkable that the association of the cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of employee attitudes toward organizational specific social activities (e.g., PCSRC) and their rational discretionary behavioral outcomes (e.g., SB) need to be further investigated in the research domain of micro-CSR and positive societal turns <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Maon et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vizcaıno et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The ABR models of DPTs also focus on how people's attitudes are formed, reshaped, and directed toward their discretionary behaviors (e.g., SB). Generally, a socially responsible employee emphasizes the effect of organizational social initiatives (e.g., PCSRC), the consequences of social activities, and the history of social actions rather than personal preferences and articulate decision-making passages <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021</ref>). An employee is also more likely to involve in SB when his/her firm leads through its better community development-oriented CSR actions (i. e., PCSRC), credible informational cues about the status of contributory to better community development, and social well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Roeck &amp; Farooq, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vizcaıno et al., 2021)</ref>. When an employee develops positive attitudes toward organizational better community development oriented-CSR statements or needs for overall social welfare (i.e., PCSRC), they use their firm's social information, information about past social contextual behaviors, and what civil society and other stakeholders think <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Roeck &amp; Farooq, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moon et al., 2020)</ref>. The process of endorsing social needs or attitudes toward SB is affected by social information, the saliency of disclosures, and the significance of social statements, the stipulation to grow socially satisfactory and authentic justifications for social initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Employee social attitudes are vibrant antecedents of their psychological reactions to organizational CSR, especially PCSRC and positive social changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chaudhary, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mahmud et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhao et al., 2020)</ref>. Practitioners and academics identify CSR attitudes as a valuable tool for addressing employees' social concerns and discretionary behaviors such as SB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chaudhary, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hur et al. (2021)</ref> reported that a tradeoff occurs once employees shape positive attitudes that their firm aids or engages in better community development-oriented CSR (i.e., PCSRC) for positive social changes (e.g., charity-giving to community members, donations to vulnerable people, community development projects, and eco-friendly practices).</p><p>The extant literature in micro-CSR highlights that firms' specific social activities, especially PCSRCs, are considered a positive stimulus on employees' SB and their CSRE intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hill et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moon et al., 2020)</ref>. De Roeck and Farooq (2018) revealed that employee behavioral dimension of attitudes (i.e., CSRE) towards discretionary behaviors (i.e., SB) are natural outcomes of the consequence of insightful privilege of social initiatives and social, informational indications curbing from employee's organizational environment. They also reasoned that organizations' CSR novelties pay many prospects to form and change employees in CSRE in their work environment and community (e.g., donating to charity; investing labor, time, and money in social development projects; joining in the plan, design, promotion, and execution of CSR policies). <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rupp et al. (2018)</ref> stated that employees are likely to rejoin unquestionably to intuitions of a firm stylish in better community development-oriented CSR and counter detrimentally to corporations whose business operations are alleged for harmful activities or negative CSR. In sum, previous research on employee attitudes and their socially responsible behavioral outcomes indicates that an employee who possesses solid ethical views on social obligations, business operations, and CSR practices will be more knotted in CSRE and SB than those who take only a profit maximization motive organizational social responsibility. Therefore, the overall research outcomes on DPTs and employee outcomes reveal that employee attitudes and SB are leading stubborn by the organizational proximal CSR context, especially PCSRC and CSRE. Thus, we propose the following Hypotheses.</p><p>H1a: PCSRC is positively related to employees' SB. H1b: PCSRC is positively related to employees' CSRE. H1c: CSRE is positively related to employees' SB.</p></div>

Generally, employees are likely to react positively to perceptions of an employer engaging in socially responsible activities (e.g., community involvement, social welfare, or using environment-friendly materials in production) and retort negatively to a firm whose activities are alleged as socially irresponsible <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nazir et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rupp et al., 2018)</ref>. Suppose socially responsible employees positively perceive the features of their organizational CSR policy, particularly development community development-oriented CSR initiatives (i.e., PCSRC). In that case, they are more likely to identify themselves with the employer and society so that they will value more be a part of the organization's CSR implementation and perform social work in their community <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mahmud et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rupp et al., 2018)</ref>.

Consequently, if employees have a high level of mindfulness of social well-being (i.e., CSRP), they demonstrate many prosocial behaviors (notable SB), resulting from even organization-person fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Donia et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>.

In line with this perceptive, micro-CSR scholars have argued that perceptions of the firms' social actions, such as its better community development oriented-social activities (i.c., PCSRC), can influence employees' social concerns and shape their discretionary behaviors (notably SB) through their involvement in social works (i.e., CSRE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Girschik et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Maon et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chaudhary (2020)</ref> found that CSRE mediates CSR attributions and workers' creativity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vlachos et al.

In sum, this study predicts that the mediating role of employees' CSRE in PCSRC and their SB linkage might reasonably be expected from attitude-behavior relationships. Therefore, we propose Hypothesis 3 (H3) as follows.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and Sampling</head><p>Based on the convincing sampling method, 440 Bangladeshi employees such as commercial bankers, textile and garment workers, and foreign wage earners were recruited through an online survey conducted from September 1 to December 31, 2020. A survey link was sent to each targeted employee's respective social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and What-sApp) with the concerned office's verbal approval. Firstly, we directed a pilot survey with 39 concerned employees to confirm the targeted respondents' knowledge of the survey items. The pilot survey participants did not encounter any severe issues while responding to the preliminary questionnaire. One professor, two doctoral students (currently researching micro-CSR), and two managerial employees were also requested to examine the survey items. We added their comments and recommendations to improve the respondents' understanding of the questionnaire items.</p><p>Secondly, we sent a survey link to 1000 targeted respondents. After giving a reminder (3 times) with an interval of two weeks, we obtained 472 responses with a response rate of 47.20%. This response rate corresponded to the previous research on micro-CSR and employee attitudes and behavioral outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chaudhary, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al., 2021b)</ref>. We eliminated 32 responses due to the "straight-lining" problems. The final analysis was conducted on data collected from 440 respondents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respondent Demographics</head><p>We gathered the respondents' demographic information in a separate section of the survey form. Of the final sample (440), 51.4% of the respondents were between 30 and 40 years old, 41.1% were between ages 40 and 50 years, only two respondents were below 30 but above 20 years old (.5%), and 31 (7%) respondents were 50 years old and above. The respondents' age group-based outcomes indicate that a young group of employees (30-50 years old) dominated the study outcome. In addition, 52.5% were men, and 47.5% were women respondents. Thus, a gender-based biasedfree study has both genders' almost equal participation in the survey. On the basis of the respondents' educational level, 163 (37%) were graduate employees, and 277 (63%) respondents held a master's degree or above. Thus, highly educated employees shared their obtained knowledge by participating in the survey. The present research outcomes were led by the married (66.1%) versus unmarried (33.9%) employees' viewpoints. Among the respondents, 47.5% had below 5-year job experience, 43.6% were between 5 and 10 years of job experience, and only 39 (8.9%) respondents had a job experience of above ten years. On the basis of the respondent's position in the organizational hierarchy, 242 (55%) first-line managers' responses had more influence than 178 (40.5%) middle-level employees, and only 20 (4.5%) top-level managers' responses affected the present research outcomes. Most of the respondents had a high salary in the economic context of Bangladesh (i.e., 4.5% of the respondents were paid more than Taka100000 (Taka denotes Bangladesh currency), 18.9% of the respondents' salary was between Taka75000 and Taka100000, 30.7% of the respondents had a salary of Taka 50,000-75,000, and 45.7% of the respondents had a salary of between Taka 25,000-50,000. Almost 94% of the respondents were active volunteers in their community by sharing their income, time, and advice for better community development and social welfare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measure</head><p>We borrowed each construct's measurement scale in the current study from previous research. The respondents answered the questionnaire in Bangla (the national language of Bangladesh). The measurement scales were initially developed in English. Then, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hernández et al. (2020)</ref>, we translated all the scale items utilizing the standard translation-back-translation method. All constructs projected in the present study were measured on a seven-point Likert scale (1 [strongly disagree] to 7 [strongly agree]).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived CSR Community (PCSRC)</head><p>The PCSRC measurement scale was taken from De Roeck and Farooq (2018) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Strategy and Data Analysis</head><p>The current study runs structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the proposed measurement model and structural relationships in Smart-PLS (Version 3).

Thus, our study used this analytical strategy to handle the complex conceptual model having one moderator (CSRP) and one mediator (CSRP) in the relationship between PCSRc and SB by examining multiple related paths.</p><p>We conducted different data screening tests to ensure the findings' quality, reliability, and validity, such as multicollinearity, outliers, wrong coding, and missing values in SPSS. The findings do not confirm any of the issues in our sample. Non-response bias (NRB) was evaluated following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rogelberg and Stanton (2007)</ref>. In doing so, we compared and contrasted early and late respondents (n = 39) using t-tests. The outcomes showed an insignificant association (p &gt; .05), indicating that NRB does not affect our study findings. We performed a common method variance (CMV) test due to the cross-sectional nature of our research design, following the criteria of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref>. To do so, we used a full collinearity test suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kock (2015)</ref> to ascertain if there is any CMV in our research instrument. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> reveals the outputs of the full collinearity test. It has been found that all variance inflation factor (VIF) values turned to be lower than 3.3, indicating that CMV is not a big concern in our study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation Analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> demonstrates the outcomes of intercorrelations. As expected, PCSRC was positively correlated with CSRE (r = .335, p = .000) and SB (r = .351, p = .000). Similarly, CSRE (r = .347, p = .000) positively correlated with SB. Furthermore, CSRP (r = .425, p = .000) was positively correlated with CSRE. Hence, all these findings recognized our earlier structural relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>We performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in PLS-SEM to assess the proposed measurement model. The validity and reliability of the research scale were evaluated using the values of factor loading (FL), composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE), as advised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nunnally (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>. CR values were higher than the cut-off (&lt;.70) criteria of reliable instruments, thus validating that all measures were reliable. Similarly, the FL and AVE values were higher than .70 and .50, respectively, indicating the research instrument's convergent validity (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). We also tested the discriminant validity for the study measures using Fornell-Larker Criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. We found that the square root of AVE for each construct (diagonal elements) was more significant than its correlation coefficients (off-diagonal elements), thereby illustrating a solid discriminant validity of the study measures (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Testing</head><p>After the acceptance of the measurement model, we converted the measurement model into a structural model. Subsequently, we evaluated the values R square, Q square, and the significance of the paths coefficients. As evident from Appendix Tables <ref type="table">8</ref> and<ref type="table">9</ref> To test the hypotheses accurately, we run the structural model twice, with and without control variables. As evident from Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, without control variables, all the direct paths from PCSRC to SB, PCSRC to CSRE, CSRE to SB, PCSRC to CSRP, CSRP to SB, and CSRP to CSRE turned to positive and statistically significant.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> demonstrates the results of hypotheses testing in the presence of control variables. It was found, in the presence of control variables, PCSRC was positively related to employees' SB (β = .223, SE = .056, t = 3.979) and CSRE In addition, the paths from PCSRC and CSRP (β = .375, SE = .05, t = 7.502), from CSRP to SB (β = .132, SE = .053, t = 2.51), and from CSRP and CSRE (β = .356, SE = .047, t = 7.507) were found positive and statistically significant. Hence, H2a, H2b, H2c were supported. Subsequently, we did not find any significant influence of the control variables, except for Income (β = .161, SE = .081, t = 1.991) and MS (β = -0.145, SE = .054, t = 2.662).</p><p>We investigated the mediation hypothesis (H3) that CSRE mediated the relationship between PCSRC and SB. In doing so, we used <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hayes and Preacher's (2010)</ref> bootstrapping approach (5000 iterations) at a 95% confidence interval (CI) to measure the indirect influence. Bootstrap analysis is performed by constructing a large number of resamples B with an original sample size of N, and each resample is constructed by sampling cases from data with replacements. The findings (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>) illustrated that the indirect effect (β = .045, SE = .016, t = 2.718) of CSRE in the linkage between PCSRC and SB was significant, thus supporting H3.</p><p>Furthermore, we tested the moderating role of CSRP in the direct linkage between PCSRC and CSRE. In doing so, we utilized the product approach of Cohen and Cohen  <ref type="bibr">1983)</ref> and mean-centered our independent (PCSRC) and moderating variables. Then, we created the interaction term (multiplying independent and moderator) and ran the PLS-SEM moderation examination with CSRE (dependent variable). Consistent with our moderation hypotheses, the outcomes depicted that the interaction between PCSRC multiply CSRP and examining PLS-SEM moderation with CSRE found positive but insignificant (β = .28, t = 0.575, p = .283). Hence, moderation hypothesis H4 was not supported. Thus, we can conclude that the relationship between PCSRC and CSRE is not moderated by CSRP (See Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). This study also investigated if CSRP moderates the mediating role of CSRE in the relationship between PCSRc and SB. Hence, we performed a moderated mediation analysis using model 7 of Process Macro <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hayes, 2015)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">7</ref> also shows the indirect effect of PCSRC on SB through CSRE at different values of CSRP. It can be observed that the path of PCSRC ➔ CSRE ➔ SB is statistically significant at low, medium, and high levels of CSRP. However, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hayes (2015)</ref>, the index of moderated mediation is regarded as an actual test of moderated mediation (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).</p><p>Evidence for the moderation of the indirect effect (PCSRC ➔ CSRE ➔ SB) can be found in the bootstrap confidence interval for the index of moderated mediation does not include zero in between <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hayes, 2015)</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, the index of moderated mediation is .0072, and the 95% percent bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval based on 5000 bootstrap sample ranges from -.0256 to .0261. Since the confidence interval for the index of moderated mediation includes zero in between, we can conclude that CSRP does not moderate the indirect effect of PCSRC on SB through CSRE. Therefore, H5 was not supported in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Previous studies on CSR have primarily focused on the effects of total CSR and stakeholders' behavioral outcomes and their participation in CSR and extended prior findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hill et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vizcaıno et al., 2021)</ref>. They also demonstrated that even in an ongoing debate, employees could more favorably perceive micro-CSR initiatives as a vital internal stakeholder group. In this line-up, the current study explores underexplored micro-CSR initiatives (i.e., PCSRC) in applying popular social-psychological DPTs of attitudebehavior relationship. It tests the effects of employee PCSRC on their SB and CSRE; the influence of CSRE on SB. The current study's outcomes report that PCSRC is positively related to SB and CSRE. It also shows that CSRE is positively related to SB. These outcomes are consistent with those of De Roeck and Farooq (2018), <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Klimkiewicz and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Oltra (2017), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al. (2021b)</ref>. They also found positive relations between social welfare oriented-CSR and environmental degradation oriented-CSR employee socially responsible behaviors (social and green behaviors of employees). Our findings report that PCSRC allows the creation and strengthening of firms' social relationships, lessens negative feelings related to a suspected bad relationship between a company and its key stakeholders, and enhances employee SB and CSRE intentions.</p><p>This study also reports that PCSRC is positively related to CSRP; CSRP is positively related to SB and CSRE. Previous studies overlooked these links among employee attitudes and their behavioral perceptions. This study states that the employee affective dimension of attitude toward CSR (e.g., CSRP) plays a significant role in understanding how they perceive specific CSR signals and ultimately influence CSR-based employer attractiveness. Therefore, employees are expected to be positively reactive to employers appealing in socially accountable activities and negatively reactive to employers' perceived actions as environmentally and socially irresponsible.</p><p>This study also finds an answer of how, when, and under what condition employees' perceptions of organizational specific social activity (e.g., CSR-community) turn their specific socially responsible behaviors (e.g., SB) with a mediator (CSRE) and a moderator (CSRP) variable. The mediating mechanism is a pressing issue to justify organizational CSR activities and relational behavioral outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chaudhary, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hur et al., 2021)</ref>. The current study reports that CSRE mediates the relation of <ref type="bibr">PCSRC and SB consistents with De Roeck and Farooq (2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Klimkiewicz and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Oltra (2017), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al. (2021b)</ref>. They stated that when employees observe their firms' CSR activities as promising, they are likely to carry more liveliness to exertion and parade better assignation of CSR and assigned work. In the previous outline perspectives, the study reports that employees as human beings find meaningfulness in life by improving others' well-being by their CSRE or intentions of CSRE; CSRE directly influences employer branding; particularly, employees who pose a sophisticated assignation with CSR demonstrate a developed CSR-based employer attractiveness than those who expose a low assignation with CSR.</p><p>The ABR models of DPTs are popularly taken to test contingency effects between CSR perceptions and employees' behavioral outcomes in the CSR-HRM research domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chaudhary, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Roeck &amp; Farooq, 2018)</ref>. The current study reports that CSRP does not moderate the direct relationship between PCSRC and CSRE and the indirect relationship between PCSRC and SB via CSRE at the medium, or high employee CSRP. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Klimkiewicz and Oltra (2017)</ref> revealed that employees' CSRP is directly related to employer attractiveness. CSR is exceptionally significant for company selection to employees who distinguish CSR positively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al. (2021b)</ref> found CSRP moderates the direct relationship between PCSRC and CSRE and the indirect relationship between PCSRC and SB via CSRE such that these relationships are significant at the high level of employees' CSRP and insignificant when employees' CSRP is low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Contribution</head><p>CSR-sophisticated employees are also more prospective to dispensation career if the organization flops in CSR acquiescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>. Employee organizational identification intermediates the affiliation amid employees' perception of micro-CSR (i.e., CSR-community, and CSR-environment) and discretionary behaviors (i.e., societal and green behaviors; De <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Roeck &amp; Farooq, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hill et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Girschik et al. (2020)</ref> found that employee CSR perceptions have an enormously positive effect on their attitude toward CSR directly and indirectly (via work meaningfulness) among workforces with firmer morality beliefs and frailer centrality moral identity. Thus, similar to previous works, the current empirical faiths extend the understanding of organizational micro-CSR's strategic contributions into business value and society view by examining the links from PCSRC to SB, PCSRC to CSRE, CSRE to SB, PCSRC to CSRP, CSRP to SB, and CSRP to CSRE with a mediating (CSRE) boundary and a moderating condition in the application of DPTs of attitude-behavior relation in a newly emerging economy context (notably Bangladesh).</p><p>The findings support all the hypothesized relationships built on the ABR models of DPTs. Thus, the current study extends DPTs in the literature on the CSR-HRM domains. The current study's novel contribution is to find CSRE as a new intervening mechanism in CSR's contemporary literature. It is also treated as the first of the study of three dimensions of attitudes in the contemporary literature on the micro-CSR-HRM domains, such as cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of attitudes within three microconcept views such as micro (employee)-level analysis, micro-CSR area (PCSRC), and micro-level work setting (SB). The current study bridges the gaps between developing and developed nations as CSR study contexts (dominated by the developed economies) and between macro and micro levels of CSR literature (the larger volume of CSR literature is occupied with macro-CSR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implication for Policy Making</head><p>The current study's findings indicate that a specific micro-CSR dimension (i.e., PCSRC) is more likely to create employees' particular socially responsible behavior (i.e., SB). Employees have a pivotal role in spinning organizational CSR investments into social welfare and business value <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Roeck &amp; Farooq, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hur et al., 2021)</ref>. When a firm engages in CSR due to its intrinsic value to help society, it is a signal that employees will also be praised well, and the firm will not turn unscrupulously <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chaudhary, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>. As CSR performance boosts employer attractiveness for prospective and existing employees, companies that target to increase their social performance by shaping employees' discretionary behaviors through their engagement in CSR need to certify that firms' CSR policy is designed within the matching line of employees' desire to organizations for helping better community development and overall social welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Donia et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Klimkiewicz &amp; Oltra, 2017)</ref>. Therefore, firms' CSR policy and implementation strategies should be cautiously planned to gain a good result in the anticipated discretionary behaviors.</p><p>In the present study, more than half (55%) of the respondents are first-line workers (prime CSR ambassadors) who are directly related to customer services, and 40.5% are positioned as middle-level employees who make the liaison between the top official and first-line management personnel who confirm the proposed structural relationships. Thus, CSR managers can use CSR as a valuable strategic managerial tool to increase mid-level employees and first-line workers positive reactions to organizational CSR because when they observe their firm's CSR initiatives are to help better community development and overall social welfare, they feel a sense of pride in and respect with the society for their respective organizational identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Roeck &amp; Farooq, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>HR managers should aim to advance socially responsible HRM by arranging seminars, workshops, training, and knowledge-sharing opportunities to develop employees' positive attitudes toward their firm's CSR initiatives into business value and social welfare. To do so, HR managers can announce CSR awards and labels for employees' active engagement in CSR activities that publicly recognize their firm's efforts and their participation in society, which will flow the internal organizational pride and external prestige in their organizational membership. PCSRC is positively related employees' discretionary behaviors and CSRE, and CSRP is also positively related to CSRE; thus, CSR managers should adopt a CSR policy that addresses the social needs for better community development and positive social turns of Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mahmud et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The micro (employee)-CSR study that explores the association of employee psychology and organizational CSR initiatives that can foster social turns is still under focused and left aside in the emerging markets contexts and literature on the CSR-HRM domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hill et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rupp et al., 2018)</ref>. The current study aims to bridge the gap between macro and micro-foundations by investigating the intra-relationships among employee cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions of attitudes and their impacts on SB under the ABR models of DPTs in a newly emerging market (notably Bangladesh) context. In the twenty-first century, CSR research is a time-driven shift from evaluating CSR's effect as a cumulation of all dimensions to account for the influence of a CSR subdimension on positive social change <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Maon et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>. As a win-win-win strategy, CSR is now more effectively utilized for business growth, societal progress, and employees' well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Girschik et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mahmud et al., 2021a)</ref>. As firms' insiders, employees are a powerful patron group; their responses to organizational CSR exertion are related to understanding the societal good created by CSR inventiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chaudhary, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vizcaıno et al., 2021)</ref>. Our study expands DPTs in the CSR literature by revealing the positive associations of PCSRC, CSRE, CSRP, and SB with the mediating role of CSRE and the boundary condition of CSRP (although the moderation conditions are not supported). Therefore, firms should plan CSR policy and its impersonation strategy accordingly to employees' psychological reactions to organizational CSR, such as attitudes, emotions, feeling, engagement, and positivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jurek &amp; Besta, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vizcaıno et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The generalizability of the current study's findings can be questionable because a few employees have participated in the survey from a South Asian emerging economy (Bangladesh) having multiple economic, social, and environmental crises. As such, further research can replicate this conceptual model in other national, cultural, and economic (developing and developed) contexts to corroborate our findings and conclusion. Another limitation is that this study is crosssectional self-reported data, which may produce a CMV bias. Although we assessed CMV that was minimum in the current research findings, future studies should perform on longitudinal design to check our model over time and generalize our findings. We collected data on a single period; thus, we suggest future research to project longitudinal and experimental inquiries to investigate further impressions of specific CSR dimensions and employee discretionary behaviors in the micro-CSR domain.</p><p>Beyond methodological limitations, social scientists can extend the micro-CSR literature by exploring other stakeholders (e.g., community, customer, and shareholder), micro-CSR perceptions, and SB. Our model can be extended by examining how firms' specific social, informational cues (e.g., CSR-environment) can eventually interact with employees' work engagement and discretionary behaviors (e.g., green behaviors). Potential researchers can also expand our model on other mediating mechanisms (e.g., respect, pride, and justice) that might decode stakeholders' perceptions on specific CSR dimensions into discretionary behaviors in the workplaces and out of the office. Although CSRP as a moderating variable does not support the assumption, potential moderators (e.g., public value awareness) that might resonate with the credibility and authenticity of firms' assignation in CSR should also be considered to comprehend the specific micro-CSR-SB relationships well.</p><p>Beyond variable(s) selection, an emerging body of literature needs to examine the effect of a firm's specific social activities on sustainability with potential CSR scholars' extensive attention to engross in sensing latent social outcomes of CSR initiative, not just economic value <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hur et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nazir et al., 2021)</ref>. Lastly, if CSR is not rooted in social value, it might be alleged as greenwashing, which can shape employees' negative CSR experience, resulting in deviance and disengagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Girschik et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mahmud et al., 2021b)</ref>. Thus, future research might address the conditions under which perceived CSR can simultaneously move to the win-win-win outcomes of social welfare, employee well-being, and business value.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Conceptual model</figDesc><graphic coords="4,184.25,57.76,360.00,177.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
