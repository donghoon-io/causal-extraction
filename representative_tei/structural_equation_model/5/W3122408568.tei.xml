<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Formatively-measured constructs (FMCs) are increasingly used in marketing research as well as in other disciplines. Although constructs operationalized by means of formative indicators have mostly been placed in exogenous positions in structural equation models, they also frequently occupy structurally endogenous positions. The vast majority of studies specifying endogenouslypositioned FMCs have followed the common practice of modeling the impact of antecedent (predictor) constructs directly on the focal FMC without specifying indirect effects via the formative indicators. However, while widespread even in top journals, this practice is highly problematic as it can lead to biased parameter estimates, erroneous total effects, and questionable conclusions. As a result both theory development and empirically-based managerial recommendations are likely to suffer. Against this background, the authors offer appropriate modeling guidelines to ensure that a conceptually sound and statistically correct model specification is obtained when a FMC occupies an endogenous position. The proposed guidelines are illustrated using both covariance structure analysis (CSA) and partial least squares (PLS) methods and are applied to a real-life empirical example. Implications for researchers are considered and 'good practice' recommendations offered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, formative measurement models whereby "the direction of causality flows from the indicators to the latent construct, and the indicators, as a group, jointly determine the conceptual and empirical meaning of the construct" <ref type="bibr">(Jarvis, MacKenzie &amp; Podsakoff, 2003, p. 201</ref>) have increasingly been used in marketing studies to operationalize constructs as diverse as e-service quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Collier &amp; Bienstock, 2006)</ref>, relationship value <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ulaga &amp; Eggert, 2006)</ref>, retailer equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arnett, Laverie &amp; Meiers, 2003)</ref> and strategic responsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Nakata, Zhu &amp; Izberk-Bilgin, 2011)</ref> to name but a few.</p><p>While there exists an impressive body of literature on formative measurement models dealing with such issues as model specification and identification (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Diamantopoulos, Riefler &amp; Roth, 2008)</ref>, the focus has, with few exceptions, been on structurally exogenous formatively-measured constructs <ref type="bibr">(FMCs)</ref>. By 'structurally exogenous' we mean that the focal construct is only influenced by its assigned formative indicators but has no further observed causes. FMCs, however, might also occupy an endogenous position in the structural equation model representing a researcher's theory. Here, in addition to the formative indicators, one or more antecedent constructs are also hypothesized to impact the FMC.</p><p>Unfortunately, FMCs cannot be placed in structurally endogenous positions in the same way as their reflectively-measured counterparts, that is, by simply specifying a direct link from the antecedent to the endogenous construct. As will be subsequently demonstrated, doing so and failing to realize that the antecedent construct's impact on the endogenous FMC should in fact be captured by its indirect effect via the formative indicators, will almost always lead to biased structural parameters, incorrect effect sizes and, ultimately, erroneous study conclusions. As a result, theory development and the generation of empirically-based managerial insights are both likely to suffer.</p><p>SCHUMPETER <ref type="bibr">DISCUSSION PAPERS 2014-005</ref> Although, in recent years, a few authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cadogan &amp; Lee, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Temme &amp; Hildebrandt, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wiley, 2005)</ref> have warned against linking FMCs and their antecedents solely by direct construct-level paths (i.e., without further links to the formative indicators), such warnings have remained unheeded as a literature review on the use of endogenous FMCs in top journals demonstrates (see Section 2). The prevalence of misspecification in the literature can partly be attributed to the fact that the (erroneous) practice of modeling the influence of antecedent constructs on endogenous FMCs only by a direct link at the construct level can also be found in methodological papers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jarvis et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">MacCallum &amp; Browne, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">MacKenzie, Podsakoff &amp; Jarvis, 2005)</ref> and partly to the absence of concrete guidelines on how to correctly model such relationships.</p><p>The purpose of the current paper is to offer such guidelines so as to enable marketing researchers to correctly assess the influence of explanatory variables on FMCs under both covariance structure analysis (CSA) and partial least squares (PLS) perspectives. In doing so, we highlight several conceptual and methodological issues and also present an empirical illustration of 'good practice'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Misspecification of Endogenously-Positioned FMCs</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> shows how endogenous FMCs are typically modeled in empirical literature. Here η 1 is the FMC with formative indicators x 4 and x 5 , while ξ 1 is the antecedent construct with reflective indicators x 1 -x 3 . The relationship between ξ 1 and η 1 is captured by γ 11 . The constructs η 2 and η 3 are hypothesized reflectively-measured outcomes of the FMC. Given that ξ 1 , x 4 and x 5 are all exogenous, they are all allowed to covary, as indicated by covariances ϕ 14 , ϕ 15 and ϕ 45 <ref type="bibr">(McCallum &amp; Browne, 1993)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE</head><p>Modeling the influence of ξ 1 on η 1 along the lines shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> (i.e., by specifying a direct path between the two constructs only) is intuitively appealing as it simply mimics the way such effects are specified in both CSA and PLS path modeling when a reflectively-measured construct acts as the dependent variable. However, when the latter is an FMC such an approach creates a logical inconsistency because "a change in the value of a formative latent variable cannot occur independently of a change in the value of one or more of its indicators" <ref type="bibr">(Cadogan &amp; Lee, 2013, pp. 234-235)</ref>. This condition is clearly not fulfilled in the model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> because the antecedent construct (ξ 1 ) impacts the FMC (η 1 ) without impacting any of the formative indicators (x 4 , x 5 ). Thus, the specification mistakenly assumes that η 1 completely mediates the impact of ξ 1 on η 1 and η 3 independently from the FMC's formative indicators. As the latter remain exogenous but are allowed to covary both with each other and with ξ 1 , the direct effect γ 11 in fact only captures the antecedent variable's incremental impact conditioned on the formative indicators. Consequently, if the formative measurement model has been correctly specified, no direct influence of ξ 1 on η 1 will emerge (i.e., within sampling error, γ 11 = 0), resulting in a total effect of zero. Given a true non-zero total effect, this specification will considerably underestimate the impact of ξ 1 on η 1 and invariably lead to wrong conclusions.</p><p>Unfortunately, the practice of linking antecedent constructs to a FMC only by direct construct-level paths is widespread in the literature. A review of articles (47 in all) involving endogenous FMCs in six top-tier marketing journals during 2006-2012 (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) revealed that the overwhelming majority (94%) incorrectly specified the effects of antecedent variables on endogenous FMCs at the construct level only, that is, by directly linking the predictor construct(s) to the FMC. Our review covered the following journals: International Journal of Marketing Science (MS). A full list of the reviewed articles can be found in the online appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE</head><p>As can be seen from Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, the reviewed studies have been classified according to (a) whether aggregation of formative indicators was undertaken prior to estimation, and (b) whether the latter was performed with CSA, PLS or regression-based approaches. Both dimensionshandling of formative indicators prior to analysis and estimation method -have a substantial influence on the distortions resulting from incorrectly specifying the links between FMCs and their antecedents. Roughly one-third of the articles used disaggregated formative measurement models, however, in each of these studies the direct 'construct-level only' effects specified for the relationships between antecedent constructs and FMCs were interpreted as total effects. More specifically, in CSA, the direct effect was erroneously not regarded as an incremental/additional effect but as the only (i.e., total) effect of the antecedent construct on the FMC. Likewise, in PLS path modeling, direct links have been misinterpreted as representing the total impact of the antecedent construct(s) on the FMC which -as vividly demonstrated by our empirical illustration in Section 4 -is inappropriate. The remaining two-third of the articles formed composites prior to CSA or regression-type analysis. Although -at least in principle -this approach allows to correctly estimate total effects (see Section 3.3 for the necessary conditions), the prevailing practice of aggregating equally-weighted formative indicators casts serious doubt on whether such effects have indeed been correctly estimated in the corresponding empirical studies.</p><p>Three papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Melancon, Noble &amp; Noble, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Roggeveen, Tsiros &amp; Grewal, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Seiders, Voss, Godfrey &amp; Grewal, 2007)</ref> are notable exceptions from the mainstream approach in that they at least estimate individual effects of antecedent variables on each of the formative components. However, none of these studies documents results for a complete structural model in which the effects of antecedent variables on the FMC are mediated by its formative components.</p><p>Instead, total effects were determined based on a regression of a composite score for the FMC on the antecedent variables.</p><p>In the next section, we provide the correct specification for evaluating effects on FMCs for the three most typical cases: disaggregated formative measures in CSA, disaggregated formative measures in PLS and aggregated formative measures in CSA or regression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Correct Specification of Endogenously-Positioned FMCs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Disaggregated formative measures in CSA</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> displays the correct specification in CSA for assessing the impact of the antecedent construct ξ 1 on the FMC (now denoted as η 3 ). In contrast to the misspecified model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, there are now direct effects (represented by γ 11 and γ 21 ) from ξ 1 on the formative indicators thus making the latter variables endogenous <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Temme &amp; Hildebrandt, 2006)</ref>. This is achieved through the introduction of the pseudo-latent variables η 1 and η 2 which enable the formative indicators of η 3 (now denoted as y 1 and y 2 ) to function as endogenous variables; note in this context that λ 11 = λ 22 = 1 and ε 1 = ε 2 = 0, which implies that y 1 ≡ η 1 and y 2 ≡ η 2 . Similar to the common specification of free covariances between exogenous formative indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(MacCallum &amp; Browne, 1993)</ref>, the error terms of the two pseudo-latent variables η 1 and η 2 are allowed to correlate (i.e., ψ 12 ≠ 0). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bollen and Davis (2009)</ref>, identification of the formative measurement model is established by, first, specifying direct effects from η 3 on the two reflectively-measured outcome constructs η 4 and η 5 , and, second, by fixing one of these outgoing paths to unity (i.e., β 43 = 1). If we proceed from the full mediation hypothesis implied by a correctly specified formative measurement model (i.e., that the influence of any remote cause has to be completely channeled through the formative indicators), the exogenous latent variable ξ 1 impacts η 3 (i.e., the FMC) only indirectly via its influence on the two pseudo-latent variables η 1 and η 2 (model without the dashed path γ 31 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). In this specific case, the total effect of ξ 1 on η 3 equals the sum of the exogenous latent variable's indirect effects on η 3 via η 1 and η 2 , that is, γ total = γ 11 β 31 + γ 21 β 32 . Note, in this context, that if, upon estimation of this model a significant modification index is obtained pointing to an (additional) direct effect from ξ 1 on η 3 , this would be indicative of misspecification of the formative measurement model itself in that at least one relevant formative indicator (correlated with ξ 1 ) has been omitted. Given that, in practice, formative measurement models are sometimes specified somewhat incorrectly, it seems prudent to include an additional direct path to the FMC (model including the dashed path γ 31 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) which will pick up the antecedent variable's effect on the FMC via any missing formative indicators. In such an extended model, the total effects amounts to γ total = γ 11 β 31 + γ 21 β 32 + γ 31 .</p><p>Of course, if the direct path turns to be non-significant (i.e., within sampling error, γ 31 = 0), it could be subsequently eliminated; indeed, such a non-significant effect would enhance confidence in the FMC's measurement model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Disaggregated formative measures in PLS</head><p>Correctly specifying the same model in PLS (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) leads to a similar model structure as in CSA with two fundamental differences. First, introducing η 1 and η 2 as pseudolatent variables for the formative indicators, leaves η 3 (i.e., the focal FMC) without indicators.</p><p>Since such a model cannot be estimated in current implementations of the PLS approach (e.g., SmartPLS or PLS Graph), an additional reflective indicator (shown as y 9 in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) needs to be assigned to η 3 . Second, unlike CSA, PLS does not allow disturbance terms to be correlated; thus the covariance between ζ 1 and ζ 2 is zero (ψ 12 = 0).</p><p>As was the case for CSA, it is recommended to also include a direct path from ξ 1 to η 3 (shown as the dashed path γ 31 in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) to account for the antecedent construct's impact on the FMC via any omitted indicators. This is particularly important in PLS as the lack of model fit diagnostics such as modification indexes, can result in misspecifications remaining undetected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Aggregated formative measures in regression</head><p>As previously noted in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, formative indicators are often aggregated and the resulting composites used as dependent variables in subsequent regression analyses. The key reason for doing so is because "lack of parsimony when modeling formative indicators as separate constructs is an issue" <ref type="bibr">(Howell, Breivik &amp; Wilcox, 2007, p. 215</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cadogan &amp; Lee, 2013)</ref>. However, there is a clear downside to aggregation in that potential relationships of interest between an antecedent variable and the individual indicators of a FMC cannot be explicitly assessed. Thus one cannot trace the separate paths from the antecedent construct to the FMC via the formative indicators and draw inferences as to which indicators are mostly affected SCHUMPETER DISCUSSION PAPERS 2014-005 and how. This is an important shortcoming of aggregation not least because it is entirely possible that the same predictor construct can impact some formative indicators positively and others negatively; in this case, aggregating indicators can completely mask the impact of the antecedent construct on the FMC. Furthermore, potentially omitted formative indicators will not be detected if aggregation is used (since there will be only a single path linking the antecedent construct with the composite).</p><p>With the above caveats in mind, let us assume that the FMC in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> is now represented by the composite variable C 3 (instead of the formative latent variable η 3 ), completely determined by the two formative indicators y 1 and y 2 (i.e., ζ 3 = 0). Assuming mean-centering of y 1 and y 2 and given specific, a priori fixed β-weights, aggregation leads to the following linear composite:</p><p>(1)</p><p>For each formative indicator, the impact of the mean-centered antecedent variable ξ 1 is specified by the following regression equation:</p><p>(2) where i = 1,2.</p><p>The total effect of ξ 1 on C 3 is then captured by the slope parameter (referred to as γ total ) in the corresponding regression of C 3 on ξ 1 which can be estimated as follows:</p><p>(3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3 31 1 32 2 β β = + C y y 1 1 , γ ξ ζ = + i i i y ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 3 1 total 1 31 1 32 2 1 1 ,ξ γ ξ β β ξ ξ = +     = Cov C Var E y y</formula><p>Var Substituting Equation (2) for the two formative indicators in Equation (3) and invoking the common assumption that the predictor ξ 1 is not correlated with the disturbances ζ 1 and ζ 2 yields:</p><p>(4) Thus, as long as the β-weights for the formative indicators are correctly determined, regressing C 3 on ξ 1 yields an unbiased estimate of the total effect of ξ 1 on C 3 via the formative indicators (note that this conclusion may not apply to the FMC η 3 if some of the indicators have been omitted). Even in this case, however, the shortcomings of aggregation noted earlier still apply and, therefore, we urge researchers to opt for disaggregated modeling of endogenous formative indicators along the lines discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical Illustration</head><p>We now illustrate the steps involved in modeling a structurally endogenous FMC by using real data from a survey of students' satisfaction with the university cafeteria (n = 181). By comparing the results under both incorrect (i.e., direct effect at the construct level only -Model 1) versus correct specifications (i.e., indirect effects via the formative indicators plus a direct effect at the construct level -Model 2), we empirically highlight the substantial discrepancies in the study implications arising from the two models. Furthermore, we show that CSA and PLS produce vastly different results if the antecedent variable's effect on the FMC is incorrectly modeled. Our illustrative model (shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) proposes that the importance price plays in students' decisions on where to go for a meal (hereafter simply referred to as 'price importance')</p><p>has an impact on their satisfaction with the university's cafeteria (hereafter simply called 'satisfaction'). Satisfaction is conceptualized as a FMC, whereby satisfaction with the (1) taste and (2) healthiness of the meals, (3) the variety of meals offered each day, (4) the cafeteria's cleanliness, and (5) the prices charged by the cafeteria function as formative indicators.</p><p>Additionally, satisfaction is measured by two reflective items (overall satisfaction; right choice); all indicators of satisfaction are measured on 5-point rating scales, with larger values implying more favorable judgments. The exogenous antecedent variable price importance is measured by a single item, whereby larger values on a 4-point rating scale indicate higher importance of price.</p><p>The relevant parameter estimates under both methods of estimation are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Estimation results -Model 1</head><p>In Model 1, the antecedent variable price importance impacts satisfaction only directly, that is, the five formative indicators remain exogenous variables. Thus, the corresponding CSA specification drops the paths γ 11 to γ 51 and only models the path γ 61 ; the formative indicators are allowed to covary freely both with each other and with the antecedent construct, ξ 1 . A scale for the FMC was established by appropriately constraining its variance to unity as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Franke, Preacher and Rigdon (2008)</ref>, while linking the FMC to the two reflective items ensured that the model was identified (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bollen &amp; Davis, 2009)</ref>. In the PLS specification, Mode B was chosen for the outer model in light of satisfaction's conceptualization as a FMC (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hair et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>CSA estimation of Model 1 provides an excellent overall fit (χ 2 = 7.37, df = 5, p = 0.195; RMSEA = 0.051; CFI = 0.992; NNFI = 0.979; SRMR = 0.017). The parameter estimates suggest that the importance price plays in students' food-related decisions has no significant impact on their satisfaction with the university cafeteria (γ direct = γ 61 = 0.03, p &lt; 0.58). In contrast, PLS estimation suggests a strong positive relation between price importance and satisfaction (γ direct = γ 61 = 0.31, p &lt; 0.0001). Marked differences also emerge for the formative indicator weights.</p><p>Whereas in the CSA model all weights are positive and highly significant, only two formative indicators (satisfaction with price and taste) are significantly linked to satisfaction in the PLS model. Furthermore, price satisfaction has a negative weight which is clearly counterintuitive as it suggests that increasing students' satisfaction with the prices charged would decrease their overall satisfaction level.</p><p>The highly divergent CSA and PLS results for Model 1 can be largely attributed to the fact that CSA and PLS optimize very different criteria during parameter estimation (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Henseler &amp; Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>. Whereas CSA minimizes a global fit function based on some distance between the observed and the model-implied covariance matrix, PLS maximizes a correlation-based criterion. Specifically, the PLS solution is equivalent to the results of a canonical correlation analysis where 'price importance' is the predictor and 'satisfaction' is the dependent canonical variate. Thus, the formative indicator weights γ 11 to γ 51 are determined such that the correlation (i.e., the PLS estimate for the direct effect γ 61 in Model 1) between the two variates is maximized. As a result, the estimated weights no longer reflect the extent to which the different formative indicators contribute to the overall satisfaction level independently from antecedent variables like price importance.</p><p>The above discrepancies between CSA and PLS serve to emphasize that incorrect modeling of endogenously-positioned FMCs may lead to very different conclusions depending on the estimation method used. What is even more important, however, is that neither the CSA nor the PLS results for Model 1 accurately depict the true influence of price importance on satisfaction. Only Model 2 can unambiguously reveal this influence as shown below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Estimation results -Model 2</head><p>In Model 2, price importance is supposed to impact satisfaction both indirectly, that is, through the observed formative indicators (which are now specified as endogenous pseudo-latent variables represented by η 1 -η 5 in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and directly (in order to capture a possible impact via unobserved formative indicators). Since we presume that price importance would not completely account for the observed formative indicators' intercorrelations, the corresponding error terms (i.e., ζ 1 -ζ 5 in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) were allowed to covary in the CSA model. In the corresponding PLS model, satisfaction was measured by the two reflective items, that is, Mode A has been chosen</p><p>for the outer model.</p><p>CSA estimation of Model 2 leads to the same overall fit as for Model 1. Likewise, the direct effect of price importance as well as the formative indicator weights are identical to those in Model 1 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). However, the results now show that price importance impacts cafeteria satisfaction indirectly through significant positive effects mediated by taste (p &lt; 0.05) as well as cleanliness (p &lt; 0.05) and through a significant negative effect via prices (p &lt; 0.05). These significant but opposing indirect effects ultimately result in a non-significant total effect of 0.13.</p><p>The latter, however, should not be interpreted as implying that price importance does not affect satisfaction but rather that it has countervailing influences (some positive and some negative) channeled through different formative indicators. In fact, the finding that the same antecedent SCHUMPETER DISCUSSION PAPERS 2014-005 construct (here price importance) can have significant but directionally opposing effects on different indicators of a FMC (here, satisfaction) corroborates the arguments made in Section 3.3 against the aggregation of formative indicators prior to analysis. Moreover, the non-significant direct path from price importance to satisfaction in Model 2 (γ direct = γ 61 = 0.03, p &gt; 0.10)</p><p>indicates that, at least for the explanatory variable price importance, the satisfaction construct's content domain seems to be adequately captured by the five formative indicators shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Note that the results can now be used to provide specific managerial insights into how satisfaction can be improved. For example, since students that place high importance on price are more satisfied with taste and cleanliness but at the same time are less content with the prices charged, communicating a "best deal" or "value for money" image for the cafeteria may help increase students' satisfaction with the latter.</p><p>Unlike with Model 1, PLS estimation of Model 2 largely produces very similar parameter estimates as the CSA analysis (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>; the total effect of 0.12 is non-significant as well) and thus leads to the same substantive conclusions. Thus the correct specification for modeling endogenous FMCs seems to lead to consistent results irrespective of the method of estimation whereas the incorrect specification does not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Guidelines for Researchers</head><p>Based on our analysis, the following guidelines can be derived regarding the modeling of FMCs in endogenous positions. First, we recommend that researchers avoid aggregation of formative indicators of the endogenous FMC prior to estimation. Instead, a disaggregated approach should be adopted whereby each formative indicator is modeled as a separate endogenous variable and linked to the relevant antecedent construct(s) as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>.</p><p>Second, we recommend that the influence of antecedent constructs on an FMC should always be modeled by specifying direct effects on the corresponding formative indicators (like the paths γ 11 and γ 21 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) instead of direct effects on the FMC only. If the measurement model for the FMC is correctly specified, this should suffice to completely capture the antecedent variables' impact on the focal FMC since all antecedent variables' effects on the FMC will be fully mediated by the formative indicators (as was the case in our illustrative example).</p><p>Third, we recommend that an additional direct effect (like the path γ 31 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) is introduced in order to capture any effects of the antecedent variables which are conveyed by unobserved components (i.e., omitted indicators) of the FMC. Testing this effect not only ensures that the total effect of the antecedent variable on the FMC will be correctly estimated but helps scrutinize the validity of the formative measurement model. Since a direct effect of an antecedent variable on an FMC captures its impact over and above that through the formative indicators, a significant direct effect implies that there are other (unobserved) indicators through which the antecedent variable operates. Especially if the direct effect of an antecedent construct on the FMC exceeds (in absolute terms) the corresponding indirect effects via the formative indicators, doubt would inevitably be cast on whether a sufficiently comprehensive set of indicators has been used</p><p>to operationalize the FMC. In this case, it may be wise to revisit the specification of the formative indicators in light of the construct definition.</p><p>Fourth, we recommend that researchers test for such (additional) direct effects after establishing that the proportionality constraints implied by formative measurement models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bollen &amp; Davis, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Franke et al., 2008)</ref> hold for the FMCs in a study. Such constraints emerge because the effects of the formative indicators on downstream outcomes of a FMC (i.e., reflective indicators or dependent constructs) are assumed to be completely channeled through the FMC such that "there are no <ref type="bibr">[additional]</ref> direct effects between the indicators and the outcome variables in the model" <ref type="bibr">(Diamantopoulos, 2011, p. 340)</ref>. To illustrate, if a FMC's influence on one outcome variable η A is twice as strong as its effect on another outcome variable η B , every formative indicator's effect on η A must likewise be twice as strong as its effect on η B (hence the name 'proportionality constraints'). If these proportionality constraints do not hold for a particular formative indicator (in CSA such violations can be revealed by inspecting the modification indices for direct effects between formative indicators and downstream outcome variables), this casts doubt on the latter's validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bollen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Franke et al., 2008)</ref>. Note that it is important to assess that proportionality constraints hold before testing for a direct effect of the antecedent variable on the FMC in order to ensure that the latter test is not distorted by inadequate formative indicators.</p><p>Fifth, we recommend that researchers opt for CSA rather than PLS when estimating models with endogenous FMCs. This is because (a) PLS requires at least one (additional) reflective indicator if an FMC is endogenous, (b) PLS does not allow the disturbance terms of endogenously-specified formative indicators to be correlated, and (c) PLS offers no diagnostics (such as modification indices) enabling the assessment of proportionality constraints. Taken together, these limitations suggest that CSA should be the method of choice when estimating models with endogenous FMCs.</p><p>By means of summarizing the above recommendations, Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> provides a flowchart that marketing researchers can use for guidance when placing a FMC in an endogenous position in a structural equation model.   </p></div>
