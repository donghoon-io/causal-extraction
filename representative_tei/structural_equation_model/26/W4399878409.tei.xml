<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study investigates the determinants of sustainable construction practices in Nigeria, focusing on the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the research examines the relationships between various independent latent constructs-organizational culture, government policies, financial implications, stakeholder processes, and technology availability-and their impact on sustainability outcomes. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 248 respondents from 10 sampled construction companies in Nigeria. The data collected was analysed using SIMPLEX Project in LISREL The result of the SEM highlight the paramount importance of government policies, exhibiting the highest path coefficients across all sustainability dimensions. Organizational culture significantly influences sustainability, with companies prioritizing sustainability more likely to adopt green technologies and eco-friendly practices. Financial resources, effective stakeholder engagement, and access to advanced technologies also positively impact sustainability outcomes. The study reveals significant cross-impacts among the three sustainability dimensions, demonstrating their interconnected nature. These insights provide valuable recommendations for policymakers and industry stakeholders to foster a sustainability-oriented culture, invest in technology, and engage stakeholders effectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The construction industry is a cornerstone of the Nigerian economy, accounting for approximately 4% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employing a substantial portion of the workforce <ref type="bibr">(National Bureau of Statistics, 2020)</ref>. This sector not only stimulates economic growth through infrastructure development but also serves as a catalyst for the advancement of other sectors, such as manufacturing and services. Despite its critical role in economic development, the construction it is plagued by sustainability challenges that threaten its long-term viability. One of the primary issues is the inefficient use of resources, characterized by the excessive consumption of materials and energy, which not only increases costs but also environmental impacts <ref type="bibr">(Adeyeye et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, the industry generates a significant amount of waste, much of which is not recycled or reused, leading to increased environmental pollution and landfill use <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Oluwakiyesi, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Environmental degradation associated with construction activities includes deforestation, soil erosion, and air and water pollution, which pose severe risks to public health and biodiversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Emodi, &amp; Boo, 2018)</ref>. These environmental issues are compounded by a lack of stringent regulatory enforcement and the prevalent use of outdated and inefficient construction practices and technologies. The coexistence of these challenges with the sector's importance to the Nigerian economy highlights an urgent need for sustainable construction practices. Such practices would not only mitigate the negative environmental impacts but also enhance resource efficiency and reduce waste. There is a pressing need to adopt innovative and sustainable construction methodologies that align with global best practices while considering the local economic, social, and environmental context of Nigeria <ref type="bibr">(Johnson &amp; Turner, 2021)</ref>. Sustainable construction practices in Nigeria remain nascent, facing significant obstacles that impede widespread adoption. Primary among these is a pervasive lack of awareness regarding the environmental, economic, and social benefits of sustainable construction. This issue is worsened by a scarcity of targeted educational programs and insufficient engagement with key industry stakeholders, which are crucial for fostering a culture of sustainability within the construction sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Olawumi, &amp; Chan, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, the regulatory frameworks necessary to support sustainable construction are underdeveloped. Current policies do not adequately incentivize the adoption of green technologies nor enforce sustainability standards in building designs and materials. This regulatory gap fails to compel or encourage construction firms to alter established practices that are often detrimental to the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ezekiel &amp; Ogunsemi, 2020)</ref>. Another critical barrier is the limited access to sustainable materials and technologies. While global advancements in construction technology offer promising solutions for sustainability, these innovations are seldom integrated into the Nigerian construction industry due to high costs, limited local availability, and a lack of technical expertise necessary for implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adegbile, 2021)</ref>. The disparity between the recognized benefits of sustainable construction-such as reduced environmental impact, enhanced building efficiency, and improved occupant health-and its current limited application in Nigeria underscores the urgent need for a model that effectively integrates sustainable practices into the sector. Such a model would address these systemic barriers by providing a structured approach to implement sustainable practices, adapting to local challenges and leveraging available resources for maximum impact.</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to develop an empirically validated model that explains the determinants of sustainable construction practices in Nigeria. This involves identifying and analyzing the key factors that influence environmental, social, and economic sustainability in the construction sector. Specifically, the study seeks to identify and measure the key determinants that influence sustainability in construction projects, which include organizational culture, government policies and regulations, financial implications, stakeholder processes, and the availability of technology and expertise. By employing SEM, the study aims to examine the complex interrelationships among these determinants, understanding how they interact with each other and collectively influence sustainability outcomes. The study hypothesizes that these relationships are not merely linear but involve reciprocal and feedback mechanisms that reflect the dynamic nature of the construction industry.</p><p>A major focus of the study is assessing the impact of government policies and regulations on sustainability outcomes, quantifying the extent to which supportive policies enhance environmental, social, and economic sustainability in construction projects. Additionally, the study examines how organizational culture, including values, norms, and practices oriented towards sustainability, impacts the adoption and implementation of sustainable construction practices. It seeks to determine whether a strong organizational culture oriented towards sustainability leads to better sustainability outcomes. Financial considerations are another crucial aspect analyzed in the study. The study aims to understand how financial implications, such as the availability of funding for sustainable initiatives and the cost implications of sustainable practices, affect sustainability outcomes in construction projects. Furthermore, the study investigates the role of stakeholder processes, examining how stakeholder engagement, communication, and collaboration influence sustainability outcomes.</p><p>The study also explores the availability and impact of technology and expertise in promoting sustainable construction practices. It assesses how the availability and utilization of advanced technologies and the expertise of the workforce contribute to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a comprehensive and empirically validated model that captures the complex interactions among the various determinants of sustainability in the construction industry. This model will provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers. The findings of this study will have significant implications for both theory and practice. The development of a validated model will contribute to the academic literature by providing a deeper understanding of the determinants of sustainability in the construction industry. For practitioners, the insights gained from this study will inform the development of strategies and policies aimed at promoting sustainable construction practices. Policymakers will benefit from understanding the critical role of regulatory frameworks and the need for supportive policies to enhance sustainability outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Current Practices in the Nigerian Construction Industry</head><p>The construction sector in Nigeria has experienced significant growth due to rapid urbanization and economic development. Despite this growth, the industry's adoption of sustainable construction practices has been notably slow, primarily driven by a traditional focus on immediate economic returns rather than long-term sustainability goals. This emphasis on short-term gains often results in the extensive use of conventional construction materials and methods that are heavily reliant on energy consumption and resource depletion. Such practices have increase the environmental footprint of the construction sector, manifesting in increased greenhouse gas emissions, significant waste production, and widespread ecological disturbances <ref type="bibr">(Bankoleet al., 2017)</ref>. Environmental degradation linked to construction activities not only compromises ecological health but also affects the social fabric and economic stability of communities. For instance, the improper disposal of construction waste contributes to land pollution and can obstruct natural waterways, leading to increased flooding and associated social and economic disruptions <ref type="bibr">(Olawuniet al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In response to these challenges, there are emerging shifts toward more sustainable practices within the Nigerian construction industry. Innovations include the utilization of locally sourced materials, which reduces the carbon footprint associated with the transportation of materials. Additionally, there is an increasing interest in recycling construction waste to produce new building materials. Projects such as the use of crushed concrete as an aggregate in new construction or the repurposing of reclaimed wood and metal are examples of such initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dada., 2018)</ref>. Despite these advancements, the widespread adoption of these sustainable practices remains limited. The barriers to broader implementation include a lack of standardized regulations promoting sustainable construction, insufficient knowledge and expertise among local builders and contractors about sustainable practices, and the higher upfront costs associated with green building technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Afolabi et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, there is a cultural aspect to consider, as the inertia of traditional building practices and resistance to change among local stakeholders can impede the integration of innovative, sustainable methods <ref type="bibr">(Ezekiel et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Theoretical Framework</head><p>Developed by John Elkington in 1997, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) theory advocates for businesses, including those in the construction industry, to commit equally to environmental, social, and economic responsibilities <ref type="bibr">(Elkington, 1997)</ref>. This framework emphasizes that sustainable development should balance ecological preservation with economic benefits and social well-being. In the construction sector, this means projects should minimize environmental impacts, contribute positively to the communities they affect, and still achieve economic viability. Applying the TBL theory in Nigeria is crucial as the country faces significant sustainability challenges, such as resource depletion, waste management issues, and social inequality. These challenges call for a multidimensional approach to sustainability that can be systematically addressed through the TBL framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ihuah et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Everett Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory, first published in 1962 and refined over subsequent editions, provides insights into how new ideas and technologies gain traction and are adopted within a society <ref type="bibr">(Rogers, 2003)</ref>. This theory identifies key elements that influence the adoption of new technologies: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. In the context of Nigerian construction, these elements can explain the varying levels of acceptance and implementation of sustainable practices. For example, sustainable technologies often come with higher upfront costs and may not align with existing construction practices, posing significant barriers to their widespread adoption. Furthermore, the benefits of such technologies, while significant in the long term, may not be immediately apparent to stakeholders, thus slowing their adoption rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Oladinrin et al., 2017)</ref>. In order to effectively promote sustainable construction in Nigeria, an integrated approach that combines the TBL framework with the principles of the Diffusion of Innovations is necessary. This approach would not only advocate for the environmental, economic, and social benefits of sustainable practices but also address the practical concerns related to their adoption. For example, by demonstrating the long-term economic benefits and enhanced community wellbeing associated with sustainable construction, industry leaders can increase the relative advantage and compatibility perceptions among stakeholders. Educational and pilot programs can also be employed to enhance the trialability and observability of these practices, making them more tangible and desirable within the local context <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Akanbi et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Gaps in Practice</head><p>The transition towards sustainable construction in Nigeria, despite the theoretical availability of advanced technologies and methods, is impeded by a constellation of barriers. These impediments are multifaceted, encompassing educational, economic, and policy-related challenges that together stifle the adoption of green building practices.</p><p>A fundamental barrier is the pervasive lack of awareness and knowledge among construction professionals and stakeholders regarding sustainable construction practices. This deficiency not only affects the adoption of existing technologies but also dampens the demand for further innovation and investment in this sector <ref type="bibr">(Adeleke et al., 2019)</ref>. The gap in knowledge is exacerbated by a disconnect between the capabilities of sustainable technologies and the skill sets available among local professionals, indicating a critical need for extensive training and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Olatunji, 2021)</ref>. Another significant obstacle is the inadequate support and incentives from the government. Policies that could promote sustainable construction through subsidies, tax breaks, or mandates are either underdeveloped or poorly implemented. This lack of robust governmental frameworks not only slows the adoption rates of green practices but also contributes to a business environment that favors conventional methods due to their lower upfront costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chendo &amp; Obi, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The economic implications of adopting sustainable construction are also daunting. The high initial costs associated with green buildings-stemming from the premium on sustainable materials and the technologies required to deploy them-discourage widespread adoption. This financial burden can be particularly prohibitive in a developing economy where cost considerations often override environmental concerns <ref type="bibr">(Lawal et al., 2022)</ref>. Perhaps most critically, there is a significant gap in the integration of sustainable construction practices within the academic curriculum of Nigerian universities. The majority of construction-related programs do not adequately address sustainable construction, resulting in a workforce that is ill-prepared to meet the challenges of modern, environmentally-conscious building practices <ref type="bibr">(Fagbenleet al., 2020)</ref>. This educational shortfall perpetuates a cycle of non-sustainable construction practices, as new generations of construction professionals are not equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to implement sustainable solutions effectively. Additionally, cultural and social factors play a role in the slow adoption of sustainable practices. There is often a resistance to change and a preference for traditional construction methods that are perceived as less risky and more straightforward to manage. Overcoming these cultural barriers requires not only educational interventions but also broad-based campaigns to shift public perceptions and values toward sustainability <ref type="bibr">(Nduka et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Structural Equation Model (SEM)</head><p>Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a robust statistical technique used for testing and estimating causal relationships using a combination of statistical data and qualitative causal assumptions. SEM has become an indispensable tool in social sciences, behavioral sciences, education, and business research due to its ability to model complex relationships between observed and latent variables. Key concepts in SEM include latent variables, observed variables, the measurement model, the structural model, and path diagrams. Latent variables are unobserved variables inferred from observed variables and often represent abstract concepts like intelligence, satisfaction, or socioeconomic status. Observed variables are directly measured and serve as indicators for latent variables. The measurement model specifies how latent variables are measured by the observed variables, typically through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The structural model depicts the relationships between latent variables, including direct and indirect effects. Path diagrams are graphical representations of SEM models, illustrating the relationships between variables with arrows <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kline, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Model specification and identification are critical steps in SEM. Specifying an SEM model involves defining the hypothesized relationships among variables based on theoretical considerations. Identification ensures that the model has a unique solution, meaning it has more known information (data points) than unknowns (parameters) to be estimated. An identified model is necessary for reliable parameter estimation and meaningful interpretation of results <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 2016)</ref>. Several estimation methods are employed in SEM, each with its advantages and limitations. Maximum Likelihood (ML) is the most common method, assuming multivariate normality of the data. Despite its popularity, ML can be sensitive to violations of normality assumptions. Generalized Least Squares (GLS) is less sensitive to these violations, making it a suitable alternative in some cases. Bayesian Estimation, which incorporates prior distributions, is particularly useful for small sample sizes or non-normal data, offering a flexible approach to parameter estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lee, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Evaluating model fit is an essential aspect of SEM, and several indices are used for this purpose. The Chi-Square Test evaluates overall model fit but is highly sensitive to sample size, often leading to significant results even for well-fitting models. The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is another widely used index, with values below 0.06 indicating a good fit. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) are also popular, with values above 0.95 suggesting a good fit. These indices provide researchers with a comprehensive assessment of how well their model represents the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bentler, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Steiger, 1990</ref>). SEM's applications are diverse, spanning multiple disciplines. In psychology, SEM is used to examine the relationship between mental health constructs, allowing researchers to test complex theoretical models involving multiple latent variables. In education, SEM helps assess the impact of teaching methods on student performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of different educational interventions. In marketing, SEM models consumer behavior and brand loyalty, helping businesses understand the factors that drive customer satisfaction and retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hoyle, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Byrne, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Despite its strengths, SEM is not without challenges and criticisms. The complexity of SEM requires substantial statistical expertise and familiarity with specialized software like AMOS, LISREL, or Mplus. Large sample sizes are often needed for reliable estimates, which can be a limitation in studies with smaller populations. Model specification is another critical issue; misspecification can lead to incorrect conclusions, highlighting the importance of theoretical grounding and careful model development <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(MacCallum &amp; Austin, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Review of Related Studies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.51">Sustainable Construction Practices</head><p>Adeleke et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) conducted a comprehensive study to identify the barriers hindering the adoption of green building practices in Nigeria. Employing a qualitative research approach, they gathered and analyzed the perspectives of various construction industry professionals.</p><p>The study highlighted significant barriers such as a lack of awareness, inadequate skills, and insufficient governmental incentives. The findings emphasize the need for enhanced educational programs and policy reforms to support sustainable practices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dada (2018)</ref> focused on the use of recycled materials in Nigerian construction, aiming to promote sustainability in the sector. Through a qualitative analysis of case studies and existing literature, Dada identified that recycled materials could considerably reduce the environmental footprint of construction activities. The study concluded that integrating such materials leads to environmental and economic benefits by minimizing waste and reducing material costs. Nevertheless, Dada's research lacks a quantitative assessment of the long-term durability and performance of recycled materials in construction.</p><p>Lawal et al. ( <ref type="formula">2022</ref>) investigated the economic challenges of adopting sustainable construction in Nigeria. Using a quantitative method, they analyzed cost implications and perceived economic barriers that affect stakeholders' decisions. The research found that the high initial costs of sustainable construction technologies deter their adoption despite potential long-term savings. However, this study did not address the possible financial incentives or policies that could mitigate these initial costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nduka &amp; Okeke (2019)</ref> explored the cultural and social barriers to sustainable construction in rural Nigeria. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach combining surveys and interviews, they documented significant resistance to new construction methods, rooted in traditional practices and skepticism towards modern technologies. The study recommends targeted community engagement strategies to change perceptions and encourage sustainable practices. <ref type="bibr">Obi et al. (2021)</ref> focused on the social impacts of sustainable construction practices in developing countries. Their qualitative study involved interviews with construction workers and stakeholders to assess changes in workplace safety and community well-being. Findings suggest that sustainable practices lead to improved safety and enhanced social inclusion. However, the research would benefit from a comparative analysis to measure improvements against non-sustainable construction projects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.52">Governmental Policies and Incentives</head><p>Chendo &amp; Obi (2021) analyzed the impact of governmental policies on sustainable construction in Nigeria. Through an extensive review of policy documents and stakeholder interviews, their study identified that inconsistent and poorly implemented government policies are major barriers to sustainable construction. The authors suggest comprehensive policy reforms to establish a more supportive environment for sustainability. <ref type="bibr">Johnson &amp; Turner (2021)</ref> examined the adoption of sustainable practices and technologies in the Nigerian construction industry, focusing on the influence of external pressures and local dynamics. They used a qualitative approach, interviewing key industry players to understand the drivers and obstacles of sustainability adoption. The study highlights that while international models and standards are influential, local adaptation is crucial for effective implementation. <ref type="bibr">Elkington (1997)</ref> carried out a seminal work on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) which introduced a framework that has been widely influential in discussions about sustainable business practices, including construction. Elkington's book provides a conceptual analysis of how businesses can operate by equally valuing social, environmental, and financial returns. While highly theoretical, the book lacks empirical data specific to the construction industry, particularly in developing countries like Nigeria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.53.">Economic Impact</head><p>Ezeudu et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) conducted a study assessing the economic benefits of sustainable construction in Nigeria. Their research, primarily quantitative, analyzed cost-benefit scenarios of implementing sustainable practices. The findings indicate substantial long-term savings and profitability enhancements, advocating for a broader uptake of green building standards. However, the study does not address the short-term economic challenges that stakeholders often face, which may deter initial investments in sustainable technologies. <ref type="bibr">Bankole et al. (2017)</ref> researched the environmental impacts of conventional construction practices in Nigeria. Utilizing environmental impact assessments (EIA), the study quantitatively measures the negative effects of traditional construction methods on local ecosystems. The research underscores the need for stricter regulatory frameworks to mitigate these impacts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.54.">Educational Gaps and Needs</head><p>Fagbenle et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) explored the integration of sustainable construction in professional education in Nigeria. Through surveys and curriculum analysis, their study points to a significant gap in educational offerings related to sustainability. They advocate for curriculum reforms to include sustainable construction principles. The study, while comprehensive, does not examine the effectiveness of existing educational interventions in improving sustainable construction practices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Olatunji et al. (2021)</ref> focused on the knowledge and awareness levels regarding sustainable construction technologies among construction professionals in Nigeria.</p><p>Their study, based on questionnaires and interviews, identifies a significant knowledge gap that hinders the adoption of these technologies. While insightful, the research could be strengthened by a longitudinal study to track changes in awareness and implementation over time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.55.">Technological Innovations and Diffusion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Research Gaps</head><p>The pursuit of sustainable construction in Nigeria has been a focal area of academic and industry interest. However, notable research gaps remain, especially in areas that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, responsive policy development, economic strategies, educational initiatives, and cultural integration. There is a considerable gap in research concerning the practical application of sustainable construction practices within the unique socio-economic and cultural contexts of Nigeria. Existing studies often lack a detailed exploration of how sustainable technologies and methodologies can be effectively tailored and implemented in Nigeria's distinctive market dynamics and labor capabilities.</p><p>The effectiveness of existing policy measures and the development of new regulatory frameworks to support sustainable construction is another area lacking in-depth research.</p><p>There is a need for comprehensive analyses that evaluate the success or failure of specific policies and develop insights based on comparative analyses with other developing countries that have successfully fostered sustainable construction practices. Economic considerations are crucial, yet there is a shortage of detailed research on the economic feasibility of adopting sustainable construction practices in Nigeria. Studies frequently cite cost as a barrier without adequately exploring potential financing models or economic incentives that could mitigate these costs and encourage the adoption of sustainable practices.</p><p>Although the lack of education and awareness regarding sustainable construction is well acknowledged, there is a paucity of empirical research focused on integrating sustainable construction into educational curricula and professional training programs. More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions and their impact on enhancing the adoption of sustainable practices. The cultural aspects of adopting sustainable construction practices have not been sufficiently studied. The construction industry in Nigeria is deeply entrenched in traditional practices, which may conflict with modern sustainable methods. Research focused on understanding cultural perceptions, readiness for technological adoption, and developing culturally sensitive sustainability approaches is critically needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Research Design</head><p>This study employed a quantitative research approach, designed to systematically investigate the factors influencing the adoption of sustainable construction practices in Nigeria. The objective is to develop a predictive model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the relationships between these factors. The sample for this study consists of 248 respondents drawn from the Nigerian construction industry, including architects, engineers, project managers, and policymakers. This sample size is sufficient to provide the statistical power needed for complex model testing in SEM, following guidelines by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hair et al. (2017)</ref> on sample sizes in SEM analysis. The respondents were selected using a stratified random sampling technique to ensure representation across different professional roles and geographic locations within the industry.</p><p>Data was collected using a structured questionnaire, which was developed based on a review of the literature and existing validated instruments. The questionnaire was divided into sections corresponding to various constructs identified as relevant to sustainable construction practices, such as awareness, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, policy influence, and individual commitment to sustainability. The questionnaire consist of multiple-choice questions and Likert-scale items, where respondents will rate their agreement or disagreement on a five-point scale.

It combines different methods such as confirmatory factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, and path analysis. The model has two parts: a measurement part that tests how well observed indicators reflect latent constructs (factors derived from factor analysis), and a structural part that tests how latent variables and an outcome variable are related (Chou and Yang, 2012). To use SEM, we need two types of variables: latent constructs, which are not directly measurable, such as knowledge areas and project performance measures, and observed indicators, which are measurable. The technique is based on analyzing the covariance structure of the variables (Karl et al., 2016), and it is better than multiple regression analysis because it accounts for the measurement error that occurs when many variables are measured <ref type="bibr">(Molenaar et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The hypothetical model for the SEM was developed using the three areas of sustainability (environmental sustainability ENS, Economic sustainability ES and social sustainability SS) as the dependent latent variables and the five factors influencing the adoption of sustainability (organizational culture OC, availability of technology and expertise ATE, financial factor FF, stakeholder practices SP and government policies and regulations GPR) as the independent latent variables with their respective observable variables used for data collection. The model was developed using Chou and Yang (2012), <ref type="bibr">Karl et al. (2016)</ref> and Shanmugapriya and Subramanian (2015) and brainstorming with the10 professionals in the construction industry with at least 10 years of work experience in project management. The following hypotheses were drawn at the end of the brainstorming session using direct influence (positive relationship). This resulted into 25 hypotheses as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.2. The model included both a measurement model and a structural model. The measurement model defined the relationships between latent constructs and their observed indicators, ensuring that the constructs are accurately represented by their respective indicators. The structural model specified the hypothesized paths among the latent constructs, based on theoretical and empirical evidence from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>.</p></div>

SEM is particularly appropriate for this research due to its ability to handle multiple dependent relationships and its robustness in theory testing. The analysis was conducted using the software package LISREL which provides tools for both measurement model assessment and structural model development. The goodness of fit of the SEM model was assessed using several indices, including the Chi-Square statistic, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). These indices provided a comprehensive assessment of how well the model fits the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. The Chi-Square statistic tested the overall fit of the model, with lower values indicating a better fit. RMSEA assesses the model's approximation error per degree of freedom, with values less than 0.06 indicating a good fit. CFI and TLI compared the fit of the specified model to that of a null model, with values close to 0.95 or higher suggesting a good fit.</p></div>

Companies with technological proficiency and expert knowledge are better equipped to implement energy-efficient systems, waste reduction technologies, and sustainable materials.</p><p>The study revealed significant cross-impacts among the three sustainability dimensions. For instance, environmental initiatives like pollution control and green spaces can enhance social well-being, while economic sustainability can provide the financial resources needed for environmental investments. These findings highlight the interconnected nature of sustainability dimensions. The results of this study offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to promote sustainability in the construction sector. Developing comprehensive policies that provide clear incentives for sustainable practices, such as tax breaks for using green materials, subsidies for renewable energy projects, and penalties for non-compliance with environmental standards, is essential. Policies that facilitate access to financial resources for sustainability initiatives can significantly enhance the adoption of sustainable practices.</p><p>For industry stakeholders, the findings highlight the importance of cultivating a sustainability-oriented culture. Companies should foster a culture that prioritizes sustainability at all organizational levels through leadership commitment, employee training, and integrating sustainability into corporate values and practices. Allocating resources to acquire advanced sustainable technologies and expertise is crucial. Companies should invest in energy-efficient systems, waste reduction technologies, and sustainable materials to improve their sustainability performance. Effective stakeholder engagement is essential for aligning sustainability goals with organizational practices. Companies should actively involve employees, customers, suppliers, and the community in sustainability initiatives to ensure comprehensive and inclusive strategies. While this study provides a robust model for understanding sustainable construction practices in Nigeria, future research should focus on empirical validation using field data. Collecting data from various construction projects can provide more accurate and context-specific insights. Exploring the dynamics of sustainable construction practices in different regional contexts can help generalize the findings and provide tailored recommendations for diverse settings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 3.2 Hypothetical SEM</figDesc><graphic coords="16,79.10,72.00,466.43,294.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Their qualitative study reveals a growing interest in sustainable practices, though actual implementation remains low.Akindele et al.

Their work combines environmental science with socio-economic analysis to highlight the urgent need for sustainable interventions in the construction sector. However, the study does not provide specific recommendations for construction practices or policy changes needed to address the identified issues</figDesc><table /></figure>
