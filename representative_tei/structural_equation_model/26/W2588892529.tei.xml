<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Attitudes towards consumption have shifted in recent years making the sharing economy increasingly popular as an instrument to prevent unsustainable resource consumption and to improve resource allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>. In addition, the proliferation of Internet-based platforms and mobile applications incessantly facilitates the rise of the sharing economy. Modern information and communications technologies allow people to disintermediate traditional commercial channels and to share excess capacity with each other effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3]</ref>. In this context, online platforms are often seen as the enablers of contemporary sharing economy services <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Previous research conceptualizes the concept of trust as a key component to establish a successful collaborative environment. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Morgan and Hunt (1994)</ref> identify trust as an important factor influencing cooperative activity. Following this logic, Ostrom (2000) finds trust and reciprocity to be essential to initiate and maintain C2C relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pavlou and Gefen (2002)</ref> further integrate institutionbased structures as an influential factor of trust in an intermediary framework. On the face of it, there is good reason to believe that trust is of high importance in the sharing economy.</p><p>The need for trust to establish online relationships, has been extensively elaborated in related online industries, for example, the e-commerce industry. However, existing theory is unable to fully explain the customers" intentions in the sharing environment, where users often get in contact with each other via an online platform and share a physical good in the offline world. In this regard, a comparative examination of intermediary and property provider trust in a sharing environment remains an open question. Answering this question is the first objective of our study. Therefore, we analyze the implications of trust on the customers" intentions on the sharing economy platform Uber. Uber is particularly suitable in the context as the mobile app connects complete strangers on short-term notice.</p><p>In particular, the goal of our study is to assess, whether "trust in Uber" and "trust in drivers" influence the customers" intentions to use the ridesharing service. In our paper, we close the existing research gap by answering the following research question: Does trust influence the customers' intentions on Uber?</p><p>We adopt the research model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gefen (2000)</ref>, which investigates the building and the implications of trust in the e-commerce industry. In addition, we follow the theory of "Trust and Power" by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Luhmann (1979)</ref>, which comprises the fundamental conditions of trust. In this regard, we derive its validity from the sharing economy and propose a modified research model that seeks to explain the participation behavior in the ridesharing industry.</p><p>By doing so, we contribute to the field of IS by complementing the theory of trust-based decisionmaking on online platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. We further examine a possible trust transfer between the intermediary, hereinafter referred to as Uber, and the property providers, hereinafter referred to as drivers.</p></div>

Finally, by incorporating the antecedents "disposition to trust" and "familiarity" in temporary C2C relationships, we also contribute to the sharing economy research by incorporating an established trust-inducing design.</p><p>We expect that trust influences the customers" intentions to "inquire about drivers" and to "request a ride" on Uber. In addition, we expect that "trust in Uber" and "trust in drivers" are interconnected. Finally, we expect that the antecedents "disposition to trust" and "familiarity" are a precondition of trust in our sharing economy setup.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the related work on the sharing economy, including the relevant literature on trust and the corresponding antecedents.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The sharing economy</head><p>Contemporary sharing practices not only extend the current market demand by addressing the needs of potential customers, but also compete with existing firms over the available market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>. Hence, while using modern technology, they enter existing markets, providing goods and services over digital commercial channels. In addition, they often realize economic, cultural, and organizational benefits that could not be achieved with the traditional ownership practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. As a result, they continuously outperform incumbent businesses, which only offer goods and services over obsolete commercial channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. These sharing practices go by various names, such as "access-based consumption" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, "collaborative consumption" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>, "commercial sharing systems" <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, "consumer participation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, "the mesh" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, and "sharing economy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the sharing economy. The sharing economy is based on a hybrid market model that can nowadays be found in numerous industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. In this regard, the most profound market changes can be observed in the hospitality <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53]</ref> and transportation industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>. In the following, we focus on Uber, an online platform that enables its user to offer, share, and request a ride. As a consequence, we exclude all other sharing economy platforms that focus on other industries, apply uncompensated sharing practices, or offer incomparable goods and services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Trust</head><p>Trust is a complex concept that has been studied incessantly from different perspectives in various disciplinary fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. In the following, we understand trust as an attribute that originates through relationships among different parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Based on this logic, researchers have shown that trust is crucial in interpersonal and commercial relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref> that involve risk, uncertainty, or interdependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. The need for trust is particularly high in socially distant relationships, such as in the online environment, due to an increasing transaction complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Hence, online interactions that cannot be fully controlled by the individuals require an adequate trust basis to function successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>. With the absence of trust, in order to reduce uncertainty, individuals would need to consider the entire action set of a counterpart <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. As a consequence, individuals would rather refrain from an interaction than to evaluate all outcome possibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Trust is among the most effective complexityreduction mechanisms, as it eliminates negative outcome possibilities from a consideration set <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. Following this logic, with the rising dependency on other individuals and growing vulnerability to their misconduct, the need for trust increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Researchers argue that trust is particularly important in the online environment, such as in e-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>, crowdsourcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>, and virtual teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. However, there is scarce literature on the implications of trust in the sharing economy, in particular the ridesharing industry. We believe that the combination of peculiarities of Uber, such as one-time shared rides on short notice between private individuals, the usage of a mobile application, transparency of demographic data and GPS location, interactions with strangers, and the intermediary framework, have an extensive effect on the implications of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>.</p><p>Besides, previous research shows mixed results on the implications of trust in intermediary frameworks. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Verhagen et al. (2006)</ref> revealed a significant direct effect of seller trust on people"s attitude towards purchasing on C2C online marketplaces; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hong et al. (2011)</ref> found that consumer behavior is largely determined by a trustworthy platform and not seller trust on B2C electronic markets. Accordingly, we draw the conclusion that the implications of intermediary trust and provider trust are influenced by the underlying relationship framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Uber, on the other hand, is an example of a C2C business with a commercial focus where customers expect a business-like treatment. Existing theory has difficulty to predict the implications of trust in such a framework.</p><p>The findings in current literature, together with the peculiarities in our sharing economy setup, encouraged us to review the implications of trust for temporal ridesharing activities on Uber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Familiarity</head><p>Existing literature demonstrates that trust aims at current and future interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>, whereas familiarity is based on previous interactions and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. In this regard, familiarity serves as a precondition for trust. It allows comparatively safe expectations about the future and therefore complements trust as a complexity-reduction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>. As a result, familiarity helps to provide context that allows individuals to clarify future expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Whereas, familiarity with Uber can be easily established through ongoing interactions with the mobile application, familiarity with specific drivers remains an exception, due to mostly non-recurring interactions. With the introduction of familiarity to our intermediary framework, we follow Gefen"s (2000) call to test the antecedent in a different online context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Disposition to trust</head><p>Disposition to trust, in contrast to familiarity, is not formed by ongoing interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. Accordingly, disposition to trust is not affected by previous experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Based on literature, disposition to trust is a personality construct with two components: faith in humanity and trusting stance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>. In this regard, personal faith in humanity assesses that other entities are usually upright, well-meaning, and dependable, whereas a trusting stance assesses the belief in superior outcomes when interacting with other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Disposition to trust serves as an antecedent of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref> and is the result of lifelong personal development, education, and cultural consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. Therefore, with the absence of direct experience, disposition to trust is highly effective in the initiation phase of an interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40]</ref>. This makes disposition to trust especially valuable in an one-time interaction framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. The paper builds on the above literature by positioning both disposition to trust and familiarity as key antecedents of trust in our sharing economy setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Hypothesis development and research model</head><p>In order to close the formulated research gap, we introduce a research model that allows us to analyze the impact of disposition to trust and familiarity on the respective trust construct, the dependency between trust in Uber and trust in drivers, as well as their influence on the customers" intentions. In particular, we focus on Uber, a well-known sharing economy platform, which was among the pioneers of the sharing economy. Therefore, we take the perspective of a customer respectively a potential passenger on Uber.</p><p>Ridesharing activities on Uber are generally defined as interactions with strangers that imply high levels of complexity and risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref>. In this paper, we apply the complexity-reduction mechanisms suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Luhmann (1979)</ref> and adopt Gefen"s research model of the e-commerce industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. We follow the understanding that disposition to trust and familiarity can build trust by detracting the likelihood of individuals and intermediaries engaging in undesirable future actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>. Whereas familiarity receives specific modifications to reflect the sharing economy peculiarities of Uber, disposition to trust is adopted without any changes from previous research. In addition, we separate trust in drivers and trust in Uber from each other. With the introduction of the two individual trust constructs, we are able observe a possible connection between trust in Uber and trust in drivers, as well as their distinct implications.</p><p>In particular, we analyze the implications of the two trust constructs on the customers" intentions to inquire about drivers and to request a ride on Uber. In this specific context, to inquire about drivers implies using the Uber app to search for favorable drivers based on individual preferences. This involves reviewing the actual driver, including their name, photo, availability, and rating, as well as the car type and the license plate number. To request a ride, on the other hand, indicates the desire to receive a transportation service to a specific location. After the driver choice is made and the request has been processed by the app, personal information, pick-up location, and final destination are sent to the driver, who can either accept or deny the transportation request. In case the driver accepts the transportation request, Uber executes the booking and sends a confirmation to both parties including the transportation details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. Summary of key constructs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct</head><p>Description Key reference Familiarity with Uber Understanding of Uber, including knowledge about the app interface, functions and available services, based on previous interactions and experiences with Uber. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref> Disposition to trust General faith in humanity and the belief that other people are in general well-meaning and reliable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref> Trust in Uber Confidence that Uber will behave in a favorable way, which makes users comfortable to use the app and helps them to overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref> Trust in drivers Willingness to rely on favorable future actions of drivers to overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity.</p><p>[6,31,50]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inquire about drivers</head><p>The intention of using the Uber app to search for drivers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref> Request a ride The intention of requesting a ride to a specific location on the Uber app.</p><p>Familiarity with Uber can build trust when effort, complexity, and uncertainty are reduced by applying a previously learned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. For example, a customer is familiar with Uber when he is able to recall and apply past experiences of how to use the Uber app. However, if the results do not meet the customers" expectations, familiarity can vanish and complexity increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. We assume in this study that familiarity with Uber increases with successful interactions, hence obtaining knowledge about the mobile app. As a result, high degrees of familiarity improve the customers" ability to maintain clear beliefs of what constitutes their expectations of favorable platform usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1.</head><p>Increased degrees of familiarity with Uber will increase the customers" trust in Uber.</p><p>Trust in drivers or the sharing economy platform is among other things determined by a general trusting disposition. Whereas humans have a natural disposition to trust and ability to judge trustworthiness, research tells us that disposition to trust is the tendency to believe in the integrity of other entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>. Although the effect can vary depending on the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, in general, people of high disposition to trust are more inclined to frame positive initial interactions with an unfamiliar counterpart <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. In our research model the antecedent, disposition to trust, directly affects the two trust constructstrust in Uber and trust in drivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2.</head><p>The stronger the customers" disposition to trust is, the more they will trust in Uber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3.</head><p>The stronger the customers" disposition to trust is, the more they will trust in drivers on Uber.</p><p>Another goal of our study is to find out, whether there is a trust transfer between trust in Uber and trust in drivers. We base our assumption on existing literature that argues that trust in users of an online platform is established by trusting the underlying platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pavlou and Gefen (2002)</ref> argue that a trustworthy intermediary helps to build buyer"s trust in a community of sellers, while reducing perceived risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Verhagen et al. (2006)</ref> show similar results and demonstrate that trust is transferred from the intermediary to the sellers in the e-commerce industry.</p><p>Therefore, we assume that increased trust in Uber does influence the customers" perception of trustworthy drivers. Following this logic, we find that in order to register on Uber, drivers have to accept the platform"s general terms of conduct. These allow Uber to perform driver screenings, which include the inspection of criminal records, the inspection of motor vehicle records, as well as a regular evaluation of passenger feedback. As a result, Uber continuously removes distrustful drivers and blocks drivers that are conspicuous or commit misconduct. Furthermore, Uber builds trust by providing an end-to-end insurance protecting customers and drivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. We follow previous research and assume that trust in Uber affects trust in drivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4.</head><p>Increased degrees of trust in Uber will increase the customers" trust in drivers.</p><p>Further, we assume that trust influences the customers" intentions to perform certain actions on Uber <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. In practice, customers have the possibility to inquire about the drivers on Uber. Given this context, we hypothesize that the customers" intention to browse the platform for potential drivers rises with increased degrees of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5.</head><p>Increased degrees of trust in Uber will increase the customers" intentions to inquire about drivers on Uber.</p><p>H6.

In our study, we assume that customers trusting in Uber and trusting in drivers are more likely to request a ride on Uber. Furthermore, we believe that the need for trust is lower for inquiring about potential drivers on Uber than to request a ride. H7.

Increased degrees of trust in drivers will increase the customers" intentions to request a ride on Uber. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Instrument development and data collection</head><p>The questionnaire was specifically designed to measure the formation and the implications of trust on Uber from a customer"s perspective. As explained earlier, we differentiated between trust in Uber and trust in drivers. Our questionnaire contained 37 questions, covering six constructs and demographic data. The response format was standardized using a 5point Likert scale ranging from "strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly agree" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> provides an overview of the final item catalogue, including the constructs and the respective item codes.</p><p>We conducted the entire survey in early 2016. By the due date, 221 participants completed the questionnaire. The respondents were mostly between 18-24 years (n = 120), 25-34 years (n = 55), or 35-44 years (n = 23). About 46% of the participants were women (n = 101) and 54% were men (n = 120). </p></div>

We used the SPSS package to test the reliability of the measurement model, as well as to perform a factor analysis, and covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM).</p><p>We examined the reliability and validity of the constructs. Internal consistency was assessed by following the guidelines from <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Straub et al. (2004)</ref>, and Hair et al. ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>).

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows that all our construct obtained Cronbach"s alpha and Composite Reliability scores above the threshold of 0.70. We assessed construct validity by evaluating convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> and discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.

All our constructs reached the given threshold. Therefore, we could claim convergent validity for our measurement model.</p><p>Discriminant validity means the degree to which measures of different latent variables are unique <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>In general, discriminant validity is considered acceptable when the square roots of the AVE are greater than the correlations between the research constructs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> indicates that there are no outliers and all the square roots of the AVE are greater than all cross-correlations, hence indicating that the variance explained by each construct is much larger than the measurement error variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. Furthermore, discriminant validity was established where the Average Shared Squared Variance (ASV) and the Maximum Shared Variance (MSV) are both lower than the AVE for all the constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Structural model assessment</head><p>To answer our research question, we confirmed the factor structure of our dataset with AMOS. We assessed the relationship between the antecedents and the trust constructs, as well as the implications of trust on the customer"s intentions, performing structural equation modeling (SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. In our analysis, we controlled for age, income, and gender, as source of differing results.

In addition, the coefficient of determination values (R2) were 0.410 (trust in Uber), 0.421 (trust in drivers), 0.343 (inquire about drivers), and 0.449 (request a ride), reflecting that the model provides sufficient explanations of the variance. The results of the SEM are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The results show support for six hypotheses. Disposition to trust affects both trust in Uber (t = 4.92) and trust in drivers (t = 3.79), supporting H2 and H3. Familiarity, on the other hand, affects trust in Uber (t = 7.91), supporting H1. In addition, H4 is supported, demonstrating that trust in Uber has a significant effect on trust in drivers (t = 7.91). As postulated in H5 and H7, trust in Uber has a significant effect on both intentionsinquire about drivers (t = 6.71) and request a ride (t = 8.01). In contrast, we find that H6 and H8 are not supportedinquire about drivers (t = 0.74) and request a ride (t = 1.65). The data analysis answered our research question. Both antecedents influence their respective trust construct. In addition, our results show a relationship between trust in Uber and trust in drivers. Whereas there is evidence that trust in Uber affects the customers intentions to inquire about drivers and to request a ride, trust in drivers shows no significant influence on the customers" intentions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> shows a summary of the study results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Our research attempts to understand the implications of trust in the ridesharing industry. In our study, we took the perspective of a potential customer. We analyzed how platform and provider trust influence the customers" intentions on Uber. In this regard, Uber is particularly interesting as the mobile app allows complete strangers to get in contact with each other in the online world and to share a ride on short-term notice in the offline world. In order to perform the analysis, we modified the research model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gefen (2000)</ref> by separating trust in the intermediary from trust in the provider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Research implications</head><p>Our study contributes to research in several ways. First, we could show that platform trust does influence the customers" intentions in our sharing economy setup. Our hypotheses regarding the effect of trust in Uber are supported for both tested intentionsto inquire about drivers and to request a ride. On the other hand, our findings indicate that trust in drivers has no significant effect on the customers" intentions on Uber. Whereas our findings seem surprising at first, as Uber connects complete strangers with each other, it seems likely most of the risk is already covered by the intermediary. Accordingly, we can argue that our findings are in line with the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hong et al. (2011)</ref> of the B2C e-commerce industry, which demonstrate that seller trust has no effect on the customers" purchase intentions. Therefore, our results are not in line with the findings of <ref type="bibr">Verhagen et al. (2000)</ref>, which identified seller trust as an important driver of customers" intentions in C2C markets. Hence, the separation of trust into two separate constructs allowed us to show a deviating effect on the customers" intentions on Uber.</p><p>The reason why trust in drivers is not an influential factor of the customers" intentions in the sharing economy could have various reasons, which we recommend to examine in future research. Possible reasons are: 1. Ridesharing is only a temporary short-term service, which means that even on the off chance of a bad experience the perceived disservice is only of short duration. 2. It might be hard to judge for potential customers, based on the available information on Uber, whether drivers are upright and trustworthy. 3. Despite the C2C character, Uber has a commercial focus where customers can expect a business like treatment.</p><p>Second, we successfully addressed an existing research gap by analyzing the trust transfer between Uber and the drivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. Whereas, we cannot clarify the direction of the trust transfer, we extend the theoretical background of the sharing economy by examining the phenomenon of trust transfer in our particular intermediary framework.</p><p>Third, we successfully assessed the effect of both antecedents, disposition to trust and familiarity, on their respective trust construct. Thus, by evaluating the two antecedents in an unprecedented online environment, we resolve limitations that have been frequently formulated by prior researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Overall, our results complement the understanding of the sharing economy with focus on the ridesharing industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Practical implications</head><p>Our results offer important insights for managers of sharing economy services. In our study, trust in Uber appears to be the key driver of user intentions. Besides, forming the intention to use the mobile application, trust in Uber might also be of high relevance for the acquisition and the retention of customers. In practice, trust in Uber might entail providing personal information, such as demographics like age and nationality, as well as credit card information based on a credulous belief that the provided information will not be misused in any incongruous or unknown way by the platform provider. Therefore, we recommend Uber to increase trust in the platform, for example by providing adequate security measures, such as the extension of quality checks, advanced encryption of personal information, including location profiles, and demographics, as well as integrating a reliable support system in case of any challenges that might occur when using the mobile app. In addition, as familiarity seems to be an influential driver of platform trust, we recommend practitioners to pay attention to high quality applications, recognizable application interfaces, and transparent processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Limitations</head><p>Our study has some limitations. First, the sample size is fairly small. Whereas a sample size of 221 is generally acceptable, a larger sample would be preferable. Second, we only analyzed a specific sharing economy service in one particular market. Therefore, our study is context-dependent and it is unclear that our findings can be generalized for other sharing service, such as for Airbnb. Third, we only took the perspective of a potential customer on Uber. It might worthwhile to keep the study design and take the perspective of a potential driver. In this regard, it might be interesting to analyze the need of trust in passengers to form driver intentions on Uber. Fourth, given our study design, we could not verify the direction of the trust transfer between Uber and the drivers. It might be worth elaborating a possible reciprocal trust relationship in a consecutive study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we focused on Uber, a prominent example of the sharing economy. We took the perspective of a potential customer and investigated the concept of trust, which induces strangers to form temporal C2C relationships on Uber. We adopted and modified the research model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gefen (2000)</ref> and investigated the formation of trust by incorporating two antecedents. Furthermore, we differentiated between "Trust in Uber" and "Trust in drivers", and examined their implications on two customer intentions. To seek support for our research model, we conducted a survey with 221 participants. The results show trust in Uber is decisive to successfully form customer intentions, whereas the hypothesis regarding the influence of driver trust could not be supported. Overall, we are convinced that our findings are useful for IS researchers and practitioners.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
