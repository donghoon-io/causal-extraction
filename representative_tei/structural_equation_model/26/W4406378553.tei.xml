<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Data were from the 2014 Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS). The association of parental bonding (measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument), personality traits (the Responsibility Scale), and psychological status (the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) with self-evaluation measured in three domains (the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for children and the Self-Discipline Scale) were tested by the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A total of 892 Chinese adolescents were included. Signi cant positive correlations were found among self-evaluation, parental bonding, personality traits, and psychological status. The overall (direct and indirect) effect of parental bonding on adolescents' self-evaluation was 0.49. Personality traits and psychological status were directly associated with adolescents' self-evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The use of SEM offered a detailed analysis of the correlations between parental bonding, personality traits, and psychological status and a systematic approach to investigate their direct and indirect effects on adolescents' self-evaluation. The three factors directly associated with adolescents' selfevaluation and parental bonding indirectly affected adolescents' self-evaluation that was mediated by both personality traits and psychological status.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Assessing adolescent mental health from the perspective of positive psychology, self-evaluation, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the overall state of mental development. Adolescents' self-evaluation is an expressive form of self-concept. Self-concepts are de ned as selfperceptions related to speci c domains, roles, or social contexts <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Although some speci city in self-concepts is developed earlier in childhood <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, these self-perceptions become increasingly complex and differentiated across adolescence <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>, presumably due to both the cognitive development and Changes in the living environment experienced during adolescence.</p><p>Recently, society from all social classes has attached more importance to self-evaluation issues among adolescents. A person with a positive selfassessment during adolescence will believe in his own abilities, appreciate his efforts, and may have con dence and hope for future life, encouraging him to strive to solve problems <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Conversely, negative self-evaluation is the primary source of self-avoidance behaviors. Things like drinking alcohol, excessive internet use, and smartphone addiction are exacerbated as people try to avoid negative self-evaluations of themselves. Study on adolescents has found that self-evaluation is strongly associated with physical, psychological, academic, emotional, and social variables <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. In view of the important impact of self-evaluation on adolescent development, it is necessary to explore the factors that in uence adolescents' self-evaluation. However, the in uencing factors of self-evaluation during adolescence are diverse and complicated. But three main groups of factors are involved: rstly, factors related to the family environment, such as the relationships between parents and child <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. As the earliest social environment for children, parental bonding plays an important role in shaping Chinese adolescents' psychological status <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Parental bonding was identi ed as one of the crucial factors in children's personality development. Growing up with parents who provide consistent and effective guidance about regulating emotional states may counteract the impact that heightened physiological and emotional reactivity would otherwise have on peer relationships and social competence, which helps teens develop more positive self-evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The second group of factors affecting adolescents' self-evaluation is related to the personality traits that contributed to the initiative in personal, emotional, motivational, and social behaviors of adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Personality growth initiatives may be intimately linked with psychological adjustment. At the same time, positive mental health and a well-adjusted personality may be fundamental characteristics of healthy, positive, and initiative self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Furthermore, parental relationships can directly affect adolescents' self-evaluations. Abnormal parental relationships can also affect personality development, which may lead to certain problematic personality traits such as distress and emotional instability, which may indirectly reduce levels of self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Previous empirical studies have shown that personality traits mediate the relationship between parental bonding and adolescent self-evaluation <ref type="bibr">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Therefore, the above evidence provides a concrete theoretical and empirical basis for the potential mediating effect of the personality traits in the relation between parental bonding and self-evaluation.</p><p>Compared to parental bonding and personality traits, little study has been done on the impact of the third group of factors; the psychological status of adolescents <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Adolescents with negative beliefs, attachment anxiety, or low self-esteem, in uenced by environmental factors, especially parental rearing, were described as exhibiting behaviors that re ect a negative self-evaluation and then compensate for that. It implies that they act in accord with negative self-patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. In addition to personal growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, positive self-evaluation shows an important moderating role in life, work, and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Studies have shown that close parental bonding is signi cantly and positively associated with adolescents' overall health evaluations, and this relationship may be partially explained by adolescent psychological states <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. Similarly, we can infer that perceived psychological status is a mediator between adolescents' parental bonding and self-evaluation.</p><p>Although studies have respectively investigated the associations of parental bonding, personality traits, and psychological status on adolescents' selfevaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>, no studies have combined all the three factors or examined their relations so far. The present study aimed to examine the relationships between parental bonding, personality traits, psychological status, and self-evaluation among Chinese adolescents. We hypothesized that parental bonding, personality traits, psychological status, and self-evaluation would be signi cantly positively correlated (H1). Moreover, we hypothesized that personality traits would mediate the relationship between parental bonding and self-evaluation (H2) and that psychological status would mediate the relationship between parental bonding and self-evaluation (H3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Sources</head><p>The data for this study were obtained from the Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS) by implementing the China Social Science Survey Center, Peking University, which was reviewed and approved by the Institute of Social Science Survey (ISSS) of Peking University. CFPS conducted initial investigations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong in 2008 and 2009, and samples were collected from all over China in 2010. CFPS is a national, large-scale, and multidisciplinary social follow-up survey project that includes four main questionnaire types: community questionnaire, family questionnaire, adult questionnaire, and children questionnaire. CFPS had collected data over four rounds. The data analyzed in this study was from a single-round collection in 2014 by children questionnaire. The study protocol and sampling method details can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. CFPS is an open-access database, and data collection has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Social Sciences, Peking University, therefore, ethical approval and participation consent are not applicable to this study.</p><p>Adolescents in this study were students aged 10 to 15 years old in the east, north, south, central, northeast, northwest, and southwest regions of China, including 25 provinces, cities and autonomous regions. The representativeness of the sample is very good. A total of 892 adolescents from 871 families were included in the study with complete and signi cant study questionnaires. The study protocol was approved by the Wuhan University of Science and Technology Medical Ethics Review Form (No.2022082).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 892 adolescents from east (15.1%), north (11.3%), south (14.0%), central (19.7%), northeast (10.2%), northwest (16.0%) and southwest (13.6%) China, included 485 (54.4%) boys and 407 (45.6%) girls were included in the current study. The sample was composed of 365 (40.9%) adolescents living in urban areas and 527 (59.1%) adolescents from rural areas. The average age of total boy and girl adolescents was 10.72 (SD = 0.89), 10.71 (SD = 0.83), and 10.72 (SD = 0.96) years, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Questionnaire Design</head><p>This research conducted a preliminary survey of 783 adolescents in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong provinces in 2008 and 2009, to improve the operability of the questionnaire survey. Those 783 adolescents were excluded from the formal study because the nal questionnaire had been modi ed according to their feedback. The study is based on the CFPS self-administered questionnaire for adolescents aged 10 to 15 years that covered basic information on age, gender, living condition, educational level, type of residence, self-evaluation, parental bonding instrument, personality traits, and psychological status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-evaluation</head><p>Adolescents' self-evaluation consists of three scales: the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for children (NLCS-C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and the Self-Discipline Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale consisted of 10 questions such as "On the whole, I am satis ed with myself," which was a 4 -point Likert scale (1) "totally disagree" (2) "disagree" (3) "agree" and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) "totally agree", with some questions were reverse scored. A higher nal sum score for all the ten items indicated higher self-esteem. The NLCS-C scale consisted of 40 yes/no answered questions with a low score indicating internal locus of control and a high score indicating external locus of control. Such as "Do you believe that most problems will solve themselves if you just don't fool with them?" The Self-Discipline Scale is based on a 5 -point Likert scale (1) "Disagree strongly" (2) "Disagree a little" (3) "Neither agree nor disagree" (4) "Agree a little" and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) "Agree Strongly". Of the 12 questions such as "I am good at resisting temptation", a higher score indicates optimism and higher perceived self-e cacy. However, after the existing and mature scales abroad were introduced to China, researchers also faced the problems of measuring validity and reliability. Because Chinese people tend to be conservative in their responses to the scale, they tend to choose neutral answers rather than the most suitable ones, which leads to inaccurate measurement results. In dealing with this problem, the researchers of CFPS have added or deleted items and modi ed their scoring to include (1) "totally disagree" (2) "disagree" (3) "neither agree nor disagree" (4) "agree" and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) "totally agree" to reduce the probability that respondents improperly choose the middle option <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The Cronbach's alphas for the respective three scales were 0.88, 0.82, and 0.70.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parental Bonding Instrument, Personality Traits And Psychological Status</head><p>In order to make the scales conform to Chinese people's answering habits and thinking mode and reduce the inaccurate measurement results, the researchers of CFPS have modi ed these scoring scales a little and re-measured the validity and reliability of the scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The Parental Bonding Instrument introduced by Parker et al. was used with a 25-items measure of differences in parental bonding. Responses were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) "never" (2) "rarely" (3) "sometimes" (4) "often" and (5) "always"; Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The Personality Scale that was used to assess the personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> was derived from a sub-scale of the Big Five Questionnaire-Children produced by <ref type="bibr">Barbaranelli et al. [36]</ref>, with a 12-self-reported items rated from (1) "totally disagree" to (5) "totally agree" and its Cronbach's alpha was 0.77. Kessler measured the psychological status using the Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The scale consisted of 6 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) "always" (2) "often" (3) "sometimes" (4) "rarely" and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) "never". Some of the items were reversely scored so that the high total score indicates positive psychological status. The Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.649.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In brief, the CFPS sample was a multi-stage probability sample extracted by the implicit strati cation method. The samples of the subsampling frame were extracted in three stages. The rst-stage sampling (primary sampling units, PSUs) were counties (or county-level cities/districts) listed in descending order by a socioeconomic indicator. The second-stage sampling (Secondary sampling units, SSUs) were resident committees and administrative villages from counties (or county-level cities/districts). The third and nal stage of sampling (Tertiary sampling units, TSUs) were households from resident committees and administrative villages. In the rst two stages of the sampling process, o cial administrative entities were used. The administrative structure in China has two important features: rst, it is strictly hierarchical; and second, at least in theory, it covers the entire population of China exhaustively, without exception. Moreover, to minimize sampling frame errors, it was the random starting point of the circular isometric sampling method that was used to extract sample households in the third stage. The study was designed to include interviews and consider all members over the age of 9 years in a sampled household as core members of the CFPS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>SPSS-25.0 and AMOS-24.0 were used for data analyses. The participants' characteristics were presented as numbers and frequencies. In order to examine the theoretical model which contained the targeted factors, a type of multivariate analysis method, structural equation modeling (SEM), was applied. Initially, a model containing the nal scores of the parental bonding instrument, personality traits scale, and psychological status scale with the adolescents' self-evaluation domains was designed. Then the estimated value and signi cance level of each parameter were obtained. In addition, in order to explore the heterogeneity caused by demographic characteristics, and tests for heterogeneity for age (&lt; 11 and ≥ 11 years), sex (boy and girl), and living environment (urban and rural) by multigroup analyses of the structural equation modeling considering subgroup sample size≥200 <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>.</p><p>After that, the bivariate correlation analysis (BCA) was used to observe the correlation among the included factors. After the analysis results were con rmed, the proposed hypothesis model was veri ed and tted with the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of AMOS. The proposed model was con rmed by examining the goodness of t statistics, which indicted a ratio of the chi-square (χ2) to the degree of freedom (df), a goodness of t index (GFI), adjusted goodness of t index (AGFI), comparative t index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The de nition of satisfactory goodness of t was χ2/df &lt; 2.0, GFI &gt; 0.95, AGFI &gt; 0.90, CFI &gt; 0.97, and RMSEA &lt; 0.05, while the standard of acceptable goodness of t was χ2/df &lt; 3.0, GFI &gt; 0.90, AGFI &gt; 0.85, CFI &gt; 0.95, and RMSEA &lt; 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The chi-square difference test was used to check the nested models and if the complex model tted a higher degree of the data when compared to the simpler model <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. By comparing the Akaike information criterion (AIC) value of the models, a nested model is proved to be a signi cant well-tting model if it was associated with at least 50 units reduction in the measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline characteristics</head><p>Our analytic sample includes 892 children and youth, of which 485 are boys (54.4%) and 407 are girls (45.6%). The mean age of the sample was 10.7 (SD = 0.89) years. The baseline characteristics of study participants are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations</head><p>The results show that the score of the parental bonding instrument correlated with scores of the self-evaluation domains, including self-esteem, selfdiscipline, and NLCS-C (r from 0.119 to 0.265, P &lt; 0.01). It meant that adolescents' self-evaluation might rise with high levels of parental bonding instruments. The parental bonding instrument score was associated with the K6 score of psychological status and personality traits score (r = 0.185 and 0.157, P &lt; 0.01, respectively). Different parental bonding instrument might have different psychological states and personality traits for adolescents. At the same time, the personality traits score was correlated with all self-evaluation domains' scores (r from 0.156 to 0.364, P &lt; 0.01), with the strongest correlation observed with self-esteem (r = 0.364). Meanwhile, the K6 score (psychological status) was moderately correlated with some self-evaluation domains, which were the self-esteem score (r = 0.250, p &lt; 0.01) and NLCS-C score (r = 0.126, p &lt; 0.01) speci cally (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Model</head><p>The initial model assumed that self-evaluation was affected by the scores of parental bonding instrument, personality traits and psychological status.</p><p>The unsatisfactory t of the initial model was revealed by the measures of model t (χ 2 /df = 12.214, GFI = 0.961, AGFI = 0.908, CFI = 0.793, RMSEA = 0.112), especially whose AIC was 133.929 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</p><p>Several signi cant paths were added to optimize the model, and a revised structural equation model was speci ed. The measures of the revised model t (χ 2 /df = 2.876, GFI = 0.994, AGFI = 0.977, CFI = 0.977, RMSEA = 0.046) indicates that the revised model has a satisfactory t. Furthermore, given that the AIC for the revised model <ref type="bibr">(47.255</ref>) was lower than that of the initial model (133.929); thus, the revised model was more suitable for the data than the initial one (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Signi cant Relationships Between Observed Variables</head><p>As the diagram with the standardized coe cients for each factor was provided (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Results presented the direct, indirect, and total effects of the scores of parental bonding instrument, personality traits, and K6 (psychological status) on the self-evaluation scores calculated with both unstandardized and standardized coe cients. The path coe cients of variables measured at different scales within the same model can be directly compared using the standardized coe cients. In the revised SEM, the parental bonding instrument has a great direct and indirect in uence on selfevaluation (direct β = 0.28; mediated by personality traits and K6 β = 0.21, and total effect β = 0.49), while K6 was directly related to self-evaluation (β = 0.39). Additionally, personality traits have the strongest positive total (direct) effect on self-evaluation (β = 0.78) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multigroup Analyses</head><p>Pre-speci ed multi-group analyses were presented for age (&lt; 11 and ≥ 11 years) (see Additional le 1), for sex (boys and girls) (see Additional le 2), and for the living environment (urban and rural) (see Additional 3) in Supplemental File. The associations of parental bonding instrument, personality traits, and K6 with a self-evaluation did not vary by the levels of the subgroup factors, with similar results to those among the whole sample population. Parental bonding instrument, personality traits, and K6 had direct effects on self-evaluation. In addition, the Parental bonding instrument had indirect effects on self-evaluation by mediation personality traits and K6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study is the rst empirical study to use the SEM systematic approach to investigate the in uence of parental bonding, personality traits, and psychological status on the self-evaluation of Chinese adolescents (self-esteem, self-discipline, and locus of control for children). It presented a comprehensive study of mechanisms for the parental, personal, and psychological impacts on adolescents' self-concept. The SEM analysis has demonstrated that parental bonding, personality traits, and psychological status played signi cant positive roles in the self-evaluation of Chinese adolescents.</p><p>The current study ndings indicated that parental bonding was a determining factor in Chinese adolescents' self-evaluation. It had become a consensus that parents were the earliest social environment for children and played a unique and signi cant role in the development of adolescents.</p><p>The score of the parental bonding instrument was not only directly associated with self-evaluation but also had an indirect association with selfevaluation mediated by personality traits and the K6 score. During adolescence, adolescents are vulnerable to the harm of adverse stimuli, which would cause some learning and psychological problems and reduce their self-evaluation. In such situations, there is no doubt that the parental effects will not only limit their role in their children's growth and development but will also extend to the ways by which the adolescents interact with these harmful stimuli. A recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> indicated that adolescents who perceived no parental support were 4-times more likely to have mental health problems than those who perceived strong support from their parents' personality traits. Moreover, the K6-measured psychological status mediated the association between parental bonding and self-evaluation of adolescents, besides their direct in uencing effects on self-evaluation. It a rms the previous study ndings that pointed to concrete psychological mechanisms in terms of mentality and personality for parental bonding affecting adolescent selfevaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p><p>The study found that parental bonding had signi cant effects on self-evaluation among Chinese adolescents. What's more, those adolescents with higher scores on the personality traits scale were more likely to have higher self-evaluation. Personality traits are persistent and universal positive or negative attitudes towards people or things <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. Adolescents with high personality trait scores usually have constant a rmation and the ability to complete daily tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr">48]</ref>. Thus, personality traits are a crucial factor in improving adolescents' self-evaluation, which was consistent with previous studies' ndings <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. To a certain extent, this provides ideas for us to carry out intervention work from the aspect of personality traits.</p><p>As indicated by the results, psychological status, measured by the K6 scale, was also associated with the self-evaluation in Chinese adolescents.</p><p>Psychological status is a major internal motive for improving psychological and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. A few previous studies also had found that adolescents with poor psychological status were prone to a negative self-evaluation, considering themselves inferior to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Consequently, those adolescents with distressing psychological status were vulnerable to losing their courage and determination to surmount di culties and experienced greater emotional instability (higher neuroticism), which can reduce individual self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Previous studies indicated that anxiety affected axis activity (the awakening response, diurnal cortisol slope, and cortisol levels over the day) in the hypothalamic hazard-Adrenal cortex (HPA).</p><p>Individuals with a atter diurnal cortisol slope had a shorter sleep, poorer sleep quality, and even suicide. Therefore, not coincidentally was the positive correlation between self-evaluation and K6 scores observed in this study. Given this, it is essential to ameliorate the psychological status of adolescents to improve their self-evaluation.</p><p>From the view of practical signi cance, to raise the level of self-evaluation among Chinese adolescents, compared to interventional measures that target a single variable of either parental bonding, personality traits, or psychological status of the adolescents. We should formulate and conduct simultaneous interventions that take into consideration the mentioned three variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The causal associations between variables cannot be deduced because of the cross-sectional nature of this study. Besides, the associations between the variables may be overestimated or underestimated since the study was conducted by self-reports from only one source in 2014, which may lead to bias to some extent. Last, about 60% of the interviewed adolescents did not submit a relatively complete research questionnaire, especially the question about self-evaluations, so they were excluded from the study in the process of selecting the population. Although those participants probably did not have a clear self-concept of themselves, their characteristics did not differ from those of the included adolescents in terms of sociodemographic data, health status, and scores for parental bonding instrument, personality traits, and psychological status scales.</p></div>
