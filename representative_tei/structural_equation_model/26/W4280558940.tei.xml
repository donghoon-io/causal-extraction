<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Covi pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the world of education from face-to-face to online learning and digital literacy. Based on the BPS survey in 2020, 73 out of 100 educational institutions have changed the way they operate, both in administrative services and in the learning process. Digital transformation refers to the process and strategy of using digital technology to drastically change the way businesses operate and serve customers. This is a challenge given the absence of certain standards in optimizing the online learning process. Given these challenges, it is necessary to conduct an analysis of student satisfaction and loyalty on a regular basis, so that the institution knows what things need to be improved and improved. Or what things need to be improved or what factors need to be added.</p><p>Corresponding Author:-Riama Sibarani Theoretical Basis: Structural equation modeling, hereinafter referred to as SEM, is a statistical modeling technique that is highly crosssectional, linear and general in nature. Included in this SEM are factor analysis, path analysis and regression.</p><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a common and very useful multivariate analysis technique that includes special versions of a number of other analytical methods as special cases. The next definition says that Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical technique used to build and test statistical models which are usually in the form of causal models. SEM is actually a hybrid technique which includes confirmatory aspects of factor analysis, path analysis and regression which can be considered as special cases in SEM. The main requirement for using SEM is to design and build a hypothetical model consisting of a structural model and a measurement model in the form of a path diagram. SEM is a statistical technique that allows the testing of a series of simultaneous relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEM Path Chart:</head><p>The SEM path diagram serves to show the pattern of relationships between the variables studied. In SEM the pattern of relationships between variables will be filled with observed variables, latent variables and indicators. Based on the pattern of relationships between variables, SEM can be broken down into two sub-sections, namely: measurement models and structural models. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor Analysis</head><p>Factor analysis is a statistical analysis that aims to reduce the dimensions of the data by stating the original variable as a linear combination of a number of factors, so that a number of factors are able to explain as much as possible the diversity of data contained in the original variable. The general form of the factor analysis model is as follows: Xj = λ j1 F 1 + λ j2 F 2 + . . . + λ jr F r + ε j , j = 1, 2,k</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory Factor Analysis:</head><p>Confirmatory factor analysis is a factor analysis technique in which the factors formed are based on known or predetermined theories and concepts along with what variables can measure each formed factor. The confirmatory factor analysis technique is carried out by calculating the value of the loading factor (λi) which is similar to the value of the regression coefficient (βi), namely the loading factor between the indicator variables and the formed latent variable (Fj). The loading factor (λi) was tested using the T test by showing a good level of significance, meaning that the indicator variable (Xi) was significantly proven as an indicator of the relevant latent variable. In confirmatory factor analysis, a model that describes the relationship between indicator variables X1, X2,... .,Xk with latent variables is called the measurement model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Analysis:</head><p>Path analysis is used to analyze the pattern of relationships between variables with the aim of knowing the direct or indirect relationship of a set of independent variables (exogenous) to the dependent variable (endogenous). In path analysis, the relationship between variables is expressed in a system of equations called structural equations. These equations can then be described in a diagram called a path diagram. The path coefficient expresses a direct relationship between exogenous and endogenous variables, whose magnitude is denoted by ij, where i represents the effect, and j represents the cause. The path coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">γ ij =   ij r R 1 </formula><p>where R-1 is the inverse correlation matrix between exogenous variables in the analyzed model and rij is the correlation coefficient between exogenous and endogenous variables in the analyzed model. The following is an illustration of the path diagram </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Methods:-</head><p>The object of this research is the University of Satya Negara Indonesia (USNI). While the research subjects are lecturers and students. The number of samples taken is based on the Slovin criteria with a 5% precision level. The number of respondents is 370 students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of Data and Data Collection Techniques:</head><p>The data in this study are primary data in the form of respondents' answers. The data collection method was carried out using a survey through a structured questionnaire via googleform.</p><p>Research Variables: The variables in this study were classified into exogenous variables and endogenous variables. Exogenous variables are University Image (X1), Lecturer Competence (X2) and Service Quality (X3). Endogenous variables are student satisfaction (Y1), student loyalty (Y2). All variables are measured using a Likert scale that has a weight from 1 to 5, with alternative answers from Strongly Disagree (STS) score 1, Disagree (TS) score 2, Neutral (N) score 3, Agree (S) score 4, and Strongly Agree (SS) score 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis: Research Instrument Quality Test</head><p>The validity test was carried out using the Product Moment Correlation with the help of SPSS 17. The research instrument was said to be valid if the significance value was less than 5%. The research instrument is said to be reliable if the Cronbach Alpha value is greater than 0.5 (Azwar, 1997). Furthermore, the data is processed by Lisrel to obtain the SEM model and confirmatory factors for the variables.</p></div>
