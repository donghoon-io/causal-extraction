<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Social network interference induces spillover effects from neighbors' exposures, and the complexity of statistical analysis increases when mediators are involved with network interference. To address various technical challenges, we develop a theoretical framework employing a structural graphical modeling approach to investigate both mediation and interference effects within network data. Our framework enables us to capture the multifaceted mechanistic pathways through which neighboring units' exposures and mediators exert direct and indirect influences on an individual's outcome. We extend the exposure mapping paradigm in the context of a random-effects network structural equation models (REN-SEM), establishing its capacity to delineate spillover effects of interest. Our proposed methodology contributions include maximum likelihood estimation for REN-SEM and inference procedures with theoretical guarantees. Such guarantees encompass consistent asymptotic variance estimators, derived under a non-i.i.d. asymptotic theory. The robustness and practical utility of our methodology are demonstrated through simulation experiments and a real-world data analysis of the Twitch Gamers Network Dataset, underscoring its effectiveness in capturing the intricate dynamics of network-mediated exposure effects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The theory of mediation analysis can become highly intricate when experiment units are sampled from a network, a context in which limited statistical theory and methods have been explored in the literature. Consider a set of N units, often referred to as nodes and denoted by V, that forms a network within which each pair is linked by an edge if a connection exists between the two nodes. The between-node connections are described by an N × N adjacency matrix E. In this paper, we focus on a first-order Markov network structure, meaning that only immediate first-degree neighbors have a direct connection to a given unit. As a result, E is a binary matrix, where E ij = 1 if i th and j th nodes are connected (two units are directly connected by sharing a common edge) and E ii = 1 and E ij = 0 otherwise. To characterize the contiguity of a network, we denote the set of direct neighbors (or the first-degree adjacent neighbors) of unit i by N † i = {j | j ̸ = i and E ij = 1}, and the resulting unit-i-centric community is given by N i = N † i ∪ {i}. Likewise, we denote a set of second-degree adjacent neighbors of unit i by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N ‡ i = {k | k ̸ = i, k / ∈ N † i</formula><p>, and E jk = 1 for all j ∈ N † i }, namely a given node i is indirectly connected to a node k ∈ N ‡ i via a node j ∈ N † i , and higher-degree adjacent neighbors may be similarly defined. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates a network of five nodes N = 5. Focusing on "Target" Unit 1 in this example, we observe that N † 1 = {2, 3} and N ‡ 1 = {4, 5}. The relationship between a DAG-clique i and j, where i ̸ = j and i, j ∈ V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is characterized by the elements E ij of the adjacency matrix E of network connectivity.</p><p>Each node in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> contains a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) clique consisting of three variables: A i , M i , and Y i .</p><p>Here Y i represents a continuous outcome, M i denotes a continuous mediator, and A i signifies a binary exposure, with their respective supports being Supp(Y i ) ⊆ R, Supp(M i ) ⊆ R, and Supp(A i ) = {0, 1}. For simplicity, let the vector C i include all confounders, either continuous or categorical, that may affect the three relationships of the underlying DAG pathway: between exposure and outcome (A → Y ), between exposure and mediator (A → M ), and between mediator and outcome (M → Y ). Let dim(C) = p. Throughout this work, we restrict our attention to a binary exposure A and a one-dimensional mediator M .</p><p>In the classical theory of mediation analysis, the primary focus lies in estimation of the so-called natural direct effect (NDE) and natural indirect effect (NIE) of an exposure A on an outcome Y , where NIE is mediated through M . Typically, NDE marks the direct pathway A → Y while NIE characterizes the mediation pathway A → M → Y . The seminal work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> laid out the essential steps for establishing mediation, providing a foundational framework that has guided numerous subsequent studies. Building on this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Robins and Greenland (1992)</ref> pioneered the formal examination of causal mediation analysis, setting the stage for a rapidly expanded body of research that includes many influential contributions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pearl (2001)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Robins (2003)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rubin (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">VanderWeele (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">VanderWeele ( , 2009))</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Imai et al. (2010)</ref>, among others. See more references in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ding (2024)</ref>. Most of the existing works have focused on independently sampled units (or all E ij = 0) in which the so-called spillover effects are absent and irrelevant.</p><p>In the case of network data considered in the present paper, a significant technical challenge arises due to mutual influences and interferences between network-connected units. Interference occurs when the treatment, exposure, or intervention applied to one unit may have an extended influence to the response variable of one or more connected neighboring units, a unique phenomenon emerged from social or physical interactions among units. Such effect, known as spillover effect, gives rise to a different type of pathway, denoted by A N † i → Y i for target unit i. This may become more complicated when self or neighborhood mediators are involved in the cross-node interplay. For instance, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, altering the exposure A 2 of Unit 2 leads to a spillover effect on the outcome Y 1 of Unit 1 due to the network connection between units 1 and 2. Of note, this spillover effect is absent in the classical mediation analysis due to independence among units. Thus, this phenomenon requires developing new estimands, identifiability conditions, and analytics for a serious exploration theoretically and numerically. An oversight of spillover effects in the analysis can distort the understanding of how exposures and mediators influence outcomes within a network.</p><p>Traditional causal inference methods, which operate under the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rubin (1980)</ref>), assume no hidden variations in treatment and thus preclude spillover effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sacerdote, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Miguel and Kremer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakshy et al., 2012)</ref> in the analysis. In effect, the issue of interference has recently received a good deal of attention in the literature. Most of recent research on this topic has focused largely on methods in randomized trials collecting subjects from networks to study both direct effect and spillover effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hudgens and Halloran, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tchetgen and VanderWeele, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Manski, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aronow and Samii, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Leung, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sävje et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hu et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ogburn et al. (2022)</ref> investigated semiparametric estimation and inference for causal effects using observational data from a single social network while introduced some new causal estimands that are particularly relevant in social network settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tchetgen Tchetgen et al. (2021)</ref> developed innovative statistical methodologies for causal inference within the context of interference with no assumption of outcome independence among non-overlapping clusters such as a single interconnected network. Recent studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Manski (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aronow and Samii (2017)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Leung and Loupos (2022)</ref> utilized the concept of exposure mapping to define effective treatment due to neighbors, thereby aiding in the identification of causal effects under interference. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sweet (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Liu et al. (2021)</ref> proposed mediation models that incorporate social networks as mediators to explore the potential mediation role of these networks.</p><p>Despite these advancements, no existing statistical theory and methods have addressed the challenge of defining a unified framework for comprehensively studying the full spectrum of various effects involving both mediators and network interference. This is because the holistic approach is technically complex involving a great deal of nuance. To fill such a significant technical gap, this paper aims to advance the field by introducing a rigorous holistic theoretical framework designed specifically to establish and analyze the mechanistic pathways that involve both mediators and network-connected units simultaneously. The resulting comprehensive analytic enables to understand the joint effects of mediation and network interference, thereby enhancing applicability and capacity of causal inference in network data settings.</p><p>To address this technical need of analyzing spillover effects and increase the capacity of causal inference in a network setting, we propose a new linear random effects network structural equation model (REN-SEM) by extending the existing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) framework in Section 2.2. As a result, this new REN-SEM can account for both the direct and indirect influences of neighboring units' exposures and mediators on a target individual's outcome. This added capacity gives practitioners an opportunity to explore multifaceted channels of causal effects through which both self and neighboring exposure variables may impact a target outcome via self and/or neighboring mediators, all warranted under the network contiguity. In Section 2.3, we extend the concept of exposure mapping to explicitly and accurately delineate various spillover effects within the REN-SEM formulation. After introducing different mediation and interference estimands in addition to the classical NDE and NIE, we impose and discuss the necessary identifiability assumptions for the identification of all the estimands under investigation in Section 3. We present the identification theorem to estimate the proposed mediation and interference estimands using available data in Section 4. In Section 5, we present a rigorous theoretical foundation along with asymptotic results and consistent variance estimators for the proposed REN-SEM using large-sample techniques of dependent data. Furthermore, in Section 6, we conduct extensive simulation experiments to evaluate finite-sample performances of the proposed statistical methods for the estimation of various estimands, including the coverage probability to illustrate the validity of the proposed large-sample inference. Section 7 illustrates our proposed methodology by a study of gaming behaviors using the Twitch Gamers Social Network dataset, and Section 8 provides some concluding remarks. Most technical details are included in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>

This approach aligns with the popular analytical framework in the current literature considered by, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ogburn et al. (2022)</ref>. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li and Wager (2022)</ref> explores the estimation of treatment effects under a random network in a graphon modeling framework, a situation that introduces additional technical complexities, which consequently requires different theoretical toolboxes to address extra randomness arising from the realization of network samples. The situation of random networks is not the focus of this paper. The system of SEMs is structured by the following equations: for unit i = 1, . . . , N in a given network E,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">           Y i = f y (A i , A N † i , M i , M N † i , C i , C N † i , b Y i , b Y N † i , ϵ Y i , E), M i = f m (A i , A N † i , C i , C N † i , b M i , b M N † i , ϵ M i , E), A i = f a (C i , C N † i , ϵ A i , E),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ϵ Y i , ϵ M i , ϵ A i are the corresponding error (or noise) terms for the distributions of the triplets (Y i , M i , A i ) in a DAG of target node i, respectively; f y (.), f m (.), f a (.) are generic notations for the respective machinery to generate the three outputs given the inputs and random noises on the right-hand side of the equations. Note that f a (.) generates a binary output in {0, 1}. Using the above SEMs in (1), we model if, and to which extend, the exposure vector A = (A 1 , A 2 , ..., A N ) affects the outcome Y of a target unit in a DAG (A, M, Y ). Such effects are present through seven pathways given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Path-1. Intra-DAG (A → Y ); Path-2. Intra-DAG (A → M → Y ); Path-3. Inter-DAG (A → M N † → Y ); Path-4. Inter-DAG (A N † → Y ); Path-5. Inter-DAG (A N † → M → Y ); Path-6. Inter-DAG (A N † → M N † → Y ); Path-7. Inter-DAG (A N ‡ → M N † → Y ).</formula><p>To elaborate these seven paths pictorially, we create Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> based on the network topology of 5 nodes in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This figure illustrates the seven distinct mechanistic pathways originating from exposure A 1 of unit 1, as well as from its first-degree and second-degree neighbors, impacting the outcome Y 1 of unit 1. Specifically, given the network E matrix of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, units 2 and 4 are among the first-degree and second-degree neighbors of target node 1, respectively. The resulting seven pathways, Path-1 to Path-7 for the outcome Y 1 of unit 1, are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A 1 → Y 1 , A 1 → M 1 → Y 1 , A 1 → M 2 → Y 1 , A 2 → Y 1 , A 2 → M 1 → Y 1 , A 2 → M 2 → Y 1 and finally A 4 → M 2 → Y 1 .</formula><p>Next we consider a special class of Network SEMs which will form the basis of further methodological development and theoretical analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Linear Random Effects Network SEM (REN-SEM)</head><p>In the rest of paper we consider a specific system of generative machinery for f y (.), f m (.), f a (.) in our further exploration. As the first theoretical work in this field, we would like to start with a scenario where both Y and M are continuous, while the exposure variable A is binary. As evident in the paper, the related methodology and analytics are flexible and generalizable to allow a continuous exposure variable A, as well as other nonlinear settings (e.g. binary or survival outcomes) with little effort.</p></div>

The above global control or simultaneous manipulation of the full exposure vector is unrealistic and limits possible local situations and applicability of the data analytics. More realistic scenarios would pertain to manipulations on a subset of the N exposures in a network community as well as their summary functions such as community-level aggregated exposures. To differentiate between individual-level and neighborhood community-level effects and appropriately characterize causal mediation and interference effects, we propose an extended conceptual framework of the exposure mapping function for neighborhood exposures, first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Manski (2013)</ref>. This extension is applicable to any general class of Network SEMs specified by the system of SEMs in</p><p>(1), where the REN-SEM in (2)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">4</ref>) is a special case.</p><p>Exposure Mapping Functions M (•). Based on the system of SEMs in (1) we observe that i th unit's self mediator M i is dependent on the entire exposure vector A only through both self exposure A i and neighbors' exposures A N † i of this unit. To introduce a local community (e.g. the set of first-degree neighbors) into the SEMs, we restrict the dependence of self mediator M i on all other exposures A N † i only through a lower-dimensional mapping, T 1i (•) : {0, 1} ni → A 1i with dim(A 1i ) ≤ n i . Mathematically, this translates the dimensional reduction to the following form of mapping: with a = (a i , a</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">N † i , a -N † i ), M i (a) = M i (a i , T 1i (a N † i )), a i ∈ {0, 1}, a N † i ∈ {0, 1} ni ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where T 1i (.) may be regarded as of a sufficient dimension reduction on the full exposures involving only the community of first-degree neighbors, and the resulting mapping ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">M i (•, •) : {0, 1} × A 1i → R.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">Y i (a) = Y i (a, M (a)) = Y i (a i , T 2i (a N † i ), M i (a), T 3i • M N † i (a)) (6) = Y i (a i , T 2i (a N † i ), M i (a i , T 1i (a N † i )), T 3i • M N † i (a)).</formula><p>where the resulting mapping <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure">"</ref> • " denotes the operator for the compound of two functions. The second equality stems from the assumption that the outcome Y is influenced directly by the neighborhood exposure and mediator vectors through low-dimensional combined features generated by functions T 2i (.) and T 3i (.) respectively.

These channels of effects are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> along with the pathways of influences on outcome Y by various forms of self and aggregated exposures through self and neighboring mediators.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Mediation and Interference Pathways</head><p>It follows from equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) that in the REN-SEM potential outcome Y i (.) is a function of (A i , S A 1i , S A 2i , S A 3i ), as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. It is challenging in terms of both administrative and financial resources to simultaneously intervene on exposures in practice in multiple communities. A realistic task is to focus on investigating the total effects of self and first-degree neighborhood exposures on the outcome through D i = (A i , S A 1i ) by marginalizing the other higher order aggregated exposures of (S A 2i , S A 3i ). Consequently, we shall focus on the spillover effect of first-degree neighborhood exposures on the outcome solely through S A 1i , the average number of first-degree neighboring units receiving the treatment. Such task targets at the estimands of primary interest in practice, facilitating the identification, feasibility and robustness in the analysis of causal mediation and interference effects, so that results enjoy interpretability.</p><p>To elucidate this point, let us consider our motivating data example in Section 7 with the platform primarily focusing on video gaming, including playthroughs, eSports broadcasts, and other gaming-related events. Within the network, each node represents a Twitch user while edges between nodes indicate mutual following relationships among users. A triple of variables measured on each node includes (i) a binary exposureA ∈ {0, 1} with A = 1 indicates a user having mature content in light of explicit language, sexual content, graphic violence, or other adult themes, and A = 0 otherwise; (ii) a continuous mediator M representing the lifetime of user's account; and (iii) a continuous outcome Y as the number of views on the user's account. We want to assess how content maturity and network dynamics can influence viewership within the Twitch social network. To do this, node-level DAGs are imposed to study the mechanistic impact of maturity content-both of an individual and their network friends' average-on a user's account views, which may be potentially mediated by the account lifetime of both the individual and their neighbors.</p></div>

Due to the fact that A i , S A 1i , S A 2i</formula><p>, and S A 3i are intercorrelated within the network, the marginalization involves a chain of two nested operations: In the first step, marginalizing the influence of S A 3i is straightforward by integrating relevant estimands with respect to the distribution of S A 3i |X i . In the second step, marginalizing S A 2i is done through the conditional distribution of S A 2i given S A 1i and X i , which ensures that alterations in S A 1i remain valid interventions.</p><p>It is worth point out that not all possible values of exposures D i = (A i , S A 1i ) correspond to valid interventions under a given adjacency matrix.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Key Estimands of Interest</head><p>There are a total of six estimands of interest in the network setting when aggregate exposure</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">D i = (A i , S 1i ) changes from d ′ = (a ′ , s A ′ 1 ) to d = (a, s A 1 ).</formula><p>They may be classified into five classes, each defined in turn as follows. We begin with the total effect. Definition 3.1. The first-order marginal total effect is given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">τ tot (d ′ , d) = 1 N N i=1 ⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A , M i a, s 1i A , S 4i a, s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i -⃗ E A ′ i Y i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S A 2i , S A 3i ,</formula><p>where the higher-order exposure terms S A 2i , S A 3i are integrated out through the marginalization operation of ⃗ E in equations (7)-( <ref type="formula">8</ref>). This operation will also be repeated in the other definitions below that correspond to various mechanistic routes through which an individual's outcome may be influenced by self and neighbors' exposures within the network. Take an instance of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The total effect component on outcome of "Target" Unit 1, is the effect due to the simultaneous change in the exposure of Unit 1 and average exposures of the neighbors, Unit 2 and Unit 3. In the friendship network of gamers analyzed in Section 7, the first-order marginal total effect refers to the combined impact of a gamer's maturity and the average number of friends' maturity on the number of views of the gamer's account.</p><p>Decomposing the above total effect according to different pathways shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, we come up with six key estimands of interest, including direct and indirect effects within each unit and through inter-node interference. Definition 3.2. With the neighbors being withheld, the self direct effect of exposure A on outcome</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">Y (A → Y ), denoted by τ 1 , is τ 1 (d ′ , d) = 1 N N i=1 ⃗ E A ′ i Y i a, s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S A 2i , S A 3i -⃗ E A ′ i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S A 2i , S A 3i .</formula><p>This τ 1 measures an average direct effect exerted from a within-unit exposure change while all other external conditions are held fixed. Indeed, τ 1 is a familiar estimand known in the classical mediation analysis with no reliance on the network dependence. In the gamer's friendship network studied in Section 7, the τ 1 refers to the direct influence of a gamer having mature content on the number of views of this gamer's account. Unlike τ 1 , the next definition of mediation effects consists of two types of estimands. Definition 3.3. In the network setting, two types of mediation effects from self exposure A are defined, respectively, as self mediation effect and neighborhood mediation effect (a) The self mediation effect of A on Y via M (A → M → Y ) while the neighboring conditions are withheld, denoted by τ 2 , is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">τ 2 (d ′ , d) = 1 N N i=1 ⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A , M i a, s 1i A , S 4i a, s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i -⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A , M i a ′ , s 1i A , S 4i a, s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i .</formula><p>The estimand τ 2 is seen in the classical mediation analysis with independent units, and it reflects an average mediation effect within an individual unit with no influences from its neighbors. In the gamer's friendship network, the τ 2 refers to the mechanistic impact of a gamer's engagement of maturity content on the number of views of this gamer's account mediated through the lifetime of the gamer's account.</p><p>(b) The neighborhood mediation effect of A on Y via first-degree neighbors' mediators</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">M N † (A → M N † → Y ),</formula><p>denoted by τ 3 , is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">τ 3 (d ′ , d) = 1 N N i=1 ⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A , M i a ′ , s 1i A , S 4i a, s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i -⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A , M i a ′ , s 1i A , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i .</formula><p>This estimand τ 3 is new and emerges due to the network contiguity. This captures the average mediation effect from self exposure A driven by changes in the mediators from the unit's first-order neighboring community. In the same example of the gamer's friendship network, the τ 3 refers to an indirect impact of a gamer engaging mature content on the number of views of this gamer's account mediated through the lifetime of the his/her friends' accounts.</p><p>Now we turn to define spillover effects that signify new conceptual and statistical contributions related to the understanding of interference among units in a network, which are useful in practical studies to provide new insights. Definition 3.4. The spillover effect of A N † on Y (A N † → Y ), denoted by τ 4 , takes the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">τ 4 (d ′ , d) = 1 N N i=1 ⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A , M i a ′ , s 1i A , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i -⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i .</formula><p>This estimand τ 4 quantifies the average change on the outcome attributed to changes of the aggregated exposure on individual's first-degree neighbors while the other factors are withheld. In the friendship network example, the τ 4 refers to the impact of the average engagement of mature content by a gamer's friends on the number of views of this gamer's account.</p><p>The final definition is devoted to the class of two spillover mediation effects originated at neighbors' exposure changes. Definition 3.5. (a) The spillover self mediation effect of</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">A N † on Y via self mediator M (A N † → M → Y ), denoted by τ 5 , is given by τ 5 (d ′ , d) = 1 N N i=1 ⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i -⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i .</formula><p>This estimand τ 5 describes the average change of the outcome due to a change of the self mediator that is driven by a change of the aggregated exposure from the community of first-degree neighbors. In the gamer's friendship network example, the τ 5 refers to the impact of the average engagement of mature content by a gamer's friends on the number of views of this gamer's account, mediated through the lifetime of the gamer's account.</p><p>(b) The spillover neighborhood mediation effect from neighborhood exposure</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">A N † on Y through neighborhood mediator M N † (A N † → M N † → Y )</formula><p>, denoted by τ 6 , takes the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">τ 6 (d ′ , d) = 1 N N i=1 ⃗ E A i Y i a, s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A , S A 2i , S A 3i -⃗ E A ′ i Y i a, s 1i A ′ , M i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S 4i a ′ , s 1i A ′ , S A 2i , S A 3i .</formula><p>This estimand τ 6 gauges an average change of the outcome caused by a change occurring in the first-degree neighbors' mediators as a consequence of changes in these neighbors' exposures. This effect appears most complex because it involves two types of changes happening all in the neighborhood community. In the gamer's friendship network example, the τ 6 refers to the impact of the average engagement of mature content by a gamer's friends on the number of views of this gamer's account, mediated through the aggregated lifetime of his or her friend's accounts.</p><p>All of the aforementioned six estimands τ 1 to τ 6 are conditional on the sample size N and given adjacency matrix E. Of note, these estimands are deemed to be data-dependent or data-adaptive, signifying that their values hinge upon the data sample through the explicit influence of the network topology E and network size N .</p><p>4 Identifiability Conditions and Decomposition Theorem</p></div>

This effect is absent if and only if β 4 γ 2 = 0, or this unit is a singleton being fully disconnected with the other units in the network, i.e. all E ij = 0.

This estimand involves more complicated functions of the neighborhood exposures and τ 6 = 0 if and only if β 4 = 0 or (γ 1 ∆2N + γ 2 ∆3N ) = 0, which is a weighted sum of γ 1 and γ 2 .</p><p>For convenience, we may divide these six estimands into two classes according to whether they are involved in interference or not. Thus, the first class contains τ 1 and τ 2 that correspond to the classical causal mediation effects without interference, while the other class consisting of τ 3 to τ 6 emerge in the network setting due to the connectivity relationships given in E. This results in a comprehensive framework of mediation and interference effects, allowing the study of different direct and indirect pathways, including those influenced by neighboring units' exposures and mediators.</p><p>In The proof this Lemma is presented in Supplementary Section 1.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Fixed Effects and Random Effects</head><p>In the utility of the proposed REN-SEM framework to study mechanistic pathways, we focus essentially on populationlevel fixed effects, instead of unit-specific random effects. Having such a focus is crucial, as it prevents the conflation of random variation and / or potential shrinkage with the six causal estimands, thereby providing robust inference and interpretable results about the population-level impacts of exposures on outcomes within the studied population.</p><p>Technically, to obtain the six estimands (τ 1 through τ 6 ) as fixed effects, we integrate over the random intercepts in the REN-SEM specified by equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">2</ref>) and (3). Of note, these random intercepts are included in the model primarily to capture dependencies and unobserved unit level heterogeneity among the mediators and outcomes within the network.</p><p>In this way, we hope to further address unit-specific variations that are beyond what observed variables can explain.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in the REN-SEM framework with only random intercepts, the magnitudes of causal estimands conditioned on random effects are not directly influenced by these random effects. This phenomenon results from the cancellation of random intercepts through a difference between two expectations in the derivation, effectively nullifying their impact within the linear mixed effects model framework adopted by REN-SEM. Apparently, this cancellation would not hold if random slopes were included in the model. It is important to point that random intercepts do not directly alter the estimands, they impact the second moments-specifically, the variance and covariance structures of M and Y . Such effects in turn, have non-ignorable influences for the statistical inference of the fixed effects in the REN-SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Statistical Theory with Network-Dependent Data</head><p>As mentioned above, the six estimands τ 1 through τ 6 of interest are inherently functions of the parameters of the REN-SEM model in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">2</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">4</ref>) and are random effects free. Thus, with the availability of model parameter estimates, the corresponding estimates for such estimands are obtained naturally by the plug-in method as well as their inferences. In this paper, we invoke the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for the model parameters, in which, however, the large-sample theory is technically nontrivial due to the fact that the network data are not independent samples.</p></div>

The total dataset comprises 168,114 nodes or gamers, but a subset of 1,415 nodes used in our analysis due purely to the computational costs. As discussed in Section 3, our primary focus is to apply our proposed methodology to assess the impact of mature content-both from individual users and the average within their network neighbors-on the views received by a user's account. This relationship is further analyzed for potential mediation by the account lifetime of both the individual user and their neighboring nodes (or friends). In the dataset analyzed, the average network degree is observed to be 67. Approximately 50% of the gamers' accounts are flagged for having mature content. The average account lifetime within our sample is 2,035 days, with a standard deviation of 730 days, indicating a substantial variation in the duration that accounts have been active. The average number of views per user's account stands at approximately 573,003 with a standard deviation of 227,498, highlighting significant disparities in viewership across different accounts.

Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S2</ref> presents the estimates of the six causal estimands along with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.s). Below are several findings in terms of the influence of maturity on viewer engagement.</p><p>• τ 1 (A → Y ): The direct effect of a user's account having matured content on the number of views is -0.051 [95% C.I (-0.064, -0.039)] with a p-value &lt; 0.05. This implies that streams containing mature content tend to attract fewer views compared to non-mature streams. This could be due to a smaller audience base that either prefers or is permitted to view such content.</p><p>• τ 2 (A → M → Y ): The mediated effect of a user's account having mature content on the number of views through the user's account lifetime is -0.003 [95% C.I. (-0.078, 0.002)], with a p-value &gt; 0.05. This finding suggests that this mediation pathway is not statistically significant.</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">• τ 3 (A → M N † → Y ):</formula><p>The mediated effect of a user's account having mature content on the number of views through the neighbors' lifetime is 0.0012 [95% C.I. (0.0008, 0.0016)], with a p-value &lt; 0.05. This suggests that having mature content is correlated with a decrease in his or her friends' account lifetime, which paradoxically leads to an increase in the number of views for the user. This phenomenon might occur because the reduced lifetime of friend's accounts lessens competition for viewers, thereby channeling more traffic to the user's account. This dynamic highlights a potentially competitive aspect of content maturity within social networks where strategic content choices can influence not only the user's own behavior but also the interaction dynamics within their network.</p><p>• τ 4 (A N † → Y ): The spillover effect of the average number of friends having mature content on the number of views of a user is -0.031 [95% C.I. (-0.041, -0.022)], with a p-value &lt; 0.05. This implies that being surrounded by channels that host mature content generally reduces a channel's viewership. This decrease in viewership can possibly be attributed to factors similar to the direct effects of mature content, such as limited audience reach.</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">• τ 5 (A N † → M → Y ):</formula><p>The spillover mediated effect of the average number of friends having mature content on the number of views through a user's lifetime is -0.006 [95% C.I. (-0.008, -0.004)], with a p-value &lt; 0.05. This indicates that having friends with mature content decreases lifetime of the user's own account, which in turn leads to fewer views.</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">• τ 6 (A N † → M N † → Y ) :</formula><p>The spillover mediated effect of the average number of friends having mature content on the number of views through neighbors' lifetimes is 0.005 [95% C.I. (-0.005, 0.010)], with a p-value&gt; 0.05. There is no data evidence to assert the mechanistic pathway; that is, changes in friends' content maturity and their account lifetimes do not unveil a reliable impact on a user's viewership.</p><p>In summary, the influence of mature content on Twitch viewership is multifaceted, with direct and neighborhood effects playing significant roles. The negative direct and spillover effects highlight challenges in attracting viewers to mature content, while the positive mediated effects through neighbors' account lifetimes offer insights into potential strategies for mitigating these challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Concluding Remarks</head><p>We have developed a substantial extension with full theoretical rigor to a conceptual framework of great importance to study mediation DAGs in a network setting. The proposed methodology enables to investigate mechanistic pathways beyond the classical natural direct and indirect effects based on independent units. Such extension is specifically relevant to the context of network-based data in social sciences, environmental health, epidemiology, and infectious disease. Our methodology, grounded in a comprehensive system of correlated Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and network structural equation models with random effects (i.e. REN-SEM), has identified six fundamental mediation and interference estimands, some of which, e.g. spillover effects, emerge exclusively due to the presence of network contiguity. Presenting a full spectrum of the six estimands is essential for a detailed exploration of causal effects in complex network systems where neighboring units can play a critical role in the study of mediation mechanisms on individual units.</p><p>One of the key technical contributions in this paper pertains to the rigorous specification of the identifiability conditions necessary to differentiate direct, mediation, spillover, and spillover mediation causal pathways in the proposed network structural equation models. We have rigorously established key regularity conditions that ensure consistent estimation and have derived extended asymptotic normality results under network-dependent units. These theoretical results have been illustrated with high robustness and reproducibility through empirical simulation studies, which confirm its applicability in practice. In particular, the empirical coverage probability by the constructed confidence interval for each of the six estimands is stably close to the nominal level across the majority of simulation settings, which enhances the trust of the proposed inference to be used in practical studies. The application of our methodology to the Twitch Dataset has elucidated some new mediation and spillover pathways in the understanding of gamer's behaviors such as streaming platform interact and influence user engagement and viewership patterns.</p><p>Despite these advancements, several limitations of our proposed methodology warrant further investigation. First, like the existing causal mediation analysis, the causal identification assumptions we have relied on may be susceptible to violations due to unobserved confounders, potentially complicating causal interpretations. This challenge remains an open problem in the field of causal inference and merits ongoing exploration. Second, our proposed REN-SEM modeling approach employs only random intercepts to account for network dependencies and unit-specific heterogeneity. Future work could extend the REN-SEM framework to incorporate random slopes, so to capture individual-level covariate effects. Additionally, expanding the REN-SEM model to include non-linear terms or to allow non-normal distributions would enhance its flexibility and practical impact, making it more adaptable to a wider range of applications.</p><p>A 1 , A 2 , • • • , A N are Bernoulli random variables with success probability π.
