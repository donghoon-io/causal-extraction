<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In this study, patient safety is understood as an activity that minimizes and removes possible errors and injuries to patients. In this sense, it comprises prevention of medical errors and avoidable adverse events, the protection of patients from harm or injury, collaborative efforts by individual healthcare providers and a strong, well-integrated healthcare system <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. However, diagnostic errors in uence approximately 5.08% of all adult outpatients, i.e. 12 million adults, in the US, every year. It has been estimated that about half of these errors could potentially be harmful <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>In Poland, 8062 complaints regarding medical errors and 5748 cases of professional errors were identi ed in the years <ref type="bibr">2006-2008 (4)</ref>. To avoid errors and improve patient safety, health care organizations need to implement corrective activity. Despite increasing understanding of patient safety strategies, little is known about the precedents for improving safety in primary care.</p><p>The facilities available in the practice, communication and collaboration, education regarding patient safety and generic conditions have all be found to in uence patient safety management strategies <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, the present study examines factors in uencing patient safety management to develop more effective interventions and identify routes to implementing better strategies.</p><p>The principle of concept analysis states that identifying the antecedents and consequences would help in that(6,7). Certain antecedents have already been found to positively in uence patient safety in primary care (8-10): <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> safety incidents are documented to share knowledge and learn from them, (2) provide adequate sta ng and facilities in the practice, (3) encourage communication and collaboration to coordinate safe patient care, (4) provide in-service education and training for providers and (5) foster a safety culture among leaders and providers. For the purposes of the present study, these antecedents were classi ed into four strategies: generic conditions (GC), facilities in the practice (FP), communication and collaboration (CC) and education regarding patient safety (EPS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The aim of the present study was to test theoretical model of patient safety interventions, based on safety antecedents.</p><p>The following patient safety strategies were used as variables affecting patient safety management (PSM): facilities in the practice, communication and collaboration, and education regarding patient safety.</p><p>SEM was used to characterize latent variables and to produce a causal model incorporating several of the variables. The models allow the diagnosis and assessment of potential causes of safety management failure, as well as the identi cation of relevant management methods.</p><p>Patient safety is needed at all levels of the healthcare system. Regardless of the national setting, a positive safety culture focuses on collective improvement and teamwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. This can only be achieved with well de ned generic conditions for patient safety. These guidelines are essential <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>. Technology and expertise exist to manage these conditions and limit their patient safety impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. However, safety problems are most effectively managed through education, appropriate facilities and communication <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Therefore, it is assumed that (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> The population used in this study has different characteristics (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We check to ensure the measured effect is not in uenced by the control variables (table 5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Therefore, it is assumed that : H3: The relation with strategies is the identical for each control variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>SEM was used to model patient safety management using causal models derived by experts and validated using monitoring survey data. Once de ned, SEM was used to regress the de ned strategies against each other to produce nal model outputs. As a result, a series of causa relations arrows are produced, each associated with a standard coe cient representing its impact on a scale of -1 (high negative impact) to +1 (high positive impact) <ref type="bibr">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</p><p>A questionnaire intended to identify factors affecting primary care was developed. It comprised 38 items which were adopted from multiple scales used elsewhere in the literature. The instrument comprises the following ve constructs which were analyzed by SEM: patient safety management, facilities in the practice, generic conditions, communication and collaboration and education.</p><p>The questionnaire was completed by 248 individuals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The respondents differed signi cantly in the number of patients cared for and the size of their counseling centers, measured by the number of patients. The number of patients ranged from 0 to 4,000 (mean 1.763 patients; SD = 873). The number of patients per facility ranged from 300 to 16,220 (mean 5091; SD=3,096). In addition, 49.6% of respondents conducted their medical practice in a city with over 100,000 people. Most of the 38 presented items (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1A</ref> in appendix) were seen as important by the majority of participants, but the use of the strategies in daily practice varied widely <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The mean scores for all questions were low (see table 1A in appendix). The highest scoring strategy concerned patient medical records (mean=3.33 and SD=1.067). The following items were found to have a mean score above 2:</p><p>planned checks of safety of equipment medication and other facilities in the practice, the use of a properly-kept computerized medical record system, the use of ICPC-coded electronic record standards, a strong understanding of patient safety in health professionals. Particularly how it varies depending on treatment models complications and the availability of information technology in general practice and the ability to properly use them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement of latent variables</head><p>The instrument used in the study consists of 38 items measuring the ve latent variables (strategies). All measures are scored on a four-point Likert scale providing su cient variance and covariance for better data analysis (18). In addition, all the manifest variables included in the instrument, i.e. the items, re ect the changes of their corresponding latent variables and therefore can be seen as being caused by constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. In addition, all the constructs are operationalized as rst-order latent variables because rst, this way, the complexity of the whole model is reduced as the number of latent variables did not increase. Secondly, as no blocks of indicators were found to share speci c common characteristics, all items were treated as a single latent variable. A more detailed speci cation of items is presented in appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">A1</ref>.</p><p>The unrotated principal component factor analysis (CFA), principal component analysis with varimax rotation, and principal axis analysis with varimax rotation all revealed the presence of three distinct factors with eigenvalue greater than 1.0, rather than a single factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. The seven factors together accounted for 67.84 percent of the total variance; the rst (largest) factor did not account for a majority of the variance (11.324%). While the results of these analyses do not preclude the possibility of common method variance, they do suggest that common method variance is not of great concern and thus is unlikely to confound the interpretations of results.</p><p>After 248 observations, the accuracy of each of the hidden variables, was found to be at least 0.7, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (each variable also demonstrated CR&gt;0.7 and AVE&gt;0.5). The latent variable was not constructed from all of the observable variables proposed by <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. The strongness of these deliberations is to meet the threshold conditions by the constructed variables and the observable variables that represent it. signi cantly from one another. In addition discriminant validity analysis was performed to determine whether the measures of each construct differ su ciently from those of other constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</p><p>The part of the model that examines relationship between the latent variables and their measures is known as the measurement model. A previous CFA based on a sample of respondents in Poland con rmed that the measurement model demonstrates satisfactory construct validity, discriminant validity and internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. In the case of the measurement models, there is no reason to reject the hypothesis that the standardized residual values of the empirical and theoretical matrix are equal to zero (χ2 = 564.812; p = 0.000). The model was found to demonstrate a good t to the data, as indicated by a root mean square of approximation error (RMSEA) of 0.061&lt;0.08 (LO=0.054; HI=0.069), and to demonstrate good acceptability, as indicated by χ2/ss=1.928&lt;2, GFI=0.951&gt;0.9 and AGFI=0.921&gt;0.9 (16,21,23). All latent variables in the model are signi cantly correlated, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>This model was estimated using the maximum likelihood method, assuming a multidimensional normal distribution. No suspicious response pattern was observed, and also, following the outlier labeling rule, no signi cant outlier was observed; however, as no skewness or kurtosis values higher than one were found, the data was normal. In the case of the structural models, there is no reason to reject the hypothesis that the standardized residual values of the empirical and theoretical matrix are equal to zero (χ2=582.298; p=0.000). The value of root mean square of approximation error (RMSEA) is 0.063&lt;0.08 (LO=0.055; HI=0.070), standardized RMR=0.0762&lt;0.08 indicates a good t of the model. The values of χ2/ss=1.981&lt;2 indicate the acceptability of the model. Indices GFI=0.947&gt;0.9 and AGFI=0.917&gt;0.9 assume the values are acceptable, so the model is well suited to the data and can be used in the description <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Following the criteria and rules of thumb speci ed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, data analysis results are interpreted in the following sections in terms of model estimations.</p><p>The determine the predictive accuracy of the model, the determination coe cients (R 2 ) of the latent variables were estimated. R 2 values higher than 0.33 are considered acceptable for latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26)</ref>. The R 2 statistics were found to be signi cantly higher than 0.33 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) con rming that the model has su cient predictive accuracy.</p><p>Determining the strengths of impacts in our model, we used the standardized path coe cients mainly because of our model construction in which the relationships between constructs do not allow us to apply other measures such as the effect sizes. Considering the relationships between patient safety management and its three antecedents, the results of our model calculations (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) revealed the large effect of communication and collaboration (0.434), small effect of facilities in the practice (0.215), and medium effect of education on patient safety (0.325). Consequences as generic conditions for patient safety is large effects of education on patient safety (on with beta coe cient of 0.675), of communication and collaboration (0.674) and of facilities in the practice (0.586). The indirect impact of generic conditions for patient safety on the patient safety management is 0.441. Strength is comparable to impact communication and collaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effect of control variable</head><p>At a later stage of research, it was tested whether the signi cance and force of this impact is identical in the groups distinguished in the sample, because of such characteristics as the gender, age, current professional discipline as GP and work in counseling centers.</p><p>The analyses carried out in groups with the provided characteristics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> in appendix) show that in all groups, the signi cance of impact the facilities in the practice on their patient safety management cannot be considered identical. However, the results indicate no statistical signi cance in uence facilities in the practice on patient safety management in the case of female, respondents age lower than mean, current professional discipline is not GP and respondents not work in counselling centres. In addition, the results indicate that education on patient safety does improve patient safety management in groups: respondents age higher than mean and respondents not work in counseling centers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disscusion</head><p>The model was analyzed using SEM: an extension of linear regression that enables the modelling of complex relationships between interrelated (and thus correlated) variables: the resulting models account for direct and indirect impacts and can cope with correlated variables. It can also be used to model causal relationships. In SEM, it is possible to use more than one attribute to characterize latent variables. SEM uses an optimization process to create an index score for each latent variable using linear regression.</p><p>The objective of this study was to identify the antecedents of patient safety management. Seven dimensions of communication and collaboration, ve dimensions of generic conditions for patient safety and 8 dimensions of education on patient safety were adapted from previous research <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. For practice facilities we use only four dimensions not 9 and for patient safety management we use only seven not 9.</p><p>Each of these dimensions was found to be signi cant, and were important components of the latent construct. Our ndings validated hypothesis H1-H2 and con rmed that the antecedents patient safety in primary care are strategies: facilities in the practice, communication and collaboration, education and antecedents of them is generic conditions. All had the positive impact on patient safety; among all the communication and collaboration had the strongest. This con rmed that communication and collaboration strategy is an important aspect of patient safety management <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Primary care modeling is complex because causes and effects are interrelated and effects are often mitigated by a set of attributes that cannot be easily modeled using standard techniques. Traditional statistical techniques such as linear regression mainly model the direct impact of uncorrelated variables. Indirect effects are di cult to model and the presence of correlations between explanatory variables may lead to biased coe cient estimates and incorrect model interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>. Di culties in measuring patient safety and the complexity of primary care make it desirable to use new methods in the patient safety model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>.</p><p>Hypothesis 3</p><p>"The relation with strategies is the identical for each control variables" was rejected because only for strategies: general condition and communication and collaboration are identical for each control variables. The impact is different for education and practice facilities strategies.</p><p>The literature review promotes choosing a complementary approach through the use of an effective system of reporting incidents from patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. This is not in our model. The most important and pressing action is to implement an information infrastructure that enables capture of adverse events and harm across patient safety systems, and over time information can ow freely between GP and patients on various data platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. The consequences associated with patient safety in primary care are better quality of care, prevention of injury or harm, and greater patient satisfaction (8).</p><p>It has been noted in the literature <ref type="bibr">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref> that due to the practice of reporting incidents, proper communication among health care providers, and safety culture within the organizational structure, it was possible to minimize medication errors and safety incidents, improving thus quality of care in primary healthcare.</p><p>Our model shows that it is possible to prevent incidents related to patient safety through professional development and training. The key to improving patient satisfaction is proper communication with the patient and cooperation in the provision of healthcare. Facilities in the practice are also important (8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>An integrated safety model has been developed and tested, making it much easier to dismantle the tool to better understand patient safety mechanisms. Both the literature and the survey ndings suggest that generic conditions empowerment is one of the leading activity and intervention to improve patient safety management. Involvement can be achieved through facilities, communication and collaboration and education. Communication and education are also key. In all contexts, implementing and sustaining these changes requires management of patient safety focused on collective improvement and teamwork. This can only be achieved with model presented at all levels of the healthcare system. Due to the high visibility of patient safety, there are pragmatic reasons for using this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The response rate for this study was acceptable, but selection bias cannot be ruled out. Due to the selection procedure used (through a contact person), it is likely that we asked the most experienced patient safety primary care physicians in the country, and patient safety experts, on their opinion. Most of the respondents were actually practicing GPs (56.9%), which can be seen as a potential bias. The earlier studies (1) noticed that 'regular' practicing GPs found patient safety highly relevant, yet they had a very broad idea about patient safety. This survey based upon the results of previous research would be used to develop tool to measure the patient safety.</p><p>The disadvantage of the study is the use of SEM with a relatively small sample, this model likes very big sample. We have relatively small sample of 248 respondents combined with a very large list of items 38 (5 constructs) included in the analyses, what may lead to a model that is over speci ed. The number of samples in the study is by no means exhaustive, and expanding the volume of samples could be further studied to test the accuracy and stability of the results through SEM technology. The SEM with latent variables and multiple indicators, can produce highly variable estimates in small samples. In the future it is worth checking use of a xed-reliability single indicator models which is recommended in small samples.</p><p>Practical Applications SEM offers the tool enabling locally rooted planning and implementing of patient safety strategies. Revealed antecedents can establish platform for design and implementation of practical action in primary care to improve patient safety. Applying SEM reveal a whole new type of safety management.</p><p>Traditionally, this strategies are treated separately. However, these traditionally approach has signi cant disadvantages. Acceptance of the generic conditions for patient safety should generate in this regard: education, facilities, communication and collaboration. This model provides more information on patient safety management, practice, communication and collaboration, and contextual factors. </p></div>
