<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective: To analyze the direct and indirect effects of the determinants of suicidal ideation in workers, focusing on global dissatisfaction as the main exposure. Methods: A cross-sectional study, with secondary data from a cohort of a population aged 15 or over, and resident in the urban zone of a large municipality of Bahia, Brazil. We applied a structured questionnaire, including socio-demographic and work data. Leisure activities and occupational stressors were evaluated; we measured global dissatisfaction and suicidal ideation. We processed the structural equation modeling, with consideration of complex samples.</p><p>Results:The frequency of suicidal ideation (SI) was 5% in the sample of 1,629 workers studied. Signi cant direct effects for SI were observed for global dissatisfaction (β=0.72; p-value=0.001), and a high emotional demand of work (β=0.27; p=0.007). Being female, having a low monthly income, the absence of leisure activities, excessive commitment to work, and a high emotional demand of work presented signi cant indirect effects, mediated by global dissatisfaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Suicide represents a high-pro le public health problem worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, suicide affects more than 800,000 people per annum. This means that one person commits suicide every 40 seconds at a rate of 11.6 suicides for every 100,000 people per year <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Suicide is one of the fteen most common causes of death in the general population and is ranked second in young adults <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Brazil occupies the fteenth position for the rate in the Americas but is second in absolute numbers, placed behind the United States <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> . There were more than 170,000 cases (approximately 12,000 cases per year) between 1996 and 2015; in other words, on average, one person commits suicide in Brazil every 46 minutes. There were 5,160 cases in the State of Bahia between 2010 and 2019, 634 of which took place in 2019 <ref type="bibr">3</ref> .</p><p>The relationship between suicide and work rarely focuses on an analysis of the determining factors of suicide. This is due to the traditional perspective, which con nes subjective events to the individual sphere, establishing distinctive inadequacies, such as the unique causes of this dramatic event taking place. The forms of degradation of the human and social fabric, in which work plays a central role, are continually made invisible. From the workers' point of view, there are countless reasons that silence them on their psychological suffering. The invisibility of this phenomenon derives from social processes that isolate individuals who are considered unsuitable. As a consequence of this exclusion, feelings and sensations emerge that, without resolution, represent precursors of suicidal behavior: solitude, failed belonging, a perceived overload, productive incapacity for work, despair, and the feeling of uselessness, among others, structure distorted perceptions of oneself. These feelings become internalized as guilt, often fed on a daily basis by the means of production, and a society that has established competitiveness as the modus operandi by work colleagues. Fear, in turn, strengthens the impression of feeling weak with regard to the work routine, leading individuals to peaks of suffering and falling illopen doors to suicidal ideation and suicide <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Dejours and Bègue <ref type="bibr">4</ref> highlight that the denial of suffering forms part of collective defense strategies as a measure of protection against unemployment, retaliation by employers, and the prejudices associated with mental disorders, which produce and feed stigmas and exclusion.</p><p>Despite being a tragic and irreversible outcome, suicide does not occur suddenly. Generally, an individual presents signals and symptoms that indicate their intentions. Therefore, there is a suicidal context that involves a set of characteristics that signal the situation. Suicidal ideation, previous plans, and attempts at suicide generate a more acute stage of psychological suffering. Other events, predominantly identi ed in international literature associated with this context, form a body of indicators that may assist in understanding the phenomenon, and mitigating actions. Understanding the relation between these indicators plays a crucial role in characterizing suicidal behavior and avoiding its realization.</p><p>The isolated focus on mental disorders as the main precursors of suicide predominates in the scienti c literature. However, other aspects may, and should be, analyzed as factors that contribute to the situation of despair and feelings of the absence of solutions, which lead to suicide. For example, feelings of global dissatisfaction (with work, social relations, with one's health, and oneself) may be relevant indicators to monitor the situations of vulnerability and risk associated with this outcome. Faced with a scenario of investigations centered on subjects' individual characteristics, an issue as complex as suicide is usually restricted to what can be measured and the individual sphere. However, this is a limited approach, since the conditions listed are not at the genesis of the problem, but are its product, and function as mediators of the suicidal context. Therefore, the search to understand the processes that collectively (re)produce falling ill should be highlighted. De ning a focus that surpasses the traditional view involves the inclusion of broader and more complex events in the analysis, such as those related to gender and living conditions, the organization of work, and its conditions and stressors, as an important matrix of suffering, as extensively suggested in scienti c literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> .</p><p>This study focuses on related aspects that have been entitled 'global dissatisfaction'. Global dissatisfaction (latent construct arising from dissatisfaction, as follows: that capacity for work, personal relations, with oneself, quality of life, and health) is de ned as a direct precursor of suicidal ideation in workers, with this characteristic understood as an important mediator, among other factors associated with psychological suffering, highlighting occupational stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> ; gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref> ; low income <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> ; experience of physical or emotional violence at work and outside work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> ; and the absence of leisure activities <ref type="bibr">6</ref> .</p><p>Endeavors in the eld of collective/workers' health and social sciences, faced with such a complex phenomenon of nature, require further theoretical-methodological investigations, which enable a stronger immersion in the search for knowledge. This research provides a better understanding of the relations between the components of this tragic and, equally, enigmatic problem. Therefore, through this study, we aim to analyze the determining factors of suicidal ideation in workers, evaluating the direct and indirect effects and indicators, with global dissatisfaction as the main exposure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study type</head><p>Study with time-speci c data, taken from the second wave of the prospective cohort, entitled "Surveillance of mental health and work: a cohort of the population of Feira de Santana-Bahia", nanced by the State of Bahia Research Support Foundation (FAPESB/SESAB/CNPQ/MS PPSUS/BA -028/2018).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population, sample, and eligibility criteria</head><p>The cohort study population was formed of individuals aged 15 or over, who were residents in urban zones of the municipality of Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil. The sample attained, of 4,170 participants, was selected through a complex sample procedure, strati ed in accordance with ve municipal subdistricts, establishing a two-stage draw of conglomerates (census sectors and streets). The draws for each subdistrict followed the following stages: a) simple sampling of the primary sampling unit (census sector); b) probability-proportional sampling performed in each census sector (households per street, and people per household, in accordance with age range and sex), using Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) data; c) random draw of the streets where the interviews would be held.</p><p>Eligible residents from all of the drawn households were included, to hold the interviews. The eligibility criteria were as follows: living in a selected household and being aged 15 or over. Individuals without the psycho-emotional conditions to answer the questionnaire or who verbally or hearing impaired, were excluded.</p><p>The study sample was a segment of the 4,170 cohort individuals, comprising 1,629 workers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection procedures</head><p>Data collection took place between December 2018 and November 2019, every day of the week, during the daytime. Individual, face-a-face interviews were held in the households by a previously trained research team, with maximum privacy for the participants. To reduce any losses, and in an attempt to interview every eligible participant in the household, the research team made a maximum of three visits to the location on alternate days and times, and only after these attempts had failed was a loss considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection instrument and study variables</head><p>The variables of the 10 blocks of the questionnaire used in the second wave of the cohort were extracted for this study, namely: a. Sociodemographic characteristics: gender and monthly income. For the structural equation modeling, the variable was called 'Low-income'; b. Occupational characteristics: occupational stressors called 'Excessive commitment to work' and 'Emotional demand of work': Excessive commitment to work was evaluated by the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , which is a version validated for use with the Brazilian population <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model and study hypotheses</head><p>A structural model of the determinants of suicidal ideation in workers was prepared (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The main hypothesis is that global dissatisfaction has a direct effect on suicidal ideation in workers, and is the mediator of the indirect effect of the other factors (gender, monthly income, participation in leisure activities, experiencing physical or emotional violence, and occupational stressors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data treatment and analysis</head><p>First, the data were organized on a database using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, version 24. The Stata software survey module, version 16.0, was then used, which considers weighting for complex samples, in order to process the descriptive analyses of the sociodemographic and occupational variables to characterize the workers, with estimates of absolute and relative frequencies, and the respective 95% con dence intervals (categorical variables), measures of central tendency, and dispersion (continuous variables). For the constituent variables of the structural variable, bivariate analysis was conducted through Pearson's chi-squared test, with Rao-Scott correction, with 5% statistical signi cance, to identify differences in proportions in relation to the outcome, and suicidal ideation.</p><p>The database was then exported to Mplus software, version 8.7, where structural equation modeling was processed, considering the complex sample structure.</p><p>First, measurement of the global dissatisfaction latent construct (measurement model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> was carried out, to conduct structural equation modeling. Evaluation of the factorial structure of the variables directly observed through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted for this purpose, where the number of factors extracted was determined by self-values ≥ 1 (Kaiser-Guttman criterion) <ref type="bibr">28</ref> . Then, the unidimensionality of the construct was evaluated through con rmatory factor analysis (CFA). The criterion to retain the item in the factor was presentation of a standardized factor loading ≥ 0.3 and residual variance ≤ 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</p><p>The structural model was formed by the global dissatisfaction latent variable (main exposure), the variables observed (gender, monthly income, participation in leisure activities, experience of physical or emotional violence, and occupational stress), and the suicidal ideation response variable, which was also directly observed. The standardized regression coe cients (β) and respective p values (statistical signi cance of 5%) were estimated through CFA. The direct, indirect, and total effects were classi ed for size as follows: small (approximately 0.10), average (approximately 0.30), and large (approximately 0.50, or more) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</p><p>The weighted least squares means and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator was used for the factor analyses. The modi cation indices (MI ≥ 10) and expected parameter changes (EPC ≥ 0,25) were inspected to verify the need to re-specify the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . To evaluate the model adjustment quality (measurement and structural), a normalized chi-squared (X 2 /degrees of freedom) of less than 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA &lt; 0.06, with the respective 90% con dence interval &lt; 0.08) (Brown, 2015), the comparative t index (CFI ≥ 0.95), and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI ≥ 0.95) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> were used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical and legal aspects</head><p>The  Source: Prepared by the authors. DISSAT: Global dissatisfaction.</p><p>A higher prevalence of suicidal ideation was observed in the strata of women (6.7%), those with a lowincome (6.1%), those who did not partake in leisure activities (7.9%), those who had an excessive commitment to work (7.7%), and those with a high emotional demand for work (8.1%). With regard to global dissatisfaction, there was a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation in workers dissatis ed with their capacity for work (7.6%), personal relations (18.0%), with themselves (15.0%), who had a poor quality of life (11.9%), and with their health self-reported as poor (9.5%) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). The global dissatisfaction (DISSAT) latent variable measurement model obtained indices of satisfactory adjustment (EFA: X 2 /gl = 1.5; RMSEA = 0.029, with CI90%=0.017-0.042; CFI = 0.989; TLI = 0.978; CFA: X 2 /gl = 1.5; RMSEA = 0.017, with CI90%=0.000-0.042; CFI = 0.989; TLI = 0.978 (data not presented in tables). The presence of only one self-value revealed the unidimensional structure of DISSAT (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>).</p><p>In EFA, all of the measurement model factorial loads were strong and statistically signi cant. The highest load was observed for the "dissatisfaction with oneself" (ICM) (λ = 0.877) indicator, and the lowest load was observed for "dissatisfaction with health" (ISAU) (λ = 0.420). In CFA, the loads remained strong and signi cant, with a greater effect of ICM (λ = 0.845) and lower effect of ISAU (λ = 0.372). Residual correlations were not suggested by the effect modi cation indices (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). In the structural model, the response variable was suicidal ideation and the explanatory variables were the DISSAT latent variable and variables taken in the study as observed: gender, low monthly income, absence of leisure activities, excessive commitment to work, and high emotional demand for work (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The structural model adjustment indices were satisfactory: X 2 /gl = 1.4; RMSEA = 0.015, with CI 90%=0.000-0.025; CFI = 0.955; TLI = 0.917 (data not presented in tables).</p><p>The factor that most contributed to suicidal ideation in workers was global dissatisfaction. A large direct effect of DISSAT (β = 0.72; p value = 0.001) and average emotional demand of work (β = 0.27; p value = 0.007) were identi ed. These results demonstrate that, in addition to global dissatisfaction, the high emotional demand of work directly increased the prevalence of suicidal ideation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In addition to the direct effects observed, speci c indirect effects were identi ed, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, and total effects were identi ed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>.</p><p>The paths that presented speci c indirect effects, signi cantly associated with suicidal ideation were as follows: a) women who did not participate in leisure activities (β = 0.24; p value = 0.001) had a higher level of global dissatisfaction (β = 0.27; p value &lt; 0.001), and a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation (β = 0.21; p value = 0.005); b) women with a low monthly income (β=-0.21; p value &lt; 0.001) had greater global dissatisfaction (β = 0.65; p value &lt; 0.001) and a greater prevalence of suicidal ideation; c) women with a high emotional demand for work (β = 0.15; p value = 0.042) presented a greater occurrence of suicidal ideation; and d) the direct effect of monthly income was not signi cant. However, it was con rmed that the lower the worker's monthly income, the higher the global dissatisfaction (β = 0.65; p value &lt; 0.001), and greater occurrence of suicidal ideation; e) a higher income was associated with the absence of leisure activities (β=-0.28; p value = 0.033), a higher level of global dissatisfaction, and higher prevalence of suicidal ideation; f) excessive commitment to work did not have a signi cant direct effect on suicidal ideation, but it was identi ed that its presence increased the emotional demand of work (β = 0.24; p value = 0.013), and prevalence of suicidal ideation; g) excessive commitment to work was associated with a higher level of global dissatisfaction (β = 0.45; p value &lt; 0.001); h) workers who did not participate in leisure activities had greater global dissatisfaction (β=-0.222; p value = 0.001), and a prevalence of suicidal ideation; and i) the absence of leisure activities did not present a direct effect with statistical signi cance. However, not participating in leisure activities was associated with greater global dissatisfaction (β = 0.27; p value &lt; 0.001), resulting in a higher occurrence of suicidal ideation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>In addition to the emotional demand of work, another indicator of occupational stress presented an effect on suicidal ideation. Excessive commitment to work, although not presenting a direct effect, presented a signi cant total effect (λ = 0.319; p value &lt; 0.001). There was also a signi cant total effect of a low monthly income (λ = 0.207; p value = 0.006) and a borderline effect for not participating in leisure activities (λ = 0.216; p value = 0.056), with an average effect. There was a small total effect of gender, with greater exposure among women (λ = 0.177; p value = 0.008) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>).</p><p>The following were highlighted for suicidal ideation, mediated by a higher level of global dissatisfaction in workers: a low monthly income (λ = 0.470; p value = 0.034) and excessive commitment to work (λ = 0.323; p value = 0.026). The magnitude of these effects was high for low-income, and average for excessive commitment to work, with a statistically signi cant association (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The study demonstrated these individuals' highest level of dissatisfaction and the emotional demand of work as the direct effects of suicidal ideation in workers.</p><p>It is fundamental to understand global dissatisfaction as the product of the life production model. Therefore, impressions are formed on work, capacity to work, social relations, quality of life, and selfunderstanding, in addition to perceptions of the physical and psychological body, which produce their health, meaning that chronic and limiting conditions are important indicators that form global (dis)satisfaction. There are a substantial number of characteristics and studies that have demonstrated the construction of this dimension, with a distinct but also coincidental genesis and paths, which are associated with suicidal ideation. In China, well-being is negatively associated with suicidal ideation, and actions that take this path form part of the structural scope to tackle the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</p><p>It is well known that the broad nature of the "DISSAT" construct traverses various issues that affect an individual and cause a level of suffering, such as anxiety, fear, and despair. Therefore, it is this mediating construct between events that produce situations that generate suffering and the established response (falling ill and death). A factor that illustrates this path, which frequently produces dissatisfaction with life, working conditions, and oneself, is the presence of long-term chronic diseases. These diseases are broadly associated with suicidal behavior in the world literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref> .</p><p>Generally, diseases are individual clinical expressions from the physiopathological point of view but must be understood as broader processes and collective expressions that occur for various reasons and produce known social impacts, such as fear and despair. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that produce global dissatisfaction involves circumstances such as these and others, which form the fabric in which daily life is established, placing the world of work among them.</p><p>Work is considered decisive in the health-disease process since its elements interact dynamically, and workers also require exibility in the sense of adapting to processes and workloads. The continuous process of having to adapt becomes a process that generates illness, the severity of which depends on the strength of the individual's, or work groups', physical and/or psychological resistance.</p><p>The study demonstrated the total effect of the emotional demand of work and the total indirect effect of excessive commitment to work, which are important occupational stressors, such as suicidal ideation.</p><p>Excessive commitment was mediated by global dissatisfaction, which assisted in understanding the phenomenon under study. These data present a path to be explored further, and should promote new discussions on the development of technologies to tackle this issue to be used by the Health Surveillance of Workers Department.</p><p>Emotional demand produced at work is an important occupational stressor that is considerably related to psychopathologies such as burnout syndrome and depression in workers and, as a consequence, suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38</ref> . The determining factors for high emotional demand include requirements for contact at work, involving pressure, gender differences, the nature of the work to be carried out, quality of social support at work, and productivity demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38</ref> . Emotional violence adversely features as a powerful determinant of the emotional demand of work and is a factor strongly associated with suicidal behavior in general. Coupled with the absence of social support in the family and/or at work, emotional demand maximizes the effects of feelings of inadequacy, which may produce suicidal behavior.</p><p>Another dimension of occupational stressors relates to the need for reciprocal exchanges in professional relations, and its imbalance lends to suffering; in other words, when effort at work is greater than the compensation received for it, sickness erupts. In this context, Siegrist 39 also indicates a third dimension:</p><p>excessive commitment to work, closely related to effort, which has the objective of achieving professional self-esteem and recognition or approval by bosses and peers. Excessive commitment to work presented the greatest total effect with suicidal ideation and a speci c indirect effect, mediated by dissatisfaction, in this study. This nding is widely supported in international publications. Large-scale effort was a predictive factor for suicidal ideation in Chinese production workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . In other Chinese research, the average effort score, associated with excessive commitment and little reward, was related to suicidal ideation in 2,216 workers 8 .</p><p>Understanding the health/disease at work process requires further research into gender differences and their in uence on becoming ill. In this study, being female presented a total effect and was also indirectly associated with suicidal ideation. The indirect effects among women were mediated in three ways: (a)</p><p>not participating in leisure activities, producing greater dissatisfaction and suicidal ideation; (b) women with a low income, producing greater dissatisfaction and suicidal ideation; and (c) a high emotional demand at work and suicidal ideation. In research with over 20,000 French workers, the gender difference was highlighted, indicating that females were more vulnerable to suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Gender differences were demonstrated in research in China with over 2,000 workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . In other research in this country associating family and work stress with being a woman, the chances of suicidal ideation increased ve times, demonstrating that the overload of housework for women remains an important factor and deserves greater attention when added to formal labor circumstances <ref type="bibr">16</ref> .</p><p>High stress at work was associated with work and family con icts, maximizing suicidal ideation in women <ref type="bibr">16</ref> . Leisure activities were shown to be important protective measures for suicidal ideation that were more prevalent in women. Not participating in leisure activities was associated with greater occupational stress, greater personal dissatisfaction, and suicidal ideation. In China, reduced recreation was associated with suicidal ideation in petroleum industry workers 6 . Kuhn and Flanagan <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> indicate that women are more vulnerable to experiencing emotional exhaustion at work, presenting signals of depersonalization, cynicism, and lower achievement. Understanding gender differences in formal labor is important, exed to everyday female lives with a double/triple workload. A society that conditions women to the unequal struggle for better working conditions, access to income, and greater recognition also demands from them the tasks imposed by a chauvinistic and sexist society, materialized in housework and care for the family. This condition re ects activities to protect against mental illness, such as participating in leisure activities and personal attention to health and self-esteem.</p><p>Among the ndings of this study, low income was associated with suicidal ideation, mediated by global dissatisfaction. A number of studies have demonstrated this association in wealthy and developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> . In research conducted in fty-nine developing countries, with approximately 230,000 people, the African region presented the highest prevalence of suicidal ideation and contemplating suicide, with low and average income strongly associated with the outcome studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</p><p>Economic losses and debts are conditions associated with suicide, as shown in studies by Pereira et al. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> , Okuyama et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , and Neves <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . Brazilian police o cers who died through suicide also had debt and/or commitment to nancial loans as a highly prevalent characteristic <ref type="bibr">2</ref> . In traditional cultures of rural workers, economic failure and non payment of debts may determine self-extermination <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . The same reason was put forward in another study on rural workers, which added emotional and family problems as triggers for suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Although the study did not evaluate this phenomenon, strati ed by types of work, it is important to highlight that it is a social problem, historically determined for Brazilian workers in the countryside, as Neves <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> explains, and re ects a model of exploitation and expropriation, which has an impact on understanding the phenomenon in all spheres of work.</p><p>This study also identi ed that workers with a high income presented an association with a lack of leisure activities, greater personal dissatisfaction and suicidal ideation, suggesting the power that dissatisfaction exercises over the outcome, and the possibility that excessively committed workers, in the search for a better income, overlook time for leisure, implicating global dissatisfaction, psychological suffering, and suicidal ideation.</p><p>In any event, these situations suggest the need for efforts to understand these stressors as factors that together maximize the intensity of suicidal ideation. Social support at work, fair demands, and violence prevention systems (particularly in sexist environments) are some of the factors that emerged in this study and have also been identi ed in international research <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . We also highlight that, in Brazil, the reduction of structures to protect workers who have increasingly had their relationships weakened, salaries reduced, experienced internal pressure for quality and productivity and, externally, unemployment and social abandonment, both institutionally and by the state (felt in Brazil via labor and social welfare reforms, and proposals for administrative reform), although this is not an exclusively Brazilian reality. In China, the indices of suicidal ideation in petroleum industry workers have increased, coinciding with a reduction in resources previously allocated to workers' internal protective structure 6 . In South Korea, following privatization of a state-owned company, bene ts such as medical insurance and pensions were cut, and occupational health and health surveillance sectors dissolved. These workers demonstrated a signi cant increase in suicidal ideation and behavior. In Brazil, in a cohort of 100 million low-income Brazilians, direct access to income distribution policies (Bolsa Família cash transfer program) has reduced the risk of suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</p><p>The life production model, centered on impositions rei ed in the modernization of relations that perpetuate forms of producing added value, produces events that were called "Suicidation" ('Suicidamento' -neologism, in Portuguese, to represent that the worker is compelled to die) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> and "Deaths of Despair" 46 . These terms characterize contemporary suicide, not as a traditionally subjective and individual process but as a product of a way of living and (re)producing life, in which a worker is forced into such a situation that self-extermination becomes a considered alternative and, in some cases, is effectively executed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">46</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study limitations</head><p>Due to its complex nature, and the stigmas that its assumption materializes, suicidal ideation's frequency may be underestimated, indicating that tracking and recording require formats that are more sensitive to the problem. In this research, it is assumed that this di culty also occurred since the outcome was directly estimated. In addition, a cross-sectional design does not allow causal inferences due to the nature of the study, which does not consider temporality among the variables. Further studies with methodological designs that consider these criteria, in addition to instruments to track suicidal ideation and considering the complex nature of evaluating this outcome, are fundamental for a more detailed evaluation of the phenomenon and to guarantee the visibility it requires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We identi ed that a high emotional demand at work and global dissatisfaction, a latent construct that involves dissatisfaction with capacity for work, social relations, quality of life, health and dissatisfaction with oneself, directly impacts suicidal ideation. Excessive commitment to work and emotional demands form important occupational stressors, which explain the desire to kill oneself. Higher levels of global dissatisfaction presented signi cant direct effects of suicidal ideation in workers. The explanatory model identi ed, in addition to occupational stressors, also presents gender differences, mediated by the absence of leisure activities, a low monthly income, and global dissatisfaction, widely supported in international literature, when associated with outcomes that represent mental suffering.</p><p>A low monthly income, high level of occupational stress, and not participating in leisure activities presented signi cant indirect effects, demonstrating that global dissatisfaction, which has occupational stressors as a component, since it concerns the working population, is an important mediator of the relations between the determining factors of suicidal ideation. Understanding suicide at work requires understanding that this phenomenon occurs in the most varied means of production and is not exclusively attributed to a speci c condition. There is a complex, emergency situation, with regards to (re)engineering production methods and collective (re)positioning, established due to the aims of its actors, in the construction of work.</p><p>Understanding suicidal ideation in groups of workers is a task that requires signi cant effort, since due to the stigmatizing nature crystallized in (non) recognition of workers' problems, its invisibility has repercussions both in statistics and policies to address the issue and the transforming actions required in the world of work, which remain in the early stages. Signals of suicidal behavior at work call for additional space with regard to monitoring and interventional planning in these environments.
