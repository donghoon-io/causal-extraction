<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Illicit drug and heavy alcohol use is more common among sexual minorities compared with heterosexuals. This difference has sometimes been attributed to more tolerant substance use norms within the gay community, although evidence is sparse. The current study investigated the role of perceived drug availability and tolerant injunctive norms in mediating the linkage between minority sexual orientation status and higher rates of prior-year substance use. Method: We used data from the second California Quality of Life Survey (Cal-QOL II), a followback telephone survey in 2008-2009 of individuals fi rst interviewed in the population-based 2007 California Health Interview Survey. The sample comprised 2,671 individuals, oversampled for minority sexual orientation. Respondents were administered a structured interview assessing past-year alcohol and illicit drug use, perceptions of perceived illicit drug availability, and injunctive norms concerning illicit drug and heavier alcohol use. We used structural equation modeling methods to test a mediational model linking sexual orientation and substance use behaviors via perceptions of drug availability and social norms pertaining to substance use. Results: Compared with heterosexual individuals, sexual minorities reported higher levels of substance use, perceived drug availability, and tolerant social norms. A successfully fi tting model suggests that much of the association between minority sexual orientation and substance use is mediated by these sexual orientation-related differences in drug availability perceptions and tolerant norms for substance use. Conclusions: Social environmental context, including subcultural norms and perceived drug availability, is an important factor infl uencing substance use among sexual minorities and should be addressed in community interventions.

Several population-based studies have reported higher rates of illicit drug and alcohol use and problem drinking among homosexually active women compared with exclusively heterosexual women, even after controlling for differences in sociodemographic characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burgard et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cochran et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cochran et al., , 2004;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Drabble et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gruskin et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hughes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McCabe et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">McLaughlin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Talley et al., 2011)</ref>. Further, a population-based survey of women ages 18-29 in low-income neighborhoods in northern California found that women who reported having both male and female sexual partners had signifi cantly higher rates of injection drug use compared with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Scheer et al., 2002)</ref>. Similarly, studies conducted with men who have sex with men have observed elevated rates of substance use disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cochran et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McCabe et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Talley et al., 2011)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Stall and colleagues (2001)</ref> found that men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual identifi ed men, recruited from four urban areas nationally, had elevated levels of alcohol-related problems and recreational drug use when compared with national rates found among men in general.</p><p>Several explanations have been posited for these sexual orientation-related differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cochran, 2001)</ref>. Most often these disparities are attributed to a greater probability for exposure to antigay stigma and discrimination, both in childhood and as adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hamilton and Mahalik, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hughes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mays and Cochran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Stall et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wilsnack and Wilsnack, 1995)</ref>. Known as the "minority stress hypothesis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Meyer, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Stall et al., 2003)</ref>, this perspective asserts that the higher rates of dysfunctional alcohol and illicit drug use found among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals are a direct or indirect consequence of social disadvantage.</p><p>However, there may be additional reasons for these differences. Elsewhere, studies have demonstrated consistent evidence of neighborhood and community infl uence on substance use behaviors and attitudes. For example, there is a positive relationship between neighborhood alcohol outlet density and social norms regarding alcohol use, as well as rates of alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Scribner et al., 2000)</ref>. In this regard, the social organization of a visible gay and lesbian community, traditionally centered on "gay bars" and social outlets, may encourage the use of alcohol and illicit drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Green and Feinstein, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Simon Rosser et al., 2008)</ref>. The effect may be to create a climate of tolerant injunctive social norms surrounding substance use in which illicit drugs are, in turn, more readily available. Injunctive norms refer to people's perceptions that the behaviors in question are either socially approved or disapproved <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schultz et al., 2007)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr">Stall and colleagues (2003)</ref> have underscored that illicit substance use is woven into a pattern of socializing and sexual practices among young gay and bisexual men living in an urban gay male culture, implying a milieu in which substance use is seen as normative.</p><p>Consistent with this view, some types of drug use have become essentially institutionalized within "gay culture," including use of inhalants ("poppers"), "club drugs," and methamphetamines, all of which are also associated with high-risk sexual behavior among men who have sex with men <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ober et al, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ostrow et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Trocki and colleagues (2005)</ref> observed that women who reported histories of same-gender sexual partners spent more time in bars and party settings than exclusively heterosexual women and that sexual minority women also consumed more alcohol in these settings. However, the same study also found contradictory evidence with regard to men. Specifi cally, rates of heavy drinking among men did not vary by sexual orientation across settings, even though gay men spent more time in bars than bisexual and heterosexual men did. Some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cochran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Green and Feinstein, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McKirnan and Peterson, 1989)</ref> have speculated that tolerant norms regarding drug use are endemic among sexual orientation minorities, particularly among those living in areas of higher gay density. In one study of more than 700 gay men living in New York City, men with more "gay-centric" networks had higher rates of substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carpiano et al., 2011)</ref>. Another study of gay men who had moved to a gay resort area in South Florida found that those who had lived in the area for 1 year or longer had higher levels of risky behaviors and more drug-using friends compared with newer arrivals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Egan et al., 2011)</ref>. Thus, adoption of gay identity and acculturation within a gay-identifi ed community may increase one's exposure to more tolerant social norms regarding drug use. Further, these tolerant norms may be especially infl uential for individuals who are more vulnerable to the effects of stress, such as from genetic disposition, high rates of cumulative exposure to stressors, or lack of adaptive coping skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cicchetti et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heffernan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kendler et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">McKirnan and</ref><ref type="bibr">Peterson, 1988, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the nature of the relationships among sexual orientation, perceived availability of illicit drugs, and tolerant injunctive social norms regarding substance use. To do so, we used data available from the second California Quality of Life Survey (Cal-QOL II). We hypothesized that the frequently observed association between minority sexual orientation and higher rates of substance use is, at least in part, mediated by both higher rates of perceived drug availability and more tolerant injunctive social norms regarding substance use among sexual minorities compared with their heterosexual counterparts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Participants in Cal-QOL II were drawn from 5,000 eligible persons systematically selected from nearly 49,000 adult respondents in the population-based 2007 California Health Interview <ref type="bibr">Survey (CHIS;</ref><ref type="bibr">CHIS, 2009)</ref>. Both surveys were structured telephone interviews. The parent random-digitdial CHIS survey received approval from three entities: the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Institutional Review Board; the California Health and Human Services Agency; and the Westat Institutional Review Board. All participants provided anonymous responses. Cal-QOL II eligibility comprised the following: 18-70 years of age at the time of the CHIS interview (the group eligible for CHIS sexual orientation assessment), interviewed in English or Spanish (98% of CHIS interviewees), and agreement to be recontacted for future health surveys (91% of language-eligible respondents). From this list, we divided the sampling frame into two strata. One stratum, selected with certainty, included all who reported in CHIS a lesbian, gay, or bisexual identity and/or a same-gender sexual partner in the year before the interview (n = 1,387). From the second stratum, we selected 3,613 individuals proportional to their representation in the California population, except for oversampling African Americans. Permission to interview these individuals received approval from the CHIS Data Disclosure Review Committee and the UCLA and Westat Institutional Review Boards.</p><p>The 2007 CHIS response rate was 21.1%, consistent with other recent random-digit-dial telephone interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burgard et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Simon et al., 2001)</ref> including the 2007 California Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (18.7%) <ref type="bibr">(CHIS, 2009)</ref>. Of the 5,000 potential respondents, 65 were deemed ineligible (e.g., moved out of California, deceased). However, 2,815 were successfully interviewed between August 2008 and January 2009 in either English or Spanish for a Cal-QOL II-specifi c response rate of 57%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>We excluded 144 of the 2,815 Cal-QOL II respondents who were administered a shortened interview as part of an embedded refusal conversion experiment; this shortened instrument omitted norm-related questions. Thus, our fi nal sample size was 2,671. The mean age of the unweighted sample was 46.5 years (SD = 13.6 years). Approximately 51% of participants were female. Respondents reported diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds including 545 Hispanics and, among non-Hispanics, 1,539 Whites, 398 African Americans, 157 Asian Americans, and 32 American Indian/ Alaskan Natives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interview</head><p>Respondents were administered a fully structured, computer-assisted telephone interview by extensively trained lay interviewers. Assessments included the following:</p><p>Sexual orientation. Individuals were asked the genders of their sexual partners since age 18 and in the year before the interview. Next, they were asked whether they considered themselves heterosexual or straight, lesbian (for women) or gay, or bisexual. We used this information to categorize respondents into one of two groups: exclusively heterosexual (heterosexual identity and only differentgender sexual partners, if any, since age 18 reported; n = 1,877) and sexual orientation minority (lesbian, gay, or bisexual identity [n = 719] or a history of same-gender sexual partners since age 18 <ref type="bibr">[n = 75]</ref>). Finally, to assess sexual orientation-related discrimination, respondents were asked, "Sometimes people are treated badly or unfairly because of their sexual orientation. How often has that happened to you?" Answer options included 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, and 4 = often.</p><p>Substance use. Respondents answered questions about their alcohol and drug use in the 12 months before the interview. Those who reported consuming fi ve or more alcoholic drinks in a single drinking occasion on a weekly basis were coded as heavier drinkers. Individuals were also queried about past-year use of marijuana or hashish and 10 other classes of drugs. Six of these were illicit drugs: cocaine or crack, methamphetamine, heroin, hallucinogens, synthetic or club drugs, and inhalants. Four included drugs available by prescription (analgesics, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives) but specifi ed in the interview as being used either without prescription or in greater amounts than prescribed. From this, we coded two variables: past-year use of marijuana specifi cally (yes/no) and past-year illicit use of any other drug (yes/no).</p><p>Perceived drug availability. The survey included three questions drawn from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Offi ce of Applied Studies, 2008) as-sessing perceived drug availability. Specifi cally, respondents were asked, "How diffi cult or easy would it be for you to get some (specifi ed drug), if you wanted some?" The three specifi ed drugs were marijuana; cocaine; and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), crystal methamphetamine ("crystal meth"), or other hallucinogens. Answers were given on a 5-point scale: 1 = probably impossible, 2 = very diffi cult, 3 = fairly diffi cult, 4 = fairly easy, and 5 = very easy.</p><p>Injunctive norms. Four questions assessed injunctive norms pertaining to heavy drinking and illicit drug use. These questions were adapted from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Offi ce of Applied <ref type="bibr">Studies, 2008)</ref>. Specifi cally, respondents were asked, (a) "How do you feel about someone your age having four or fi ve drinks of an alcoholic beverage nearly every day?" (b) "How do you feel about adults trying marijuana or hashish once or twice?" (c) "How do you feel about adults trying cocaine?" and (d) "How do you feel about adults trying LSD, crystal meth, or other hallucinogenic drugs?" Responses were recorded on a 3-point scale: 1 = strongly disapprove, 2 = somewhat disapprove, or 3 = neither approve nor disapprove.</p><p>Personal demographics. The interview also assessed respondents' age, gender, educational attainment, race/ ethnicity, relationship status, and urban residency. We coded age into fi ve categories (18-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, and 60-72 years), educational attainment into fi ve categories (less than high school, high school degree, some college, college degree, and graduate education), race/ ethnicity into two categories (non-Hispanic White, racial/ ethnic minority), relationship status into two groups (married or cohabiting, other), and urban residency into two classifications (lives in urban metropolitan statistical area, other).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Data were analyzed using SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and MPlus <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Muthén and Muthén, 2007)</ref> using weights to adjust for selection probability and survey nonresponse. In the fi rst group of analyses, we used Wald chi-square tests to evaluate anticipated sexual orientation-related differences in demographic characteristics and frequency of sexual orientation-related maltreatment. Both demographic characteristics (gender, age, race/ ethnicity, educational attainment, relationship status, and residency location) and perceived maltreatment were then treated as possible study confounders because of previous research suggesting their association both with alcohol and drug use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brady and Randall, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Johnson and Gerstein, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mays and Cochran, 2001</ref>) and sexual orientation in population-based surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cochran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cochran et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gilman et al., 2001)</ref> similar to the Cal-QOL II. We also evaluated sexual orientation-related differences in the individual indicators of perceived availability of illicit drugs, tolerant injunctive norms, and substance use using either Wald F tests or Wald chi-square tests, as appropriate.</p><p>Next, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) methods with weighted least squares (WLS) estimators to build and test both fi t and parameters of three possible mediational models linking sexual orientation to substance use patterns (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In the general model, the predictive association between sexual orientation and substance use was hypothesized to result from both direct and indirect pathways via perceived drug availability and tolerant injunctive norms. As an initial step, we fi rst investigated, independently, the fi t of three measurement models indexing the hypothesized latent constructs of drug availability, tolerant substance use norms, and substance use behaviors. After obtaining assurance that these models had satisfactory properties, we then investigated bivariate associations (polychoric correlations) between the three latent variables and both sexual orientation and possible confounders. Statistical testing was accomplished by use of the critical ratio (CR) test (estimate / SE), which has an approximate Gaussian distribution. Those variables evidencing an association consistent with p &lt; .20 with a particular latent variable were retained for the subsequent modeling steps.</p><p>Finally, we estimated the fi t of three variants of structural relationships between sexual orientation status and the latent construct of substance use. In the fi rst model, we evaluated a mediational model where drug availability alone is the link between sexual orientation and substance use. In the second model, we hypothesized that injunctive norms alone mediate the link between sexual orientation and substance use. Moreover, in the third model, we hypothesized that both factors function as conjoint mediators. In all model testing steps, models were evaluated for fi t, or their ability to capture the covariance structure of the data, using three fi t indices: the comparative fi t index (CFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bentler, 1990)</ref>, the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown, 2006)</ref>, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Steiger, 1990)</ref>. CFI and TLI values above .95 and RMSEA values below .05 are consistent with a good fi tting model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. We also report the model chi-square statistic. Although a nonsignifi cant chi-square is also consistent with model fi t, this statistic is particularly sensitive to small departures from expected values in large sample sizes, such as the one used in the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. Tests of structural parameters, including a comparison of mediation effects between perceived drug availability and tolerant injunctive norms, were conducted using CR tests. We also estimate meditation ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ditlevsen et al., 2005)</ref> for structural relationships testing mediational hypotheses. The mediation ratio (MR) is the ratio of estimated indirect effects to the sum of estimated direct and indirect effects, or the total effect. This ratio represents the percentage change in regression coeffi cients when a hypothesized mediating variable is included in the model. Signifi cance of all tests, other than adequacy of model fi t, was evaluated at p &lt; .05. All reported confi dence intervals (CIs) are at 95%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background differences by sexual orientation</head><p>Approximately 4.5% (CI [3.9, 5.3]) of the weighted respondents reported any markers of minority sexual orientation, including identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (2.4%, CI [2.2, 2.8%]) or indicating a positive adult history of same-gender sexual partners (2.1%, CI [1.5, 2.8%]). As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, sexual minorities were generally older, χ 2 (4) = 5.52, p &lt; .001, and more educated, χ 2 (4) = 6.41, p &lt; .001; were less likely to be married or cohabitating, χ 2 (1) = 14.06, p &lt; .001; and were more likely to be non-Hispanic White, χ 2 (1) = 42.10, p &lt; .001. As expected, compared with heterosexuals, sexual minorities also reported more frequent experiences with being treated badly or unfairly because of their sexual orientation, χ 2 (3) = 54.56, p &lt; .001.</p><p>Rates of substance use differed by sexual orientation in the expected directions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Overall, sexual minorities were signifi cantly more likely than exclusively heterosexual persons to report having used marijuana, χ 2 (1) = 18.67, p &lt; .001, or other illicit drugs, χ 2 (1) = 10.47, p = .001, and showed a trend to report greater prevalence of weekly heavier drinking, χ 2 (1) = 2.83, p = .09. Perceived illicit drug availability was also greater among sexual minorities, including reporting signifi cantly greater ease of obtaining marijuana, Wald F(1) = 27.30, p &lt; .001, or hallucinogenic drugs, Wald F(1) = 7.06, p &lt; .01, but not cocaine, Wald F(1) = 1.02, p = .31. Compared with exclusively heterosexual persons, sexual minorities also evidenced signifi cantly more tolerant injunctive norms concerning adults trying marijuana, Wald F(1) = 87.09, p &lt; .001; trying cocaine, Wald F(1) = 41.32, p &lt; .001; trying hallucinogenic drugs, Wald F(1) = 29.05, p &lt; .001; or engaging in daily heavy consumption of alcohol, Wald F(1) = 13.40, p &lt; .001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of latent variables</head><p>We next investigated the fi t of the three measurement models depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> by evaluating associations among the indicators of hypothesized latent variables. The polychoric correlation matrix is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Overall, there were strong and signifi cant correlations among the perceptions of drug availability and among norms related to heavy alcohol and drug use, with the strongest associations between cocaine and hallucinogens. Past-year marijuana use was positively associated with perceptions of greater availability of marijuana, cocaine, and hallucinogens; past-year other illicit drug use was associated with past-year marijuana use. Past-year weekly heavy episodic drinking was associated with perceived tolerant norms regarding heavy drinking as well as past-year use of marijuana and other illicit drugs.</p><p>In the initial modeling step, we evaluated the adequacy of our three measurement models embedded in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. First, we hypothesized a single latent factor (drug availability) indexing the three measured indicators of perceived ease of obtaining marijuana, cocaine, or hallucinogenic drugs. This model had adequate fi t to the data, χ 2 (1) = 15.197, p &lt; .001 (CFI = 1.00; TLI = 1.00; RMSEA = .073). All estimated factor loadings were strongly positive (availability of cocaine loading fi xed at 1.0; marijuana: 0.79, SE = 0.01; hallucino-gens: 0.86, SE = 0.01). Next, we investigated the fi t of the model indexing a latent factor of tolerant injunctive norms for substance use. Four measured indicators were used to defi ne the factor; all were strong predictors of the construct (approval or disapproval of cocaine fi xed at 1.0; hallucinogens: 0.91, SE = 0.01; marijuana: 0.78, SE = 0.02; alcohol: 0.53, SE = 0.02). This model demonstrated an excellent fi t to the covariance structure, χ 2 (2) = 18.98, p &lt; .001 (CFI = 1.00; TLI = 1.00; RMSEA = .045). Finally, three indicators of substance use (past-year use of marijuana, past-year illicit use of other drugs, and heavier drinking with at least weekly frequency on average) successfully defi ned the third latent factor refl ecting past-year substance use, χ 2 (1) = 1.24, p = .266 (CFI = 1.00; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .009). All indicators again were strongly related to the latent construct (marijuana Having established the validity of the latent variables, we then evaluated their bivariate associations with sexual orientation and the seven potentially confounding demographic and maltreatment characteristics. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, sexual orientation was signifi cantly associated with all three latent constructs. Perceived drug availability was signifi cantly associated with most demographic characteristics with the exception of ethnic/racial minority status and urban residence. Specifi cally, younger individuals, men, persons with less education, and single persons were signifi cantly more likely to report greater availability of illicit drugs. Tolerant norms for substance use were positively and signifi cantly associated with being male, being non-Hispanic White, and possessing higher levels of education. Finally, the latent construct of substance use was signifi cantly associated with being younger, male, and non-Hispanic White; possessing lower levels of education; being single; and living in an urban environment. Frequency of sexual orientation-related maltreatment was not strongly related to any of the three latent constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of mediational models</head><p>We then explicitly evaluated three variants of the model depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> while adjusting for possible confounding because of retained demographic and sexual orientationrelated maltreatment measures (not shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The fi rst variant hypothesized that sexual orientation is linked to substance use through direct structural linkage and via an indirect pathway mediated by perceived drug availability. This model was a good fi t to the covariance structure of sample data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Parameter estimates are consistent with a model in which perceived drug availability partially, but not fully, mediates associations between sexual orientation and substance use. Indeed, results suggest that the ratio of mediated effects via perceptions of drug availability to total sexual orientation-related effects (MR = 0.12, CI [0.02, 0.22]) is relatively modest.</p><p>In the second variant of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we hypothesized a structural model where the link between sexual orientation and substance use is mediated solely by differences in tolerant injunctive norms. This model, too, proved to be a good fi t to the covariance structure of the data as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. Both sexual orientation and tolerant injunctive norms were signifi cant predictors of substance use. The ratio of estimated indirect effects mediated by injunctive norms to the sexual orientation-related total effects (MR = 0.39, CI [0.18, 0.61]) was considerably larger than that observed in the previous model.</p><p>Finally, we fi t a third structural model in which both perceived drug availability and tolerant norms were hypothesized as correlated mediators of sexual orientationrelated differences in substance use. This fi nal model also proved to be an excellent fi t to the covariance structure of the data as reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. Estimates of indirect effects linking sexual orientation and substance use via mediation by perceptions of drug availability (b = 0.06, SE = 0.02) were signifi cantly weaker than similar indirect effects estimated via the effects of injunctive norms (b = 0.24, SE = 0.05; CR = -3.57, p &lt; .001). Refl ecting this, the mediation ratio associated with drug availability (MR = 0.12, CI [0.01, 0.24]) was smaller than that estimated for injunctive norms (MR = 0.38, CI [0.18, 0.58]). Overall, the combined effect of the two latent factors-drug availability and tolerant norms-was associated with a mediation ratio of 0.43 <ref type="bibr">(CI [0.22,</ref><ref type="bibr">0.64]</ref>). </p></div>

According to this view, greater exposure to discrimination results in higher rates of stress-related mental distress, and this, in turn, encourages substance use as a coping behavior. In support of this explanation, multiple studies have demonstrated that exposure to stress and trauma is associated with mental disorders, substance use, and treatment seeking among individuals in general as well as among sexual minorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Frisell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hatzenbuehler et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hughes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Keyes et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Marshal et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mays and Cochran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">McLaughlin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Talley et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>As did others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Green and Feinstein, 2011)</ref>, we observed a greater risk for illicit drug use and heavier drinking among sexual minorities when compared with exclusively heterosexuals. However, our results suggest that additional social factors, as well as minority stress, may warrant closer inspection. In particular, we demonstrated that individuals with minority sexual orientation report both more tolerant norms about substance use and greater availability of illicit drugs. Further, these two factors appear to mediate a substantial portion of the relationship between minority sexual orientation and substance use patterns. Our fi ndings underscore the possible role of the socioenvironmental context in both facilitating and maintaining greater risk for substance use morbidity in this population. Importantly, the mediational effects of tolerant norms and drug availability were largely independent of each other, as seen in the stability of the effects attributable to these factors when entered independently (Models 1 and 2) and simultaneously (Model 3), although drug norms accounted for a larger share of the mediation effect. Further, sexual orientation-related differences were robust even after adjusting for reported frequency of sexual orientation maltreatment.</p><p>The source of these differences may lie in the socialization of sexual minority persons. Some have hypothesized that the clustering of individuals with minority sexual orientation (i.e., "gay ghettos") is comparable to ethnic communities, with shared norms, values, and resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(LeVay and Nonas, 1995)</ref>. This hypothesis has been dubbed the "gay neighborhood drug subculture hypothesis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Carpiano et al., 2011)</ref>. Sexual minorities may seek out neighborhoods that are perceived to be more tolerant of behaviors traditionally deemed as deviant, including homosexuality, drug use, and commercialized sex work. Urban geographers have examined the emergence of lesbian and gay urban areas, which historically have served as a destination for young people seeking to come out. Such areas afford a sense of community, identity, and shared values, in contrast to the marginalization many may have experienced in their home communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Valentine and Skelton, 2003)</ref>. Within this context, substance use may be integral to promoting social connectedness as part of a younger "lesbian and gay scene" that is often centered in clubs and bars <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Valentine and Skelton, 2003)</ref> and "sexualized social contexts" such as sex clubs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Garofalo et al., 2007)</ref>. In that regard, a recent study found that alcohol use among lesbian/bisexual college students, compared with heterosexual women, was more strongly infl uenced by desires to get in with a preferred group, although this same effect was not present among men <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Talley et al., 2012)</ref>. It is also possible that tolerant substance use norms are simply part of a cluster of more liberal attitudes about a broad range of social issues that are characteristic of this subpopulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Herek et al., 2010)</ref>. Either way, our results hint that the relationships among minority sexual orientation, tolerant drug norms, and greater drug availability may be mutually reinforcing, leading to higher levels of substance misuse across the life span.</p><p>Several study limitations warrant consideration. First, the latent construct of "substance use" combined indicators of illicit drug use and alcohol consumption. Therefore, we could not discern relationships of specifi c types of substance use with the precursor variables. However, we note that correlations among illicit drug, marijuana, and heavier alcohol use were strong. Second, our limited measurement of sexual orientation-related discrimination may have underestimated the effects of discrimination. Thus, our fi ndings should not be interpreted as a test of the comparative strength of the minority stress hypothesis versus a socioenvironmental one. Third, it is likely that there are differences among those classifi ed as sexual minorities. Sample size limitations precluded considering this issue within the SEM approach used. Research elsewhere has documented that bisexual women and homosexually experienced men who do not self-identify as gay/bisexual are especially likely to be at increased risk for substance use morbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cochran and Mays, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McCabe et al., 2009)</ref>. It may also be true that behaviors in these two groups are under less normative control by the gay community. Thus, determinants of use may vary across sexual minority subpopulations. In a similar vein, sample size precluded investigation of possible race/ ethnicity differences in the fi t and functioning of the SEM models raising similar concerns. Finally, like other cross-sectional telephone surveys, the Cal-QOL II survey shares common limitations typical of such designs, including the inability to test truly causal hypotheses and the possible introduction of bias through loss to followback. Despite these concerns, the robust fi ndings reported here suggest strongly that two factors-perceived drug availability and tolerant substance use norms-contribute to sexual orientation-related disparities in substance use. This has direct and translatable implications for community-level interventions targeting reductions in substance use. Previous work has found that although changing social norms at a community level is diffi cult, once accomplished these changes are particularly sustainable <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Latkin et al., 2003)</ref>. For example, anti-smoking campaigns and legislation in the United States have greatly reduced smoking rates on a broad level <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Middlestadt et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Zhu et al., 2007)</ref>. In addition, interventions to reduce drinking and/or alter patterns of substance use have directly targeted changing social norms with some success <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(LaBrie et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Latkin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Moreira et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Neighbors et al., 2010)</ref>. Further, norm-related interventions are known to be effective within the visible gay community <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kelly, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kelly, , 2004;;</ref><ref type="bibr">NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial Group, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Going forward, campaigns to change levels of social approval of illicit drug use and heavy alcohol consumption may serve to reduce the burden of substance use in this population. In crafting these efforts, it is essential to address the ways in which individual characteristics may shape normative infl uences. Like other populations, characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity/race, and social disadvantages linked to poverty and geographic location may have relevance here, creating multiple, complex, and sometimes confl icting social and behavioral norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Latkin et al., 2003)</ref>. But, in addition, individuals with minority sexual orientation are a particularly diverse group where only some are reachable through campaigns targeting the visible lesbian and gay community. Advocates for sexual minority health have long argued for the need for culturally competent interventions incorporating the unique aspects of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender identity and community into the content of intervention materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mayer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Shoptaw and Reback, 2007)</ref>.
