<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Work engagement, professional quality of life (ProQOL), and intent to leave (ITL) significantly impact organizational behaviors and outcomes. Understanding the complex interrelationships among nurse work engagement, ProQOL, and ITL is essential for improving nurse retention, job satisfaction, and patient outcomes. In previous investigations, work engagement, ProQOL, and ITL relationships have primarily been analyzed individually. A more integrated approach is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of these factors in the nursing profession.</p><p>Purpose: This study was designed to evaluate the interrelationships among work engagement, ProQOL (compassion satisfaction [CS], burnout, and secondary traumatic stress [STS]), and ITL in nurses using structural equation modeling path analysis.</p><p>Methods: This was a quantitative descriptive study. Data were collected from registered nurses in the United States (n = 900) using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the ProQOL-5 (CS, burnout, and STS), and a demographics datasheet (including a one-item ITL question). The proposed theoretical model, incorporating major constructs, was tested using structural equation modeling.</p><p>Results: Level of work engagement in nurses impacts ITL through ProQOL. Among the mediating variables, burnout (0.31) had the largest total effect on ITL, followed by STS (0.12) and CS (-0.12). Burnout and STS were found to correlate with ITL directly, whereas CS was found to correlate with ITL indirectly.</p><p>Conclusions: Promoting work engagement, addressing burnout and STS, and fostering CS can positively influence nurse retention and job satisfaction, ultimately improving patient care quality. Healthcare leaders and policymakers should implement strategies to enhance nurse engagement, reduce burnout, and cultivate compassion satisfaction to increase nurse retention and improve organizational outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Work engagement, professional quality of life (ProQOL), and intent to leave are factors known to significantly affect organizational behaviors and outcomes. Work engagement refers to a positive state of mind characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption in one's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bakker, 2022)</ref>. When employees are engaged in their work, they tend to exhibit high energy, enthusiasm, and a sense of purpose, which may contribute to better productivity and organizational success. On the other hand, employees who are disengaged in their work may exhibit emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion; pessimism; and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Maslach &amp; Leiter, 2021)</ref>. ProQOL comprises compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. Compassion satisfaction refers to the pleasure one attains from doing one's work well, burnout denotes the feelings of hopelessness and inadequacies in doing one's job effectively, and secondary traumatic stress describes the symptoms associated with exposure to traumatically stressful events <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bahari et al., 2022)</ref>. Another phenomenon affecting organizational outcomes is employee intent to leave or voluntary turnover (i.e., employees leaving their workplace or organization voluntarily), which negatively impacts personal productivity as well as organizational customer satisfaction and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Treglown et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In nursing, the relationships among these concepts can significantly impact the performance and health outcomes of healthcare organizations. As frontline healthcare providers, nurses are critical to an organization's ability to deliver quality patient care and maintain competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Juraschek et al., 2019)</ref>. However, nursing is one of the most stressful occupations in healthcare. The demanding nature of care delivery coupled with myriad workforce shortage challenges may unfavorably affect the work engagement, quality of life, and intentto-leave status of nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ghazawy et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hetzel-Riggin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Leng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wei et al., 2023)</ref>. The registered nurse (RN) turnover rate is a significant issue in healthcare. In 2022, the RN turnover rate was 22.5%, leading hospitals to lose millions of dollars due to onboarding and replacement costs <ref type="bibr">(NSI Nursing Solutions, Inc., 2023)</ref>. Factors influencing nurse intent to leave are multifactorial <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Skillman &amp; Toms, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Treglown et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wei et al., 2023)</ref>. Thus, exploring the complex factors affecting nurses' intent to leave and understanding the interrelationships among these factors are critical to helping organizations and policymakers design and implement effective policies to improve nurse retention, job satisfaction, and patient outcomes.</p><p>Previous studies provide valuable insights into several critical aspects related to work engagement, ProQOL, and intent to leave, particularly within the nursing and healthcare contexts. Work engagement is positively associated with enhanced job performance and organizational success. ProQOL, including compassion satisfaction and burnout, affects healthcare professionals, with burnout linked to adverse patient care outcomes. Employee intent to leave, or voluntary turnover, is a persistent concern affected by factors such as job dissatisfaction and heavy workload that impacts both organizations and patient care continuity.</p><p>Current research on intent to leave among nurses, which relies primarily on conventional statistical methods such as correlations and multiple regression, offer limited insight into the multifactorial relationships and direct effects among work engagement, ProQOL, and intent to leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Skillman &amp; Toms, 2022)</ref>. For example, multiple regression represents the direct effects of one predictor on an outcome variable after adjusting for other variables and thus may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of relationships. Another limitation in prior research is the utilization of advanced statistical analysis such as structural equation modeling (SEM) to comprehensively integrate all factors into a unified model to facilitate the exploration of the intricate relationships among these variables. SEM is a statistical technique that can evaluate complex relationships among multiple factors and examine factors that are often interrelated but not easily discernible through traditional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kline, 2023)</ref>. Path analysis is an SEM model that can include indirect effects, that is, cases in which one factor affects a factor that directly affects the outcome variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kline, 2023)</ref>. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the interrelationships among work engagement, ProQOL, and intent to leave in nurses using SEM path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Framework</head><p>This study was based on Kahn's Employee Engagement Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kahn, 1990)</ref> and the Convergent Care Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wei, 2022)</ref>. Individuals may apply differing levels of personal engagement in their work roles and performance. When individuals have a sense of meaningfulness, safety, and support about their work, they tend to exhibit higher levels of engagement, satisfaction, and production; otherwise, they may become disengaged and withdrawn and hide their ideas, feelings, and identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kahn, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Convergent Care Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wei, 2022)</ref> addresses work engagement, ProQOL, and intent to leave dimensions, which are not included in the Employment Engagement Theory. The four domains of Convergent Care Theory include organizational commitment (all-inclusive organizational care), team collaboration (interprofessional collaborative care), patient care competency (person-centered precision care), and personal self-care level (providers' and patients' self-care). This theory emphasizes the multifaceted features of healthcare and proposes facilitators of employee work engagement and compassion satisfaction. When organizations promote a positive, caring, and inclusive organizational culture, compassion, trust, and self-care, their employees tend to be more engaged in their work, experience higher job satisfaction, provide better quality of care, and have lower levels of stress and intent to leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wei, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wei &amp; Horton-Deutsch, 2022)</ref>. Based on the guiding theories and the current literature, a theoretical model that incorporates the major constructs of work engagement, ProQOL (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress), and intent to leave was proposed in this study (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Also, the interrelationships among the constructs were evaluated using SEM path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>This quantitative descriptive correlational study adopted a cross-sectional survey design. The institutional review board of the University of Louisville approved this study <ref type="bibr">(IRB No. 21.0844)</ref>. All of the participants agreed and consented to participate in the study before answering the survey.</p><p>By applying SEM on a national nurse sample, it is expected this study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how work engagement and ProQOL influence, via both direct and indirect pathways, nurse intent to leave. Using path analysis within SEM allows the exploration of mediating and moderating effects that may be missed by traditional statistical approaches, providing a deeper and more-comprehensive understanding of how work-related factors influence nurses' intent to leave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Data Collection</head><p>A convenience sampling method was used to recruit participants for this study. A survey link was established and disseminated via email to various nursing professional organizations, including the Competency and Credentialing Institute, healthcare organizations, and hospitals, as well as to individual nurses across the United States. Due to the indirect pathway used to recruit participants, an accurate response rate could not be determined. Nursing professional organizations rather than social media platforms were used to send the survey link to ensure data were collected from respondents working in the nursing field. The inclusion criterion was being an RN in the United States with a minimum of 3 months of work experience in a healthcare organization or institution. Nurses not practicing in the United States or unwilling to share their experiences were excluded. The survey link accepted completed survey submissions from respondents between March and September 2022. Measures were implemented to restrict multiple submissions based on IP address throughout the survey period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>Demographics Participant demographic data collected included gender, race, age, ethnicity, education, work setting, facility type, current job role, and years as an RN (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Utrecht work engagement scale</head><p>Work engagement was measured using the English version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-17 (UWES-17; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref>. This scale comprises 17 items in three dimensions: vigor (six items), dedication (five items), and absorption (six items). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (always). The average score of each subscale is calculated by summing the total score for subscale items and dividing the result by the number of subscale items, with total possible scores ranging from 0 to 6. This scale is well established and has strong psychometric properties, with a Cronbach's alpha ranging from .70 to .90 (Schaufeli Professional quality of life-5 ProQOL-5 is a 30-item self-report scale that comprises three subscales-compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stamm, 2010)</ref>. Compassion satisfaction refers to the pleasure resulting from being able to do one's job and help others well. This subscale includes 10 items such as "I get satisfaction from being able to help people." Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction and better perceptions of being an effective caregiver. The burnout subscale measures feelings of hopelessness and difficulties in doing one's jobs effectively. This subscale also includes 10 items such as "I feel worn out because of my work as a health care provider." The secondary traumatic stress subscale refers to workrelated, secondary exposure to traumatizing incidents experienced by a significant other. This subscale consists of 10 items such as "I feel depressed because of the traumatic experiences of the people I help." Respondents are asked to rate the frequencies of experiencing each subscale item in the previous 30 days on a 5-item Likert scale, ranging from 1 = never to 5 = very often, with higher scores indicating higher levels of secondary traumatic stress. The three subscales each range from 10 to 50. The Cronbach's alpha has been previously calculated as .88 for the compassion satisfaction subscale, .75 for the burnout subscale, and .81 for the secondary traumatic stress subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stamm, 2010)</ref>. The Cronbach's alpha for ProQOL-5 was .85, and those for the three subscales were .90 for compassion satisfaction, .70 for burnout, and .84 for secondary traumatic stress in this study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>An SEM generated through IBM SPSS AMOS, Version 29, was used to evaluate the study hypotheses and to validate the developed theoretical model using 2022 national nurse survey data. Four latent variables were developed, and the measurement model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which specified the relationship between observed indicators and their underlying latent constructs. Indicators for four latent variables (work engagement, compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress) were included in the measurement model. The number of observed indicators measuring work engagement and ProQOL was reduced based on covariance (overlap or redundancy) among the indicators and standardized regression weights (if &lt; 0.50, then removed).</p><p>After evaluating the model fit and factor loadings of the measurement model, the structural equation models were specified. Parameter estimates were calculated using the maximum likelihood estimator. Model fit measures were used to assess the model's overall goodness of fit. Next, model fit statistics were evaluated for significance using published recommendations. The goodness-of-fit indices used in this study included the comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), incremental fit index (IFI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), with a fitness value of &gt; .95 for the CFI, TLI, and IFI and &lt; .08 for RMSEA and SRMR indicating good fit. IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data cleaning, recoding, and descriptive analyses, and IBM SPSS AMOS 29.0 was used for SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Characteristics</head><p>The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 900 participants in this study are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Six hundred thirteen (68.1%) of the participants were female, and 213 (23.7%) were male. The average age of the sample was 36.06 (SD = 9.69) years, and over two thirds identified as either White (489, 54.3%) or Black (173, 19.2%), with the remainder identifying as Asian, American Indian, Alaskan, Hawaiian Native, or Other Pacific Islander. Nearly four out of five participants (713, 79.2%) reported holding a specialty certification, and slightly over half (473, 52.6%) worked at hospitals/medical centers. In terms of job, 420 (46.7%) worked as staff nurses; 288 (32%), as administrative staff; and 99 (11%), as educators.</p><p>Descriptive Analyses of Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-17, Professional Quality of Life-5, and Nurses' Intent to Leave Using descriptive analysis, the mean scores for the three subscales of UWES-17 were 3.69 (SD = 1.11) for vigor, 3.84 (SD = 1.21) for dedication, and 3.53 (SD = 1.08) for absorption. Also, the mean score for compassion satisfaction was 36.11 (SD = 7.54) on a scale of 10-50, that for burnout was 26.22 (SD = 5.6), and that for secondary traumatic stress was 27.49 (SD = 7.04).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of Measurement Model and Interrelationships of Latent Constructs</head><p>The CFA used to assess the adequacy of the hypothesized measurement model consisted of four latent variables and 22 manifest variables. Factor loadings and composite reliabilities of each construct are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The work engagement scale with three dimensions (vigor, dedication, and absorption) was reduced from 17 items to eight items under one dimension only. The 30-item ProQOL-5 scale with three dimensions (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress) was reduced to 14 items under three dimensions. Moreover, nine items of the work engagement scale and 16 items of the ProQOL-5 were removed. Construct reliabilities were also assessed for every construct. The results of CFA indicate the hypothesized measurement model fits the data adequately, with an RMSEA of .037, an SRMR of .032, a CFI of .970, a TLI of .965, and an IFI of .970. The standardized factor loadings for all four latent variables were statistically significant and above .58, with most above .65. The magnitude and significance of the factor loading suggest that all indicators were moderately or strongly correlated with the latent factor with which they were hypothesized to be related. The SEM model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) was used to examine the interrelationships among the latent constructs, including work engagement, ProQOL, and intent to leave, which was controlled by the year as an RN and permitted the effects of the work engagement to be mediated through all three factors (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress), and had adequate fit based on all fit indices including IFI = .947, CFI = .946, TLI = .939, SRMR = .045, and RMSEA = .044.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, work engagement was strongly and positively related to job satisfaction (estimate = 0.84, p &lt; .001) but strongly and negatively related to burnout (estimate = -0.83, p &lt; .001) and stress (estimate = -0.17, p &lt; .001). Regarding nurses' intent to leave, several pathways were identified. Job satisfaction exhibited a negative direct relationship, although it was not statistically significant (estimate = -0.12, p = .172). Conversely, burnout exhibited a strongly positive direct relationship with intent to leave (estimate = 0.31, p = .003), emphasizing its adverse impact on retention. Work engagement was found to have a relatively weaker positive direct relationship with intent to leave (estimate = 0.02, p = .862). The positive relationship found between stress and intent to leave (estimate = 0.12, p &lt; .001) highlights the positive influence of stress on intent to leave.</p><p>Years as an RN was found to be negatively related to burnout (estimate = -0.10, p = .002) and stress (estimate = -0.25, p &lt; .001) and positively related to job satisfaction (estimate = 0.04, p = .146), indicating that more experience is associated with reduced burnout and somewhat increased job satisfaction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of Professional Quality of Life on the Pathway From Work Engagement to Intent to Leave</head><p>A decomposition of the standardized direct, indirect, and total effects of work engagement on intent to leave, specific indirect effects through three pathways, and total effects of each of the model's mediating variables is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Work engagement had a significant total effect (-0.353, p = .009) and indirect effect (-0.376, p = .010) on intent to leave. The direct impact of work engagement on intent to leave was insignificant. The specific indirect effect of work engagement on intent to leave through burnout (-0.248, p = .009) and secondary traumatic stress (-0.020, p = .005) was negative and significant. The model infers that the probability of intent to leave decreases by 35.3% of a standard deviation for every standard deviation increase in work engagement score. Higher work engagement was associated with greater compassion satisfaction and lower intent to leave. Higher work engagement decreased secondary traumatic stress and burnout, which resulted in decreased intent to leave. The specific direct effect of work engagement on satisfaction (0.84, p = .008) and burnout (-0.83, p = .005) was the largest of any pathway in the model. A difference in work engagement of 1 SD, while  holding other variables constant, was associated with a compassion satisfaction value of 0.84 SDs higher and a burnout value of 0.83 SDs lower. Of the three mediating variables, burnout (0.31, p = .010) had the largest total effect on intent to leave, followed by secondary traumatic stress (0.12, p = .005) and compassion satisfaction (-0.12, p = .274).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, the complex interrelationships among factors such as nurse work engagement, ProQOL (including compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout), and intent to leave were evaluated using SEM path analysis.</p><p>A comprehensive theoretical model incorporating work engagement, ProQOL, and intent to leave was proposed and tested to evaluate complex relationships among factors that are often interrelated but not easily discerned using traditional methods. Work engagement has significantly negative total and indirect effects on intent to leave in nurses but no significantly direct effect on intent to leave. Work engagement influenced intent to leave indirectly through the ProQOL; higher work engagement correlated with greater compassion satisfaction and lower intent to leave and with lower burnout and secondary traumatic stress, which are associated with reduced intent to leave. Burnout and secondary traumatic stress correlated directly with intent to leave, and compassion satisfaction was indirectly associated with intent to leave. SEM was used in this study to evaluate the pathway from work engagement, through compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress, to intent to leave. The findings of this study may be divided into three main discussion points: work engagement, burnout and secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction.</p><p>First, the findings highlight the significance of promoting nurse work engagement. One of our key findings was the significant indirect effects of work engagement on intent to leave through burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Support for these findings can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hetzel-Riggin et al. (2020)</ref>, which showed that work engagement (vigor, dedication, and absorption) and resiliency partially mediated the relationship between work-related stress and burnout (depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and personal accomplishment) in nurses in the United States. However, Hetzel-Riggin et al. added that each form of burnout was influenced by distinct mediational pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hetzel-Riggin et al., 2020)</ref>. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sellers et al.

Therefore, highly engaged nurses are less likely to leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sellers et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The results suggest that higher work engagement is associated with lower levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress, which in turn contribute to reduced intent to leave.

Healthcare policymakers, organizations, and nurse leaders play a crucial role in promoting nurse engagement in healthcare organizations.</p><p>Second, among the three mediating variables, burnout and secondary traumatic stress were respectively identified as having the largest and second-largest total effects on intent to leave. Unfortunately, burnout is prevalent in the nursing profession, especially among newly graduated nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kelly et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wei et al., 2022)</ref>. As level of burnout increases, so do the consequences to nursing. The findings of this study are consistent with <ref type="bibr">Kelly et al.'s (2021)</ref> survey of direct care nurses and Wells-English et al.'s (2019) study on oncology nurses, both of which showed that intent to leave increased as level of perceived burnout increased. Burnout has been associated with a 3.50-fold increase in intent to leave among emergency department nurses in the United States with an above-medium level of burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lee et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mohr et al. (2021)</ref> classified burnout clusters as low, medium, and high for an observational study of 111 intensive care units at Veterans Health Administration hospitals. Compared to intensive care units in low burnout clusters, high burnout cluster locations had higher turnover and lower job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mohr et al., 2021)</ref>. Similar to this study, Wells-English et al. found a positive correlation between secondary traumatic stress and intent to leave. These findings highlight the detrimental impact of burnout and secondary traumatic stress on intent to leave in nurses. Furthermore, the results of this study are consistent with previous findings regarding the adverse effects of burnout on nurse turnover intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Oehlert et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wei, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wei &amp; Horton-Deutsch, 2022)</ref>. Nurse burnout and secondary traumatic stress are significant concerns in healthcare organizations, as they can negatively impact nurses' health, work satisfaction, and patient care. Thus, healthcare organizations should recognize and address burnout and secondary traumatic stress in nurses. Targeted interventions are needed to reduce the currently large effect of burnout and secondary traumatic stress on nursing workforce retention.</p><p>Research has shown the crucial role nurse leaders play in mitigating nurse burnout and secondary traumatic stress and promoting healthier work environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wei et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wei &amp; Wei, 2020)</ref>. Healthcare organizations must also acknowledge the impact of secondary traumatic stress on nurses and provide adequate support. Developing comprehensive programs focusing on psychological support, trauma-informed care, and coping strategies can help nurses manage secondary traumatic stress more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Leng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Papa &amp; Robinson, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>The findings of this study emphasize the significant indirect effects of work engagement on intent to leave via the mediator of compassion satisfaction. Higher work engagement was found to be associated with greater compassion satisfaction, which was, in turn, linked to lower intent to leave.

The findings underscore the importance of cultivating a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in the nursing profession, as it can serve as a protective factor against turnover intentions.</p><p>The results of this study further highlighted the importance of cultivating compassion satisfaction as a protective factor against turnover intentions. Wells-English et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) also found compassion satisfaction to be a predictor of turnover intentions, with their study demonstrating a statistically significant negative correlation between compassion satisfaction and turnover intention. Healthcare organizations should prioritize initiatives that enhance nurses' compassion satisfaction by, for example, recognizing and valuing their contributions, providing emotional support, and creating a positive work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abou Hashish &amp; Ghanem Atalla, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wei, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wei &amp; Horton-Deutsch, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Turnover in nursing is very prevalent <ref type="bibr">(NSI Nursing Solutions, Inc., 2023)</ref>. Given the significant impact that nurse turnover has on nursing and healthcare in general, it is vital to develop and implement effective solutions to address this concern. Based on the findings of this analysis, several recommendations are proposed to address nurse engagement, burnout and secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction.</p><p>First, we propose the following recommendations for nurse leaders and policymakers to promote nurse engagement: developing a positive and supportive work environment, building trust, co-creating meaning and purpose of what we do at work, applying effective communication, employing meaningful recognition and appreciation, helping nurses find their uniqueness and strengths at work, encouraging participation and involvement at work, cultivating curiosity for continued learning, and empowering nurses for decision-making. Enhancing nursing engagement requires giving nurses a voice in the decisions that impact the work environment. Leaders must authentically learn their stories and appreciate their strengths to improve work satisfaction and decrease intent to leave. Developing relationships (e.g., mentor-mentee relationships) may help nurses better cultivate a sense of belonging, work fulfillment, and satisfaction at work. By fostering a work environment that encourages autonomy, professional growth, and positive relationships, organizations can enhance nurses' ownership mentality and work engagement.</p><p>Second, several strategies exist for healthcare policymakers, organizations, and nurse leaders to address nurse burnout and secondary traumatic stress. These strategies include imple-menting evidence-based interventions to reduce burnout such as workload management, emotional support programs, work-life balance initiatives, and self-care practices; recognizing nurses' efforts; making nurses feel unique and valued; designing strategies to increase teamwork and collaboration; inspiring nurses' involvement; and ensuring optimal organizational outcomes.</p><p>Third, compassion satisfaction is a significant mediator of the relationship between work engagement and intent to leave. Organizations can improve nurse retention and overall job satisfaction by fostering compassion satisfaction. Healthcare policymakers, organizations, and nurse leaders play an essential role in promoting nurses' compassion satisfaction, which is the positive emotional state derived from providing compassionate care <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bahari et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wei et al., 2023)</ref>. We propose the following strategies that healthcare policymakers, organizations, and nurse leaders may employ to foster compassion satisfaction among their nursing staff: encouraging nurses' selfcare, providing adequate resources, promoting peer support, fostering a positive work environment, and cultivating an allinclusive culture of caring that aligns with the mission statement of the American Academy of Nursing (i.e., "Improve health and achieve health equity by impacting policy through nursing leadership, innovation, and science"; American Academy of <ref type="bibr">Nursing, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study has many strengths, including the large sample size used (n = 900) and the deployment of standardized instruments with high reliability to measure the variables. However, several limitations that affect the generalizability of findings should be considered. This study used a convenience sampling method, which may introduce bias, as recruited participants may be atypical of the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Polit &amp; Beck, 2020)</ref>. Also, convenience sampling is inherently limited in terms of representativeness, as it may not fully capture the entire population of nurses in the United States. We selected this sampling method for practical reasons, including accessibility and the constraints of the online data collection process. Next, it is unclear whether this study's findings may have been influenced by the experiences of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other studies have identified nurses' experiences of burnout and stress from COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Martin et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Nursing Leadership</head><p>Kahn's Employee Engagement Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kahn, 1990)</ref> and the Convergent Care Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wei, 2022)</ref>, used as the theoretical frameworks for this study, strengthened this research by informing the research design and method as they related to work engagement, ProQOL (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress), and intent to leave. Evidence from this study suggests burnout and secondary traumatic stress to be directly correlated with intent to leave and compassion satisfaction to be indirectly correlated with intent</p><p>The Journal of Nursing Research</p><p>Holly WEI et al.</p><p>to leave. These findings have meaningful implications for nursing leadership.</p><p>In addition to the recommendations provided earlier in this paper, the Convergent Care Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wei, 2022)</ref> may inform the interventions of nurse leaders to mitigate the factors associated with intent to leave among nurses. At the organizational level, leaders can foster an "organizational care" approach, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wei (2022)</ref> defines as "an organization's mission, goals, culture, and commitment to value employees' contributions, care for employees' well-being, and ensure resources for employee's work and safety" (p. 10). Practicing "organizational care" can support nurses' engagement, compassion satisfaction, and sense of belonging and value. Nursing leaders can ensure an organizational culture of "collaborative care" where teamwork, trust, cooperation, shared responsibility, collaboration, and togetherness are valued and fostered.</p><p>The finding that burnout and secondary traumatic stress are associated with intent to leave underscores the impact of well-being on nursing work and care delivery. Although the American Association of Colleges of Nursing ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>) has identified self-care as an essential competency for professional nursing education, it also holds bearing in professional nursing practice. As such, another recommendation drawn from Convergent Care Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wei, 2022)</ref> is active engagement in self-care. Nurse leaders are in a position to influence self-care in nurses through role-modeling and mentoring as well as by creating structural and systematic changes that foster, promote, and support nurses' ongoing self-care management. Examples include the development and implementation of training programs, resources and activities, and the creation of physical spaces where nurses can engage in selfcare while at work.</p><p>Nurses' health and well-being influence the quality, safety, and cost of care (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2021). Therefore, it is critical for nurse leaders to prioritize and address structures, policies, and organizational cultures that may negatively affect nurses' engagement and ProQOL and contribute to their intent to leave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Future Research</head><p>A recommendation for future research is to conduct a mixedmethod study to obtain in-depth descriptions and understandings of factors (barriers and facilitators) related to intent to leave in nurses. It may also be necessary to conduct research to determine causal relationships between the significant variables in this study as well as longitudinal research to investigate changes over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>An SEM approach was used in this study to analyze the relationships and pathways among nurse work engagement, ProQOL, and intent to leave. The findings provide robust evidence in support of the proposed model, explicating the relationships among work engagement, compassion satisfaction, burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and intent to leave within the nursing profession. The findings underscore the importance of promoting work engagement and addressing burnout and secondary traumatic stress to mitigate intent to leave among nurses. By fostering higher levels of work engagement, healthcare organizations can enhance nurse retention and ultimately improve patient care quality and outcomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Path Diagram</figDesc></figure>
