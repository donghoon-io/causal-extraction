<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Understanding the causes of traffic collisions is crucial for road designers, engineers, and policymakers to improve road safety at intersections. Design standards aim to minimize the severity and frequency of collisions. However, the factors that may affect traffic collisions are extensive. Their causal mechanisms can be complex, with feedback loops between traffic flows, visibilities, speeds, risk perception, speed limits, and other geometric characteristics of intersections. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is commonly used in behavioural sciences to understand complex causal paths, including travel behaviour studies. However, SEMs cannot robustly represent non-normally distributed datasets and rare count events, and little literature exists on their application to road traffic collisions. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a piecewise Structural Equation Modelling (pSEM) technique, which can handle count responses (i.e. number of collisions) to represent the complex causal relationships that lead to collisions. Application of pSEM technique is compared with conventional SEM. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values demonstrate that pSEM is a more robust approach to model collisions at unsignalized intersections than conventional SEM. In terms of prediction ability referring to explained variance, pSEM is much more robust than SEM. Piecewise Structural Equation Modelling is, therefore, recommended for policy implications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A wide range of research has been undertaken worldwide to understand and address road traffic collisions at unsignalized intersections. In the United Kingdom, prioritycontrolled intersections account for 49% of urban accidents, with T or staggered intersections accounting for 59% of these <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Many people were killed in these collisions, of which 66% were drivers, cyclists, or motorbike riders, 19% were passengers, and 15% were pedestrians <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Collision prediction models (CPMs) serve a variety of purposes, including estimating the anticipated number of collisions based on traffic volume and identifying factors related to the occurrence of collisions, such as geometric, environmental, and operational variables. To accurately determine the frequency and severity of collisions and reduce their likelihood, it is essential to comprehend the causal mechanisms that connect road conditions, environmental factors, drivers, vehicles, temporal variables, and operations to collisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. By proactively utilizing CPMs, potential collision risks can be assessed, and collision-prone locations can be identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>CPMs have evolved over decades from an early approach with multivariate linear regression analyses of traffic collisions to the most used method; generalised linear regression modeling (GLM) and most recently, machine learning. The logic behind this evolution lies in the nature of traffic collisions that are rare and non-normally distributed count responses. GLM seems convenient; however, it cannot overcome complex hierarchical interplay between explanatory variables, such as in the case of collisions. To represent such complexity, the conventional structural equation model using multivariate linear regression can be used using AMOS SPSS or other analytical software. However, the model treats the count response as a continuous variable that will cause unreliable results due to the nature of collisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. On the other hand, the machine learning approach can handle complex problems, but interpreting results are problematic, due to their "black box" nature. Therefore, there is a need to have a new analytical regression method that can combine the structural equation model for representing complex and hierarchical interplay and GLM that accounts for non-normally distributed collisions.</p><p>This paper developed a piecewise Structural Equation Model (pSEM) to road safety as a new analytical method, overcoming drawbacks of previous techniques. The new pSEM model is compared with the conventional SEM by analysing traffic collisions at 120 priority intersections in the city of Portsmouth, UK.</p><p>The remainder of this paper begins by summarising the current literature's findings regarding collision prediction models at unsignalized intersections. Commonly used regression models relevant to this paper are described, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Then, the mathematical background of path analysis as a family of structural equation modeling is explained. In the method section, after briefly describing the data for this paper, piecewise Structural Equation Modeling is formulated, and a causal diagram of the model is illustrated compared to a standard SEM. The results are discussed and concluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies on unsignalized intersections</head><p>Road traffic collisions (RTC) at unsignalized intersections are a major concern around the world, and several approaches have been used to better understand their causes.</p><p>The approaches on modeling traffic collision of priority three-armed intersections can be broadly categorized into three main categories: observational research, experimental research and microsimulation studies as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>The first category is observational research, which can be further divided into three sub-groups. The first group aims to determine the frequency or number of collisions. For example, Kitto <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> conducted a study in Wellington, New Zealand to examine the effect of physical and site characteristics on collisions. Similarly, Bonneson <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> examined unsignalized intersections in the USA (Utah, Minnesota, Illinois, etc.) to develop a model relating intersection traffic demand to collision frequency. As collisions are rare events and nonnegative count data, the most commonly used approach to modeling RTCs was Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM). Other studies have developed collision prediction models based on traffic flow to assess safety at unsignalized intersections, such as Salifu <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, who studied two cities in Ghana, and Kulmala <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, who developed separate models for different types of collisions in Finland.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Categorization of studies on priority three-armed intersections.</head><p>The second approach to understanding RTCs is to determine the severity of collisions rather than the frequency. For instance, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> applied logistic regression to examine the contribution of various factors to collision severity in Victoria, Australia, while Haleem and Abdel-Aty <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> examined the severity of injury collisions at unsignalized intersections in the USA. Both studies found that several variables, such as traffic volumes, the number of lanes, and driver age, were significant in determining collision severity.</p><p>Statistical models are useful for drawing conclusions and establishing relationships, but they generally have poor predictive performance due to assumptions about the collision data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Researchers have used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify collision severity, such as Akin and Akbas <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, who predicted intersection collisions in Michigan State, USA.</p><p>The third approach to traffic safety at junctions is hot-spot identification. Sayed and Rodriguez <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> attempted to develop collision prediction models to identify collision-prone locations of urban unsignalized intersections on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, using the Empirical Bayesian (EB) method.</p><p>Category two includes experimental research, such as Polus <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> who implemented a before-and-after study to investigate whether stop signs differ from yield signs in terms of their effect on traffic collisions at unsignalized intersections.</p><p>Category three includes microsimulation studies based on traffic conflict techniques developed by General Motor Laboratory. Traffic conflicts refer to observed situations where two or more road users approach a collision course, which could result in a collision if no one acts to avoid it. Traffic conflict indicators, such as time to collision (TTC) and postencroachment time (PET), can be used to assess traffic safety. Microsimulation software, such as VISSIM and AIMSUN, can be used with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) to classify whether PET and TTC have critical conflict values.</p><p>Caliendo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> attempted to predict the number of collisions by using the number of critical traffic conflicts predicted. Pawar, Gore, and Arkatkar <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> investigated the use of accepted gaps to estimate the likelihood of a collision at unsignalized T-intersections. The best-fitting distribution was the generalised extreme value (GEV), which was used to estimate the likelihood of a collision using accepted gap and PET datasets. Accepted gap data was used for risk characterisation. Goyani <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> looked at the safety effect of mixed traffic conditions on different types of vehicles. The percentage of critical crossing conflicts (PCCC) was higher in the traffic stream with motorised two-wheelers and threewheelers, followed by cars, buses, LCVs, and trucks. Paul <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> figured out how motorised two and three-wheelers conflicts affect crossing conflicts at unsignalized T-intersections in India. They applied Truncated Negative Binomial regression to create models of crossing conflicts. The results showed that the number of critical and non-critical conflicts is greatly affected by the proportion of two and three-wheelers in the conflicting and offending stream, the presence of a central traffic island, and the total number of conflicts.</p><p>Studies using microsimulation have also examined the effect of changes in speed limits on traffic safety at unsignalized intersections, such as Pirdavani <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, who used S-Paramics to analyse whether changes in speed limits under different traffic volumes affect traffic safety. Srinivasula, Chepuri, and Joshi <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> investigated the critical speed of conflicting vehicles and the effect of speed bumps on PET and traffic collision frequencies. They concluded that while safety has improved, other appropriate measures should be implemented to improve safety levels further.</p><p>Surrogate safety measures traditionally applied to single collision types. Gastaldi, Orsini, Gecchele, and Rossi <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> applied two bivariate extreme value theory (EVT) approaches in order to simultaneously evaluate multiple collision types at a three-leg unsignalized intersection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linear regression models</head><p>In the literature, early attempts at collision prediction studies were modelled by multiple linear regression that can be formulated as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐸𝐸 = 𝐵𝐵 0 + ∑ 𝑥𝑥 𝑗𝑗 𝑏𝑏 𝑗𝑗 𝑛𝑛 𝑗𝑗=1</formula><p>(1) Where 𝐸𝐸 is the number or frequency of collisions, 𝐵𝐵 0 is an intercept, 𝑥𝑥 𝑗𝑗 represents explanatory variables such as road width and traffic flow, 𝑛𝑛 is the number of explanatory variables, and 𝑏𝑏 𝑗𝑗 are the estimated coefficients.</p><p>Kitto <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> examined the effect of various physical and site characteristics on collisions by using multiple regression techniques. Arndt and Troutbeck <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> described the relationship between the geometry of priority intersections and collision rate using multiple linear regression. However, there are many debates and controversial points regarding this modeling technique. Nambuusi <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> highlighted that multiple linear regression is not robust as the response variable is nonnegative count data. The linear regression model, while appealing and simple, has stringent assumptions that are frequently violated when applied to data on road safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generalized linear regression models (GLMs)</head><p>To overcome the limitations of conventional linear regression, GLM was used. These models allow the analysis of non-normally distributed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Poisson regression Different generalized linear models have been established in the literature. Poison GLM regression is one of the commonly used models since collisions are unavoidably discrete and rare random events <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Rahman <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> indicated that another advantage of Poisson regression is that it is suitable for categorical data.</p><p>The commonly used form of Poisson regression with a log link function can be written as follows.</p><p>𝐸𝐸 = 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 𝑒𝑒 ∑𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗 (2) Where E is the expected event, b𝑗𝑗 are the estimated coefficients, 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 is the interval as an offset variable (i.e. time, length), 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 represents an explanatory variable, and e is the natural number.</p><p>This function above specified traffic collisions by adding traffic flow as the main exposure variable. The following structure is a general form used in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝐸𝐸 = 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄 1 𝑏𝑏1 𝑄𝑄 2 𝑏𝑏2</formula><p>(3) Where 𝑄𝑄 1 and 𝑄𝑄 2 annual average daily traffic flows per 1000 vehicles b 1 and b 2 are the estimated parameters, and 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 is the offset variable (year).</p><p>What 𝑄𝑄 1 and 𝑄𝑄 2 depend on what kind of flow model was used. For example, in the major/minor inflow model, they are the sum of major and minor traffic flow at an intersection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>128</head><p>The following form was added to the model to include additional factors such as categorical and geometric variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐸𝐸 = 𝑄𝑄 1 𝑏𝑏1 𝑄𝑄 2 𝑏𝑏2 𝑒𝑒 ∑𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗+𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 (4</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>) The Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression</head><p>Poisson models also have some drawbacks. Turner <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> observed that the Poisson model sometimes produces inaccurate results. The limitation is that the mean must be equal to the variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. When this equality is not evident, under-dispersion or over-dispersion problems occur. The pure Poisson model can be modified to deal with the overdispersion problems through a Quasi-Poisson approach. The estimated parameters that result from the Quasi-Poisson (QP) model are the same as those from the pure Poisson model. The difference is just in their standard errors that are inflated by a factor of 'k' <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> Another way to model an over-dispersed response variable is to use the negative binomial (NB) regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>The assumption of the NB model is reported to be a more realistic approach than the Poisson regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. Several researchers have attempted to use NB regression to deal with dispersion problems [i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>.</p><p>Theoretically, the variance (𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑛𝑛)) in the negative binomial distribution is not equal to the mean (𝜆𝜆) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑛𝑛) = 𝜆𝜆 + 1 𝑟𝑟 𝜆𝜆 2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The term</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 𝑟𝑟</formula><p>= 𝜃𝜃 , which refers to the inverse of the overdispersion parameter (𝑉𝑉). In the mathematical limit situation where ' 𝑉𝑉 ' is close to infinity, the variance will equal the mean due to the standard Poisson model assumption as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑛𝑛) = 𝜆𝜆 + 1 ∞ 𝜆𝜆 2 = 𝜆𝜆<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Conventionally, Poisson regression is a particular instance of the negative binomial model where the 𝜃𝜃 parameter is zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. The overall form of negative binomial regression is derived from the Poisson model by adding an independently distributed error term <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>.</p><p>𝜆𝜆 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑒𝑒 ∑𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗+𝑏𝑏 0 + Ɛ 𝑖𝑖 +𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 (7) Where exp (Ɛ 𝑖𝑖 ) is the gamma distributed error with mean 1 and variance 1/r=θ.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝑃𝑃(𝑌𝑌 = 𝑦𝑦 𝑖𝑖 |𝜆𝜆 𝑖𝑖 , 𝜃𝜃) = 𝛤𝛤(𝜃𝜃+𝑦𝑦 𝑖𝑖 ) 𝛤𝛤(𝜃𝜃𝑦𝑦 𝑖𝑖 ) � 𝜃𝜃 𝜃𝜃+𝑦𝑦 𝑖𝑖 � 𝜃𝜃 � 𝜆𝜆 𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃+𝜆𝜆 𝑖𝑖 � 𝑦𝑦 𝑖𝑖 (8)</formula><p>Where 𝑦𝑦 𝑖𝑖 = 0, 1 ,2 , … , 𝑛𝑛 is the number of collisions, θ is the inverse dispersion parameter (1/r), and Γ (…) is the gamma distribution function.</p><p>Poch and Mannering <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> concluded that the elements related to collision frequency in an intersection approach could logically identify significant traffic and geometric phenomena by using negative binomial regression modeling.</p><p>The over-dispersion parameter as an extra variation in traffic collisions can be caused by some factors, such as misspecification in the model and an excessive number of zero collisions. In this regard, the zero-inflated Poisson or the zeroinflated negative binomial models can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation model (SEM): A path analysis</head><p>In the 1920s, path analysis was developed by Sewall Wright, a geneticist. He attempted to measure the direct influence of one variable on another along with path diagrams by taking correlations into account. The path analysis method, therefore, depends on the degree of correlations in a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Wright <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref> obtained the basic formulation of path coefficients by explaining the representative path diagram illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Variables are connected as a function of dependent relationships through the one-way arrows. Vi is a total residual determination, and the double arrows represent residual correlations between variables. Wright assumed that all relationships are linear.</p><p>Each variable from the unidirectional perspective can be formalised as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(𝑉𝑉 0 -𝑉𝑉 0 ′ ) = 𝑉𝑉 01 (𝑉𝑉 1 -𝑉𝑉 1 ′ ) + 𝑉𝑉 02 (𝑉𝑉 2 -𝑉𝑉 2 ′ ) + ⋯ + 𝑉𝑉 𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛 (𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛 -𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛 ′ )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Where 𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 ′ is the mean, (𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 -𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 ′ ) represents deviations from means, and 𝑉𝑉 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 is a coefficient.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖 = (𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 -𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 ′ ) 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Where 𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖 is a standard z score of a variable, and 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 is the standard deviation.</p><p>𝑃𝑃 0𝑖𝑖 = 𝑉𝑉 0𝑖𝑖 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 𝛿𝛿 0 (10) 𝑃𝑃 0𝑖𝑖 is a standardised path coefficient reflecting a correlation.</p><p>Equation 9 and Equation <ref type="formula">10</ref>; 𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 = (𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 -𝑉𝑉 𝑖𝑖 ′ ), 𝑃𝑃 0𝑖𝑖 (𝛿𝛿 0 / 𝛿𝛿 𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑉𝑉 0𝑖𝑖 can be rearranged respectively. Then, they can be combined with Equation 11 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝑋𝑋 0 𝛿𝛿 0 = 𝑃𝑃 01 𝛿𝛿 0 𝛿𝛿 1 𝑋𝑋 1 𝛿𝛿 1 + 𝑃𝑃 02 𝛿𝛿 0 𝛿𝛿 2 𝑋𝑋 2 𝛿𝛿 2 + ⋯ + 𝑃𝑃 0𝑛𝑛 𝛿𝛿 0 𝛿𝛿 𝑛𝑛 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 𝛿𝛿 𝑛𝑛<label>(11)</label></formula><p>So, if the unnecessary parameters in the equation above are eliminated, the final form of the equations will be as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">𝑋𝑋 0 = 𝑃𝑃 01 𝑋𝑋 1 + 𝑃𝑃 02 𝑋𝑋 2 + ⋯ + 𝑃𝑃 0𝑛𝑛 𝑋𝑋 𝑛𝑛 (<label>12</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Path Analysis Diagram, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wright, 1934)</ref> According to Wright <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>, the fraction of the standard deviation of the dependent variable in the above equation is measured by each path coefficient. The factor identified will be directly responsible for a change in the fraction of the dependent variable even if all other factors, including residuals are constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>.</p><p>SEM is a multivariate technique that combines regression, factor analysis and analysis of variance in order to simultaneously estimate interrelated dependence relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>. Even though conventional SEM methodology is well-known and widely applied in many different fields of research, nowadays, there are no robust, practical applications for collision prediction.</p><p>SEM used multivariate linear regression that does not account for the nature of collision data, which are rare, non-negative counts and may not be normally distributed with respect to explanatory variables. The linear regression of a count response variable may not present meaningful results. As explained above, generalised linear modeling (GLM) approaches taking account of discrete responses would be more logical. Regarding traffic collisions at unsignalized intersections, such approaches have been applied in the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43]</ref> and overseas [i.e., 7, 10, 11, 29, 31, 34, 37] However, GLM may not be able to represent the complex inter-relationships between explanatory variables such as speeds, visibilities, speed limits and collisions. Therefore, in this paper, a piecewise structural equation model (pSEM) adapting GLM into a structural equation model will be introduced and compared with conventional SEM by analysing collisions at 120 priority intersections in the city of Portsmouth, UK.</p></div>

The city has the highest population density in the United Kingdom, with 5,100 people per square kilometres, significantly above the national average <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. In 2007, Portsmouth was the first city in the UK to introduce a city-wide 20mph speed limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>.</p><p>The locations where data collection was conducted shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> were collected from 120 locations in Portsmouth and Gosport. Locations were reviewed between Sep 2020 and Aug 2021.</p><p>The data collection process summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Speed data from approaching vehicles at 360 junction arms were measured by using an SL700 spot speed camera. Classified 15minute traffic counts were undertaken in the am, pm or both. These were converted to Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) using the standard conversion factors suggested by the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>.</p><p>As input variables, geometric factors (such as visibility, road width, and turning radii) are measured. To measure the geometric factors, the DIGIMAP service in the United Kingdom provides AutoCAD-compatible ".dwg" files. However, actual conditions, such as parking situations, could not be visualized in the AutoCAD drawing. As a result, visibility measurements were drawn in 3D using Google Earth. All junctions were visited to see if there were any discrepancies between Google Earth views and current junctions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref> As output variables, collision scenarios collected from STATS19 data provided by Department of Transport. In the UK, each accident has specific index number linking vehicle and collision information. These two massive datasets combined by R Studio, STATS19 package.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Piecewise Structural Equation Modeling (pSEM)</head><p>pSEM was developed by Shipley's studies in the 2000s <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. The relationships between variables in the conventional SEM are simultaneously estimated in a single variance-covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>. However, in pSEM, each set of relationships are estimated locally (or, in other words, independently) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. The conventional SEM uses chi-square tests to compare observed and predicted covariance matrix, while the goodness-of-fit of a pSEM is measured as a "test of directed separation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. Shipley <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> highlighted that this test does not depend on asymptotic methods, so it can be used with smaller sample sizes. Secondly, many problems involving nonnormality and non-linearity can be overcome. Another aspect of the "test of directed separation" is that it does not conflict with some problems of covariance matrices involving a maximized loss function. Finally, it allows each piece of the local causal model to determine how much it contributes to the lack of fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref>. Therefore, pSEM appears to be a robust technique for estimating collisions. R Studio was selected as the analytical package, as it can run with the "piecewiseSEM" package.</p><p>The d-separation test of pSEM Shipley's method of testing the path model is based on graph theory notation called directed separation (dseparation) and its relation to conditional independence claims in the probability distribution developed by Pearl and Verma <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[52]</ref>. They explained the logic and mechanics of the d-separation test. Shipley <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> generalised and adapted this to deal with data with a hierarchical structure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. d-separation for independence claims</head><p>The mathematical background of the d-separation test was introduced in Shipley <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref> and detailed in Shipley <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">53]</ref>The process can be summarised in 6 steps as follows. 1. First, the causal hypothesis should be formed in the directed acyclic graph showing the variables involved in the hypothesis and directed causal links between each other as arrows. It can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> as an example where Shipley <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref> indicates the functional form of the equations ("fij") that link variables between i and j. 2. Identify each pair of variables (X, Y) in the graph for variables that do not have an arrow from one direction to another, such as X1 X3 or X3X1. 3. Find the causal parents that are mediating the links. For instance, the causal parent of the relationship between X1 and X3 is X2. Because there is no direct arrow between X1 and X3, this set of variables (X1 X2 X3) is called the conditioning set. 4. Create an independence claim by converting each unique pair and conditioning set. The independent claims of the directed acyclic graph in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are listed below as an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>means that Xi and Xj variables are a probabilistically independent conditional set of variables in Q. 6. Calculating the null probability (pi) for each predicted independence claim. 7. In the final step, a global test of the model requires simultaneous testing of these independence relationships given by Fisher <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[54]</ref>. Fisher's C test can be written as follows. 𝐶𝐶 = -2 ∑ 𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛 (𝑝𝑝 𝑗𝑗 ) 𝑘𝑘 𝑗𝑗=1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> The test follows the chi-square distribution with 2k degrees of freedom. Where k is the number of independent claims. This statistic also can be used to compute an AIC score for comparisons in the model selection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[53]</ref>.</p><p>𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶 𝑐𝑐 = 𝐶𝐶 + 2𝐾𝐾 (13) Where C is Fisher's C statistics, K is the likelihood degrees of freedom.</p><p>The pSEM model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref> was specially designed in line with the literature. Arrows from any variable into the response variables (4 types of crashes) were modelled by the GLM approach of Poisson regression with log link functions. In contrast, multiple linear regression under the pSEM model simultaneously modelled other connections with normal distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">56]</ref>.  The associations between speed variables (mean and standard deviation) and other factors were modelled with pSEM through multiple linear regression, as speeds are dependent variables. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to check the normal distribution assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The results of this study indicate that the pSEM model showed better performance, especially for predicting collision frequencies. Overall, the collision frequencies of pSEM explained 57% more variance compared to those in the conventional SEM, as the differences were summarised in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref>.</p><p>Differences in explained variance vary through the responses. Much greater differences have been observed where the responses are count variables (collisions) compared to the response variables that are continuous. This demonstrates the limited capability of linear regression to model traffic collisions. Even where the responses (mean speed) were suitable (continuous) for multivariate linear regression through SEM and pSEM models, the piecewise structural equation model generally shows better performances with 18.18% and 20.59% differences. All of these differences seem to depend on how estimations are done, and other factors as listed below:</p><p>• pSEM estimates locally while SEM estimates simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. • Whether it is an asymptotic method or not; pSEM does not depend on asymptotic method and gives better estimation performance with smaller sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• The distribution of response variables</head><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values. The BIC and AIC are used to assess model performance. Model performance is measured by taking complexity into account. They include a term that assesses how well the model fits the data with a term that penalises the model based on how well it fits the data, dependent on the number of parameters in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[57]</ref>. The same model structure in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref> was used to compare the model fit. The SEM model performed better in terms of the AIC and BIC values than SEM.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Conclusion</head><p>The present study was designed to propose piecewise Structural Equation Modeling and compare it with the conventional SEM for understanding the causality behind road traffic collisions. Two analytical models were run for the same model structure. The global model fit value of conventional SEM could not pass the chi-square test leading to improper results, while the goodness of fit for pSEM did with Fisher's C statistic. Test of directed separation of pSEM also informed about other lack of fit for paths not included in the model. The pSEM model performed better, particularly in forecasting collision frequencies. Values for the Akaike 134 Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) used to evaluate model performance. When the same model structure was employed to examine model fit, the pSEM model outperformed the SEM model in terms of AIC and BIC values.</p><p>SEM employed multivariate linear regression, which ignores the nature of collision data, which are infrequent, non-negative counts that may not be normally distributed in relation to explanatory factors. So, the results of SEM show that it seems not to be a proper approach to model traffic collisions. As previously stated, GLM techniques that take the discrete nature of responses into account would be a more reasonable approach. GLM, on the other hand, seems to be incapable of representing the complicated interrelationships between explanatory factors such as speeds, visibility, speed limits, and collisions. Application of pSEM extends the generalised linear modeling approach one step further by allowing it a hierarchical model structure including intermediation and provides a new inferential test called the test of directed separation to measure model fits. This paper proposes that pSEM is a more robust approach for modeling collisions than conventional SEM.</p><p>The collision frequencies of pSEM explained an average of 57% more variation when compared to those of the conventional SEM. Differences in explained variance differ between responses. Where the responses are count variables, much greater variation has been seen (collisions). This reveals linear regression's poor capacity to model traffic collisions. However, even when the response variable (in this case mean speed) is suitable for multivariate linear regression, due to it being a non-count variable, the piecewise structural equation model consistently outperforms SEM with 18.18% and 20.59% differences.</p><p>The scope of this research is confined to a model structure developed to comprehend certain types of road traffic collisions at 120 priority three-arm intersections. More studies could be done to assess the efficiency of the piecewise Structural Equation Model at various types of intersection and collisions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 .Figure 5 .</head><label>45</label><figDesc>Figure 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In terms of global goodness of fit, the SEM uses chisquare tests to compare observed and predicted covariance matrices. The null hypothesis of the chi-square test is that the covariance matrix of observation (∑) is equal to the predicted covariance matrix (∑(θ)). The Pvalue was less than 0.001 with a chi-square value of 181.642 and 48 degrees of freedom. Predicted-observed covariance matrices significantly differ from each other. Thus, the alternative hypothesis (∑ ≠ ∑(θ)) is accepted. In contrast, in the piecewise SEM, the goodness-of-fit is tested using a test of directed separation. Fisher's C statistic is 120.3 with P-value = 0.279 and on 112 degrees of freedom. The model indicates that there is no significant need to improve model fit.</p><p>Lack of fit values of the directed separation test are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The analysis revealed a few associations with high probability where p values are less than 0.05. For example, the relationship between the Mean of major road speed and left-hand visibility at 9 metres back (Vis. Left 9) is significant with a p-value = 0.012. However, one cannot reasonably infer a causal relationship between them. Minor road visibilities may be correlated to major road visibilities, which may moderate the mean speed on major roads. This connection and others were not added to the model because two reasons. Firstly, incorporating these relationships into the model is completely unnecessary. Secondly, Fisher's C statistic demonstrated that the model is adequate without the inclusion of new relationships.</p><p>The connections between non-significant predictors and response variable in the initial tested model (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) were step by step removed using the backward elimination method. Then, the results of the final pSEM and SEM models (remining connections) were presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> including the estimated coefficients, standard errors and corresponding p-values of the models. "NA" represents that connections between predictor and response variables were removed due to the backward elimination. However, the latest model forms for pSEM and SEM do not match each other. Some variables were kept in one of the models, while these variables were removed from the other. On the other hand, some variables were removed entirely from both models. For the "right turn from minor motorised vehicle-bicycle collision" scenario in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, SEM lost many response variables while pSEM kept them.</p></div>
