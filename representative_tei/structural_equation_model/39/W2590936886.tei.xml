<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As a consequence of the profound changes taking place in families and the labour market, balancing work and family is an increasing workforce demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Mercure &amp; Mircea, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In the last decades, labour conditions have changed; long working hours make it difficult to meet family responsibilities, and job insecurity has increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rhnima et al, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, changes have also occurred in families, such as the increase in dual-earner households and in the number of families with dependent family members or single parent families. In this context, when work interferes with family, work-to-family conflicts (WFC) arise <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Greenhaus &amp; Beutell, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Organizational efforts to improve employee well-being (EWB) through the development of work-family policies may help solve this problem. Work-family policies include work practices aimed at balancing work, family <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(López-Ibor et al, 2010)</ref>, and personal demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Felstead et al, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Evidence has been gathered by researchers of a positive relationship between workfamily policies and job performance in socially supportive organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Biedma-Ferrer &amp; Medina-Garrido, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">van Steenbergen &amp; Ellemers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson et al, 2002)</ref>. In line with these findings, the objective of this study was to analyse the impact that different work-family policies have on job performance. As such, we designed a model for identifying the effects that different types of work-family policies have on EWB and, ultimately, on job performance. However, according to some authors, the mere existence of work-family policies is not enough for employees to attain a work-family balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Yeandle et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Budd &amp; Mumford, 2005)</ref>. Based on this finding, a distinction was made in our study between the existence and employees' awareness of work-family policies, and true access to these policies.</p><p>This study provides added value to the existing literature on work-family policies in various forms. First, the effects that the existence and employees' awareness of workfamily policies have on job performance were separately assessed from the effects that the actual uptake of work-family policies without reprisals have on job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baxter &amp; Chesters, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McDonald et al, 2005)</ref>. In the existing literature, a distinction is not made between the adoption and the actual implementation of work-family policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McDonald et al, 2005)</ref>. As stated above, it is not enough that work-family policies are available, but employees must be aware of their existence and be provided true access to them <ref type="bibr">(Budd y Mumford, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yeandle et al, 2002)</ref> without reprisals <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gray &amp; Tudball, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bond, 2004)</ref>. True access to work-family policies requires a supportive work-life organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Las Heras et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sivatte &amp; Guadamillas, 2014)</ref>. Secondly, we present an unpublished model for determining the relationship between the existence of and access to work-family policies and job performance as mediated by EWB. In third place, the probability that WFC arise and work-family policies are implemented to solve them may differ across sectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen et al, 2015)</ref>. It would be interesting to analyse the impact of work-family policies on job performance in the sectors such as the banking sector where employees are subject to more pressure in terms of results <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Burke, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rosso, 2008)</ref>, as they are more vulnerable to WFC and consequently more urgently require the implementation of work-family policies. The contribution of this study is that it examines the relationship between work-family policies and job performance in the banking sector, a scarcely studied sector (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">van Steenbergen &amp; Ellemers, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the decision to focus our study on the banking sector was based on the dramatic impact that the economic and financial crisis had on this sector in Spain. The crisis was accompanied by major restructuring and downsizing, offices closing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alamá et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Maudas, 2011)</ref>, and increased working hours and pressure exerted on employees in a traditionally stressful sector <ref type="bibr">(Ariza-Montes et. al, 2013</ref>). An additional effect of the financial crisis is that organizations now devote fewer resources to the implementation of work-family policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mihelič &amp; &amp; Tekavčič, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>This study is structured in six sections, as follows: In Section 2, we expose the theoretical fundaments of the hypotheses formulated in this study. Section 3 describes the empirical study performed and the methodology used. Section 4 provides an analysis of the results.</p><p>Section 5 comprises a discussion of results and their implications for human resource management. Finally, the conclusions, limitations of the study, and future research lines are described in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review and hypotheses</head><p>The literature provides evidence of the difficulties that employees face in balancing work and life <ref type="bibr">(Watis et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Keene &amp; Quadagno, 2004)</ref>. The occurrence of WFC may negatively affect job satisfaction, increase turnover intent, and cause more stress and even depression among other deleterious effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sánchez-Vidal et al, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Steinmetz et al, 2008)</ref>. It seems reasonable that organizations implement policies aimed at solving WFC.</p><p>In this sense, studies have documented that the availability of work-family policies reduces the probability of WFC arising <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sivatte &amp; Guadamillas, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have concluded that the lack of work-family policies may compromise EWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Devi &amp; Nagini, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hughes &amp; Bozionelos, 2007)</ref>. In addition, work-family policies can improve job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jyothi &amp; Jyothi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kanwar et al, 2009)</ref>, job satisfaction and organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jyothi &amp; Jyothi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Poelmans &amp; Caligiuri, 2008)</ref>, where gender has a moderating influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cloninger et al, 2015)</ref>. However, as stated above, the mere existence of work-family policies does not imply that employees widely use these policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McDonald et al, 2005)</ref>. Thus, employees must be aware of the workfamily policies available in their organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Budd &amp; Mumford, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yeandle et al, 2002)</ref> and perceive that they can use them freely without reprisals <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gray &amp; Tudball, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bond, 2004)</ref>. Evidence has been provided that employees do not always know that they can use work-family policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Yeandle et al, 2002)</ref>, and they are seldom familiar with such policies adopted in their organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Budd &amp; Mumford, 2005)</ref>. Furthermore, the fact that work-family policies exist in an organization does not necessarily mean that their employees perceive they can use them freely <ref type="bibr">(Gray y Tudball, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bond, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Employees are reluctant to use work-family policies for a number of reasons: missing out on the chance to be promoted, being regarded as poorly committed to the organization, or being worried about losing their job <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baxter &amp; Chesters, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chinchilla et al, 2003)</ref>, the latter increasing as the age of the employee decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buonocore et al, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, employees should perceive that their superiors are supportive when it comes to using work-family policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hammer et al, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sivatte &amp; Guadamillas, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Reducing the incidence of WFC involves making employees perceive they can use workfamily policies freely, which requires a work-family supportive organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Las Heras et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sivatte &amp; Guadamillas, 2014)</ref>. According to the theory of perceived support, organizational work-family support is defined as the perception that one's employer provides helpful social support, regardless of the organizational policies available <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kinnunen et al, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The hypotheses formulated take into account the two aforementioned dimensions of work-family policies: on the one hand, the existence and employees' awareness of such policies and, on the other hand, employees' true access to work-family policies without suffering any negative consequences for their careers.</p><p>Following the recommendations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pasamar &amp; Valle (2011)</ref>, work-family policies were classified into four groups (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1)</ref>  The availability of work-family policies may have positive effects on certain employee psychological aspects and attitudes. Accordingly, our hypotheses posit that the existence of and access to work-family policies (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are related to EWB and job performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Work-family policies and EWB</head><p>A number of definitions of well-being have been proposed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wright, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cropanzano &amp; Wright, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Edgar et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">van Steenbergen &amp; Ellemers, 2009)</ref>, among which EWB stands out <ref type="bibr">(Zheng et al, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ilies et al, 2007)</ref>. When referring to EWB, the most common concept -the one chosen for this study-is psychological <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Edgar et al, 2015)</ref> or emotion-based EWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wright, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakker &amp; Oerlemans (2011)</ref> define EWB as the prevalence of pleasant emotions (e.g. joy or happiness) over negative emotions (e.g. sadness or anger) as a result of job satisfaction.</p><p>The fact that EWB is positively or negatively affected by the experiences of employees suggests that work-family policies relate to EWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lucia-Casademunt et al, 2013)</ref>. In this sense, work-family policies such as working time flexibility have been reported to have positive effects on EWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lewis, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, whereas WFC may have a negative impact on EWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lapierre &amp; Allen, 2006)</ref>, work-family policies might be positively related to EWB <ref type="bibr">(Zheng et al, 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Biedma-Ferrer &amp; Medina-Garrido, 2014</ref>).</p><p>Based on the potential relationship between work-family policies and EWB, we postulated that the existence of and access to different types of work-family policies (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) may influence EWB:</p><p>H3.1: The more strongly an employee perceives that work-family policies based on working time flexibility exist, the better his/her EWB.</p><p>H3.2: The more strongly an employee perceives that work-family policies based on long paid and unpaid leaves exist, the better his/her EWB.</p><p>H3.3: The more strongly an employee perceives that work-family policies based on flexibility in the work location exist, the better his/her EWB.</p><p>H3.4: The more strongly an employee perceives that work-family policies based on employee and family support services exist, the better his/her EWB.</p><p>H4.1: The more strongly an employee perceives that work-family policies based on working time flexibility are accessible, the better his/her EWB.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sample and data collection</head><p>Fieldwork was focused on the banking sector in Spain, a sector with a total of 192,265 employees. Data were collected using a closed-question, self-administered questionnaire.</p><p>Respondents received an e-mail with a link to the web-based questionnaire. Pre-testing was conducted to improve the efficacy and design of the questionnaire, prevent ambiguity, and improve measurements. Data were collected from three organizations between July and November 2014. Organization representatives were invited to participate in the study and informed that the final aggregated results would be provided to them once they were available. A total of 1,565 questionnaires were returned by respondents, who were representative of the entire Spanish population in terms of geography. Fifty-four questionnaires were withdrawn from analysis due to incomplete or missing data. Of the resulting 1,511 effective respondents, 42.4% were female and 75.9% had child or elder care responsibilities that required work-family balance. The mean age was 43.7 years (SD 8.9), and mean seniority in the company was 18.7 years (SD 11.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Measurements</head><p>The measurement model describes the linkage between theoretical constructs and empirical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fornell, 1982)</ref>. Two types of relationships are identified in this model: the The application of these criteria to all constructs justifies the use of the reflective model, since all indicators are representations of the unobserved theoretical construct they reflect, they share a common theme, are interchangeable, and are strongly correlated.</p><p>Except for job performance, multiple indicators based on respondents' rating of a series of statements on a 5-point Likert scale were used, where 1 was "strongly disagree" and 5 was "strongly agree". Firstly, to assess the existence of work-family policies in an organization, an adapted version of the Families and Work Institute (2012a, 2012b) scale was used. The adapted scale consisted of five indicators of respondents' perceptions. Thus, respondents were asked whether work-family policies were available, whether information on work-family policies was provided to them by the organization, whether they were aware of the work-family policies, whether they knew of someone who had used them and, finally, whether they had ever used work-family policies (e.g. "I have the working time flexibility I need to meet my personal and family responsibilities".) The respective alpha coefficients for each group of work-family policies were: α1=0.836, α2=0.800, α3= 0.884, α4=0.924 for flexi-time, long paid and unpaid leaves, flexi-place, and family support services, respectively.</p><p>To measure the variable Accessibility, a 2-item scale (α1=0.819, α2=0.792, α3=0.851, α4=0.885) based on the contributions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson et al (2002)</ref> and the Families and Work Institute (2012a, 2012b) was designed. In this scale, respondents have to rate how they perceive access to work-family policies in their organization and they are asked whether they can use them without reprisals (e.g. "If I used work-family support resources, it would have negative consequences for my career", with an inverse scoring system). EWB was measured using an adapted version of the reflective 4-item scale (α1=0.962, α2=0.962, α3= 0.974, α4=0.977 for flexi-time, long paid and unpaid leaves, flexi-place and family support services, respectively) designed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boshoff &amp; Mels (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Warr (1990)</ref>. This scale was based on the respondents' perception of work stress, job satisfaction, motivation to perform his/her tasks and organizational commitment (e.g., "I often feel anxious and stressed inside and outside my workplace", with inverse scoring, or "My main satisfactions in life come primarily from my job"). Finally, respondents' perception of their own job performance was measured by asking them to rate their job performance.</p><p>In line with the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boshoff &amp; Mels (2000)</ref>, the item "My organization gets the better of me in terms of job performance" was included in the questionnaire (α was not applicable, since it was a 1-item construct).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Methods</head><p>Following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hair et al (2014)</ref>, hypothesis testing was performed using a structural equation model based on the PLS-SEM approach. The methodology selected -more specifically, the data collection methods employed-, as well as the constructs tested and the indicators used were appropriate for empirically examining the correlations among theoretical variables related to organizational work-family support <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Casper et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chang et al, 2010)</ref>. Data analysis was performed using SmartPLS 3.0 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Ringle et al, 2014)</ref> and mean values were attributed to missing data using the criterion of replacement with average value. Although the parameters of the measurement model and the structural model were measured in a single step, the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chin (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hair et al (2014)</ref> for the presentation of results were adopted.</p><p>Accordingly, measurement model testing was performed first, followed by the evaluation of significance among parameters. As such, the validity and reliability of measurements was guaranteed before any conclusions were drawn on the relationships among constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Measurement model testing</head><p>In this section, we examine whether the study variables (or indicators) measured the theoretical concepts correctly. Given that all constructs were reflective, reliability was analysed first; i.e., whether the indicators actually measured what they were intended to measure. Next, validity was evaluated; i.e., whether measuring was consistently performed.</p><p>In the reliability analysis, the reliability of each item was examined separately by assessing factor loadings (lambda). For an indicator to be definitely included in the measurement model of a construct, it must have a factor loading &gt;=0.707. This involves the shared variance between the construct and its indicators being greater than the error variance. Some authors consider that this empirical rule (λ &gt;= 0.707) should not be so rigid in early stages of scale design <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al, 2014)</ref> and conclude that an indicator with a factor loading ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 can be deleted from a scale if deletion results in the average variance extracted (AVE) or Composite Reliability (CR) exceeding the minimum threshold value established (AVE = 0.5; CR = 0.7). Consequently, weak indicators can be occasionally maintained for their contribution to the validity of the content analysis measure. In any case, clearly weak indicators (≤0.4) must always be discarded.</p><p>In this study, all indicators of the measurement model were maintained, although two indicators did not reach the minimum threshold value established (λ &gt;= 0.707). This decision was based on the fact that the AVE for all latent variables exceeded 0.5, which means that it was not necessary to delete these variables to reach the minimum threshold value for AVE. Therefore, as these two indicators contribute to the validity of the content, they were maintained.</p><p>The reliability of the scale was assessed to verify the internal consistency of all indicators when measuring the concept. Scale reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's Alpha coefficient and Composite Reliability (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nunnally (1978)</ref> considered 0.7 adequate for indicating modest reliability and a stricter 0.8 for basic research. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, all constructs comfortably exceeded the threshold established for Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability, all except Cronbach's Alpha for the variable ACCESS 2, which was 0.792 and would be considered acceptable.</p><p>Construct validity was assessed by examining convergent validity and discriminant validity. Convergent validity signifies that a set of indicators represents one and the same underlying construct, which can be demonstrated through their unidimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Henseler et al, 2009)</ref>. Convergent validity is assessed through the average variance extracted (AVE), which provides a measure of the proportion of variance that can be explained by its indicators with respect to variance accounted for by measurement errors. <ref type="bibr">Fornell &amp; Lacker (1981)</ref> recommend a threshold value for AVE &gt; 0.5, which means that 50% of the construct variance can be explained by its indicators but not by the indicators of the other constructs. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, an AVE &gt;0.5 was obtained for all constructs. This means that more than 50% of the variance in the construct can be accounted for by its indicators.</p><p>Discriminant validity examines to what extent a given construct differs from other constructs. Discriminant validity was assessed using the <ref type="bibr">Fornell-Larcker criterion (1981)</ref>, which is based on the idea that, in a given model, a construct should share more variance with its indicators than with other constructs. Consequently, an effective method for assessing discriminant validity is demonstrating that the AVE for a construct is greater than the variance that the construct shares with other constructs of the same model; in other words, the correlations among constructs are lower than the square of the AVE.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows in bold that the square of the AVE for all latent variables was greater than the correlation among variables. This means that all constructs were more strongly correlated to their indicators than to those of the other constructs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>Once the goodness of fit of the measurement model was verified, the structural model was analysed by assessing significance of correlation among variables. More specifically, the variance explained by endogenous variables was measured according to their R 2 , path coefficients or standardized regression weights (Beta) and respective levels of significance. The R 2 of dependent latent variables provides a measure of the predictive power of a model and indicates the amount of variance of the construct that is accounted for by the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chin (1998)</ref> established the following threshold values for R 2 : &gt; 0.67 indicates "substantial"; &gt; 0.33 indicates "moderate" and &gt; 0.19 means a "weak" predictive value. The R 2 values obtained for this model show that the variable well-being has a weak predictive power (R 2 : 0.114, 0.128, 0.062 and 0.1912 for each group of work-family policies, respectively), whereas the predictive power of the variable "Job performance" was substantial (R 2 : 0.797, 0.809, 0.851 and 0.851 for flexi-time, long paid and unpaid leaves, flexi-place, and family support services, respectively. respectively).</p><p>The weak predictive power of the model for the variable well-being is due to the fact that apart from the existence of and access to work-family policies, this variable is affected by many other factors. These independent factors, however, were not the object of this study, and well-being, as it was measured in this study, accounts for an important proportion of variance in job performance.</p><p>In relation to path coefficients, they were calculated by bootstrapping. In accordance with standard guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al, 2014)</ref>, subsamples were created using 5,000 observations. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> displays the p-value and confidence interval obtained for each path coefficient. Additionally, the same procedure was performed to assess the potential total and indirect effects among latent variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>).  The results obtained do not support Hypothesis 1, which postulates that there may be a positive relationship between the existence of work-family policies and job performance.</p><p>Conversely, the results do demonstrate that the existence of work-family policies based on flexibility in working time, long paid and unpaid leaves, and the work location has a total positive indirect effect on performance mediated by EWB. In contrast, the same does not occur to employee and family support services.</p><p>Hypothesis 2, which states that access to work-family policies may be positively related to job performance, is also not confirmed. Nevertheless, true access to work-family policies was found to have a total positive indirect effect on job performance mediated by EWB.</p><p>Hypotheses 1 and 2 suggest that EWB has a complete (rather than partial) mediating effect. The reason is that the relation between the existence of and access to work-family policies and job performance as mediated by EWB is significant, but the direct relationship between work-family policies existence and accessibility and job performance disappears when EWB is included as a mediating variable.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 posited that the existence of work-family policies may be positively related to EWB. The results obtained confirm this hypothesis for all work-family policies groups -except for employee and family support services (Group 4)-were proven to have a slight, statistically significant effect on job performance.</p><p>Hypothesis 4 suggested that work-family policies accessibility may be positively related to EWB. This hypothesis is confirmed for all work-family policies groups, as they were found to have a slight but statistically significant effect on job performance.</p><p>Finally, hypothesis 5 is also confirmed by the results of the study. Thus, EWB has a significant effect on improvement in job performance. EWB was the only variable found to have a significant, direct effect on job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and implications for human resource management</head><p>In accordance with the results obtained in this study, the existence of and access to workfamily policies do not have a direct effect on job performance, but rather an indirect one On the other hand, our results demonstrate that the existence of and access to some types of work-family policies (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are indirectly related to job performance. This relationship has been proven to exist in all types of work-family policies except for employee and family support services (Group 4 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). In light of the above, it can be deduced that employees do not appreciate, for instance, the existence of employee and family support services for carers of children and elderly relatives as much as other workfamily policies related to working time and workplace flexibility. This finding contrasts the high proportion of respondents who had child or elder care responsibilities (75.9%).</p><p>Conversely, respondents did appreciate that the work-family policies available were actually accessible and did not involve any reprisals.</p><p>Another relevant aspect to take into account is the context where this study was carried out. It is widely known that the economic and financial crisis in Spain negatively affected labour rights -and especially work-family policies-in this sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alamá et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mihelič &amp; Tekavčič, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Maudas, 2011)</ref>. This was added to work stress and the pressure traditionally exerted on employees for the improvement of results in this sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Burke, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rosso, 2008)</ref>. In this context, it seems that employees were more concerned about maintaining their job than on their own well-being. The results of this study, however, contradict this assumption and demonstrate that EWB is positively related to job performance.</p><p>The application of the findings of this study to the sphere of human resource management is threefold. First, HR managers can improve EWB by adopting work-family policies, informing on their availability, and ensuring they can be used without reprisals. Thus, the to-do list of any company should include a supportive work-family organizational culture that promotes organizational and supervisor support to employees with family responsibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Las Heras et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sivatte &amp; Guadamillas, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the EWB generated by the implementation of work-family policies may have a positive effect on job performance and improve the cost-benefit ratio. Analysing the costbenefit ratio is helpful for managers, as the impact of work-family policies -and many other policies-on the organization is generally assessed in terms of cost-benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McDonald et al, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Third, as stated above, managers should be aware that job performance will improve more substantially if flexi-time, long leaves, and flexi-place arrangements -rather than employee and family support services-are offered to their employees.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that HR managers must take into account that work-family policies are not only important for employees with family responsibilities, but for all employees. Although work-family policies are aimed at this type of employee, increasing attention is being paid to employees without family responsibilities who want to maintain a work-life balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Felstead et al, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This study makes a theoretical and empirical contribution to better understand the impact EWB. This was found to be applicable to all groups except for employee and family support services. The existence of this type of work-family policies does not seem to have a direct or indirect effect on job performance or EWB. Yet, once this type of work-family policies has been adopted, it is important that employees perceive they can use them easily, as this has an indirect positive effect on job performance.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that fieldwork focused on a single sector -the banking sectorand on a single country -Spain-. Thus, legal and cultural differences may hinder the extrapolation of the results obtained to other sectors and countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen et al, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In future research, work-family policies should be analysed in other sectors and countries, since context may cause significant differences in terms of WFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen et al, 2015)</ref> and work-family policies.</p><p>Furthermore, other variables related to EWB should be included in future studies as model control variables. In this line, demographic, socioeconomic, sectorial, geographical, cultural variables should be also considered, among others.</p><p>Given the impact of work-family policies on EWB and job performance, further studies should be conducted on the academic and practical implications of these variables for human resource management.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>: (1) Flexibility in working time (flexi-time); (2) flexibility through long paid and unpaid leaves; (3) flexibility in work location (flexiplace); and (4) employee and family support services.</figDesc></figure>

Furthermore, their study examined the impact of work-family policies on physical EWB based on health indicators.
