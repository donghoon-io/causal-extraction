<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>COVID-19 pandemic hampered the global economy and movement of people. Education which is traditionally delivered in face-to-face settings was severely affected. This led to the temporary closure of schools and universities around the world. To ensure continuity of teaching delivery, academic institutions adopted full online learning. The sudden adoption of remote learning gained different feedback from various stakeholders. The Philippines, as one of the developing economies in Southeast Asia, had reached the mark in terms of the total no. of cumulative cases, placing the country in the 11 th to 20 th bracket. Due to this prolonged mode, students shared increasing dissatisfaction towards remote learning. This research aims to understand the causal relationship of dissatisfaction factors namely: 1) Academic Teaching, 2) Academic Support, 3) Accessibility, 4) Learner and 5) Community Social through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and 12 Engineering program outcomes designed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitude. Results show that all dissatisfactions factors have a direct influence on specific program outcomes. SO1, SO2, SO3, SO5, SO9, and SO11 were identified to be critical and need to be attended by HEIs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The  pandemic has affected day to day lives of people. The impacts of this predicament were seen and felt in the (1) healthcare, (2) economic, (3) social aspects of the economy. Indeed, the challenge to strengthen global healthcare systems to cope with the alarming rate of cases is difficult. Financial implications to businesses such as disruption of supply chain, poor cash flow in the market, and significant decrease in the revenue growth are evident as well. Service sectors are hampered in delivering properly their intended services, closure of places, schools, postponement of social activities were experienced by different countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Haleem &amp; Javaid, 2020)</ref>. Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has been abrupt. This resulted in closure of schools around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Henaku, 2020)</ref>. To ensure continuity of education, school and universities adopted full online learning. The sudden shift to distance learning brough by the pandemic challenged Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) especially</p><p>Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial <ref type="bibr">Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022</ref> professors to be innovative in teaching-learning delivery for their students <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Lapitan et al., 2020)</ref>. The prolonged closures of schools impacted both students, families, and educators to adopt distance learning. Moreover, the closure of schools brought a physical and emotional toll due to the withdrawal of nonacademic support <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hoffman &amp; Miller, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics strand posted a declining student engagement. Converting laboratory and research courses to virtual settings became a heavy challenge <ref type="bibr">(Brancaccio-Taras et al., 2021)</ref>. This was evident in a national study conducted in the Philippines, only 41% of medical students considered themselves engaged physically and mentally engaged in online learning. The respondents identified their learning barriers as technological, individual, domestic, institutional, and community. Moreover, it was pointed out that difficulty in adopting learning systems, home responsibilities, and poor communication are most frequently encountered <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baticulon et al., 2021)</ref>. During July-August 2020, a study conducted in Indonesia to measure the level of students' satisfaction on remote learning for higher education, only 19% showed very satisfaction. It was identified that limited internet access, low lecturer guidance is the main cause of dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Surahman &amp; Sulthoni, 2020</ref>). An assessment study conducted in the Philippines of undergraduate nursing students in their experience of online learning. The survey was conducted in January 2021 which show, 11.1 had very low satisfaction, 37% had low satisfaction and 46.3% had moderate satisfaction. Based on their academic performance, 3.7% answered very poorly, 37% assessed poor and 50% shown fair. In terms of satisfaction with their current academic performance, 11.1% answered not very satisfied, and 42.6% responded not satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Oducado &amp; Estoque, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The struggle of the country to cope with the immediate and long-term effects of the pandemic has been taxing its local and global resources. The delivery of education in the country was greatly hampered. In fact, the Philippines was tagged with one of the longest temporary closures of schools and universities of onsite teaching operations or face-toface classes due to current pandemic conditions. Considering that Primary, Secondary and Tertiary students, who are the younger members of the populace, are at great risk of possible transmission of the virus, the country through its governing agencies: (1) Department of Education, and (2) Commission on Higher Education decided to fully implement remote learning. As of April 2021, the country is now in its 13th consecutive month of alternative mode of teaching delivery. The sudden shift towards full remote learning brought mixed feedbacks from its stakeholdersstudents, parents, and educators.</p><p>A preliminary study was conducted in one of the largest engineering schools in the country in terms of the student population to map their collective journey of remote learning. It is evident that third-year Engineering students posted declining feedback of their remote learning experience. Furthermore, a 4-point Likert scale satisfaction assessment on achieving program outcomes during remote learning was conducted among the respondents of the preliminary study. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows that 16% of the students are very dissatisfied, 28% are dissatisfied; 16% are satisfied and none are very satisfied. Students as the primary customers of the education service system, there is a high threat posted of having unachieved satisfaction of program outcomes. Thus, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are confronted to devise strategies to prevent worsening the situation. While there has been a broad amount of literature in responding to improve the quality of remote learning, most strategies and solutions lack the ability to directly address the identified causes of Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 dissatisfaction. There is also an absence of exploring community restrictions as a possible cause of dissatisfaction. Moreover, existing strategies and responses provided by HEIs in Engineering, students still find ineffective. In the implementation of the Outcomes-Based Education in remote set-up, existing related literature do not use the achievement of specific program outcomes as a measure of quality remote learning. Thus, there is a misalignment of using a generic "Student Satisfaction" measure to address the quality of student remote learning. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a decision support tool (DST) that considers the following: (1) significant dissatisfaction factors towards remote learning, (2) specific program outcomes that are critical in students' satisfaction towards remote learning, and (3) specific strategies and actions that address both dissatisfaction factors and specific program outcomes towards quality remote learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Objectives</head><p>The relationship of the variables in the study wherein the Dissatisfaction in Achieving of Program Outcomes will be processed through hypothesis testing is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The set of factors was identified and shortlisted through an extensive review of related literature. Factors were consolidated and checked together. Moreover, to investigate more of the literature factors, a preliminary study was conducted in a local university that offers Engineering programs. Additional and unique factors were identified too. Meanwhile, the relationship of the program outcomes will be tested of attainment during the remote learning. These will be measured using a 4-point Likert scale. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>The term "remote learning" or "distance education:" refers to a teaching method in which the student and the teacher are physically separated. It can make use of a variety of technology, including email, audio, video, computers, and the Internet. Distance education's main goal is to provide educational opportunities to those who are underrepresented or who do not have access to a traditional educational institution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kentnor, 2015)</ref>. It is also an alternative system for traditional education due to its ability to reach the masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Urgan &amp; Kurubacak, 2021)</ref>. The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak that began in early 2020 has so far affected more than 200 countries and regions around the world. The global economy, education, and public life have all been severely impacted, with the greatest effect on university teaching and research operations, as well as colleges with the highest mobility of staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Yao, Li, Yohannes, &amp; Song, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022</p><p>In the Philippines, the Department of Education (DepEd) planned to end the school year for basic level institutions in late March 2020, but classes were cut short in the middle of the month due to COVID-19. The suspension of face-toface education is extended beyond the school year 2020-2021 due to the pandemic thus, the Department of Education has launched the DEPED Commons Project, which will serve as an online platform for virtual lessons that teachers and students across the country can use as an alternative. However, this is still in the trial stage and is not mandatory.</p><p>Similarly, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) suspended classes in the same month but recommended that available distance learning and alternative modes be used instead, which has yet to be implemented because virtual learning is still new to the Philippine educational system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Talidong &amp; Toquero, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the rapid growth of online tertiary education, it is evident that educators and students face several obstacles that compromise the overall standard of distance learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Markova, Glazkova, &amp; Zaborova, 2017)</ref>. Electronic learning (e-learning) is a wider approach to learning that opens new learning and teaching opportunities in a variety of fields outside of the conventional classroom setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Rodrigues, Almeida, Figueiredo, &amp; Lopes, 2019)</ref>. Students recommended that changes be made in places where they were dissatisfied, such as improving network instability, activating connections by improving unilateral interactions, and holding face-to-face classes for hands-on classroom activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Shim &amp; Lee, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Students face some learning challenges, particularly in terms of successful teaching practices and communication habits, even though degree students generally rate their distance learning experiences positively. Low selforganization, teacher lack of control, lack of successful interaction, and a sense of isolation are all factors that contribute to their dissatisfaction with their online learning experience. The results back up the hypothesis that faculty play a critical role in information creation, and they can help all tertiary sector stakeholders find ways to optimize the ICT potential in distance tertiary education <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Markova, Glazkova, &amp; Zaborova, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>While online learning is proving to be beneficial in protecting students' and faculty's health in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not as successful as traditional learning. The study's findings revealed that in underdeveloped countries like Pakistan, where most students are unable to access the internet due to technological and financial barriers, online learning is unable to yield desired results. Other concerns raised by higher education students included a lack of face-to-face contact with the teacher, response time, and the absence of typical classroom socialization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Adnan &amp; Anwar, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The growing number of students enrolled in distance education supports online learning as a viable alternative to conventional classroom. As a result of the various geographical locations used for the studies, accessibility problems such as internet connectivity, using compatible smartphones and laptops have been described as a significant challenge to online learning. According to the findings of a study conducted in Ghana, students were not prepared for an online learning environment in this pandemic period. Another important consideration is that the students are already used to the conventional teaching system. People are also attached to accepted pedagogies and propositions, according to research, so implementing new trends or modifying an existing one is likely to face resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Aboagye, Yawson, &amp; Appiah, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>A study in India found that the biggest problem identified by participants was technical constraints. Lack of access to internet would exclude some of the learners from the online courses. Slow connections will make it difficult to access course platforms and materials. The respondents also expressed concern about a lack of culture. It is difficult to create a welcoming learning atmosphere or a sense of community in an online setting. The instructor's incompetence was also shown by the survey. The teacher should try to make lectures enjoyable and successful to maintain the learner's interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Muthuprasad, Aiswarya, Aditya, &amp; Jha, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Teaching and learning are dynamic processes that are affected by factors other than the teaching method. Professional education and teacher preparation, especially in e-learning systems, must be prioritized. E-learning/blended courses should be designed to facilitate coherence between online and offline activities, campus-related and practice-related activities, and interactions between students, instructors, and materials. Specific course designs must be created to be applicable in a specific setting. In terms of educator roles and relationships, educators, and higher education institutions (HEIs) should encourage strong educator involvement in online settings as well as the development of online learning communities that foster positive relationships <ref type="bibr">(Nortvig, Petersen, &amp; Balle)</ref>.</p><p>Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022</p><p>Stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mortazavi, Salehabadi, Sharifzadeh, &amp; Ghardashi, 2021)</ref>, virtual education has generated a negative experience among students for numerous reasons, including the lack of distance learning facilities and the lack of a standard for preparing quality content. Dissatisfaction factors with the virtual teaching include weakness of the uploaded educational contents, lack of substantive input due to the offline virtual teaching and inability of discussion with the teachers, communication &amp; channel problems (ISP issues -cost, bandwidth) and lack of preparedness of the receiver of the message.</p><p>All education stakeholders' comprehensive approach to teaching and learning is impacted by remote learning. Faculty and students stated that they were unable to teach and learn practical and clinical work using online learning modalities. They were only able to teach and evaluate the information portion. Teachers were unable to determine students' comprehension during online lectures due to a lack of immediate feedback. Students also mentioned their short attention span and the resource-intensive nature of online learning as drawbacks. Some teachers have reported that students misbehaved and attempted to access online tools during tests while studying online (Mukhtar, Javed, Arooj, &amp; Sethi).</p><p>Indeed, the pandemic disrupted the service industry. Education being one of the largest service industries globally, was required to transform its delivery to remote set-up. Various HEIs have adopted different types on delivering their education service. The adoption of remote learning has mixed acknowledgements. Most of the research, posted its implementation is not well received by students. Students develop dissatisfaction towards remote learning.</p><p>Government and HEIs responses have made but none of these try to provide specific for the remote learning process, addressing the dissatisfied factors.</p><p>Considering the Philippines as a developing country, particularly the Engineering education sector, received alarming unsatisfied feedback from their students towards the remote learning. From the existing studies, the researchers would want to investigate the following factors(See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) that cause dissatisfaction on attainment the program outcomes. These factors will undergo interactional analysis towards dissatisfaction of the attainment of program outcomes. The general factors will be considered as latent constructs.</p><p>Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022</p></div>

Through modifications, the Final SEM is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> (right).</p><p>From the 12 program outcomes used as variables in the study, only 6 emerged as directly influenced by specific dissatisfaction factors. These are SO1 (An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics and science appropriately to solve Engineering problems), SO2 (An ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data accordingly), SO3 (An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability and sustainability, in accordance with standards), SO5(An ability to identify, formulate, and solve Engineering problems correctly), SO9 (The recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning), and SO11 (An ability to use techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for the practice of Engineering).</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, for Academic Teaching, ATEACH2, ATEACH4, ATEACH5, and ATEACH6 were identified as the largest significant measured variables. Only ASSUP1 and ASSUP2 were determined for Academic Support. ACC3 and ACC4 remained significant for Accessibility.
