<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>School boards are expected to monitor and enhance the educational quality of their schools. To know whether and how school boards are able to do so, we first of all need to know whether school boards are aware of the educational quality of their schools in the first place. Taking Dutch school boards in primary education as an exemplary case (N ¼ 332) we developed and tested a path model using structural equation modelling to analyse the extent to which school boards discern educational quality in their schools. The results show that, in general, school boards in primary education believe that they can contribute to enhancing the quality of school education. If the school board and school(s) management stick to their governing and management roles respectively, this positively affects the extent to which the school board is able to identify educational quality in the schools it governs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Concerns about the quality of school education have grown in many countries, triggered in part by international benchmark results, such as PISA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hooge et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Grek, 2009)</ref>. These concerns keep pace with the manifestation of the effects of decentralization in education: a more limited and indirect role of central government in steering education, coupled with increased school autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hudson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pierre and Peters, 2005)</ref>. Next to increased sensitivity of demand, competition between schools and the enhanced influence of parents and other local stakeholders, decentralization has led to greater autonomy for school boards in taking decisions relating to resource allocation and/or curriculum and assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(OECD, 2011)</ref>. In relation to these developments there is an increasing interest in the governance of educational organizations and the role school boards play in this regard.</p><p>A limited but growing amount of research is taking the role and influence of school boards into account when explaining the quality of school education. In order to take responsibility for and manage the quality of school education, it is a prerequisite that school boards have a picture of the quality of the service delivery of their schools in the first place. This article analyses to what extent school boards are capable of establishing the level of educational quality in their schools, and studies the factors that contribute to this awareness. We have formulated the following central research question: 'To what extent do school boards have a picture of the quality of school education and how can this be explained?'</p><p>Studying school boards in primary education in the Netherlands is important to answering our research question for two reasons. First, these school boards have a broad scope of autonomy concerning the allocation of resources, personnel matters, infrastructure of buildings, and curriculum and assessment. Indeed, their decision-making power has grown during the period 1980-2010, due to decentralization and increased school autonomy policies. When considering the number of autonomous and powerful school boards, the Netherlands ranks among the top of all developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(OECD, 2011)</ref>. Second, the programme theory underlying Dutch educational policy presupposes that school boards have a significant role in assuring the quality of school education. The recently adopted Good Education, Good Governance Act 2010, particularly, holds school boards ultimately responsible for guaranteeing educational quality <ref type="bibr">(Staatsblad, 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Staatsblad, , 2010b))</ref>. Taking this as a starting point, one would expect Dutch school boards to have a picture of the quality of education in the schools they govern, especially school boards in primary education, because they operate more closely to primary processes in their schools than school boards in secondary and tertiary education do <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blokdijk and Goodijk, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turkenburg, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>School Boards in the Netherlands</head><p>Traditionally, there are differences between the composition of the school boards of private and public schools, and in the ways they are governed. State dependent private schools have always been privately run, are based on religious denomination or life philosophy, but receive the same financial support from the government that public schools do. Public schools were established by the state, are neutral and for a long time were run by local government. Over the last two decades, however, a major shift in power has taken place from local government to public school boards. Consequently, almost all Dutch primary schools are currently publicly funded and privately run. Almost one-half of the school boards in primary education (46%) run just one school, one-third (34%) run 2 to 10 schools and one-fifth (20%) run more than 10 schools. 1  The members of school boards in primary education are mostly men (76%), their average age is between 40 and 59 years and they are highly educated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Honingh and Hooge, 2012)</ref>. In 2011 half of all school governors (48%) in primary education were parents, but they are not evenly distributed across all school boards <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Honingh and Hooge, 2012)</ref>. One-sixth of the school boards consists only of parents and another one-sixth consists of a majority of parents, supplemented with other voluntary governors (citizens, members of a religious or life philosophy community or professionals with specific expertise such as law, finance, HRM or education). Two-sixths of school boards in primary education consists of no parents but of at least one professional governor, supplemented with voluntary governors.</p><p>It is important to mention here that, since they are appointed, school board members in the Netherlands function as trustees rather than as representatives. The voluntary governors (laypersons receiving a honorarium) are appointed by cooptation, which means that the current</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">140 Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership 42(4S)</formula><p>members of a school board jointly recruit and appoint a new board member in case of a vacancy. Professional governors (receiving a salary) are appointed by their internal supervisors. 2 In many other countries (for example, the USA) members of school boards are elected officials and therefore operate in a political environment in which they are held accountable through such means as elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alsbury, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saatcioglu et al., 2011)</ref>. Compared to these countries, school boards in the Netherlands lack democratic accountability mechanisms and operate at a relative distance from the political dynamics of government.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background</head><p>In contrast to the substantial amount of research on how and to what extent school organization, school leadership, professionalism of teachers, teaching methods and parental involvement affect student achievement and the quality of school education, little research has been carried out to investigate the influence and effects of school boards <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Claassen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">French et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Land, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saatcioglu et al., 2011)</ref>. As school boards seem somewhat understudied, we lack knowledge about the implications and effects of school boards, their governing styles and board-related characteristics that might affect the quality of education.</p><p>Building on the notion that student achievement and the quality of school education is affected by school leadership, the comprehensive review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Leithwood et al. (2008)</ref> is of interest here. <ref type="bibr">They (2008: 28)</ref> conclude that school leadership 'is second only to classroom teaching as an influence of pupil learning' but that school leadership 'acts as a catalyst without which other good things are quite unlikely to happen'. Applying this mechanism to school governance, it probably ranks third (or fourth) compared to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning, but still can 'serve for unleashing the potential capacities that already exists in the organization' <ref type="bibr">(Leithwood et al., 2008: 28)</ref>.</p><p>The above hypothesis postulating a very modest, indirect, but significant influence of school board governance on the quality of school education is confirmed by the small amount of research on the topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alsbury, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">French et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Plough, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saatcioglu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sampson, 2011)</ref>. Many researchers affirm that school board governance matters in an indirect way via leadership and structural and cultural factors of school organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Claassen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hofman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Land, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Revell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Roberts and Sampson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saatcioglu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wylie, 2007)</ref>. From this perspective, school board governance can be seen as a precondition for and a way to facilitate those who are directly responsible for the teaching process. <ref type="bibr">Saatcioglu et al. (2011: 2)</ref> explain this indirect effect by the effects of board practices and processes that 'are likely to trickle down through several layers of implementation'.</p><p>One of the characteristics of effective school board governance is the focus on the quality of school education <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Land, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAdams, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Plough, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ranson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wylie, 2007)</ref>. This means that school boards actually have the quality of the school(s) in the picture, for example, the output, outcomes, quality, and strengths and weaknesses of the (organization of the) educational learning processes, of staff professional development and of school(s) organization. The research literature also reveals several factors that may impact on whether school boards have a picture of the quality of the education in the schools that they govern. It turns out that much depends on the governing role the school board takes and is given. <ref type="bibr">Cornforth (2003: 12)</ref> identifies six different governing roles for non-profit sector boards that can be applied to school boards. One of these models describes boards as having a role in improving the quality of their service delivery: the education in the schools that they govern. This role is of particular interest here: it explains how Hooge and Honingh: Are School Boards aware of the educational quality of their schools? 141 boards can take this role by adding value with top-level decisions, strategy, through partnering and supporting managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cornforth, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>To unravel the school boards' role in improving the quality of school education, we distinguish three aspects of this role here.</p><p>(1) The aspect of attaching importance to steering the quality of school education Not every school board attaches importance to steering the quality of school education. Just like boards of other social enterprises, school boards always have to balance social goals (for example, the quality of school education) with business goals (for example, efficiency), and the scales can tip either way: towards focusing too much on social goals at the expense of building a sustainable business, or vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Spear et al., 2007)</ref>. Until recently, Dutch school boards have been primarily concerned with financial, legal and personnel issues, conventionally leaving the responsibility for the quality of school education to school managers and teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Claassen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turkenburg, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Warthenberg-Cras and Van Kessel, 2007)</ref>. In 2007, for instance, less than onehalf of Dutch school boards in primary education (43%) reported that they handled a great deal of policy focused on quality control: financial and school building issues received more attention. Moreover, less than one-half of school boards (39%) considered educational outcomes a very important aspect of the mission statement <ref type="bibr">(Turkenburg, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>(2) The aspect of contributing to the quality of school education It is assumed that the degree to which school boards are inclined to take up the role of improving the quality of school education will depend in part on the 'will' and 'skill' of board members <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(McAdams, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mordaunt and Cornforth, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pettigrew and McNulty, 1995)</ref>. School boards need to be willing to contribute to the quality of service delivery and quality improvement of the schools they govern. For school boards to adopt a theory of action for monitoring the quality of school education and to create desired improvements, this first requires the basic conviction that 'school does matter' for achieving the potential of every child. It also demands skills such as leadership and teamwork, and the will to be successful in using power sources effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(McAdams, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>(3) The aspect of the governing style In the literature different governing styles are associated with effective governance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bush and Gamage, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAdams, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mordaunt and Cornforth, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ranson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Spear et al., 2007)</ref>. Governing styles are characterized by the level of activity of school boards, varying from an '''inactive'' governing body where governors fulfill only their minimum statutory role and delegate most of their responsibilities to their professional staff' to a '''proactive'' governing body where governors want to be directly involved in all policy matters and may seek to influence operational management' <ref type="bibr">(Bush and Gamage, 2001: 41)</ref>. School boards with a consultative sounding style (leaving authority with the school(s) management) and/or an executive style (partnering with the school(s) management, scrutinizing performance as well as taking overall responsibility) are identified as being effective in <ref type="bibr">Ranson et al.'s (2005)</ref> research project about school governance and school improvement. In line with these findings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAdams (2006)</ref> reports that an executive style ('managed instruction') is effective for school boards governing and aiming to improve mainly low-performing schools. An executive style entails interfering in the (organization of the)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>142</head><p>Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership 42(4S)</p><p>educational-learning processes and professional development in schools. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAdams (2006)</ref> school boards should adapt their governing style to the circumstances of each school, as soon as a larger number of schools reach relatively high performance levels. School boards can adopt a less executive style with some schools, widening the parameters for the schools to manage staff and curriculum and expanding school accountability. In other schools, school boards maintain control of teaching materials and professional development. Once all schools have reached acceptable and stable performance levels, school boards can let the reins and choose styles focusing on participative management, employee involvement and results. Until recently, this idea of having an executive style and/or mixing governing styles to adapt to the situation in the school(s) ran counter to conventional wisdom in the Netherlands that the school boards' role is mainly strategic <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hooge and Honingh, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Claassen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tils, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turkenburg, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Warthenberg-Cras and Van Kessel, 2007)</ref>. In general, Dutch school boards are reluctant to focus on educational learning processes and professional development in the schools they govern. They are apt to consider this as 'micro-management', which interferes inappropriately with school management. School management and teachers, in turn, could perceive this as an expression of 'distrust' or an admission of failure.</p><p>Governing roles are neither monolithic nor static. School boards can combine and change their roles, depending on contextual or strategic factors. Tension and conflict seem most likely to occur when governors and managers have different perceptions and expectations of their respective roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hall, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mordaunt and Cornforth, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Spear et al., 2007)</ref>. When roles are unclear it is difficult for both governors and managers to stick to their roles and act accordingly: <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Robinson et al. (2003)</ref> point out that interpreting the requirements of the governance role is one of the main difficulties of school governance.</p><p>To summarize, in applying the general notion that the governing role of a school board can affect whether school boards have a picture of the quality of school education, we focus here on the influence of the school boards' ascribed role of improving the quality of school education. We have disassembled this role into three parts: (1) attaching importance to the steering of the quality of the education; (2) the will and skill to contribute to the quality of education; and (3) the governing style. To explain whether school boards can discern the quality of school education in the school(s) they govern, we also take into account the extent to which school board and school(s) management stick to their respectively governing and management roles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>In this section, we present the operationalization of the variables and amplify the features of the sample, the scores on the endogenous and exogenous variables, the explanatory variables and the use of structural equation modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Through a dataset of the PO-raad (the Dutch branche organization for school boards in primary education), we invited all chairpersons of the 1225 school boards in October 2010 to participate in our study, a total of 332 chairpersons completed and returned the questionnaires, thus generating a response rate of 27%. To determine the representativeness of our sample, we compared it with the population of Dutch school boards according to board size (the number of schools that is governed by the school board) and denomination. The facts that: (1) small school boards that run just one Hooge and Honingh: Are School Boards aware of the educational quality of their schools? 143 school are underrepresented (39% in the response group and 46% in the population); (2) school boards that run 10 to 20 schools are overrepresented (20% in the response group and 13% in the population); and (3) school boards with a public denomination are overrepresented (21% in the response group and 13% in the population) make it clear that our sample is not representative of the Dutch school boards.</p><p>Responses in which only a few items were missing were retained for data analysis after using the expectation maximization algorithm to address the problem of missing items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endogenous and Exogenous Variables</head><p>In our conceptual framework, we distinguished 'the extent to which school boards have a picture of the quality of the education their schools provide' (PQ) as the endogenous (dependent) variable. This variable was represented by five items, with a Cronbach's alpha score of 0.79 (see Appendix 1). These items were presented to the respondents in the form of propositions, and the respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed with these propositions according to a five-point response scale (range 1-5). In Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS 19), which was used in this study, the standardized regression weights of the items ranged from 0.56-0.72.</p><p>The exogenous (independent) variables included in the analyses were 'the extent to which school boards think they can contribute to the quality of the education their schools provide' (CQ), 'the extent to which school boards attach importance to steering the quality of the education their schools provide' (AISQ), 'the extent to which the school boards have an executive style' (DS), 'the extent to which school boards stick to their governing role' (GR) and 'the extent to which school boards perceive that the school(s) management sticks to its management role' (MR).</p><p>All variables were represented by multiple items (3-6) with Cronbach's alpha scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.86 (see Appendix 1). The items were presented to the respondents in the form of propositions. The respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed with these propositions according to a five-point response scale. In AMOS 18 the standardized regression weights of the six items measuring CQ ranged from 0.62 to 0.71, those of the three items measuring AISQ ranged from 0.74 to 0.82, those of the five items measuring ES ranged from 0.61 to 0.82; those of the four items measuring GR ranged from 0.52 to 0.81; and the standardized regression weights of the four items measuring MR ranged from 0.62 to 0.82.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background Variables</head><p>We also controlled for the effects of 16 school board characteristics. The school board structure and composition characteristics that were included in the analysis are the number of schools that are governed by the board (NS), the number of members belonging to the school board (NM), percentage of men belonging to the school board (PM), the percentage of parents belonging to the school board (PP), the percentage of highly educated members belonging to the school board (PHE) and the percentage of average educated members belonging to the school board (PAE).</p><p>For school boards having a supervisory board (SV) we used a dummy (0 not having a supervisory board and 1 for having a supervisory board).</p><p>Two indicators were used to determine the extent to which school boards set goals with respect to outcomes. We used dummies for school boards that had set targets regarding the learning outcomes at the schools (SGBLO) and for supervisory boards that had made agreements with the 144</p><p>Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership 42(4S)</p><p>school board about the learning outcomes (0 for not having set targets and 1 for having set targets, 0 for not having agreed on outcomes and 1 for having agreed on outcomes). Seven indicators were included to analyse whether the school board held itself accountable to different horizontal stakeholders. Here we also used dummies (0 for not holding itself accountable and 1 for holding itself accountable): the school board holds itself accountable for its mission/vision (AMV), the school board holds itself accountable for its policies and goals (APG), the school board holds itself accountable for the teaching content and methods in the school (ATCM), the school board holds itself accountable for the pedagogical approach in the school (APA), the school board holds itself accountable for the quality of school education in the school (AQE), the school board holds itself accountable for the quality of the teaching staff in the school (ATS), the school board holds itself accountable for the learning/educational outcomes at the school (ALEA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothetical Model</head><p>Our hypothetical model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The arrows illustrate the direct effects that we expected to find. The exogenous and endogenous variables are presented within ovals. The ovals indicate that these variables represent latent constructs measured by more than one item (AMOS considers them unobserved variables). The background variables are presented in a rectangular box.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Modelling</head><p>We used structural equation modelling to test our theoretical propositions regarding the empirical relationships between the constructs AISQ, CQ, ES, GR, MR and PQ. We also examined the directionality of significant relationships in order to answer our research questions.</p><p>In the analyses, we started with a 'full model' that included all of the variables presented in our theoretical framework. We used a stepwise procedure to trim the model, excluding the non-significant variances and predictors with non-significant regression coefficients one at a time. AMOS 19.0 was used for this. The robustness of the theoretical model was evaluated according to (1) the appropriateness of the direction, strength and significance of parameter estimates, (2) various statistical tests and fit indices, including a chi-square test of fit (w 2 ), the root mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) and (3) the model's ability to explain the variance (R 2 ) of satisfaction in both teacher samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hox (2002)</ref> argues the importance of including more than one goodness-of-fit index and selecting indices that are based on different principles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Yu (2002)</ref> prefer the TLI, CFI and RMSEA for onetime analyses. <ref type="bibr">Schreiber and colleagues (2006)</ref> identify the RMSEA as a suitable index for evaluating the fit of a model. This index is based on the difference between the predicted and observed covariances while controlling for the complexity of the model. In general, smaller RMSEA scores indicate better fit. The following is a general threshold guideline for accepting a model: RMSEA &lt; 0.06-0.08.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>First, we present the descriptive results (see Appendix 1). School boards in primary education are aware of the quality of the education their school provides. The chairpersons of the school boards Hooge and Honingh: Are School Boards aware of the educational quality of their schools? 145 report from being neutral to agreeing (3.7 on a five-point response scale (range 1-5), five items, SD 0.6) with this statement. Furthermore, school boards attach importance to steering the quality of education (3.6 on a five-point response scale, three items, SD 0.7) and, to a significantly greater extent With respect to the third aspect of the governance style, the chairpersons of the school boards report from being neutral to disagreeing (2.8 on a five-point response scale, five items, SD 0.7) with the statement that the school board has an executive style.</p><p>Finally, our data reveal that school boards and school management stick to their roles. This has been measured by asking the chairpersons of the school boards whether the school board sticks to its governing role (agree: 4.1 on a five-point response scale, four items, SD 0.5) as well as asking whether school management sticks to its management role (agree: 4.1 on a five-point response scale, four items, SD 0.4).</p><p>Addressing our research question, evidence emerged in support of the trimmed model and its robustness across the sample of school boards, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Decentralization policies in conjunction with concerns about the quality of school education have given rise to an increasing interest in effective school governance and the role school boards can play in this regard. Our theoretical reflection on the influence of school boards on the quality of school education presented in this study reveals an indirect but significant influence. To actually be able to take responsibility for the quality of school education and steer it, it is prerequisite that school boards are aware of the quality of service delivery of their school. In this article we have investigated whether and how school boards get a picture of the quality of school education. We have formulated the following central research question: 'To what extent do school boards have a picture of the quality of school education at the schools they govern and how can this be explained?'</p><p>The Netherlands is one countries with a large number of autonomous and powerful school boards. The Dutch educational system presupposes that school boards matter for the quality of school education. For this reason, we have chosen the Netherlands as an exemplary case representing a good example of the phenomenon we are interested in. We have directed our research on Dutch school boards focusing primarily on the effects of the school boards' governing role on the picture of the quality of school education that school boards have. Our analyses confirm that this aspect of the school boards' governing role, and sticking to it, does affect the school boards' picture of the quality of school education, both directly and indirectly.</p><p>Before discussing our findings, two limitations should be considered. Because all the measures were obtained through self-reporting by the chairpersons of school boards, common method variance is a problem, as are social desirability effects. Although self-report data are commonly used to measure the self-perception of individuals, it is important to remember that they may not reflect the actual performance of the respondents.</p><p>The second limitation concerns our sample, which is not representative of Dutch primary school board population. Moreover, the low response rate calls into question the validity of the results. We assume that our findings are less applicable to small school boards (governing just one school) as these school boards are underrepresented in the sample. We assert that, for this reason, the result that the background variable 'size of the school board' (the number of schools that fall under the school board [NS]) does not affect our endogenous variable, should be interpreted with caution.  Altogether, our findings confirm the observations made in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blokdijk and Goodijk (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tils (2011)</ref> that Dutch school boards, on average, are aware of the quality of the education their school provides. This contrasts with observations of the situation approximately five years' ago as presented in the studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Claassen et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr">), Turkenburg (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Warthenberg-Cras and Van Kessel (2007)</ref>. The increased attention for the quality of school education of school boards can in part be explained by the increased pressure of the Dutch Inspectorate of Education using risk-based selective school inspections of potentially underperforming schools since 2007. The risk-based school inspection approach directly targets school boards, for instance by interviewing the school board in case early warning analysis points to potential risks, or by instructing the school board to formulate a plan of approach aimed at improving quality, and so on Another partial explanation could be the adoption of the 'Good Education, Good Governance' Act 2010. This law aims at improving school governance and the quality of school education by requiring school boards to arrange for internal supervision and to comply with a Good Governance Code, established by the Dutch branch organization for school boards in primary education. This code demands school boards to focus on the quality of school education.</p><p>Our most important conclusion affirms earlier research results presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAdams (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mordaunt and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cornforth (2010), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pettigrew and</ref><ref type="bibr">McNulty (1995)</ref>. The more school boards take up their governing role in steering and improving the quality of school education in the sense that they are 'thinking that they can contribute to the quality of school education', the more they are aware of the quality of school education. Thus, school boards' belief in their own capacities and significance matter for having a picture of the quality of school education, which is considered to be prerequisite for actually steering and improving the quality of school education.</p><p>In contrast to our hypothesis, the aspect of the governing role in steering and improving the quality of school education in the sense of 'attaching importance to steering the quality of school education' does not affect school boards having a picture of the quality of school education directly, but only via the other aspect of the governing role, namely 'thinking that the school board can contribute to the quality of school education'.</p><p>The aspect of 'governing style', that we have included in our definition of the governing role in steering and improving the quality of school education, does not affect school boards having a picture of the quality of school education at all. The results show that the extent to which school boards have an executive style does not matter for school boards having a picture of the quality of school education, neither in a positive, nor in a negative way.</p><p>Deeper reflection on these results leads to more insight in the broad concept of the school boards' role in improving the quality of school education.</p><p>First, our results reveal that this role can be unravelled into two aspects forming a conditional chain: the aspect of attaching importance to steering the quality of school education is conditional for the 'will' and 'skill' of the school board to contribute to the quality of school education.</p><p>Second, our results do not suggest that governing style, measured here in terms of having an executive style, influences the school boards' role in improving the quality of school education, despite our expectation that it would, based on theory and former research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bush and Gamage, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAdams, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ranson et al., 2005</ref>). An explanation for this can be found in the research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McAdams (2006)</ref>, which asserts there is no one best style for effective school governance. Building on the work of McAdams, we conclude here that the extent to which school boards have an executive style as such does not matter for a school board taking a role to improve the quality of Hooge and Honingh: Are School Boards aware of the educational quality of their schools? 149 school education in general, but we assume instead that what does matter is the degree to which the school board is able to adapt its executive style to the situation of the school it governs. Unfortunately, we are not able to test this assumption with our data. The extent to which a primary school board sticks to its governing role, whether it is an executive style or not, appears to matter for the extent to which school boards are aware of the quality of school education. Notably the extent to which school management sticks to its management role (as perceived by the chairperson of the school board) turns out to even more strongly affect school boards having a picture of the quality of school education. This is not only a confirmation of the theoretical notion that when roles are clear it is easier to stick to them and act accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mordaunt and Cornforth, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Spear et al., 2007)</ref> but also underlines the importance of school management behaviour for school boards having a picture of the quality of school education, which is considered to be prerequisite for actually steering and improving the quality of school education.</p><p>Finally, our study reveals that the more school boards attach importance to steering the quality of education their school provides, the more they think it can contribute to it and the more they are aware of it. This is a promising conditional chain for school boards in focusing on the quality of school education and student achievement in order to actually deliver good schooling.</p></div>

Internal supervision is a mechanism to control an organization's performance, the functioning of its board and the plans board members develop and carry out <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zattoni and Cuomo, 2010)</ref>. Recently, school boards in primary education are required by law to arrange for internal supervision and guaranteeing a clear separation between governing and supervising functions. In the Netherlands, it is generally agreed that the internal supervisory function in the governance of public sector organizations involves three tasks <ref type="bibr">(Author and Author, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blokdijk and Goodijk, 2012)</ref>: 1) decision control, 2) acting as the employer of the governors and 3) assisting with advice and being a sounding board. Internal supervision can be structured in various ways through either a one tier or a two tier structure. The internal supervisors are laypersons (citizens, stakeholders, members of a religious or life philosophy community or professionals with specific expertise such as law, finance, HRM or education) and are appointed by cooptation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
