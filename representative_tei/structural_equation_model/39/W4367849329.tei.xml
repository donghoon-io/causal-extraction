<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) dramatically impacted the world population, and a large portion of patients progressed to hospitalization due to worsening symptoms <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.

The onset of exacerbated systemic in ammation is commonly observed with the progression of COVID-19 symptoms, and has been identi ed as a key factor for the aggravation of symptoms in patients with pre-existing chronic in ammatory diseases <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Due to the presence of common comorbidities and a possible in ammatory breakdown connection, periodontitis was supposely associated with the infectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and progression of COVID-19 symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. A translocation of SARS-CoV-2 in a periodontal-vascular-pulmonary route by angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) biding <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> can change the coagulation cascade in both diseases, and is expressed as high blood levels of D-dimer, that is a common risk factor for periodontitis and COVID- <ref type="bibr">19 [6, 7, 17, 18]</ref>. Moreover, the direct aspiration or inoculation of periodontal pathogens into the lower respiratory tract developing ventilatory-associated pneumonia has also been considered a biological mechanism for this association <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref>.</p><p>Based on these hypotheses, previous observational studies suggested that periodontitis (assessed by radiographs or selfreported) was correlated with severe COVID-19 outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Severe periodontitis was also associated with higher infection levels by SARS-CoV-2, hospital admission requiring assisted ventilation, COVID-19 pneumonia, and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">26]</ref>. A recent metaanalysis also indicated that patients with COVID-19 and periodontitis had a higher risk of hospitalization, assisted ventilation, and death <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Another preliminary clinical study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients corroborated the association between periodontitis and ICU admission, incidence of critical symptoms, and risk of death, when adjusted for the patient's age and hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. However, a deeper investigation of periodontal features and in-depth assessment of the paths of the relationship between the worst frame of periodontitis and COVID-19 is still lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the periodontal condition in COVID-19 patients and determine the association between severe generalized periodontitis and COVID-19 outcomes in a multidirectional study using a structural equation modeling analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study location, design, and sample</head><p>This observational study was designed following the Declaration of Helsinki's principles. A convenience sample of COVID-19 patients was recruited between August 2020 and October 2021. Participants were selected at two reference hospitals for exclusive for COVID-19 patients during the pandemic outbreak (the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Goias -HC/UFG, and the COVID-19 State-run Hospital -HCamp) of Goiania, State of Goias, Brazil. The research protocol was previously approved by the related ethical committees (CAEE 38088920.9.0000.5083 / 38088920.9.3001.5078 / 38088920.9.3002.5082), and all participants or responsible relatives provided a written consent to participate in the study.</p><p>All participants were hospitalized and had con rmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by qRT-PCR tests, the minimum age was 18 years, and at least one typical COVID-19 symptom was present at the time of recruitment <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. Included participants were assessed during scheduled visits that occurred once a week in the restricted areas of COVID-19 patients. Only individuals with acceptable clinical conditions for the oral examination procedures were included. Exclusion criteria comprised diagnosis of sepsis or infections with multi-resistant bacteria, missing data on qRT-PCR exams and study endpoints, impossibility to perform periodontal probing, and edentulous subjects.</p><p>Recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) practices for routine healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic were adopted for all examinations in the hospital environment. Patients and nursing teams were instructed to perform oral hygiene measures, and all patients were referred to periodontal treatment at the university dental clinics after hospital discharge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical, sociodemographic, and COVID-19 outcomes information</head><p>Medical and sociodemographic data were collected from medical records. Self-reported data comprised pregnancy, history of liver diseases, cancer, osteoporosis, thyroid diseases, arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Sociodemographic data included age, gender, race, educational level, and monthly family income. For data analysis, age, comorbidities, and conditions associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 aggravation were considered, including diabetes, obesity (BMI ≥ 30), hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and smoking.</p><p>Hospitalization features and COVID-19 outcomes were assessed during and at the end of the hospitalization period. The study's dependent variables included:</p><p>1. Level of symptoms: the most severe status of symptoms during hospitalization, classi ed as mild, moderate, severe, or critical, according to the WHO <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>; 2. Admission and referral to ICU; 3. Length of stay in ICU or total in hospital (in days); 4. Hospitalization endpoint: discharge or death; 5. Type of ventilation support: mechanical ventilator (invasive or noninvasive);</p><p>. Extent of pulmonary involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical periodontal variables</head><p>Periodontal probing was performed preferably within the rst (n = 136, 63.6%) or second week (n = 54, 25.2%) after hospital admission. Examinations were performed by a periodontist (CAC) under external illumination in the patient care setting. Intraexaminer reliability was assessed in a pilot analysis of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) measurements in 48-hour duplicated assessments in ve non-COVID-19 patients with stage III generalized periodontitis. Comprehensive periodontal clinical examination, including PD, CAL, and bleeding on probing at six sites per tooth in all teeth was performed to categorize patients according to their periodontal statuses. The clinical periodontal variables included were:</p><p>1. Periodontal status: patients were classi ed as healthy or with gingivitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> or periodontitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, based on a classi cation of periodontal diseases and conditions <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. Gingival health was de ned as &lt; 10% bleeding sites with PD ≤ 3 mm; gingivitis was de ned as ≥ 10% bleeding sites with PD ≤ 3 mm; and periodontitis was de ned as a detectable interdental CAL at ≥ 2 nonadjacent teeth, or buccal or oral CAL ≥ 3 mm with pocketing ≥ 3 mm at ≥ 2 teeth when not ascribed to non-periodontitisrelated causes.</p><p>2. Severity and extension of periodontitis: patients with periodontitis were dichotomized according to the severity of the disease into mild and moderate (stages I/II, up to 4 mm interproximal attachment loss) or severe disease (stages III/IV, more than 5 mm of interproximal attachment loss), and according to the extension of the disease into localized (up to 30% of teeth affected) or generalized (30% or more teeth affected) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Data analysis was performed using the SPSS 1 , v. 23.0, and Mplus v.8.8 softwares <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Analyses included descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis using the Chi-square test, and Structure Equation Modeling (SEM).</p><p>For SEM analysis, periodontal status was divided into three categories: (1) diagnosis of healthy or gingivitis, (2) localized or generalized periodontitis stages I and II and localized periodontitis stages III and IV, (3) severe (stages III and IV) generalized periodontitis. Then, a theoretical model was constructed using SEM analysis to estimate the association between severe generalized periodontitis and severe-critical symptoms, ICU admission, and death of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Information on the presence of two or more comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or obesity), patient's age, and smoking were included in the model as possible confounders. The Weighted Least Squares estimation method was used.</p><p>The following thresholds were adopted to analysis of model t: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) &gt; 0.90, RootMean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) &lt; 0.06, and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) &lt; 0.10 for adequate t; CFI &gt; 0/95, RMSEA &lt; 0.06, and SRMR &lt; 0.08 for acceptable t. The hypothetical model was supported by theoretical and empirical ndings <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A total of 87 hospital visits were performed and 725 hospitalized patients were assessed for eligibility. However, 310 (42.8%) patients were excluded due to refusal to participate (n = 57), diagnosis of sepsis or infections with multi-resistant bacteria (n = 75), or missing information on the qRT-PCR exam (n = 103) or COVID-19 outcomes (n = 75). Then, other 201 were excluded due to inability of performing periodontal examination because of poor general health status (n = 62), di cult access to intraoral examination (n = 63), prone position (n = 15), or edentulism (n = 61). Therefore, 214 dentate or partialy dentate patients were assessed by complete periodontal examination at baseline and follow-up data. The patient owchart is detailed in Online Resource 1 of the online Clinical Oral Investigations. teeth were 8.9 (SD = 8.4).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the bivariate analyses (Chi-sware test) of the crosstabulation between COVID-19 outcomes and predictive variables (periodontal conditions and comorbidities). Patients with periodontitis had higher rates of severe-critical symptoms (p &lt; 0.001), ICU admission (p = 0.003), and death (p = 0.020). Serious COVID-19 outcomes were not associated with the severity of periodontitis (p &gt; 0.05). However, generalized periodontitis was positively related to severe-critical symptoms (p = 0.018) and ICU admission (p = 0.029). Death due to COVID-19 was associated with smoking habit (p = 0.049) and hypertension (p = 0.011). No associations were found between serious COVID-19 outcomes and other comorbidities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Since preliminary results demonstrated an important association between periodontitis and severe COVID-19 outcomes in 96 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, this study aimed to investigate this relationship in a multidirectional analysis with a larger sample size and more robust regression modeling. The present study corroborates this association showing a direct positive connection between severe generalized periodontitis and the risk of serious symptoms, with an indirect effect on ICU admission and death.</p><p>The prevalence of severe periodontitis is estimated in 9.8% (8.2 to 11.4%) of adults, and it is considered the sixth most common human disease in the World <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. It has been well established that severe generalized periodontitis is associated with the main chronic diseases considered as causes of death in the USA in 2010, including heart disease and diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">36]</ref>. Since periodontitis and COVID-19 have several common comorbidities, a possible systemic in ammatory connection and a possibility of bacterial aspiration and/or viral translocation via damaged periodontal tissues was hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. After preliminary evidences from observational studies that assessed periodontitis using panoramic radiographs or self-reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, some clinical studies have been conducted to corroborate these ndings <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> However, sound evidence on the association between periodontal status and COVID-19 is still lacking, maily due to missing confounding factors that would affect the results and an unclear de nition of the pathways of this relationship. In addition, it has been well recognized that the most severe and generalized forms of periodontitis are capable of causing systemic changes that can led to worsening systemic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Thus, the need to segregate this worst periodontal status from other mild presentations is remarkable.</p><p>This study developed a theoretical model that explores multidirectional pathways to evaluate the probable multidirectional Consequently, death was directly related to referral to ICU [sc = 0.512 (0.392-0.631); p &lt; 0.001]. Therefore, it seems plausible that severe generalized periodontitis is also indirectly associated with increased ICU admission and death. This imputable association with systemic diseases was previously demonstrated. The indirect association of periodontitis and complications of diabetes has been evidenced, showing a higher mortality rate in subjects with diabetes and severe periodontitis than those with mild or without periodontitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>Advanced age was associated with poor periodontal status and severe symptoms of COVID-19. Since the rst wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the elderly population has presented higher susceptibility to infection through the oral route of the virus transmission and a higher risk of severe manifestations and symptoms of COVID-19 <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. However, well-known comorbidities associated with COVID-19 outcomes <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> were only related to age. As previously discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, the possible explanations can be the self-reported information of the presence of comorbidities, and sampling bias since the sample of hospitalized patients is expected to present greater severity of COVID-19 symptoms compared to general population. Similar reasons can be hypotetized for the lack of association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes, despite the evidence indicating that smokers are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-smokers [38].</p><p>However, smoking was positively related to severe generalized periodontitis (sc = 0.175 (0.053-0.298; p = 0.005). This nding supports tobacco's direct and large effect on the subgingival microbiome, in the in ammatory responses, and the homeostasis and healing potential of the periodontal tissues, leading to a greater susceptibility to severe disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Furthermore, tobacco's impact is related to an expected more severe disease and worse outcomes following many types of periodontal treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Findings from the present study reinforce the impact of periodontal damage on general health. Additionally, the selected outcomes revealed a signi cant in uence of severe generalized periodontitis in the worsening of symptoms of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which can indirectly affect the consequences of the disease. Results from this study emphasize the need for public strategies to prevent and provide early treatment of periodontal diseases <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Several previous interventional studies have shown the role of periodontal interventions in improving the presentation and prognosis of systemic diseases and conditions, such as control of glycemic index <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. An observational study showed that previously periodontal treatment seems to protect patients from needing mechanical ventilation when infected by SARS-CoV-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Therefore, there is a need for studies exploring the relevance of the periodontal therapies and oral care measures during COVID-19 disease [16].</p><p>This study's has limitations related to the time of the periodontal assessment during patient's hospitalization. In order to minimize the in uence of precarious hospital oral care on the periodontal status, patients were examined in the rst two weeks after hospitalization, and only severe periodontitis was included. Concerning sampling methods, the non-randomized selection of participants may introduce bias to the data analysis, and the magnitude of the associations may be underestimated. Patient selection was markedly affected by problems in performing oral examinations as a result of the restrictive access to patients within the COVID-19 sector of the hospital, the several concurrent medical interventions in patients with severe disease presentations, devices in the oral cavity, as orotracheal tubes, and precarious oral hygiene measures during hospitalization. In addition, some patients improved their symptoms before the scheduled visits for the oral assessment, which may in uence the validity of the outcome measurements, and the relatively small sample of patients with severe generalized periodontitis may result in the lower precision of the association estimates.</p><p>Finally, the present study has a cross-sectional observational design, which could lead to possible questions regarding evidence of possible associations between diseases. However, in the pandemic context, there is an urgent need for early epidemiological studies to further our understanding of the health impact of COVID-19. Therefore, it was demonstrated that observational studies in the immediate part of the COVID-19 pandemic can provide a valuable understanding of the preliminary data on risk factors and possible treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Further clinical trials with larger samples and appropriate sampling methods are needed to elucidate the effect of the treatment and control of periodontal disease on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. The present study's ndings may clarify the possible relationship between periodontitis and new variants of SARS-CoV-2 or new viruses with the potential to cause lung injuries and severe in ammatory and systemic outcomes.</p></div>

In addition, preventive oral care and early periodontal interventions should be encouraged to avoid developing severe and generalized diseases, which can negatively in uence the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.</p></div>

The hospitalization time ranged from 2 to 75 days. Almost half of the patients had severe-critical symptoms (n = 106, 49.6%), and more than 48.1% (n = 91) had extensive pulmonary involvement. Most patients (58.9%) required ICU admission during hospitalization, and 62.7% needed invasive mechanical ventilatory support. Nevertheless, most patients were discharged from the hospital due to the remission of symptoms of COVID-19 infection (n = 142, 72.2%). Fiftytwo patients (26.8%) died due to complications of COVID-19. The hospital endpoint was not well-de ned in twenty patients due to discharge to another healthcare facility (n = 16, 7.5%) or evasion (n = 4, 1.9%).</p>The periodontal conditions are also shown in Table</p>2</p>. A high prevalence of periodontitis (46.7%) was observed in hospitalized dentate adult COVID-19 patients. From all patients diagnosed with periodontitis, 60% (n = 60) presented severe disease, classi ed as stages III or IV, and 64% (n = 64) exhibited generalized clinical attachment loss. The worst frame of periodontal disease (severe generalized periodontitis) was found in 23.8% of patients. The mean number of present teeth was 19.2 (SD = 8.6), and missing</p></note></figure>
