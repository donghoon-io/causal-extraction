<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The percentage of mobile banking users is currently lower than the number of active internet users with smartphones in Indonesia. The current study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 by adding two important factors, perceived risk and observability. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing behavioural intention and use behaviour of Mobile banking by customers of Indonesian. Data was collected by conducting an online survey questionnaire completed by 360 respondents. The authors analysed the model through structural equation modelling LISREL. The results showed observability, performance expectation, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions as positive and significant of behaviour intentions. The perceived risk, and price value indicated negative and significant in explaining behaviour intention. Behavioral intention and experience has positive and significant to use behavior mobile banking.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The use of digital technology especially the internet, has become a part of lifestyle in society, the growth of internet users in Indonesia in 2017 amounted to 143.26 million people, as much as 44.16% conducted internet activities using smartphones and 39.28% using a combination of smartphones and computers, as well as from the number of users who use the internet in the economic sector for new banking activities by 7.39% <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(APJII, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Mobile banking is a form of internet-based banking activity model through wireless devices and a service that enables bank customers to conduct banking transactions via smartphones, this mobile banking service can be used by using the menus available on the SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Card, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data), or through applications that can be downloaded and installed by customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(OJK, 2015)</ref>. The ease of use and the widespread availability of cellular communication has led to the phenomenal growth of financial transactions in rural and urban areas, especially in many developing countries in Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Misra and Bisht, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The emergence of new competitors, which is financial technology companies have an impact on banking industry transactions. The effect is a change in customer behavior from conventional activities such as visiting bank offices, switching to digital transaction activities. The percentage of internet users to access banking services is 7.39% and percentage of those conducting banking transactions on mobile banking has only reached 17.04% <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(APJII, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Based on data from one national private bank as of March 2019, from 4.2 million retail banking customers registered in the mobile banking application at 18.5% and those actively using This Journal is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License mobile banking application just counted at 41.4% of registered customers or only 7.7% of total customers. The number of carried out transactions was 1.63 million transactions and the amount of money transacted was 1656 billion rupiah.</p><p>Previous research mentioned the significant influence of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) variable on behavioral intention to use mobile banking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gharaibeh et al. (2018)</ref> concluded that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, trust and mass media had a significant positive effect on the adoption of mobile banking in Jordan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baptista and Oliveira (2015)</ref> conducted a study on behavioral intention in mobile banking in Mozambique with the results that effort expectancy, hedonic motivation and experience had a significant impact. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bhatiasevi (2015)</ref> added that the perception factor of credibility, and perceived comfort had a significant positive effect on behavioral intention to use mobile banking in Thailand in addition to the factors of effort expectancy, performance expectancy, and social influence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Al-Jabri and Sohail (2012)</ref> explained that the relative profit, compatibility and observability factors showed a significant positive impact while risk perception had a negative impact on behavioral intention in mobile banking in Saudi Arabia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blaise et al. (2016)</ref> concluded that performance, expectation efforts, social influence, and facility conditions, perceived trust and perceived risk have a significant influence on the use of m-commerce in North America.</p><p>This study is different from previous studies, this study accommodates UTAUT2 variables and risk perception variables and observability variables from the Difussion of Innovation theory. This study also analyzes up to the most significant indicator variable on behavioral intention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Mobile Banking</head><p>The banking business is experiencing changes related to the development of technology that has an impact on shifting relationships between banking customers and banks. With the existence of digital-based service options, banking customers do not really need to conduct banking transactions directly to bank branches, but customers can take advantage of ATM services, online chat, internet banking and mobile banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Citigroup, 2016)</ref>. The integration between internet technology and mobile networks creates opportunities and new technologies in banking business services, namely mobile banking which provides a service mechanism wherever and whenever for banking services as the use of smartphones and tablet PCs develops <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dash et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tiwari et al. (2006)</ref> states that the mobile banking utility from the perspective of the bank is to: 1. Support intensive competition in the banking sector. 2. Adapting to specific target segment requirements. 3. Functioning as a distribution channel. 4. Increase the volume of sales of banking products. 5. Increase customer satisfaction. 6. As a company image product.</p><p>Mobile banking provides opportunities for banks to maintain their existing customer base, smart technology based on customer segmentation by offering innovative services that have added value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">UTAUT2</head><p>There are several research models developed to explain the factors that influence the interest and use of an information technology system including Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The UTAUT was developed comprehensively from the eight theoretical perspective models <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. Extending theory to study the context of developing applications and services from technologies that target consumers, modifying some of the relationships that already exist in the UTAUT model concept and introducing new relationships, then added three new constructs namely hedonic motivation, price values and habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. The main purpose of UTAUT2 is to complete the better construct so that it can explain the emerging technology can increase the use of technology for users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref> stated that UTAUT2 created an important increase in the variables explained in the use of technology by 56% to 74%.</p><p>The constructor of the UTAUT2 Model consists of: 1. Performance Expectancy is the level of individual confidence that through the system usage can help him obtain performance gains in his activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. 2. Effort Expectancy is defined as the ease of use of a system that can reduce effort and time effort in activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. 3. Social Influence is the level of trust in the social environment that convinces individuals to use the new system <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. 5. Hedonic Motivation is pleasure derived from the use of technology and determine its adoption and usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brown and Venkatesh, 2005)</ref>. 6. Price is the perception of the gap between the benefit of using technology and the rates charged <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dodds et al., 1991)</ref>. 7. Habit (Habit) is the extent to which a person tends to behave automatically due to previous learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Limayem et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Diffusion of Innovation (DOI)</head><p>DOI theory contributes by examining innovation and the success of technology dissemination through more appropriate indicators of consumer behavior, and trying to explain how, why, and at what level the new technology idea spreads and a process when an innovation is communicated from time to time in social systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rogers, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>There are five attributes, namely: 1. Relative Advantage: relative advantages that result in increased efficiency, economic benefits and increased status. 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Risk Perception</head><p>Risk perception is an attribute that refers to the level of risk in using an innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ram and Sheth, 1989)</ref>. Risk should be considered as one of the biggest concerns in the adoption and use of mobile banking services <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chen, 2013)</ref>. Despite the success of mobile phones, researchers believe that mobile banking customers experience many types of risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agu et al., 2016)</ref>. Banks need to take serious and urgent steps to respond complaints and provide special guarantees in reducing risk perceived by customers (Al-Jabri and Sohail, 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Experience</head><p>Experience is how much or how often someone uses certain technology.

(2012)</ref> defines experience as an opportunity to use a technology product and is generally formed from individual operational activities along with the passage of time using that technology product. Increased experience and routine behavior leading to the habit of using technology products can be a support in maintaining and increasing the actual use of technology products <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Albashrawi, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal and Prasad (1999)</ref> explain the existence of a strong relationship between previous individual experiences with similar technology and individual behavior to use the technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">METHODOLOGY</head><p>This study uses non-probability techniques by sampling according to the purpose (purposive sampling). The sample selection is based on certain characteristics that are already known before, which are banking customers who have opportunity to use mobile banking and are domiciled in Indonesia.</p><p>Primary data in this study were obtained from distributing questionnaires by online using Google forms. The questionnaire was designed into two parts, the first section about general data and profile of respondents including gender, age, level of education, location, length of time using mobile banking, and the number of mobile banking applications used. In the second part questions about the variables to be analyzed. The scale used is the Likert scale approach with a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5.</p><p>Model used is a combination of UTAUT2 with observability characteristics from DOI theory, as well as perceived risk.</p><p>The combination of these models are based on the assumption that acceptance of technological concepts which is complex phenomenon and requires more than one model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shen et al., 2010)</ref> and will be able to strengthen the significance and predictions of the results obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Hypothesis</head><p>To answer the problem in this study, the authors propose a research hypothesis:</p><p>1. H 1 : Observability has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention 2. H 2 : Performance Expectancy has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention. 3. H 3 : Effort Expectancy has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention. 4. H 4 : Social Influence has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention. 5. H 5 : Facilitating Condition has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention. 6. H 6 : Hedonic Motivation has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention. 7. H 7 : Price Value has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention 8. H 8 : Perceived Risk has a significant negative effect on behavioral intention. 9. H 9 : Behavioral intention has a significant positive effect on use behavior. 10. H 10 : Experience has a significant positive effect on use behavior.</p><p>Data processing that carried out was descriptive analysis, analysis by SEM-LISREL method and priority determination stage. The application software used was LISREL 8.80. The stage of determining priority indicators for behavioral intention was done using quadrant charts as in the Importance Performance Analysis technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Martilla and James, 1977)</ref>. The X-axis determines the average range of respondents' perceptions on the questionnaire indicator, while the Y-axis determines the loading factor of the indicator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULT AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The results of the distribution of questionnaires produced 360 questionnaires that met the completeness to be processed. The number of male respondents was 52% and female respondents were 48%. This study grouped ages according to generations based on research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bencsik and Machova (2016)</ref>. Respondents are dominated by the range of age between 25 years and 31 years (30.6%), ages between 32 years and 38 years (25.8%), ages 18 years and 24 years (20.3%), ages between 39 years and 47 years (16.9%), and over the age of 48 years (6.4%). The education level of the largest respondents was undergraduate/ bachelor graduates (S1), totaling 63.1%, while the smallest percentage was Doctoral graduates (S3) of 1.9%. Most of the respondents residing in Java with a percentage of 73.1% and followed by respondents on the island of Sumatra 15.3%, the smallest percentage of respondents was in the Maluku/Papua region (1.9%). Respondents who have used mobile banking services for 6 to 12 months is 42.8%, while respondents who have not used mobile banking services are 11.7%.</p><p>Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, all model conformity indices have a measure of the suitability of the measurement model with a good match category, which exceeds the minimum suitability of the model.</p><p>Validity is related to whether a variable measure what should be measured <ref type="bibr">(Wijanto, 2015)</ref>. A variable has good validity for the construct of its latent variable, if the value of t factor loading (loading factor) is greater than the critical value (≥1.96) or for practicality (≥2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ridgon and Ferguson, 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hair et al. (2010)</ref> suggest a standardized loading factor (SLF) value ≥0.5 indicates that convergent validity has either been achieved or more is expected to be SLF ≥0.7.</p><p>Reliability is the consistency of a measurement. There are two ways in measuring reliability, the first is construct reliability (CR), which is a deciding indicator that shows whether or not convergent validity is good, the second is variance extracted (VE), which is a reflection of the total number of constructs in the observed variable explained by latent variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hair et al. (1998)</ref> states that a construct has a good reliability value if the value of CR ≥0.70 and the value of VE ≥0.50.</p><p>Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, shows the validity and reliability of the model variables. Invalid indicators are FC4 and UB5 and were eliminated when calculating CR and VE. The results of the reliability evaluation of all latent variables are reliable criteria.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Hypothesis Testing Results</head><p>Hypothesis testing in this study was conducted by evaluating the path coefficient and the calculated value for each path of the model.</p><p>Testing of each path of the two latent variables will produce a value of tcount, if the tcount &gt;1.96 can be concluded that the influence of the variable is significant.</p><p>Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> explains that from 10 existing hypotheses, there are 2 hypotheses that were rejected because they were insignificant (H3 and H4), and 1 hypothesis that was rejected due to a significant negative effect (H7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Priority Determination</head><p>Based on the research, there are three latent variables that influence behavioral intention variables, namely observability, performance expectancy and hedonic motivation. To find out the relationship between the loading factor value and the average value of each indicator of the most influential variable, a simple mapping approach is used, such as the Importance Performance Analysis technique (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</p><p>There are two indicators that are in quadrant I, namely HM3 (using mobile banking services is very convenient) and OB1 (can access mobile banking anywhere or anytime in the territory of Indonesia) which are priorities to be improved. In quadrant II there are five indicators that must be maintained services namely PE1 (using mobile banking support to complete important work), PE3 (using mobile banking beneficial in daily life), PE4 (using mobile banking completes the payment process quickly), OB2 (not facing queue  when using mobile banking) and OB3 (can immediately see the effects of transactions on mobile banking).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSSION</head><p>The conclusions of this study are as follows:</p><p>1. Behavioral intention is significantly positive influenced by the variables of observability, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation and facilitating conditions. The price value and perceive risk factors have a significant negative effect. 2. Latent variables social influence and effort expectancy do not affect behavioral intention. 3. Use behavior of mobile banking users is significantly positively influenced by behavioral intention and experience.</p><p>Based on this research, managerial implications are obtained, which the development of differentiation in HM3 indicators that makes the appearance of mobile banking more accommodating of user and application interactions (user interface/UI) and able to accommodate the experience of users who have used mobile banking applications (user experience/UX). The designed UI/UX has appropriate and simple design features but still focuses on banking transaction activities and user experience, and controls the application of multimedia.The second indicator, OB1, can be developed by increasing the ability to access mobile banking applications that can accommodate bandwidth availability.</p><p>Collaboration with communication service providers can be an alternative solution. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>4.</head><label></label><figDesc>Acilitating condition<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref> a.
