<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Organizational Justice Dimensions and Project Success Introduction</head><p>Project success is probably the most extensively deliberated topic in project management literature. A vast amount of factors has been identified which potentially enhance or improve the performance of projectssome of them are more generally applicable such as tools, practices and support <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jitpaiboon et al., 2019)</ref> whereas others are focused on specific regions or industries such as software or public-private partnership projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tam et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Almarri and Boussabaine, 2017)</ref>. However, project performance issues are continuing, and large amounts of money are wasted on a daily basis due to poor performance and issues such as overspend, scope creep, time overrun and non-achievement of goals <ref type="bibr">(PMI, 2020b</ref>). PMI's recent Pulse of the Profession study found that worldwide over 11% of every Dollar spent on projects is in fact lost <ref type="bibr">(PMI, 2020b)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, it was also found that 65% of organizations see the development of leadership skills of their project professionals as a high priority to improve this situation and it was recognized that project managers won't get far without people skills <ref type="bibr">(PMI, 2020a)</ref>. This indicates that people and psychosocial aspects are gaining importance in addressing the challenges of weak project performance <ref type="bibr">(Berssaneti &amp; Carvalho, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maqbool et al., 2017)</ref>. Nevertheless, there has been little empirical attention on the psychosocial relationships and more importantly on the effect of these relationships on project success <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Unterhitzenberger and Bryde, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>One approach which has shown promising results in this area is organizational justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Unterhitzenberger and Bryde, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Loosemore and Lim, 2015)</ref>. Organizational justice focuses on how individuals perceive fairness in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Greenberg, 1987)</ref> and recognizes that the way employees are treated has an impact on their behavior at work. Meta-analyses of Cohen-Charash and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Spector (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Colquitt et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Viswesvaran and Ones (2002)</ref> have established that organizational justice positively influences both employees as well as organizations with the employee's organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) being one of the key benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chan and Lai, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fassina et al., 2008)</ref>. OCBs are defined as behaviors displayed by employees that go beyond the contractual requirements and are above and beyond what organizations can formally demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008)</ref>. They have been recognized as being critical to the survival of organizations due to the ever-increasing competitive business environment. Projects are also generally regarded as competitive business environments with particular pressures due to their temporary nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bakker et al., 2013)</ref>. Project team members are required to work under limiting budget and time constraints, which often require them to go "the extra mile" and put more personal effort into a project than they are formally required to do by contract. On the project level this phenomenon has been defined as project citizenship behavior (PCB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braun et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>With our research, we propose to investigate the four-dimensional organizational justice construct and its relationship to project success including the mediating role of PCB. This is of relevance as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Colquitt, J. and Jackson (2006)</ref> highlight the context sensitive nature of organizational justice and suggest that it is perceived differently in different social and organizational contexts.</p><p>Currently, we do not know if the strong support for organizational justice and OCB relationship that has been found in classic organizations holds true in the significantly different context of projects. Projects are complex social constructs, which are viewed as a temporary organizational systems that are distinct from permanent organizations <ref type="bibr">(Hobday, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braun et al., 2012)</ref> in four key aspects: time, which is limited in temporary organizations; task, which is the reason the project (or temporary organization) is launched; team, which focuses on the interpersonal relationships and the interplay with the permanent organization and transition, which is about the requirement to achieve transformation as a result of the temporary organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lundin and Söderholm, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Unterhitzenberger and Bryde (2019)</ref> utilized a simplified three-dimensional construct for organizational justice, which proposed an impact on project performance, but has limitations as it does not account for a nuanced investigation of the more detailed four dimensions of organizational justice. Furthermore, extra role behavioror PCBwas not considered as a mediator and hence, this relationship remains unknown. Hence, we aim to answer the following research questions: 1) How do the different organizational justice dimensions impact project success? 2) Is the relationship between dimensions of organizational justice and project success mediated by project citizenship behavior?</p><p>We conducted a large-scale time-lagged quantitative study with 314 participants and performed the analysis via partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hair, J.F. and Sarstedt, 2019)</ref>. Our findings revealed that all four organizational justice dimensions positively impact project success and that this impact is mediated through PCB. We therefore contribute to project management literature in two-fold. First, we enrich the project management literature by empirically investigating the impact of organizational justice dimensions on project success directly and indirectly through the mediating role of PCB. Second, we also provide recommendations for project leaders and managers to stimulate the exhibition of citizenship behavior in project teams and thus, contribute towards project success. In the next section, we will provide the theoretical background for our hypotheses, then we will consider methodological aspects, present our findings and discuss the results. Finally, the theoretical &amp; managerial implications and limitations of our study will be presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory and Hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Justice</head><p>Organizational justice has traditionally been defined as the degree to which an aspect of the organizational environment is perceived as fair following certain rules or standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cropanzano et al., 2001)</ref>. The concept is known to be subjective -as being "in the eye of the beholder" <ref type="bibr">(Colquitt, J. et al., 2018, p.159</ref>) and viewed as a phenomenon which is complex and multifaceted "as individuals are concerned about fairness for several reasons, judge the fairness of several aspects of decision events, and use fairness perceptions to guide a wide range of key attitudes and behaviors" <ref type="bibr">(Colquitt, J. et al., 2005, p. 45)</ref>. Initially, a differentiation between three different types (or dimensions) of justice was made <ref type="bibr">(Colquitt et al., 2005)</ref> namely: 1) Distributive justice focuses on the fair allocation of outcomes; 2) Procedural justice focuses on the fairness of the processes used to determine outcome distributions or allocations 3) Interactional justice focuses on communicating the outcomes and processes. However, it has also been recognized that for a more differentiated understanding of interactional justice a distinction should be made between interpersonal and informational justice, whereas interpersonal justice means the quality of interaction and the treatment received and informational justice is concerned with the accuracy, truthfulness and timeliness of the information shared <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Colquitt, J., 2001)</ref>. For our work we will adopt this four-dimensional organizational justice construct, consisting of distributive, procedural, interpersonal and informational justice, for which no empirical investigation has been conducted in the project context as the only previous study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Unterhitzenberger and Bryde (2019)</ref> used the three-dimensional construct.</p><p>For decades research on organizational justice has suggested that it contributes positively to how individuals engage at work, e.g. by predicting higher levels of job performance and OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Colquitt, J. et al., 2018)</ref> as well as better work attitudes and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Huang et al., 2017)</ref>. In particular, research has proposed consistently strong support for organizational justice as a predictor of OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Colquitt et al., 2013)</ref>. This association is often discussed using the theoretical lens of social exchange theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Moorman and Byrne, 2005)</ref>. Social exchange theory (SET) assumes that social lifeincluding working lifeconsists of a series of transactions between different parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Mitchell et al., 2012)</ref>. These transactions comprise of actions which are conditional on the rewarding actions of others and therefore create a process of reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cropanzano et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005)</ref>. Unlike economic exchanges, social exchange relationships are characterized by the exchange of less tangible, sometimes symbolic resources with the exchange being governed by certain rules such as reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blau, 1964)</ref>. This means that it is assumed that individuals respond to fair treatment from their supervisor by putting extra effort into their work and going beyond their contractual duties and hence, engage in OCB which is beneficial to their supervisor and their organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008)</ref>. Utilizing SET as a theoretical lens we aim to investigate the association of organizational justice dimensions with OCB in the project setting.</p><p>The setting in which justice relationships are investigated is critical as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Colquitt, J. and Jackson (2006)</ref> highlighted the context sensitivity of justice rules. They suggest that justice is perceived differently in different settings, as different aspects of justice are more important in certain contexts whereas others are more important in others. However, their context was limited to a comparison of individual vs. team perception and team characteristics of size and diversity. Also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fortin (2008)</ref> considers only team environment, culture and power as context, whereas team environment does not consider the unique characteristics of projects. Research on projects as temporary organizations shows that they are distinct from permanent organizations and this distinction is based not only on the temporariness of projects but also on the other unique characteristics of team (demographics of members who work together), task (purpose of project initiation and implementation) and transition (something needs to be changed because of the temporary organizations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lundin and Söderholm, 1995)</ref>. Hence, the project context with temporary teams working on specific tasks towards the achievement of a transition or transformation is a context which has only been scarcely addressed in organizational justice research <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Loosemore and Lim, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Unterhitzenberger and Bryde, 2019)</ref>. Our work will therefore contribute to closing this gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Project Citizenship Behavior</head><p>The individual's behavior at work which goes beyond contractual arrangements has gained much attention over the past decades with OCB being at the core of many investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Podsakoff et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Dovidio et al., 2017)</ref>. Generally, OCB is referred to as the voluntary behavior by workers, which is neither expected nor formally required by the job description but has been recognized to carry immense significance for the effective functioning of firms <ref type="bibr">(Organ, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Podsakoff et al., 1997)</ref>. Examples of OCB are when individuals perform tasks efficiently to achieve the organization's objectives, proactively propose novel solutions to improve the work or assist a co-worker without expecting any favor in return. However, it has been recognized that OCB cannot simply be transferred to the project setting due to its unique characteristics of time, task, teams and transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lundin and Söderholm, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braun et al., 2012)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braun et al. (2012)</ref>, project citizenship behavior (PCB) consists of four dimensions which are related to but not identical with the seven dimensions of OCB. Firstly, there is helping behavior, which relates to helping another individual or team from a different organization working on the same project. Secondly, project loyalty is introduced as a cross-organizational point of reference in addition to the employment organization. Thirdly, project compliance is concerned with the compliance to formal and informal rules and regulations established for the project and fourthly, proactive behavior relates to the individual initiatives project team members from different organizations demonstrate and their civic virtue towards the project. These findings highlight the importance of a project context investigation of citizenship behavior and we will adopt <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braun et al. (2012)</ref> concept of PCB to examine its association with organizational justice and project success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Project Success</head><p>As stated earlier, project success has been addressed widely in the academic literature and consequently, there is a broad diversity of views on what constitutes project success. The only overarching agreement is that project success has moved on from simply considering the iron triangle of cost, time and quality to a more holistic view of success which incorporates different perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pollack et al., 2018)</ref>. However, this has led to a situation where there is the danger of "comparing apples and oranges discussing project success" <ref type="bibr">(Albert et al., 2017, p.797)</ref> due to a lack of commonly agreed success criteria. It has been recognized that project success or failure might depend on the individual stakeholders' interpretation of the success criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Davis, 2018)</ref> which indicates that a more nuanced view is required. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albert et al. (2017)</ref> concluded from a comprehensive literature review that a differentiation between hard and soft criteria is necessary with hard criteria being aspects such as cost, time, performance, quality and economic success and soft criteria representing different stakeholder perspectives. For this study we determined that the aspects of time, cost, performance, client use, satisfaction and effectiveness are suitable criteria to define project success following <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aga et al. (2016)</ref>. Effectiveness in this context is defined as the extent to which a project meets its objectives. These criteria represent a mix of hard (time, cost, performance) and soft aspects (client use, satisfaction, effectiveness), which are captured according to the stakeholders' perception, and therefore allow for the integration of different stakeholder perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aga et al., 2016)</ref>. This follows the recommendations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albert et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davis (2018)</ref> and will allow us a nuanced assessment of project success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>Findings from previous studies suggest that organizational justice positively impacts various facets of performance and success: <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mahajan and Benson (2013)</ref> found that organizational justice positively impacts on firm success, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Swalhi et al. (2017)</ref> demonstrate an association of organizational justice and job performance and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Unterhitzenberger and Bryde (2019)</ref> showed some relationship with project performance. Hence, a general positive association between the overall concept of organizational justice and project success can be assumed. However, the more nuanced relationships with different organizational justice dimensions remain to be better understood. A number of studies have established that procedural justice impacts task performance of individuals and the importance of procedural justice in the context of performance has been widely accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zapata-Phelan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Colquitt, J. et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cohen-Charash and Spector, 2001)</ref>. On the other hand, the association between distributive justice and job performance is less clear as some studies have found support for it <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Skarlicki and Folger, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cohen-Charash and Spector, 2001)</ref> whereas others failed to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Swalhi et al., 2017)</ref>. The picture is similarly contradicting for the association between interpersonal justice and task performance as some studies found significant support for the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cropanzano et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rupp and Cropanzano, 2002)</ref> whereas others didn't <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Colquitt, J.A. et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Zapata-Phelan et al., 2009)</ref>. Informational justice has only rarely been investigated in relation to performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schumacher et al., 2020)</ref>, however the combined dimension of interactional justice (interpersonal and informational justice) has shown promising support for a positive relationship with task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zapata-Phelan et al., 2009)</ref>. This shows that whilst various studies have consistently found support for the overall relationship between organizational justice and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Unterhitzenberger and Bryde, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mahajan and Benson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Swalhi et al., 2017)</ref>, the impact of the individual dimensions is less clear. Therefore, we argue that the relationships between the individual dimensions and project success need to be investigated and clarified. Based on the overall positive impact of organizational justice on performance, we assume that this support is also present through the individual dimensions. This assumption is grounded in the supportive findings outlined above which provide us with sufficient theoretical underpinning to investigate these relationships in more detail. We therefore hypothesize that the individual dimensions of organizational justice significantly and positively affect project success:</p><p>H1a: Distributive justice positively impacts project success.</p><p>H1b: Procedural justice positively impacts project success.</p><p>H1c: Interpersonal justice positively impacts project success.</p><p>H1d: Informational justice positively impacts project success.</p><p>We have outlined above that organizational justice is one of OCB's strong predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008)</ref>. The meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Colquitt et al. (2013)</ref> examined 493 independent samples and identified a positive association between each dimension of organizational justice and OCB (r = uncorrected population correlation; rc = corrected population correlation): interpersonal justice (r = .32; rc = .43), informational justice (r = .30; rc = .42), procedural justice (r = .23; rc = .30), and distributive justice (r = .17; rc = .21). This provides strong support to hypothesize a positive association between the different organizational justice dimensions and OCB, however we do not know if this relationship holds true in the project context. This is especially the case, as OCB cannot simply be transferred to the project context, but needs to be adapted and is characterized by four unique dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braun et al., 2012)</ref>. Whilst <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lim and Loosemore (2017)</ref> attempt to investigate this relationship, they do not consider the project context sufficiently and simply use traditional OCB definitions, which is inappropriate according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Braun et al. (2012)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we see the need to investigate this relationship in the project context. Utilizing the rationale of SET we assume that individuals who are treated fairly in projects (based on the four dimensions of organizational justice) will engage in reciprocal transactions by putting extra effort into their work and going beyond contractual duties <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008)</ref>. Based on this evidence, we propose that the organizational justice dimensions are positively linked with PCB: OCB has been recognized as being critical to the survival of organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008)</ref> and leading to sustainable organizational effectiveness, for instance high productivity, improved coordination, high performance, enhanced capability to respond to the changes in environment and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Podsakoff et al., 2000)</ref>. Additionally, it has been found that it increases an individual's task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen and Rush, 1998)</ref> as well as the performance of work groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Podsakoff et al., 1997)</ref>. This linkage has also been examined in the project setting and a recent research carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wang et al. (2018)</ref> established the positive effect of OCB on the performance of megaprojects. This suggests that there is evidence for a link between OCB and different aspects of performance. In line with this, PCB has demonstrated its impact on the effectiveness of projects by predicting success criteria such as the iron triangle <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Braun et al., 2013)</ref> or the achievement of project objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ferreira et al., 2013)</ref>. Hence, we have established that the different organizational justice dimensions are some of the most robust predictors of OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Colquitt et al., 2013)</ref> and that OCB impacts on different aspects of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Podsakoff et al., 2000)</ref>. Following this, one may expect that PCB can help to clarify the nature of the linkage between the different organizational justice dimensions and success in the project context. Thus, we hypothesize that the demonstration of citizenship behavior by project team members due to perceived organizational justice supports the achievement of project success: H3a: The relationship between distributive justice and project success is mediated by PCB.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population, Sampling and Data Collection</head><p>The research design of our present study was quantitative in nature adopting a positivist research philosophy with a deductive approach. This allowed us to remain neutral and independent during the investigation whilst using a large sample to test hypotheses developed from existing theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Saunders et al., 2019)</ref>. The participants in our study had to fulfill the following criteria:</p><p>1) experience of at least one year of working in or leading projects and 2) worked in or led at least one completed project with knowledge about the results of that project. A convenient sampling technique was used. They belong to various sectors such as engineering and construction, healthcare, education and I.T. Access to the participants was gained through professional contacts of the study authors. Respondents participated voluntarily in the survey and their informed consent was obtained. All respondents were assured of the data confidentiality and anonymity. A time-lagged self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data which was administered in three waves. The independent variables i.e. all dimensions of organizational justice were collected in Time 1, mediating variable i.e. project citizenship behavior was collected in Time 2 and dependent variable i.e. project success was collected at Time 3. Each of the time intervals was three weeks apart. The purpose of time lags was to overcome common method bias and selfserving bias issues <ref type="bibr">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Codes were assigned to respondents in order to maintain their privacy and for the purpose of matching the responses of same respondents from T1, T2 and T3. This helped to contact the same respondents with their consent in T2 &amp; T3 accordingly.</p><p>At T1, we received 363 usable responses out of the 400 questionnaires we distributed (response rate 91%). At T2, questionnaires were sent to those respondents only, who responded in T1, and 314 usable questionnaires were returned (response rate 87%). At T3, the same process was followed with a total of 233 usable questionnaires returned, which were then considered for statistical analysis (response rate 58%). There were 82.4% male respondents and 17.6% females.</p><p>Most of the respondents (93.6%) were aged between 18-40. 43.8% of our respondents were single and 56.2% were married. Nearly half the participants worked in a managerial position (49.8 %).</p><p>54.5% of the respondents had 1-5 years of experience, 27.5% ranging between 6-10, 16.7% between 11-20 years and only 1.3% between 21-30 years. None of the respondents had +30 years' experience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Structural equation modelling (SEM) is a statistical analysis method which is commonly used to test structural relationships by combining factor analysis and multiple regression analysis.</p><p>According to Kline (2011), SEM is used to specify, identify, estimate, test and modify a measurement and structural model. Thus, in the present study we used the partial least squares (PLS) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref> to perform confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) through SmartPLS 3.0 to verify the fitness of our model with the data. For the structural model the direct and indirect effect was determined through Process Macro presented by Hayes (2013). The analysis was done by using the model 4 from the manual provided by Hayes (2013) as it is the classical model of mediation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Variables</head><p>One Way ANOVA was performed to explore the impact of the control variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> depicts that there is a significant difference caused in project success across marital status of respondents (f = 3.59, p&lt;.05) therefore, marital status was controlled for in the regression analysis.</p><p>We currently do not know for certain, why marital status caused this significant difference. One reason might be that priorities and commitment to the job change after marriage, but this needs to be explored in more depth in a separate study. It was also found that there was no significant difference in project success across other demographics of respondents i.e. gender, age, position and experience. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics and Correlation</head><p>The mean values, standard deviations (SD) and correlation analysis are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. It indicates that distributive justice (r = .520, p&lt; .001), procedural justice (r = .553, p&lt; .001), interpersonal justice (r = .554, p&lt; .001) and informational justice (r = .627, p&lt; .001) are positively associated with project success thus, giving preliminary support to our hypotheses. It furthermore shows that project citizenship behavior is positively associated with project success (r = .517, p&lt; .001). Since all the correlation coefficient values (r) lie within the range of .3 to .7 there is no problem of multicollinearity in our data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tests of the Measurement Model</head><p>To justify the measurement model, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed <ref type="bibr">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988)</ref> which consisted of six latent variables: distributive justice (DJ), procedural justice (PJ), interpersonal justice (INTJ), informational justice (INFJ), project citizenship behavior (PCB) and project success (PS). As per the results of the measurement model</p><p>(1 st level) all the indicators with factor loadings &lt; .5 were dropped including one item of interpersonal justice (INTJ2), seven items of project citizenship behavior (PCB6, PCB7, PCB8, PCB9, PCB10, PCB11, PCB12) and one item of project success (PS6) because the elimination of these items improved the validity of our measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the measurement model (2 nd level) after removal of the items. We would like to note that PCB14, for which the outer loading was slightly lower than .5, was included because that the validity of the measurement model was not compromised and the item loading was very close to .5.  The convergent validity was assessed through internal consistency, CR and AVE. For an adequate convergent validity of the scale, a minimum threshold of AVE is .50. However, convergent validity will be sufficient to measure any concept with an AVE &lt; .50 if the composite reliability is &gt; .60 <ref type="bibr">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Thus, convergent validity is established according to the results reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. After verification of the convergent validity, the discriminant validity was evaluated. Discriminant validity determines whether a construct is distinct from other constructs by empirical standards, hence if it is not highly correlated with other constructs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> indicates that the values on the diagonal exceed all the preceding values in rows and columns of the matrix. That means that the square root of each construct's AVE is greater than its correlation with other constructs thus, it suggests that validity is established <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair, J. et al., 2011)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Testing</head><p>We used the process macro by Hayes ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) to determine the direct and indirect effects.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows that distributive justice positively impacts project success (β = .529, p&lt; .001) and project citizenship behavior (β = .375, p&lt; .001) thus, H1a and H2a are supported. Moreover, the indirect effect (.169) of project citizenship behavior between distributive justice and project success is significant with 95% confidence interval. Project citizenship behavior partially mediates the relationship between distributive justice and project success, thus, H3a is supported. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> depicts that procedural justice positively impacts project success (β = .561, p&lt;</p><p>.001) and project citizenship behavior (β = .449, p&lt; .001) thus, H1b and H2b are supported.</p><p>Moreover, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> indicates the significant indirect effect (.174) of project citizenship behavior between procedural justice and project success with a 95% confidence interval. Project citizenship behavior partially mediates the relationship between procedural justice and project success, therefore, H3b is supported. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> indicates that interpersonal justice positively impacts project success (β = .519, p&lt;</p><p>.001) and project citizenship behavior (β = .260, p&lt; .001) thus, H1c and H2c are supported. In addition, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> shows that the indirect effect (.121) of project citizenship behavior between interpersonal justice and project success is significant with a 95% confidence interval. Project citizenship behavior partially mediates the relationship between interpersonal justice and project success, hence, H3c is supported.  Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref> depicts that informational justice positively impacts project success (β = .685, p&lt;</p><p>.001) and project citizenship behavior (β = .365, p&lt; .001), thus, H1d and H2d are supported.</p><p>Moreover, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref> demonstrates the significant indirect effect (.142) of project citizenship behavior between informational justice and project success with a 95% confidence interval. Project citizenship behavior partially mediates the relationship between informational justice and project success, thus, H3d is supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study provides new insights into how the four organizational justice dimensions impact project success through mediation of project citizenship behavior (PCB). The results of our research supported all the hypothesized relationships, and we will discuss them in more detail below to develop an enhanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Altogether, these findings improve our understanding of the importance of organizational justice and PCB and their contribution to project success.</p><p>Firstly, we found evidence that all four organizational justice dimensions i.e. distributive, procedural, interpersonal and informational justice are positively associated with project success (supporting hypotheses 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d). Interestingly, all four dimensions have about the same impact with informational justice showing a slightly stronger relationship than the other dimensions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Unterhitzenberger and Bryde (2019)</ref> found that procedural justice was the most influential factor, with distributive and interactional justice having a significantly weaker impact.</p><p>Despite the differences in the strength of relationships the findings of our study confirm <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Unterhitzenberger and Bryde (2019)</ref> findings that all organizational justice dimensions demonstrate a positive association with project success. This suggests that the implementation of fair principles and processes throughout the project and across different aspects is critical. Making decisions about the distribution of resources should be guided by the principles of need, equity and equality to align with justice rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Colquitt, J. and Shaw, 2005)</ref> in order to encourage project team members to reciprocate the behavior and engage in the social exchange of beneficial actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cropanzano et al., 2017)</ref>. The implementation of fair procedures and principles by the project manager strongly influence the project success because the project team members then use fairness perceptions as heuristic to evaluate if they can swiftly trust the management <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Proudfoot and Lind, 2015)</ref> and the quality of their relationship with the project manager is strengthened when they perceive that the project related decisions are taken in a reliable and transparent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Colquitt et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Our study also reveals that the treatment of and communication with the project team members is significant in regard to its impact on project success. When project team members are treated with politeness, dignity and respect following interpersonal justice rules they reciprocate to uphold their ethical beliefs by delivering project tasks effectively <ref type="bibr">(Bies, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cheung, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, when the project team members are provided with reasonable justifications for decisions and when the communication of these decisions happens in a truthful way, they develop a strong identity with the project. Thus, they respond by performing high and contributing to project due to perceived informational justice. This is also the dimension we have found to be most influential which suggests that a truthful and justified sharing of information is very important for project team members. This is unique to the project context and might be grounded in the fact that projects are often characterized by a high degree of uncertainty and that truthful and justified communication reduces this uncertainty for project team members who subsequently use this information to make more informed decisions to the benefit of the project.</p><p>Overall, this suggests that the basic principles of organizational justice are applicable in the project context and that despite the context sensitivity of the concept significant benefits can be realized in the projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Colquitt, J. and Jackson, 2006)</ref>. It also highlights the relevance of social exchange theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cropanzano et al., 2017)</ref> as a theoretical lens predictor of OCB in the project context, i.e. PCB, if the appropriate measures are utilized. This is due to the fact that OCB measures do not actually account for the context specific characteristics of projects and hence, consider aspects such as general helping behavior, organizational loyalty or organizational compliance, which do not appear to be impacted by justice perceptions in the project as they are related to the permanent organization the project team member is working for. In contrast to this, PCB measures such as project-specific helping behavior, project loyalty and project compliance directly relate to the temporary organization and hence, are impacted by justice perceptions in the project.</p><p>We also found that PCB mediates the relationship of all four organizational justice dimensions with project success (supporting hypotheses 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d). Despite the fact that there is strong theoretical underpinning for these hypothesized relationships, this is the first study that explicitly examined how PCB mediates the relationship between organizational justice dimensions and project success. Previous studies have proven that organizational justice is a robust predictor of OCB and OCB has also been recognized as a survival factor for organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Colquitt et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jafari and Bidarian, 2012</ref>), but we are the first to establish this relationship in the project context. Having established that all four organizational justice dimensions have a positive impact on project success, we are able to explain this relationship through the mediation of PCB. PCB is the extra-role behavior that project team members demonstrate voluntarily in an inter-organizational project environment, i.e. across the boundaries of permanent organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braun et al., 2012)</ref>. Our findings determine that PCB is encouraged by the implementation of fair processes and principles in projects as is OCB in permanent organizations. Through its adapted dimensions of project-specific helping behavior, project loyalty, project compliance and project-specific proactive behavior it encourages individuals to go their contractual duties. And again, we contribute to the literature on project behavior by further establishing the need for dedicated concepts such as PCB to be explored and utilized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Findings of this study also provide some valuable managerial implications that can potentially alter the ways in which projects are being managed currently. In order to enhance project success, this study gives a different perspective to the present approaches of project management. The present study highlights new areas of responsibility for project sponsors and/or project managers as they should be familiar with the significance of justice rules, processes and decisions in projects due to their significant impact on success of project. The project managers need to take fairness into account throughout the project life cycle. Some practical actions can be taken in initial phases of the project for instance the design of fair procedures and principles for decision making, the fair distribution of resources among participants based on need, equity and equality, the truthful and justified sharing of sufficient information with project participants and the communication of these procedures to participants with respect and dignity. Our findings suggest that along with the implementation of organizational justice the project managers should also encourage project team members to exhibit project citizenship behavior for effective execution of project tasks. Rewards either intrinsic i.e. job autonomy, growth or extrinsic such as salary raise, bonus, allowances etc. should be given to those project team members who show extra role behavior during the course of project delivery. In particular, the findings of our study can be used to highlight the importance of establishing and practicing fair and impartial practices during the execution of any project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Along with the fruitful insights, the study has a few limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, self-reported measures were used for data collection and therefore, common method bias cannot be ruled out. Future researchers should move toward the use of multisource data collection through dyadic relationships in projects between project team members and project managers. Second, we collected data from employees working on projects situated in Islamabad, Pakistan. So, there are limitations to the generalizability beyond the specific cultural context.</p><p>Various cultures have different interpretations and perceptions about organizational justice, consequently, the findings may only be applicable in the Pakistani context. Future studies must be carried out in other cultures, for instance Middle East, Asia or Europe to further look at the impact of cultural variations on the linkage between organizational justice, project citizenship behavior and project success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Despite the extensive deliberations in project management literature, there is a lack of scientific research focusing on psychosocial factors in project-based organizations and their impact on project success except few promising attempts. Thus, our study contributes to body of knowledge by providing evidence that all four dimensions of organizational justice have a significant impact on project success both directly and through mediation of project citizenship behavior (PCB). Altogether, these findings enhance our understanding of the importance of organizational justice and PCB and their contribution to project success. Findings of our study provide valuable managerial implications for project leaders and project managers by advocating that project team member's perceptions about all four dimensions of organizational justice (distribution of resources, enactment of procedures, polite treatment and candid communication) are crucial and should not be ignored throughout the life cycle of a project to facilitate project success. Findings also suggest that project leaders and project managers should provide an environment that encourages project team members to go the extra mile or beyond the formal obligations through fair treatment in order to enhance the likelihood of effective project delivery.</p></div>

This is an important new finding as PCB is related to, but not identical with OCB <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Braun et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Braun et al., 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lim and Loosemore (2017)</ref>, who utilized traditional OCB measures in the project context, our study made use of the adapted and context adjusted PCB measures.</p><p>Through this we are able to establish that the use of context-specific measures matter as <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lim and Loosemore (2017)</ref> only found a significant association between interpersonal justice and OCB, but not with any of the other dimensions which contradicts broadly accepted knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fassina et al., 2008)</ref>. Our study however was able to demonstrate that organizational justice is indeed a the extra mile, be more effective and productive <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Basu et al., 2017)</ref> and subsequently facilitates project success.</p><p>Thus, we have contributed to existing literature by providing insights on how project citizenship behavior influences project success along with implications for project leaders and project managers to encourage project team members to go the extra mile or beyond the formal obligations for effective project delivery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>From a theoretical perspective our study makes three contributions to the literature: Firstly, we establish that the four-dimensional organizational justice construct significantly impacts project success and that the implementation of fair processes and principles in the project context facilitates project success. By doing so we contribute to the literature on project success through strengthening the support for psychosocial relationships as success factors. Secondly, we demonstrate that organizational justice is a reliable predictor of extra-role behavior in the project context if the appropriate project-related measures are used. This is an important finding as it aligns the findings in regard to the linkage of organizational justice and OCB from the project literature with the literature on permanent organizations. Through this we contribute to the literature on project behavior and respond to the call for more integration of organizational behavior aspects into project studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Unterhitzenberger and Müller, 2020)</ref>. And thirdly, we are able to partly explain the impact of organizational justice on project success through PCB. This is relevant as it highlights the significance of the voluntary behavior of project team members that goes beyond </p></div>
