<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Health and well-being are central to the global economy and significant steps are being made by service scholars and practitioners to improve individuals' quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Sweeney et al., 2015)</ref>. This focus has led to the growing area of transformative services -services which assist uplifting the well-being of customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al., 2013)</ref>. However, significant health issues remain worldwide, such as obesity resulting from overconsumption of food and beverage products <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Seiders and Petty, 2004)</ref>. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that obesity has nearly doubled since 1975, with 1.9 billion adults being overweight and 650 million being classified as obese <ref type="bibr">(WHO, 2017)</ref>. This is concerning, because obesity is noted as leading to other health complications, such as diabetes, psychosocial problems, osteoarthritis, and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Reilly and Kelly, 2011)</ref>. Service scholars and service practitioners therefore still have an important role to play in delivering these services and understanding how they can address such health issues.</p><p>Traditionally, health and well-being customers are required to be physically present to receive services which improve their well-being (e.g. visiting a dietitian or doctor); however, in recent years, mobile technology has been increasingly used to deliver such transformative services <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Schuster et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Schuster et al., , 2015))</ref>. In addition to the growing prevalence of transformative services being delivered by technology, new approaches to how these experiences are delivered are emerging. One such approach is gamification -the use of game design elements which enable greater value-creation for service users <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Huotari and Hamari, 2017)</ref>. Service practitioners and researchers have realized a great opportunity exists in using "gameful" thinking for service provision, with the mobile gaming industry growing at 19% per year to a total of US$46.1 billion in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(McDonald, 2017)</ref>. Further, transformative services and gamification sit at the nexus of two prevalent areas of service research: improving health and well-being through the delivery of services <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Ostrom et al., 2015)</ref>, and the use of gamification to encourage real-world behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Johnson et al., 2016)</ref>. Thus, it is timely to understand how gamification and transformative services can be used in tandem to improve customer wellbeing behaviors.</p><p>Transformative services are known to create an array of support resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rosenbaum and Massiah, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Van Dolen and Weinberg, 2017)</ref> and value <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blocker and Barrios, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Van Oerle et al., 2016)</ref>. However, little service literature exists to explain how support resources and value are created via gamified mobile applications or apps (hereafter referred to as "transformative gamification services"). This is despite the existence of such practices in the marketplace. For example, FitBit+ provides support via encouraging statements, "Almost there! Get 1,487 steps more to hit your daily goal", and provides value to users via the tracking of physical activity and weight loss. Therefore, whilst it could be presumed support created by transformative gamified apps creates value, there is limited empirical evidence validating such an assumption. Furthermore, given the large array of different social support dimensions and value dimensions proposed in the service literature, it becomes hard to holistically understand their collective importance. Research suggests hierarchical modeling can be one useful approach to gain a greater holistic understanding of technological experiences <ref type="bibr">(Atker et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Piyathasan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wetzels et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, the first aim of this research is to empirically investigate the relationship between social support and value hierarchically in transformative gamification services.</p><p>Transformative gamification services can be unique in that they often encourage a social brand; that is, a behavior variant with attributes that bear similarities to that of a commercial brand. The notion of a social brand being a behavior is relatively new to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mulcahy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Naidoo and Abratt, 2018)</ref>, with the predominant alternative approach being social brands represented by campaigns or services <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Evans et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gordon et al., 2016)</ref>. This new and under-researched perspective of a social brand suggests that behaviors can act and be measured as brand variants. For example, <ref type="bibr">Mulcahy and colleagues' (2015)</ref> study suggests there are three variants of alcohol drinking behavior: absent drinking, moderate drinking, and binge drinking. Their study validates the performance of social behaviors being measured via brand equity. However, this is the only study to the authors' knowledge that validates and quantifies social behavior brands.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to confirm if indeed behaviors can function as a social brand.</p><p>Further, what also requires examination is how social support and value created by gamified transformative services support a social behavior brand, and whether these effects are direct (i.e. social support to social brand equity) or mediated (i.e. social support to social brand equity via value). Thus, the second aim of this research is to investigate the effect of social support on social brand equity, and whether this effect is direct or mediated by value.</p><p>One context in which these aims can be examined is that of a transformative gamification service encouraging healthy beverage consumption outside of a western culture, such as by Middle Eastern consumers. This is an important area to research transformative gamification services, as research points out that many gamification studies are situated within a western context and focused on behaviors such as alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dietrich et al., 2018)</ref> or exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Johnson et al., 2016)</ref>. Further, industry reports show that the consumption of beverages that can be perceived as "unhealthy," such as soft drinks, has increased from 33.8 million liters in 2012 to 38.7 million in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Statista, 2018a)</ref>. Therefore, it is important to clarify the generalizability of the positive impact of transformative gamification services in encouraging behaviors, such as healthy beverage consumption, beyond market segments situated in developed, western market economies.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, related literature is reviewed in the areas of gamification services, social support, value, and brand equity. This is followed by a presentation of the conceptual model and hypothesized relationships. The method of the study is then outlined and the results presented. A discussion of the results and their theoretical and practical implications is then provided. The paper concludes by outlining directions for future research. Overall, this paper contributes new knowledge by testing a hierarchical model with mediating effects, which takes into consideration social support, value, and social brand equity in a new well-being behavior and market segment setting. This newly proposed theoretical model and empirical findings further the agenda of gamification delivered via mobile platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hofacker et al., 2016)</ref>, and the service research priorities of <ref type="bibr">Ostrom and colleagues (2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Transformative gamification services</head><p>There is growing interest in the application of gamification in the services field. Research suggests gamification can create enjoyable and useful experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Koivisto and Hamari, 2014)</ref>, which can lead to improved engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harwood and Garry, 2015)</ref>. In the literature, there appears to be two streams of research in services relating to gamification. The first stream focuses on gamification for commercial benefit; that is, examining how gamification can increase consumers' usage of products and services which are commercially orientated, such as e-banking services <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rodrigues et al., 2016)</ref> or online shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Poncin, et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The second stream focuses on gamification for uplifting and maintaining change in consumers' performances of health and well-being behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hammedi et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Johnson et al., 2016)</ref>, which can be labelled "transformative gamification" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mulcahy et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Most research in transformative gamification has focused upon health and well-being behaviors, such as exercise <ref type="bibr">(Hamari and Kovisito, 2015)</ref>, smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mulcahy et al., 2018)</ref>, and energy consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, most studies are situated within developed economies and consumers from western markets such as the United States and Australia. The current research, however, focuses on a less-researched behavior in transformative gamification services -healthy beverage consumption -with consumers from an emerging non-western economy, namely Iran. Taking such a perspective and approach is important to extending the knowledge base of transformative gamification services and its generalizable effectiveness across different contexts. The next section reviews the literature on social support to begin setting the conceptual foundations of the study's model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Social support</head><p>In the literature, social support has been shown to be beneficial for assisting consumers to maintain or improve their well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Coulson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rosenbaum and Massiah, 2007)</ref>. This includes delivering social support through technological channels, such as online social support groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Coulson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Parkinson et al., 2017)</ref>. Whilst not thoroughly researched, transformative gamification services can offer social support by providing guidance and encouragement to users. When conceptualizing social support there appears to be agreement that the construct should be measured as a multi-dimensional construct to allow richer insight into the construct's characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Osman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yao et al., 2015)</ref>. Further, most studies appear to leverage the conceptualization of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cutrona and Russell (1990)</ref>, who propose five dimensions: emotional, informational, esteem, network, and tangible assistance.</p><p>However, despite agreement in the literature that social support is multi-dimensional and that many studies leverage the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cutrona and Russell (1990)</ref>, the number and characteristics of social support differ considerably in different studies (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rosenbaum and Massiah (2007)</ref> examine emotional and instrumental (informational) support, whereas <ref type="bibr">Parkinson and colleagues (2017)</ref> measure all five dimensions of social support: emotional, informational, esteem, network, and tangible assistance. The variance in the number of social support dimensions examined across this study is to be expected, as it is dependent on the behavior, service user, and service under investigation. Therefore, for the purposes of this research, social support is conceptualized as a two-dimensional hierarchical construct represented by emotional and informational support.</p><p>These two dimensions were chosen as they represent the social support given by the transformative gamified service in addition to them being the most consistently measured dimensions in social support studies (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>&lt;Insert Table <ref type="table">1 about here&gt;</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Value creation</head><p>The creation of value is central to services, and particularly those that are transformative <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zainuddin et al., 2016)</ref> or gamification-focused <ref type="bibr">(Hamari and Kovisito, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Leclercq et al., 2017)</ref>. In the literature, multiple multi-dimensional frameworks have been used to examine value created by technological products and services. Of these, three appear to be predominately used to guide studies of value: consumption-values theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sheth et al., 1991)</ref>, hedonic and utilitarian value <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Babin et al., 1994)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Holbrook's (1994)</ref> typology. Of these three, Babin and colleagues' (1994) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Holbrook's (1994)</ref> typology appear to be best suited to understanding game experiences and gamification. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamari and Koivisto (2015)</ref> conceptualize hedonic benefits to be represented by two single-factor dimensionsplayfulness and enjoyment -and utilitarian benefits to be represented by usefulness and ease of use, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Okazaki (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">leverages Holbrook's (1994)</ref> typology operationalized by <ref type="bibr">Mathwick and colleagues (2001)</ref> to measure the value of mobile game experiences.</p><p>Research also suggests multiple frameworks of value can be used together to hierarchically measure and subsequently gain a deeper understanding of the concept's structure and how it collectively contributes to service users' experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wetzels et al., 2009)</ref>. Wetzels and colleagues' (2009) study, for example, demonstrates that value can be measured hierarchically and this can contribute to understanding users' loyalty. They argue that measuring value hierarchically can be advantageous as it allows for examining the richness of the construct, its level of factors, and its overall assessment of impact on desired outcomes. They also demonstrate that hierarchically measuring value can enable multiple frameworks -such as Babin and colleagues' (1994) hedonic and utilitarian value, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Holbrook's (1994)</ref> typology -to be represented within a singular model. They use Holbrook's dimensions to measure experiential value and hierarchically model them according to Babin and colleagues' hedonic and utilitarian value dimensions. Research outside of value also demonstrates similar advantages for hierarchically modeling similar constructs, such as service quality in technological settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blut, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fassnacht and Koese, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Piyathasanan et al., 2015)</ref>. However, research which goes beyond the single-order measurement of value and uses hierarchical modeling within transformative services and gamification is limited. This research takes a similar approach to Wetzels and colleagues (2009) by using <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Holbrook's (1994)</ref> typology to measure value, and Babin and colleagues' (1994) framework to hierarchically map their characteristics. Undertaking such an approach is important, as users are likely to evaluate certain dimensions of value created by a transformative gamified service, but also assess the cumulative value created by these dimensions. It is therefore proposed that hierarchical modelling can achieve these two purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Brand equity and social brands</head><p>Brands can represent products, services, people, places, and ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Keller, 1998)</ref>. Recently, branding has been extended to apply to social behaviors (e.g. drinking in moderation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mulcahy et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Keller (1998)</ref> points out that branding behaviors can be feasible and that actual behaviors need to be branded. In the literature, the predominate approach to branding a social behavior relates to a supportive campaign or product/service (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</p><p>For example, the campaign 'Truth SM ' is a brand which represents quitting smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Evans et al., 2002)</ref>, whereas services such as 'Breastscreening Queensland' studied by <ref type="bibr">Gordon and colleagues (2016)</ref> can represent a brand for services which assist well-being through cancer screening. However, more recently a new and less examined approach has been proposed to measure social brands. <ref type="bibr">Mulcahy and colleagues (2015)</ref> propose that branding frameworks, such as brand equity, can be applied to a social behavior without the co-branding of a campaign or supporting product or service. This bears similarities to other scholarly thoughts outside of branding, such as 'value-in-behavior' proposed by <ref type="bibr">Gordon and colleagues (2018)</ref>, which demonstrates that well-being behaviors themselves (without a product of service) can create value for consumers. <ref type="bibr">Mulcahy and colleagues (2015)</ref> point out that there can be variants in the behaviors consumers can perform in a "behavior category", which bear similarities to that of commercial product brands. For example, in their study they suggest that, like the commercial product of beer which can have brands with varying attributes (e.g. Heineken, Corona, and Peroni), so too can drinking behaviors (excessive drinking, moderate drinking, and abstinence drinking). They further demonstrate that the social brand of moderate drinking has similar brand equity dimension structures to that of commercial products. However, whilst <ref type="bibr">Mulcahy and colleagues (2015)</ref> have successfully applied brand equity to social brands in alcohol consumption behavior and Australian adolescents, there is still a need to replicate and extend these findings to different social behaviors and market segments. It is important to extend the external validity (generalizability) of their findings and ensure they are applicable to different behavior contexts, such as healthy beverage consumption and Irian consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kerr et al., 2016)</ref>. This study therefore examines the existence and structure of brand equity, specifically the dimensions of brand awareness, brand image, perceived quality, and brand loyalty, and how they contribute to the overall brand equity (as a second higher-order factor, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blahut et al., 2004)</ref> of a social behavior brand, and how this can be encouraged by the social support and value delivered via transformative gamification services.</p><p>&lt;Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2 about here&gt;</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conceptual model and hypotheses development</head><p>The literature review established the conceptual basis of the study and highlighted gaps in the literature. Based upon the gaps in the literature, this research presents a conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) which hierarchically measures the constructs of social support, value, and brand equity. Furthermore, the model suggests there is a mediated relationship between social support and brand equity via value. Justification for the proposed model and its relationships are discussed below.</p><p>Based on prior research, it is hypothesized that social support created by transformative gamified services will create value for users. This follows the work of Loane and colleagues' (2015) netnographic study findings, which suggests that the social support generated from online health communities can create value for members. Similarly, Van Oerle and colleagues (2016) found online health communities that provide support and information to members can create affective (hedonic) and cognitive (utilitarian) value.</p><p>Establishing the relationship between social support and value is important, as while prior studies have hinted at the link between these two constructs this has been mainly qualitative.</p><p>Therefore, while there are suggestions that social support and value are linked, research is required to confirm these findings. Thus, based upon the evidence of prior studies, the following relationship is suggested for testing:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Social support has a direct and positive association with value.</p><p>A review of the literature suggests alternative approaches regarding the interrelationships between social support, value, and brand equity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rosenbaum and Massiah's (2007)</ref> study demonstrates that social support can have a direct effect on loyalty, a component of brand equity, whereas He and Li's (2010) study of high-tech services brand equity can be mediated by value. Research also suggests that aspects of brand equity can be antecedents rather than outcomes of customer value <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brodie et al., 2009)</ref>. As this study theorizes the impact of social support on creating value and support on social brand equity, it is appropriate and expected that social supports' impact will be mediated by value, and consequently have an indirect effect on brand equity. Thus, the following is proposed for testing:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Social support has a significant indirect effect on brand equity via value. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Study Setting</head><p>This study was conducted in Iran, a developing country in the Middle East with a population of over 80 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Statista, 2018b)</ref>. Conducting the study in Iran provided an interesting market segment to examine in relation to their technology adoption and usage, as well as excessive consumption of alcohol. First, in relation to the adoption of technology, industry reports show that Iranian mobile users have reached 53 in 2018, an increase from 47 million in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jafari, 2018)</ref>. Thus, an opportunity exists for global and domestic technological service providers in Iran and the findings of this study besides its theoretical insights is how gamified technological services can be designed and marketed for this rapidly expanding market.</p><p>For the desired health and well-being behavior, reduced alcohol consumption, Iran also provides an interesting study setting. Despite alcohol being illegal in Iran, many alcoholic beverages are smuggled and distributed via the black-market or is illegally homemade <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lankarani and Afshari, 2014)</ref>. Further, the social stigmatism and legal restrictions on alcohol consumption in Iran prevents consumers from admitting habits and problematic behaviours, which makes it difficult for hospital and medical services to identify and assist these consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alavi, et al. 2016)</ref>. Therefore, whilst excessive alcohol consumption is acknowledged as a health issue for Iran, its scale is somewhat difficult to determine and so too is the forecasting and planning of the delivery of services to overcome this issue. Transformative gamification services delivered via apps is one potential novel way to evade such difficulties and circumstances, as the use of mobile technology to gain access to health and medical services is known to provide greater anonymity and increase consumers' confidence in accessing potentially vital services in comparison to those which are face-to-face <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Schuster, et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data Collection and Sample</head><p>A survey was chosen as the data collection instrument for the study. Participants were recruited via social media posts, social media sites, and flyers with a download link to a purpose-built gamification app for the study (details regarding the app will be outlined shortly). Participants were incentivized to partake in the study with the chance to go into a prize draw of a one-in-five chance to win a gold coin worth US$100. Once participants had installed the app they were directed to a registry page with questions relating to their height, weight, age, and current habits regarding beverage consumption. This demographic information was important not only for the study, but it enabled the gamification app to tailor its information to the user. Participants were directed to use the gamified app for a period of 2 weeks, after which time they were invited to fill out a questionnaire with items relating to social support, value, and brand equity. The final sample consisted of 351 respondents. The sample profiles are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. The sample shows a good variability across gender and a good variation across those in normal weight (45.86%) and overweight or obese categories (50.99%) according to their self-reported body mass index (BMI), calculated using height and weight. The sample shows a slight tendency for respondents to be aged 20-35, which is to be expected as this group is known to adopt technology faster and perceive more value in the services it provides <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kumar and Lim, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>&lt;Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> </p></div>

The gamified app also included five mini-games. Users were rewarded points within the gamified app for performing desired behaviors in the real world (e.g. drinking a healthy beverage). This therefore facilitated the use of game design elements for purposes beyond entertainment and outside of the gaming system, which is reflective of conceptualizations of gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Deterding et al., 2011)</ref>. The gamified app also provided messages of encouragement and informative facts regarding the beverages being consumed by users and the impact they had (positive or negative) on their health, reflecting emotional and informational support.</p><p>&lt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> about here&gt;</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Instrument validation</head><p>Prior to testing the research hypotheses, the constructs were assessed for convergent and discriminant validity via confirmatory factor analysis. For the hierarchical analysis, social support and brand equity were measured as second-order hierarchical constructs, whereas value was measured as a third-order hierarchical construct, which is consistent with prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wetzels et al., 2009)</ref>. Following the procedures suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bagozzi and Yi (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Fornell and Larker (1981)</ref>, convergent validity was assessed via the t-values associated with the parameter estimates. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows that the loadings of the items were positively and statistically significant for all constructs examined in the study. The reliability of the items was also confirmed, with the composite reliability index being higher than the recommended threshold of .60 <ref type="bibr">(Fornell and Larker, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>The constructs' hierarchical structures were also assessed. The two dimensions of support, emotional support (.833), and informational support (.945), loaded with significant tvalues onto the hierarchical factor of social support, validating it as a second-order construct.</p><p>Next, the hierarchical structure of value was assessed. Service excellence (.979) and Customer Return on Investment (CROI) (.974) had high factor loadings and significant tvalues with the second-order construct of utilitarian value, confirming it as a second-order construct. Aesthetics (.860) and playfulness (.934) met factor-loading thresholds and had significant t-values, validating hedonic value as a second-order construct. Utilitarian value (.996) and hedonic value (.966) had high factor loadings and significant t-values, validating value as a third-order construct. Finally, brand equity's hierarchical structure was assessed, with brand awareness (.962), brand image (.989), perceived quality (.957), and brand loyalty (.990) having high factor loadings and significant t-values, confirming it as a second-order hierarchical construct. Discriminant validity was also established with AVE scores being above their related shared variances with constructs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref>). After establishing the hierarchical structure of the constructs, the measurement model was assessed with the results (CMIN/DF=1.39 CFI=.97, TLI=.97, RMSEA=.03) suggesting the model had an acceptable fit to the data. The CMIN/DF ratio was smaller than the recommended 3 by <ref type="bibr">Fornell and Larker (1981)</ref>, indicating a good model fit.</p><p>&lt;Insert Tables <ref type="table">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5 about here&gt;</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Testing of hypotheses</head><p>To test the hypothesized relationships structural equation modelling in AMOS24.0 was performed. The structural model had a good fit to the data (CMIN/DF=1.39, CFI=.97, TLI=.97, RMSEA=.03) and the hypotheses testing results are detailed in Table <ref type="table">6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. Testing revealed social support had a positive association with value (β=.38, p&lt;.000), as hypothesized in H1. This indicates social support creates a valuable transformative gamification service experience for users. H2 predicted social support would have a significant indirect effect on brand equity via value. The results revealed the direct effect of social support on brand equity was non-significant (β=-.03, ns), whereas results revealed (as predicted in H2) that social support had a significant indirect effect on brand equity via the mediator of value (β=.34, p&lt;.000). The results also revealed value had a strong significant and direct positive association with brand equity (β=.94, p&lt;.000), supporting H3. This suggests value created via transformative gamification services positively builds brand equity relating to the social behavior being encouraged. The model also produced a high R² of .87 for brand equity, suggesting the model was a good predictor.</p><p>&lt;Insert Table <ref type="table">6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> about here&gt;</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>This research investigates the influence of social support on value and social brand equity in a transformative gamification setting through the empirical testing of a hierarchical model.</p><p>The hierarchical model was shown to outperform rival models measuring constructs at a lower order, and the effect of social support being fully mediated by value.

Collectively, the results also both support and build on extant literature to provide new insight into the emerging area of transformative gamification in three ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Hierarchical Modelling for Gamification Service Research</head><p>The first theoretical contribution of this study relates to its hierarchical modelling approach. The results of this research indicate that the conceptual model fits well to the data and outperforms other competing models measured at lower orders. To the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first to theoretically propose and empirically demonstrate a hierarchical model for transformative gamification. Previous modeling of gamification, including those of a transformative and commercial focus, have predominately modelled constructs such as value as single-order constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Koivisto and Hamari, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hamari and Kovisito, 2015)</ref>. This research demonstrates an alternative theoretical view of conceptualizing and empirically testing related constructs in gamification hierarchically to provide a more holistic perspective of users' experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Piyathasanan et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Wetzels et al., 2009)</ref>. Consistent with the emerging evidence in digital technologies and experiences, the findings of this study suggest value has a hierarchical structure in a transformative gamification setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wetzels et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mencarelli and Lombart, 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, our study extends this perspective by confirming that social support and brand equity can also have hierarchical structures, which to date has not been thoroughly explored or validated in the literature.</p><p>Taking a hierarchical approach to modelling consumers experiences with transformative gamification is conceptually interesting and valuable for a number of reasons.</p><p>First, it represents a step toward better understanding the associations between various subdimensions (for example the interrelationships and structure of value) <ref type="bibr">(Faasnacht &amp; Koese, 2006)</ref>. Second, the findings of this study suggest hierarchical construct models provide utility to gamification and service scholars in that it allows for greater theoretical parsimony and a reduction in model complexity (i.e. the number of hypothesized relationships tested) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wetzels, Odekerken-Schröder, Van Oppen, 2009)</ref>. This is important for service researchers examining gamification in particular as many of the constructs and frameworks are multidimensional and often have a considerable amount of relationships between single order factor constructs. As a result, exciting opportunities exist for service and gamification scholars to test prior (and future) studies frameworks which theorize single order factors are related but yet to be empirically supported from a hierarchical modelling approach.</p><p>Furthermore, this offers service and gamification some flexibility in their theorization and analysis by allowing diagnostic examinations of the effect of single order factors but also the cumulative effect of concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Social Support, Value and Social Brand Equity Interrelationships</head><p>The second contribution of this study relates to a greater understanding of the interrelationships between social support, value and social brand equity. In this study, the findings show value plays a mediating role between social support and social behavior brand equity. Prior research has suggested that social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Parkinson et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rosenbaum and Massiah, 2007)</ref> and value <ref type="bibr">(Hamari and Kovisito, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zainuddin et al., 2013)</ref> can influence well-being outcomes. Yet, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first to show the strong positive influence social support has on creating value in transformative gamification. Consistent with prior research, this study found that value plays a mediating role (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">He and Li, 2010)</ref>, and that social support has a non-significant direct effect on brand equity, but a significant indirect effect via value. This has potentially important implications beyond transformative gamification, as social support and value are two central concepts in the broader transformative service research agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al., 2013)</ref>. In addition, the gamification literature has established that value can influence desired outcomes (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Hamari and Kovisito, 2015)</ref>, but the antecedents which influence the creation of value have not yet been thoroughly researched. This research therefore sheds light on social support as one form of antecedent that can result in value creation in transformative gamification services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3">Behaviors as Social Brands</head><p>The third contribution of this study relates to measuring brands in transformative service and social marketing settings. Theorists in social marketing have posited that behaviors function as products and brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gordon, 2012)</ref>. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence that supports this view, with most studies examining branding of services and campaigns which encourage a desired behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Evans et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Asbury et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gordon et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Evans et al., 2016)</ref>. Findings from this research provide important empirical evidence that social behaviors can indeed be viewed as products measured via brands. In doing so, it theoretically extends the generalizability of prior studies -those prior studies which have thus far only provided preliminary evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mulcahy et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Naidoo and Abratt, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, this research strengthens the theoretical perspective that there are two approaches to branding for social behaviors: branding of the service or campaign, and branding of the social behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Practical implications</head><p>There are several important practical implications derived from this study. At a higher level, the results of this study add to the evidence-base of transformative gamification assisting the well-being of consumers. As well-being and healthcare services are often funded publicly via government bodies or non-government organizations (NGOs), the results of this study provide further compelling evidence to governments, NGOs, and other well-being service providers to support the funding and creation of transformative gamification apps that target health and well-being behaviors. This could also be important for countries where the discussion of particular well-being behaviors with health professionals is a taboo topic or illegal such as the consumption of alcohol in countries such as Iran. The findings of this study therefore suggest that transformative gamification is one alternative that provides a potentially more anonymous approach for consumers to seek health and well-being services.</p><p>Our findings also reveal the importance of designing social support mechanisms to create valuable transformative gamification service experiences. Thus, transformative gamification designers should pay special attention to incorporating elements which provide social support to users. Specifically, from our conceptualization of social support, emotional support and informational support are encouraged to be especially designed within gamification transformative services. Emotional support should focus on boosting users' selfesteem and ego. For example, apps in the current marketplace such as 7 Cups: Anxiety &amp; Stress Chat 1 provides users with anonymous emotional support and counseling from trained professionals. Practitioners should consider ways in which design features such as chatrooms or communities incorporated into transformative gamification services to foster the seeking and provision of (anonymous) emotional support. For informational support, the findings suggest that design features such as push notifications or tracking features can designed within transformative gamified apps to create value for users. Practitioners could therefore undertake similar design approaches to apps such as Strava<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> , which allows users to track their running or riding and analyse their performance overtime.</p><p>The model and findings from this study also demonstrate service and gamification practitioners are able to measure social support, value and social brand equity at multiple levels. Just as the hierarchical model approach provides flexibility for scholars, this approach also provides practitioners the ability to evaluate these constructs at a primary dimensional level (single order factor) or cumulative level (higher order). Practitioners can therefore make informed strategic decisions when evaluating and assessing gamification services based upon their evaluation aims as well as their information and reporting requirements <ref type="bibr">(Dagger, et al. 2007</ref>). Finally, our findings show transformative service practitioners can measure well-being behaviors using branding models and frameworks such as brand equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mulcahy et al., 2015)</ref>. Practitioners could thus pay attention to the variation of the behavior they are encouraging customers to perform and pinpoint the defining characteristics or value propositions the behavior has in comparison to other competing behavior brands. Further, this demonstrates a new perspective and method by which transformative service practitioners can measure well-being. It is suggested that practitioners measure social brand equity for both their targeted well-being behavior and other competing behaviors to diagnostically evaluate the performance of their services and campaigns in encouraging well-being behavior. Some limitations of this research will now be acknowledged. This study utilized a crosssectional design of consumers' experiences after using a transformative gamification service for a period of two weeks. It would be interesting for future research to track consumers' experiences with transformative gamification services over time and identify how value and brand equity in a social behavior evolve (or diminish). A worthy direction for future research would be to consider other aspects aside from social support which assist in creating valuable transformative gamification service experiences. This could include the influence of game design elements, such as points, challenges, and characters, on the creation and experience of value. Caution should be taken when attempting to draw generalizability from the study's findings to other market settings and behaviors. Whilst this study examined transformative gamification services in a market segment (Iran) and behavior not thoroughly researched, future research may benefit from examining cross-cultural differences or variances which may occur based upon different behaviors being encouraged. Future studies could also seek to investigate whether the findings of the current study are consistent in other developing markets beyond Iran such as countries in the Middle East (e.g. Saudi Arabia and Qatar) and Latina America (for example Chile and Argentina). Another interesting avenue for future research would to be examine factors which moderate (e.g. strengthen or weaken) the relationships examined within this study. For example, whether consumers previous experience or familiarity with technology (in the case of this research apps or smartphones) or duration of use based upon data analytics changes the nature of the relationships between social support, value and social brand equity. Finally, whilst outside the scope of this study, including some emerging concepts in transformative services and gamification could provide greater insight. For example, consumer engagement is emerging as an important concept for understanding value co-creation, gamification and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harwood and Garry, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hollebeek and Andreaseen, 2018)</ref>, and its incorporation in future studies could provide an interesting extension on the current study.</p></div>
