<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the growth in social media and social network advertising (SNA), scant theoretical and empirical knowledge exists on the differences between countries, and the perceptions and attitudes towards social network advertising. The purpose of the study is to investigate the relationships between users' perceptions (personal and societal), their attitudes and their behaviour towards Facebook advertising, across three countries, as well as the moderating role of privacy and general advertising attitudes. Online surveys were administered and a convenience sampling resulted in 1,166 respondents. Structural equation modelling was used to test the proposed model.</p><p>The research indicates that the social support theory shows promise for examining the perceptions and attitudes towards SNA. Furthermore, the validity of the conceptual model is confirmed in all three countries however, the strength of these relationships differs.</p><p>Additionally, it is evident that consumers' culture influences the role of privacy and trust in SNA perceptions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>"Advertising works most effectively when it's in line with what people are already trying to do. And people are trying to communicate in a certain way on Facebook -they share information with their friends, they learn about what their friends are doing -so there's really a whole new opportunity for a new type of advertising model within that medium" (Mark <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Zuckerberg, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Social Networking Sites (SNS) have fostered communication, sharing and collaboration between people across the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barefoot &amp; Szabo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tuten, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hajli, 2014)</ref>. It is this exchange of information and social support that attracts users to these social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Ridings &amp; Gefen, 2004)</ref>. Social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter, has millions of users, many of whom have incorporated SNS into their everyday lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The magnitude to which the use of SNS has penetrated the market has provided marketers with attractive opportunities to communicate and engage with their respective markets, based on users disclosed personal information, such as location, age and personal interests <ref type="bibr">(Chang, Liu &amp; Shen, 2017)</ref>, very cost effectively <ref type="bibr">(O'Flynn, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Lee &amp; Hong, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Prior research <ref type="bibr">(Powers, Advicula, Austin, Graico &amp; Snyder, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taylor, Lewin &amp; Strutton, 2011)</ref> has shown that, although brand perceptions and offline, traditional advertising continue to be relevant, social media have raised the expectations of consumers in terms of what is advertised and how it is advertised. Essentially, consumers use SNS to connect and to collect information to make purchase decisions <ref type="bibr">(Powers et al., 2011)</ref> and as a result, SNS are now seen as trusted sources of information and opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Chu, 2011)</ref>. Consequently, SNSs have become powerful marketing tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Yadav &amp; Rahman, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Change et al., 2017)</ref> for brands and an important advertising vehicle for marketers <ref type="bibr">(Tuten and Soloman, 2018)</ref> globally, due to its ability to reach across borders <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Tuten &amp; Mintu-Wimsatt, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Although social networks such as Twitter and Snapchat is growing in popularity, particular among the younger generation, Facebook remains the world largest social media platform, with over 2.27 billion active users signing in monthly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chaffey, 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, Facebook has the biggest social media share by platform worldwide with 72.12%, followed by Pinterest (14.47%) and Twitter (6.07%) <ref type="bibr">(Global Statcounter, 2019)</ref>. Therefore SNS, such as Facebook, have become attractive advertising platform in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Kirkpatrick, 2015)</ref>. Additionally, Facebook is constantly introducing new features that could enhance Facebook advertising i.e.</p><p>Augmented Reality Ads, advertising cross-platforms, new features to enhance the use of video advertising such as 'Facebook Stories Ads'. Especially in Australia Facebook currently has a 60.8% share of the social media market, followed by Pinterest (25.67%) and Twitter (5.99%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(GlobalStat Counter, 2019)</ref>. Similarly, in Germany Facebook still has 67.51 % of the market share compared to Pinterest (17.86%), Twitter (5.37%), and YouTube (5.09%). Additionally, Facebook is the largest social media platform in South Africa with a penetration rate of 53%, followed by LinkedIn (18%), Instagram (9%) and Twitter (4%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Businesstech, 2019)</ref>. It is evident that Facebook is an appropriate platform to investigate due to its massive user base, its popularity, its integration into consumers' everyday lives and its continual growth <ref type="bibr">(Internet World Stats Report, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, Statistica, 2018)</ref>. Due to the increasing popularity of Facebook for users, as well as marketing practitioners, issues related to advertising in this platform has become a dominant theme in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alalwan, 2018)</ref>. In spite of some concerns, such as those related to privacy, the trend of engaging with Facebook as an advertising channel by marketers and advertisers, is still increasing.</p><p>Although research does exist in the area of online marketing and advertising, not all of this research is automatically transferable to the social networks such as Facebook due to its unique social, interactive and user-centric context. Furthermore, online advertising often includes a very broad spectrum of contexts ranging from virtual game worlds to collaborative projects and blogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bond, Ferraro, Luxton &amp; Sands, 2010)</ref>. The fast growth of SNS usage merits a specific focus on consumer attitudes towards SNA <ref type="bibr">(Taylor et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>Given the importance of social media several studies have attempted to investigate general promotional activities conducted on these platforms such as the diffusion of messages on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chang, Yu, &amp; Lu, 2015)</ref>; consumers attitude towards information sharing on SNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Lee, Kim &amp; Ham, 2016)</ref>; consumers' responses to SNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Lee and Hong, 2016)</ref>; consumers' response towards sponsored advertising on SNS using the TAM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Lin &amp; Kim, 2016)</ref>; cognitive effectiveness of SNA <ref type="bibr">(Rejón-Guardiaet al., 2016)</ref> and targeting on social media sites <ref type="bibr">(Schumann, von Wagnehein &amp; Groene, 2014)</ref>. Most of these studies concluded that SNA enhances the influence of marketing activities on the users' perceptions.</p><p>Yet, only a limited number focused specifically on Facebook, including motivations to use <ref type="bibr">Facebook (Sashittal, Sriramachandramurthy &amp; Hodis, 2013)</ref>, identifying various Facebook segments <ref type="bibr">(Wallace et al., 2014)</ref>; trust in Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chang et al. 2017)</ref>; social support in Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Chiang &amp; Huang, 2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Facebook advertising (i.e. Banister et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Duffett, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dehghanit &amp; Tumer, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jung, Shim, Jim &amp; Khang, 2016)</ref>. Unfortunately, the majority of studies were conducted in a single country context, mainly using student samples and often only focusing on positive influences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Knoll (2016)</ref> confirms these gaps in a systematic review on SNA by concluding that future studies should: (a) investigate the influences (both positive and especially negative) of SNA on consumers attitudes and behaviors for example, response towards advertising, (b) the synergies between traditional and social network advertising, (c) steering away from single country contexts and (d) employing non-student samples. In a similar fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alalwan, Rana, Dwivedi and Algharabat (2017)</ref> concluded after an extensive review of marketing on SNS, that researchers should focus their attention on advertising on specific platforms, trust perceptions, additional theories to provide a clearer picture, as well as other dimensions than hedonic features as antecedent to SNA attitudes.</p><p>It is thus evident that research on how Facebook advertising is perceived and how it influences attitudes and behavior, is yet relatively incomplete and somewhat limited in scope <ref type="bibr">(Godeya et al., 2016)</ref>, especially in cross continental research <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Wesley et al., 2018)</ref>. It seems that this argument still holds as <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jung et al. (2016)</ref> urge researchers to explore the relationships between attitude and behavior towards SNA in diverse cross-cultural studies.</p><p>As engaging with SNS may result in issues related to privacy and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Tsay-Vogel et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chang et al., 2017 )</ref>, as evident in Facebook that was recently forced to establish an independent privacy committee after being fined for violating consumer privacy rights (BBC <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">News, 2019)</ref>, investigating advertising on Facebook cannot be done without considering these issues as well.</p><p>Additionally, there is a gap in literature concerning the effect of social media advertising in comparison with traditional advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Morra, Ceruti, Chierici &amp; Gregorio, 2018)</ref>. Posing a challenge for brands to understand the level of integration and influence between SNA and advertising in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Schivinski and Dabrowski, 2015)</ref>. As a result, it is important to investigate consumers' attitudes toward advertising on social media and more general media and the level of their effectiveness on business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Boateng &amp; Okoe, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Valos, Polonsky, Mayondo &amp; Lipscombal, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Metha (2000)</ref> for example found that the performance of printed advertising is impacted by consumers' general attitudes toward advertising, yet to date no such research exist in the field of social media, especially Facebook.</p><p>Given that traditional media advertising is usually based on one-way communications versus Facebook advertising having a two-way relational communication model, not only between Facebook friends but also between brands and users, makes further investigation imperative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Knoll (2016)</ref> found that social theories are often used in the study of social media, due to the social nature of these networks. Furthermore, as SNS are used for communication, sharing and collaboration between people across the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barefoot &amp; Szabo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tuten, 2018)</ref> to interact with other users online (Hajli 2014), these sites provide opportune platforms for social support. Furthermore, research has shown that SNS such as Facebook has been used as a important venues for asking and receiving social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kim, 2014)</ref>. Hence, we used the social support theory, as the theoretical lens for the study to argue that functional social support in a trustworthy network, as evident in personal perceptions or lack thereof in societal perceptions, influences users' attitudes and behavior.</p><p>In an attempt to address some of these gaps this study will employ non-students samples, underpinned by social support theory, in a diverse cross-country context, investigating both positive and negative influences as well as the role of traditional advertising and privacy issues.</p><p>In doing so contributing to the growing body of knowledge of social media research with as specific focus on SNA but especially potential cultural differences evident in a Facebook context. Cross-cultural psychology research propose that culture influences attitudes as well as responses toward advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(de Mooij, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Gudykunst, 2003)</ref>. Cultural differences likewise exist in media consumption patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hasebrink et al., 2015)</ref>. These differences are important to consider for Facebook advertisers in designing strategies around multi-country campaigns to connect and engage successfully with consumers in a diverse cross-country context.</p><p>Consequently, we followed the advice of <ref type="bibr">Wang, Yua and Wei (2012)</ref>, as well as that of <ref type="bibr">Ducoffet (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Godeya et al.(2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Wesley et al. (2018)</ref>, that more social media research, especially in the context of Facebook, is needed, and especially across-countries, since consumers' sentiments from different cultural backgrounds could differ <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Petzer &amp; Meyer, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of the study is thus three-fold. Firstly, to determine the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors towards Facebook advertising as well as the influence of trust in the Facebook and secondly, to determine whether general advertising attitudes and privacy concerns have a moderating effect on the various attitudes towards Facebook ads. Thirdly, to determine if crosscountry difference exist in the context of Facebook advertising.</p><p>To achieve the research objectives, a restrained approached was used, by including aspects reflective of the two main types of perceptions -personal (positive) and societal (negative)and their influence on Facebook advertising attitudes and users reported behavior towards the advertised brand. This is because the purpose of the study is not to determine the already wellestablished perceptive dimensions of attitude towards advertising, but rather to determine the structural relationship between these perceptions and the general advertising attitudes, trust and privacy, as well as the specific attitudes towards Facebook advertising as well as the behavior towards a brand in a cross-country context. This study's main contribution lies in its diverse multi-country context advancing international marketing practises by identifying differences in the proposed model across cultures. In addition, it extends the theoretical lens for research on social network sites such as Facebook by using social support theory. Lastly, it address some of the gaps identified in SNA research by shedding light on the perceptions, attitudes and behavior towards Facebook advertising as well as the inclusion of the moderating role of general advertising attitudes and privacy. Adding insight into how marketers can use technology such as social media to get the best marketing results, but also taking cognisance of the challenges posed by trust and privacy concerns due to these technologies. The cross-continental context revealed several similarities, but also some cross-country differences, adding to the sparse SNA research available in a multi-country setting.</p><p>The next section addresses the literature and conceptual framework followed by the research methodology employed, results and implications of the study. The paper concludes with the limitations and suggestions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Literature review 2.1 Social network advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Mulero and Adeyeye (2013)</ref> contend that the tremendous growth of SNS can be attributed to SNS support for both the maintenance and the solidification of existing offline relationships, as well as the facilitation of the creation of new ones. SNS make massive global online communications accessible to anyone with an internet connection. They also add a participatory element to online communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barefoot &amp; Szabo, 2010)</ref>, by enabling consumers to create manageable information environments that are customisable and relevant to their preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Bright &amp; Daugherty, 2012)</ref>. Consequently, organisations are able to increasingly use SNS for marketing purposes, such as brand awareness, attracting new customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Zafar &amp; Khan, 2011)</ref>, managing customer relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Mulero &amp; Adeyeye, 2013)</ref>, increase purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Koivulehto, 2017)</ref> as well as advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Yang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Lee &amp; Hong, 2016)</ref>. These various applications of SNS for brands leads to an increase of online marketing efforts via social network sites. These marketing efforts, include actions that encourage consumers to buy products and brands with targeted marketing messages as well as encouraging users to share these messages with other consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bilgin, 2018)</ref>. Online advertising is defiend as: "Any form of commercial content available on the internet, delivered by any channel, in any form, designed to inform customers about a product or a service, at any degree of depth" <ref type="bibr">(Harker, 2008:296)</ref>. Applying this definition to Facebook advertising, these ads can come directly from companies (e.g. homepage ads), or via the postings of friends (e.g. social and organic impressions) and they usually appear in users <ref type="bibr">' Facebook newsfeed or sidebars (Taylor et al., 2011)</ref>. Brands can also advertise their products or brands through the Facebook brand page (fan page) -not in the scope of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Seller &amp; Laurindo, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Companies are also attempting to exploit indirect marketing strategies on SNS, such as creating polls, competitions, encouraging product reviews or the use of 'check-in' buttons <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Curran, Graham &amp; Temple., 2011)</ref>. SNA thus differs from traditional online advertising that is often distributed through banners or sponsored links and is often difficult to distinguish from user content. As a result, consumers have difficulty in distinguishing advertising from usergenerated content on SNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Jung et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefor a variety of ad formats such as video, image, collection, carousals, slideshows, 'playables' (Interactive ad before downloading app), instant experiences, offers, event response and page 'like's are available when advertising on Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Facebook, 2019)</ref>. Because of this difficulty to distinguish between homepage advertising, social impressions and organic impressions for consumers and continued blurring lines, for the purpose of this study, no distinction was made between direct and organic Facebook advertising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Facebook advertising</head><p>Facebook advertising for the purpose of this study refers to any type of advertising about a company, brand, cause, product or service on users Facebook page/wall/timeline. These ads may be directly from companies/brands or indirect via postings/likes of friends and appears in users Facebook newsfeed or sidebar. Thus, excluding other Facebook ad placements options such as Facebook marketplace, messages or Fan pages. The main advantage of Facebook advertising is its ability to reach an specific segment or group (targeting), additionally the majority of people word-wide spend most of their time on Facebook (80%) of all internet users use Facebook), and Facebook ads build engagement through interaction such as 'likes' and 'comments' between users and brands' advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Standberry, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Chou, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Brands also receive assistance as Facebook provides useful analytics and new additions such as "creative compass" that help advertisers to pre-test ads, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lincoln, 2019)</ref>. As more and more brands advertise on SNS such as Facebook and with Facebook's algorithm changes in 2017, it is difficult for brands to ensure that their communications show-up in user newsfeeds. Thus, brands need to ensure that their advertisements are effective when they do show up. By paying for Facebook ads brands ensure that, they do not only appear in more feeds, but they can also target their ads to the right consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chou, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Parmelee, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Targeting benefits advertisers but also users as it allows advertising to be less intrusive and more successful in delivering the appropriate content to the right users. With Facebook increasing its reach to advertise on the cross-platform messaging service for mobile devices (WhatsApp) and the several call to action buttons (contact us, shop now, watch video, download, use app, play game etc.) makes this a preferred social media platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Keates, 2019)</ref>. New trends for Facebook in 2019 include a move away from traditional keyword targeting to focusing on building audience segments and more automation such as 'Dynamic ads'. With 'Dynamic ads' brands will be able to upload an entire product catalogue and set campaign time and let Facebook do the rest. Additional features that will ensure that Facebook ads utilize video better such as 'unskippable' 'Facebook Storie' ads as well as Augmented Reality (AR) advertisements that will allow users to virtually interact with brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lincoln, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>However, the technology is not without its drawbacks for users and increase privacy and control issues are at the forefront of FB advertising (BBC News, 2019). Facebook was recently forced to establish an independent privacy committee after receiving a fine for violating consumer privacy rights. Facebook agreed to adopt new protections for the data users share on Facebook. In addition Facebook provides users with various privacy setting options such as a two-factor authentication process and adjustable privacy settings. These settings provide users with options to decide who will be able to can see their future posts, limit the audience for old post and decide how people will be able to find and contact them, to name but a few <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Schmidt, 2018)</ref>. Concerning advertising preference users can adjust the setting 'your ads preference' in the 'ads' sidebar in their Facebook settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Schmidt, 2018)</ref>. Although these adblocking options provide more control for users, it could negatively affect brands as it reduces ad exposure and results in fewer opportunities to generated income <ref type="bibr">(Shiler, Waldfogel &amp; Ryan, 2018)</ref>. However, interesting ad-blocking growth has stagnated on desktop (21%) and remains low on smartphones (7%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Newman et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Social support and social networks</head><p>Social network sites offers various benefits to firms, such as improved brand reputation (de Vries, Gensler &amp; Leeflang 2012), word-of-mouth recommendations <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2011b)</ref>, sales <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnihotri et al., 2016)</ref>, information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Lu &amp; Hsiao, 2010)</ref> as well as providing social support for users <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ballantine &amp; Stephenson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Verduyn et al., 2017)</ref>. As more consumers join SNSs, the importance of these sites, as an outlet for social support, increases as social media users are becoming more dependent on these networks to interact and engage <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Chiang &amp; Huang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Meng et al., 2017)</ref>. Facebook use is for example positively connected with social support, such as the providing of information, advice and friendship <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Sessions, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Consumers use a variety of social media tools to interact with other users, as well as online brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hajli, 2014)</ref>. It is this exchange of information that includes communication (advertising) from brands or friends posts, comments, shares or 'likes' that provides social support that attracts users to these social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Ridings &amp; Gefen 2004)</ref>. SNSs thus offer an environment for users (consumers) and brands, to exchange various types of social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Wong and Ma, 2016)</ref>. Social support can be viewed as "the perception or reception of coping assistance, or as attributes of one's social circle" <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Uchino, 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">House (1981:39)</ref> describes social support as "an interpersonal transaction involving one or more of the following: emotional concern, instrumental aid, information, or appraisal (information relevant to self-evaluation)". The information elements and the appraisal are especially relevant to Facebook advertising due to the direct linkage to information, self-image, entertainment, and falsity perceptions. Social support could be received from a range of sources, such as family or friends, but also from brands, or firms, or a brand community <ref type="bibr">(Taylor, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the popularity of SNS and its integration into consumers' everyday lives, coupled with the blurred lines between advertisements and social interaction on these platforms, the social support theory is an applicable lens, through which to investigate the perceptions and the attitudes towards advertising. Both brands and Facebook friends via their communication messages, comments, blogs and posts provide social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Wong &amp; Ma, 2016)</ref>. Social support includes both structural and functional aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Thoits, 2011)</ref>. The structural aspect refers more to the nature of individuals' social networks, such as the size and structure of a user's network; consequently, the functional definition of social support is more applicable to our study.</p><p>Functional social support focuses on both the perceived support availability and it is reflective of the extent to which an individual believes that support is available from the network, if needed. The functional aspects of social support include informational, esteem as well as emotional support <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Meng et al., 2017)</ref>. Research shows that SNSs generate both informational and emotional support <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ballantine &amp; Stephenson, 2011)</ref> and that such support increases the level of trust and reduces the perceived risk of using social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hajli, 2014)</ref>. In fact, majority of consumers who have access to the internet are also active users of social media due to the enjoyment of generating, distributing and collecting of information, as well as sharing and engaging -known as social support -on these channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kemp, 2016)</ref>. Social media, therefore, has developed new touchpoints such as communication messages (advertising) between consumers and brands on a global scale to provide social support.</p><p>Additionally, although social support is a universal resource, cultural differences have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Gurung, 2006)</ref>. In some cultures, an individual is perceived as more of a collective unit of society, whereas in the more individualistic cultures, social support is seen as a transaction, whereby one person seeks help from another. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kim et al. (2006)</ref>, different cultural ideas about social groups could be the reason for these differences in the extent of social support. Collective cultures social support systems are often better developed while individualist cultures often have smaller and less satisfying social support networks <ref type="bibr">(Scott, Ciarrochi, &amp; Dean, 2004)</ref>. A collectivistic nature also suggest that consumers are more likely to be motivated to engage in socializing activities online <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Muralidharan et al., 2015)</ref>. In comparing individualism-collectivism and social support from different members of a social network, it was evident that depending on their collectivist or individualist nature, individuals will seek out different members of their social networks for social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Triandis et al., 1988)</ref>. Furthermore, collective cultures get more and a better quality of social support than people in an individualistic cultural setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Triandis et al., 1988)</ref>. In individualistic cultures, the individual has more rights and fewer obligations, but as a result also receives less social support from the group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Goodwin, Hernandez and Plaza (2000)</ref> concluded that cultural background impact the type of social support sought and benefits derived from the support.</p></div>

An important sign of the efficiency of advertising is the perceptions and attitudes that consumers have towards advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Wang &amp; Sun, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Consumers' perceptions and attitudes towards advertising are seen as indicators of the success of advertising in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Wang et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">, Yaakop et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Krugman, Bauer and Greyser (1969)</ref> were some of the first to study consumer attitudes towards advertising in general and they found two main antecedents: the economic attitude and the social attitude. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Pollay and Mittal (1993)</ref> used this as a base from which they developed, and empirically supported, seven perceptions or belief antecedents that were applied to various other contexts, such as the traditional, as well as online advertising. These seven factors can be classified into two categories. The first category, labelled as personal use, consists of factors that include product information, social role and image, as well as the hedonic or pleasurable aspects. These aspects relate to the functional aspects of social support (emotional, informational and esteem support) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Meng et al., 2017)</ref>. The second category reflects a more generalised or macro-dimension, which includes aspects, such as value corruption, falsity or non-sense and materialism <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Pollay &amp; Mittal, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">O'Donoghue, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Tan &amp; Chia, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The latter are labelled as social effects.</p><p>Consumers derive utility from the hedonic value that entertaining messages could deliver, but also from advertising's role as a source of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Wang &amp; Sun, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Wolin et al.

( <ref type="formula">2011</ref>) also reported that information and entertainment were the strongest positive predictors of attitudes towards SNA.

(2009)</ref> found that the perceptions of advertising relevance and value, as well the social identity and group norms, is an important antecedent of consumers' attitudes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Zeng et al. (2017)</ref> confirmed this in online communities. These positive personal perceptions of Facebook ads that is almost imbedded (often difficult for users to distinguish between UGC and brand communication) into users private yet social network(s), bears a striking resembles to the functional aspects of social support that refers to emotional, informational and esteem support <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Meng et al., 2017)</ref>. Based on the above arguments and the social support theory, the same is expected to be true for Facebook advertising. Based on the forgoing discussion we hypothesise that:</p><p>H1: The personal perception of SNA is positively related to attitudes towards SNA.</p><p>In contrast to the above, <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Wang and Sun (2010)</ref> suggest that advertising is often condemned for a number of reasons. These include the promotion of materialism, altering values in a corruptive manner, and the misleading of consumers. It is, therefore, necessary to focus, not only on the positive personal perceptions, b u t a l s o o n t h e potential negative societal perceptions (social consequences) of Facebook advertising. Many consumers may enjoy advertisements but a great proportion of consumers view advertising as more misleading than informative <ref type="bibr">(Metha, 2000)</ref>. One can clearly see these two perspective from previous research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Metha (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Wang and Sun (2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Metha (2000)</ref> suggest that if consumers perceive advertisements as manipulative or false, they are likely to hold negative attitudes towards the ad and brand and are less likely to engage in positive behavior.</p><p>Consumers' negative attitudes toward advertising if often a result of its social effects, such as false or misleading advertising, materialism, and its influence on community values (Laroche, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kalamas &amp; Cleveland, 2005)</ref>. For more established and individualist markets issues such as information overload, clutter, and intrusiveness (privacy concerns), causes more irritation and result in a negative impact on advertising attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Laroche et al., 2005)</ref>. In terms of <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Pollay and Mittal (1993)</ref>, materialism, value corruption and falsity, or nonsense, are expected to result in a negative attitude towards advertising. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Wang et al. (2009)</ref> found that value corruption played a dominant role among the negative belief factors. Furthermore, the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Azeem and Haq (2012)</ref> showed that value-corruption perceptions were amongst the antecedents that were significant negative predictors of attitudes towards online advertising, which was consistent with the prior research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ducoffe, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Wolin et al., 2002)</ref>. Similarly, if advertising is viewed as promoting materialism, or being misleading (falsity), it is also expected to result in negative attitudes. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Azeem and Haq (2012)</ref> were found to be consistent with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Wolin et al. (2002)</ref>. These researchers found that falsity/nonsense can also negatively predict attitudes towards online advertising. One can thus argue that if SNA is perceived as not providing social support users would expect from a social network, one could expect a negative attitude from social media users, who believe that SNA undermines their values and fails to provide social support the need. Based on the foregoing discussion, we hypothesise that:</p><p>H2: The societal perception of SNA is negatively related to attitudes towards SNA.</p><p>Exchanges between brands and customers revolve around relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Morgan &amp; Hunt 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Mosteller and Poddar, (2017)</ref> argue that trust is fundamental in these relationships, implying that one party is expected to perform actions that would result in positive outcomes, and not take actions that would result in negative outcomes (For example, misusing personal information). Using social network sites such as Facebook, may result in trust issues for users <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chang et al., 2017)</ref>, and as such marketers should consider trust in the platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Jang, Chang &amp; Chen, 2015)</ref>. Prior research also suggests that privacy needs of users in developing regions are different from those in developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Vashisiha, Anderson &amp; Mare, 2018)</ref>, and as a result, trust in the internet differs significantly between countries. For example, in many large developing economies, internet users trust 'the internet', while this is not necessarily the case in developed countries. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hampson, (2018)</ref> it could be that "newcomers to the internet might be unaware of the potential abuses and risks". Investigating the differences in various online behaviors across countries is thus highly applicable <ref type="bibr">(Punj, 2013)</ref>. Advertising received from a trusted source is considered more acceptable than marketing messages from an unknown brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Leppaniemi &amp; Karjaluoto, 2005)</ref>.

In a similar fashion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Boateng and Okoe (2015)</ref> found that there is a relationship between users' attitude toward SNA and their behavioral responses. In situations where consumers have a positive disposition towards online advertising, they are more likely to click on advertisements and to purchase online. Users' behavior towards SNA can be privacy-related, advertising-related (e.g. ad-clicking) and brand or firm-related (e.g. visiting the website, or purchasing).</p><p>The effectiveness of Facebook advertising should be measure by taking into consideration consumer evaluations of the interest and actions produced by such advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dehghani &amp; Tumer, 2015)</ref>.

'Actual purchases made' or 'shopping' are popular behaviors measured in traditional advertising research, as a measure of the effectiveness of the advertisement, and this is also applicable to the online world. For the focus of this study, the reported behavior will be investigated in terms of behavior towards the brand.</p><p>The converse to this is that if customers exhibit a negative attitude towards online advertising, they are less likely to click on online advertisements and they are therefore more likely to purchase less, or not at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Wang &amp; Sun, 2010)</ref>. It is evident that a positive relationship should exist between the overall attitude towards online advertising and the resulting behavior.</p><p>Furthermore, supported by the Theory of Planned Behavior <ref type="bibr">(Ajzen, 1991:179)</ref>, which argues that attitudes are perceived as a predictor of behavioral intentions of individuals, which ultimately results in actual behavior, we hypothesise that:</p><p>H4: Attitude towards SNA positively influences Facebook users' behavior towards the brand/firm.</p></div>

For the most part, a more favourable attitude toward advertising in general is connected to a more positive advertising evaluation, such as the advertisement being informative or entertaining. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Beneke, Cumming, Stevens and Versfeld (2010)</ref> found that the more positive a consumer's attitude towards advertising in general, the more positive his/her attitude would be towards mobile advertising. <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Yang's (2003)</ref> findings suggest that internet users' beliefs about online advertising were comparable to their beliefs about traditional advertising. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Tan and Chia (2007)</ref> found that attitudes towards advertising in general have a mutually reinforcing and causal effect on the attitudes towards advertising on television. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bauer et al. (2005)</ref> also reported that general advertising attitudes impact on mobile advertising attitudes. These findings relate to the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Festinger, 1978)</ref>. The theory describes an individual's need to keep his cognitive system in balance by "integrating a single attitude into his overall 'attitudinal system'" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bauer et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The theory is grounded on the supposition that an individual will at all times aim to keep his/her cognitive system in stable. Therefore, a discrepancy between related opinions, perceptions or attitudes causes discomfort and this results in the consumer trying to reduce the inconsistencies between his cognitions. The implication is that, consumer's attitude towards advertising in general may affect the attitude towards a specific advertisement, or advertising in a specific context, such as Facebook.</p><p>Therefore, the attitude towards Facebook (newer and specific advertising content) would be dependent on the attitude towards advertising in general as one can expect consumers to hold a more stable and consistent attitude towards advertising in general. Based on the premises that attitudes towards advertising in general comprise the organising attitude <ref type="bibr">(Tan and Chia, 2007:360)</ref> towards advertising in a specific channel, as well as the set of antecedents that influence these attitudes, we hypothesised that:</p><p>H5: Facebook users' general advertising attitudes positively moderates the relationship between perceptions and attitudes towards SNA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2">Privacy concerns</head><p>Social media marketing holds an incredible potential for companies and consumers, but it may also cause privacy violations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chang et al., 2017)</ref>. Brands advertising on SNS, such as Facebook, could be perceived as an invasion of users' privacy. Consequently, the growth of SNS as an advertising platform has important repercussions for consumers, as well as for advertisers <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Lin &amp; Kim, 2016)</ref>. Privacy issues are especially applicable as Facebook for example allows advertisers to personalise and customize their marketing-communication messages for individuals, by using their personal information. Although targeting and personalising increase the advertising effectiveness of brands, they also have the ability to increase the privacy concerns for users <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jung, 2017)</ref>. Concerns about privacy in using SNS also have a negative impact on the attitude towards SNA <ref type="bibr">(Taylor, Lewin &amp; Strutton, 2011)</ref>. Even though on a global level it seems as if users are cultivating more relaxed privacy attitudes as Facebook matures, privacy still affects users attitudes and behavior (Tsay-Vogel, Shanahan &amp; Signorielli, 2018). We argue that, as a result, consumers that are more concerned about their privacy in general, may be more cautious than consumers that are not concerned about their privacy and this will impact their perceptions of SNA and their resulting attitudes. We hypothesise that:</p><p>H6: Facebook users' general privacy concerns negatively moderates their relationship between their advertising perceptions and their attitudes towards SNA.

The diverse three-country context provides a ideal chance for understanding the attitudes and behaviors towards Facebook advertising in diverse markets, with different cultural-orientations, levels of economic development (from a large, emerging, sub-Saharan country e.g. South Africa, to a smaller, advanced Western European country e.g.</p><p>Germany) as well as different level of social network readiness. In order to better contextualize the study, some country, cultural and consumer insights are provided. in all countries, with South Africa being the lowest (ranked 73 th , score 5.5), Germany (ranked 54 th , scored 5.8) and Australia (ranked 32 nd , scored 6) the highest. It is interesting to note that the countries also differ, according to how developed their laws are. Not surprisingly, the developed countries' laws were more advanced (Germany ranked 26 th ; Australia 29 th ) than those of South African (ranked 43 rd ). This could hold implications for privacy and trust issues on social media.</p><p>Advertising is a social-cultural phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Wang &amp; Sun, 2010)</ref> and as a result, consumers' beliefs and attitudes toward SNA are unavoidably influenced by their cultural predisposition.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Haytko et al.

According to Goodrich and De Mooij ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>), these dimensions can be used to understand consumers' attitudes and behavior and they could provide a background in a cross-country context. Although numerous models have been suggested in the past, Hofstede's model is still used widely in marketing studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Magnusson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> S o a r e s , F a r h a n g m e h r &amp; S h o h a m 2 0 0 7 ) . A l t h o u g h t h e r e a r e v a r i o u s c r i t i c i s m s a g a i n s t Hofstede's classifications, and rightly so, it was deemed sufficient to provide a cultural-value perspective of the countries included in the study. The results of Goodrich and de Mooij ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) also indicate that Hofstede's cultural dimensions are also applicable to explain the crosscultural differences in both online and offline environments. A further important finding from Goodrich and Mooij ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) is the strong explanatory capabilities of some of the dimensions for the usage of social media across different cultures. It is evident that, compared to Australia, Germany and South Africa are less individualistic (with South Africa the lowest) and indulgent;</p><p>while Germany has a long-term orientation that is not evident in the other two countries. The countries also differ in terms of uncertainty avoidance (Germany scoring the highest with South Africa the lowest) and power distance (South Africa the highest and Germany the lowest) (Hofsteded-insigts.com). These difference and similarities in the cultural dimension could impact on consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behavior towards SNS advertising. For example, South Africans higher power distance (degree of hierarchy and power distribution in a society) might indicate that consumers are easier to <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Littrell &amp; Valentin, 2005)</ref> persuade through advertising messages. As uncertainty avoidance refers to the degree that consumers can tolerate uncertainties, it could be related to one's caution about purchases <ref type="bibr">(Petrovici &amp; Marinov, 2001)</ref>, especially on-line or advertising messages and this could also be related to trust and privacy concerns.</p><p>An alternative approach to that of Hofstede is the Global Leadership and Organisational</p><p>Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) study, which built on both Hofstede's work to cluster nations in ten groups <ref type="bibr">(Chhokar et al. 2007</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Schlagwein and Prasarnphanich (2014)</ref> reported that two of the GLOBE dimensions showed a significant impact on social media and its use, with 'collectivism' having a positive effect on social media use, and 'uncertainty avoidance' having a negative impact.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the aim of this paper is not to compare the cultural values or dimensions between the countries but rather the inclusion of Hofstede's framework and the GLOBE classification merely serves the purpose of providing some cultural insights into the selected countries' national culture and aiding in the explanation of possible cross-country similarities or differences. </p></div>

Facebook was selected as the social media platform of interest as it continues to have a high penetration rate, both globally and in all three countries. As a result, the study population comprised adult Facebook users. The survey was developed in English for the South African and Australian participants, and translated into German for the German participants (reversed translation was used to ensure the equivalence with the English version)</p><p>and it was delivered online via a market research firm's consumer panel. The participants were incentivised by the market research firm, in accordance with their normal practices. Consent was provided from the participants and ethical clearance was obtained from the relevant authorities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Country selection</head><p>The cross-country selection (Australia, Germany &amp; South Africa) was motivated by several reasons. Firstly, the extensive composition of Facebook users and popularity of the platform in all three countries provides an extremely valuable opportunity to examine the trends, both within and across countries. However, a review by <ref type="bibr">Wilson, Gosling and Lindsay (2012)</ref> revealed that, although many articles have explored social media and the Facebook trends within a single country context, even basic comparisons of samples across different countries, were rare. Secondly, the growth in the social networking environment is not only evident in developed countries, such as Australia, with a 67% growth in Facebook subscribers during the period from 2010-2017 but this trend is even more evident in emerging countries, such as South Africa, with a growth of 809% during the same period (Internet World Stats Report, 2017). Additionally, Facebook usage and behavioural data are ideal to compare the trends across groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Wilson et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Wilson et al. (2012)</ref> argue that as Facebook continues to grow internationally, exploring differences and similarities in how users behave will become increasingly important due to the increased competition to engage with users, both locally and internationally <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Demangeot et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>As such, our approach of an exploratory cross-country study to test the applicability of our proposed model, not only by including diverse countries in terms of development and network readiness but specifically from a diverse cultural perspective (refer Section 2.6), would generate deeper insights in our understanding of SNA internationally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Measurement</head><p>Two screening questions were used to confirm that the respondents were active Facebook users, aged 18 years or older and that they were indeed exposed to FB ads. To ensure that respondents had a clear idea of what the study intended to measure, a short description of Facebook ads for the purpose of the study was also included: "Facebook advertising for the purpose of this study refer to any type of advertising about a company, brand, cause, product or service on your Facebook page/wall/timeline. These ads may be directly from companies/brands or indirect via postings/likes of friends and appears in your Facebook newsfeed or sidebar". Therefore the focus was only on ads placed in users feed either in newsfeed/timeline or Facebook right column (sidebar) and excluded other Facebook ad placements options such as Facebook marketplace, messages or brand fan pages. In addition a question measuring the frequency that respondents were exposed to some of the main formats of Facebook ads, (sponsored links or posts, photos, videos, competitions, voting polls, free or paid application (Apps), invitations, special offers, games) were also included. This was an additional measure to check that respondents were indeed expose to Facebook ads.</p><p>Subsequently, each question in the questionnaire was framed with "Please read each statement about advertising on your Facebook page/wall/timeline, and then indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statements". The general section also included questions on</p><p>Facebook usage and demographics.</p><p>Attitudes towards advertising in general, and Facebook advertising in particular, were based on the scales of <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Pollay and Mittal (1993)</ref> and Mahmoud (2013) and they each consisted of six items each (for example, "In general, I like advertising").

(2012)</ref>. The six-item Global-Item Privacy concern of <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Malhotra et al.

The personal-perceptions dimension included asking, whether the respondents considered the advertising to be informative, enhancing their social image and hedonic or entertainment value while the societal perception referred to the possible falsity of advertising.</p><p>Facebook users self-reported behavior towards the brand was measured in terms of the frequency (Never (0) to Always ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>)) that users displayed the following behavior as a result of seeing a Facebook ad: visiting the advertised firm's website, become a fan of the firm or brand page as a result of the ad or purchasing the advertised product or service. Access to accurate behavioral data is limited due to data privacy concerns, technical difficulties and high costs. As a result self-reported measures are central especially in online media use research and marketing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Jiang, Yang, &amp; Jun, 2013)</ref>. We do however acknowledge that self-report bias is a concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Lee et al., 2007)</ref>. All the constructs were measured with an 11-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 -'Strongly Disagree' to 10 -'Strongly Agree'.

The sample characteristics are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The descriptive analysis of the respondents' demography indicates that the samples were slightly skewed towards males in both South Africa (62.5%) and Germany (58.4%), whereas 54.3% of the Australian sample were females. The majority of the respondents across all three countries came from the age group of 25-34 (50.9% from South Africa 36.6% from Germany, and 42.3% from Australia). Respondents with a high school degree and undergraduate degree were very similar across all three countries, however, the percentage of undergraduate degreeholding respondents were marginally higher than high-school degree holding respondents in South Africa and Germany whereas it is the opposite in Australia. Noticeably, there is a difference in Facebook-usage length in South Africa, and in the rest of the two countries. South African respondents are longer users of Facebook compared to German and Australian respondents. However, the Facebook usage frequency per week is very similar across the respondents of the three countries. Most of the demographic characteristics of the three countries are very close to each other, although there were some differences observed.</p><p>Therefore, the responses provided by the respondent in these three countries were taken to be statistically comparable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Validity of the measurements</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), to ensure that reliability and validity were achieved. The results of the CFA are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Although the Chi-square result was significant 2 = 1760.764, (df= 681, p=0.00), the model is sensitive to the sample size and to the model complexity. Therefore, we checked the other model fitness measures (GFI=0.924, AGFI=0.913, TLI=0.967, CFI=0.970, IFI=0.970, RSMEA=0.037, CMIN/DF=2.586, SRMR=0.039), according to the guidelines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bagozzi and Yi (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bearden, Sharma and Teel (1982)</ref>. All of the model fitness indices indicated a good model fit. Next, we checked the construct reliability (CR&gt;0.70) and average variance extracted (AVE&gt;0.50), according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bagozzi and Yi (1988)</ref>. The CR and AVE of each construct met the standard. Moreover, item loadings are substantial (Estimate&gt;0.60) and highly significant.</p><p>Therefore, the model achieved convergent validity. Moreover, we conducted a discriminant validity test following the method presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>. The correlation matrix is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The AVE of each construct is greater than the shared variance with other constructs, which indicates that discriminant validity has been achieved. In addition, we conducted a common method bias test. Firstly, the Harman's one-factor test showed that a single factor solution explained only 39.16% of variance, which is clearly below the cut-off threshold of 50%, which implies no common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Harman, 1976)</ref>. Further, we added a common latent factor to check whether there is a model fit changed. It remained similar after the inclusion of that common latent factor (model without common latent factor: 2/df. = 1.705, model with common latent factor: 2/df. = 1.553), which again means that there is no common method bias in our model <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003)</ref>. As all of the latent constructs of our model were self-reported by the respondents. Therefore, we used a marker variable to test the existence of a common method bias following the suggestion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Lindell and Whitney (2001)</ref>. Three items from a theoretically unrelated construct named 'social desirability' was introduced as the marker variable in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1960)</ref>. The relationships among all the independent and dependent constructs remained statistically significant after the inclusion of the marker variable. This further indicates that there was no common method bias in the dataset (Baggozi, 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Invariance analysis</head><p>A two-stage invariance analysis was conducted to check whether the respondents of the three different countries responded similarly for construct measurement, when following the guideline suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998)</ref>. Firstly, we tested the configural invariance, in order to check the item equivalence. The results of the configural invariance test are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. They show that 2 and the model fit indices were satisfactory. Secondly, we ran a metric invariance test (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). As the 2 difference 144.654 (df=39, p&lt;0.05) is significant, the full metric invariance was not supported. A full measurement metric invariance is rarely found in practice and thus, a partial metric invariance test is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Milfont &amp; Fischer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998)</ref>. We relaxed 5 out of 39 constraints, based on the modification indices, in order to get a partial metric invariance. The non-restricted and partial invariance model was compared; and the resulting 2 difference 67.138 (df=34, p&gt;0.05) was found to be significant. Therefore, the metric invariance was achieved. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Hypotheses' test</head><p>To test the hypotheses, we conducted a structural model test. Although the chi-square difference remain significant 2/df = 1.722 (p &lt; 0.01), other fit indices indicated that the fit of structural model is acceptable (CFI=0.951, IFI=0.951, TLI=0.946, RSMEA=0.025, SRMR=.057). The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>.   seem to be that evident in these countries. The relationship between societal perception and attitude toward Facebook advertisement was not moderated by either attitude towards advertising in general or privacy in any of the three countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implications</head><p>Our results support the 'social support theory' that examines attitude toward Facebook advertising. The validity of the conceptual model is confirmed in all three countries reflective of three continents (Africa, Australia and Europe) and diverse cultural contexts. Several similarities -as well as some differences in the moderating effect of privacy and general advertising attitudes among the countries are evident. The lack of empirical evidence of behavioral data concerning Facebook advertising makes this study beneficial for a wide academic (and industry/practitioner) audience. The value of the research also lies in its threecountry approach, thereby testing the conceptual framework in diverse cultural contexts. Given that Facebook is a global phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Kirkpatrick, 2011)</ref>, the research also adds to the body of knowledge pertaining to international marketing. As we continue to embrace (and comprehend) the apparently endless array of social media platforms, brands are not only figuring out how best to engage with their local communities, but also how to make the most of the global audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Nitu, 2014)</ref>. As such, our studies furnish theoretical and practical contributions to advertising on SNS, such as Facebook, in the global context.</p><p>The effects of advertising on society and culture have been extensively examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Wang &amp; Sun, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bolton et al. (2013)</ref> propose that globalization may lead to increasing homogeneity but owing to the large disparity between wealth, infrastructure and technology among emerging and developed countries, this may not be an accurate viewpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Petzer &amp; Meyer, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>However, our results confirm that perceptions, attitudes and behavior towards SNA, i.e.</p><p>Facebook, are indeed a phenomenon that is reflective of a global-market place, suggesting that consumers around the world are becoming more homogeneous in their attitude, thereby displaying similar attitudes and behavior towards advertising messages on these platforms. Our research thus confirms that in general standardization (based on personal perceptions, attitudes and behavior towards the brand) of advertising campaigns could be effective, contributing to the longstanding debate of standardization vs. specialization in promotional campaigns across countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Frith &amp; Sengupta, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Duffett, 2015)</ref>. For international marketers, this suggests that a standard SNA strategy could be effective. It may, however, be necessary for social media networks and marketers to take note of the differences in terms of trust and privacy in certain cultures.</p><p>It is evident that personal Facebook advertising perceptions have an impact on the attitudes of Facebook users across continents. Thus, supporting the growth of expenditure of brands on social media. The perceptions of Facebook advertisements, as having utilitarian (source of information) and hedonic (enjoyment) value positively impact on attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Wang et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Zeng et al., 2017)</ref> signaling for advertisers the need to ensure a balance between pushing the content, while ensuring an enjoyable experience for users, when engaging with the content.</p><p>Advertising that is introduced with subtlety into consumers' 'social, yet private space', as part of the 'conversation' using relevant images, videos, games or even competitions, can be useful to create this balance.</p><p>However, as consumers' believe that Facebook advertising also helps to make informed choices in projecting the desired social images, the important role of the 'social aspect' of 'social' media is evident <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Wolin et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Powers et al., 2011)</ref>. Advertisers could use this to their advantage, by encouraging: 'liking', 'sharing', 'tagging' and 'commenting' on advertisements that would not only increase engagement with the brand, increase organic advertising, but also using the social aspect to influence user attitudes. It is valuable that positive attitudes towards FB advertising indeed lead to positive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Kim et al., 2010)</ref>, such as visiting the brands' website, becoming a Facebook fan of the brand or purchasing the brand, as the ultimate goal of advertising, is frequently to encourage action. By ensuring that users do visit the website or brand Facebook page, provides marketers with a multitude of additional opportunities to further engage with their customers and potential customers.</p><p>The moderating effect of general attitudes on attitudes towards Facebook advertising is a sure sign that investigating advertising effectiveness on 'new' platforms can never been done in insolation and taking cognizance of consumers' general attitude towards advertising is important to gauge the effectiveness of an Facebook advertisement, especially evident in the personal perceptions of the German and Australian sample. Interestingly, general advertising attitudes do not impact the relationship between societal perceptions and attitude towards Facebook advertising in any of the countries.</p><p>Yet the small, significant nuances in how cultures differ with regard to SNA suggests that marketers need to consider a degree of specialization, when advertising on SNS across cultures;</p><p>and they need to incorporate some tailoring of their advertising strategies and messages to the local market, especially to address trust and privacy issues.</p><p>The strong positive effect of trust on attitudes towards Facebook advertising in South Africa could be ascribed to the fact that 'collectivism' often helps to develop trust <ref type="bibr">(Doney, Cannon &amp; Mullen, 1998)</ref> or it may be due to the fact that they had the longest relationship with Facebook, of the three countries. The high uncertainty avoidance culture in Germany could be why trust in Facebook did not influence attitudes towards Facebook advertising for the German sample, which supports the negative relationship between uncertainty avoidance and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Qu &amp; Yang, 2015)</ref>. However, these possible explanations needs further investigation and empirical testing.</p><p>Thus although Germans could trust a SNS it does not necessary implies that the trust in the SNS would be transposed to the marketing communication messages on that SNS. This is inline with <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kelly, Kerr and Drennan (2017)</ref> reports that social media users in general may trust the SNS but that users are reluctant to trust advertising on these sites. Putting the burden of ensuring that advertising messages are viewed as credible and trustworthy to ensure a positive attitude towards such a messages on the shoulders of the advertiser. Thus as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Dehghani and Tumer (2015)</ref> advertisers need to move towards trust-based advertising instead of merely push advertising on SNS such as Facebook. Furthermore, risk-taking cultures (low in uncertainty avoidance), such as the South African, privacy do not influence their attitudes in the same way as less risk-taking and more developed cultures. Another possible explanation could be that in developing countries, such as South Africa, users of Facebook often trust the internet where privacy concerns play a lesser role as these users might not be aware of all the abuses and risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hampson, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>It is evident that consumers' perceptions play important role to form or shape consumers' attitude toward advertisements backed by the assumption that advertisements are source of information and provides utilitarian value <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Wang et al., 2009)</ref>. This notion is supported by this study, however, societal perception of social media advertisement did not influence such attitude. Under this circumstance, managers should establish and maintain communication with consumers focusing on their personal perceptions with customized methods rather than mass advertising messages. Collectively (societal perception), consumers may think that advertising messages lie and attempt to manipulate them to accomplish advertisers' goal, such as increases sales volume but this is not currently influencing their attitudes towards these advertisements.</p><p>However, managers can focusing on establishing an industry practice such as social currency and paid reviews, which although not currently helpful for creating a positive attitude toward SNA, could in future when these methods will become common as industry practice, be useful tools for incentivized eWOM.</p><p>We found that general attitude toward advertising moderates the relationship between personal perceptions and attitude. It indicates that general attitude toward advertising strengthens the relationships between personal perception and attitude towards Facebook advertising. Thus, managers of brands should create positive awareness toward advertisements in general to reinforce Facebook promotions. This can be accomplished by providing authentic information regarding the brand in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Vukasovic, 2013)</ref> such as showing the features and benefits of the brand comparing with other brands can be effective. Brand comparisons that are done by independent online-based service providers who are not directly affiliated with the brands they are comparing, could be the answer. Such comparisons help the consumers to take rational decisions by providing important information. This type of initiative by the brands not only creates positive attitude toward advertising, but also develop a sense of trust and credibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hajli, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">So, Xiong &amp; King, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, privacy is found to weaken the relationship between personal perception and attitude toward Facebook advertisement (Australia and Germany). In the recent years, the privacy concern becomes a major issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Tsay-Vogel et al., 2018)</ref>. Even though findings at the global level support the socializing role of Facebook in cultivating more relaxed privacy attitudes, it still impacts on users' attitudes and behavior (Tsay-Vogel, Shanahan &amp; Signorielli, 2018).</p><p>Thus, brand managers need to carefully manage consumers' information. One possible way to handle privacy issue in social media is making the personal information management system secure and explain the security system to the consumers to ensure that they feel a sense of confidence.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, our results add insight into the limited SNA literature that is currently available <ref type="bibr">(Jung et al., 2016:259)</ref>. Unlike previous studies, which focused on SNA in a single-country context, using mainly student samples and only focusing on positive influences, we have expanded the focus to include positive (personal) as well as negative (societal) influences, utilizing non-student samples, in a diverse multiple country context, as to identify any commonalties and/or differences. Thus, this study's multi-country context provides a unique opportunity for understanding consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behavior towards Facebook advertisings in di erent markets. The cross-country nature of the study does not only add value, because of the increased generalisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Maheswaran &amp; Shavitt, 2000)</ref>; but it also provides evidence confirming the speculation of <ref type="bibr">Okazaki and Taylor (2013)</ref> of the emergence of a global consumer culture, as a result of the global social networks. This is confirmed in our results as it is evident that consumers on a global social-media site, such as Facebook, in general display similar perceptions, attitudes and behavior towards SNA in the presence of some culture differences. Consequently, being able to compare ndings across three di erent countries, provides additional insights into SNA that should bene t both future researchers and marketing practitioners. This study, therefore, not only contributes to advertising and consumer behavior theory, but through the conceptual model tested and insights into diverse market environments it also advances international marketing practices in social media and social network advertising.</p><p>The majority of the main paths of the model found to be significant across three different countries, whereas the moderation effects and trust are different based on the cultural differences. These similarities and differences have noteworthy managerial implications that contributes to the social media and advertising industry at large. Social media managers of brands should try to improve personal perceptions of consumers to improve attitude toward Facebook advertisements, and improved Facebook advertisement attitude will lead to expected brand related behavior. Such relationships work across three different countries regardless their cultural differences. Therefore, managers do not need any customization in perception-attitudebehavior relationship. However, customizations are required in developing and managing general attitude formation toward advertisements and privacy. Unlike South Africans, Australian and Germans social media promotion effectiveness depends on overall promotional improvement of general advertisements used in other media (such as TV and newspaper advertisements). As German culture is the highest of all three countries in uncertainty avoidance it suggest their need for laws and regulations to reduce uncertainty and risks when going on-line. Additionally the fact that Germany has the most developed ICT laws of all three countries, further support this notion. This is echoed in the projection that social media selfregulation will be replaced by more formal regulations not only in terms of privacy but also misleading advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Rogers, 2018)</ref>. Brand managers can utilize integrated marketing communication where all the promotional/communicational tools should be integrated and reinforce each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kotler &amp; Keller, 2014)</ref>. This belief is supported by the relationship Africa should create more awareness among their consumers' about data privacy and how to utilize privacy settings. In this way, consumers will become more conscious about their personal information security and by providing such data security options, social media cites (i.e. Facebook) can gain users trust.</p><p>Social media managers who intend to promote their products or services could utilize the findings of this study to convert consumers' perception to positive attitude toward Facebook advertisements and positive brand behavior. Managerial contributions of this study is threefold.</p><p>First, managers could apply common strategies for all the countries (reflected by the main model -personal perceptions, attitudes and behavior), however, they need to customize few aspects (trust and privacy) depending on the country and/or culture. Second, it shows how general attitude toward advertisements and privacy moderates the relationship between consumers' perception and attitude toward Facebook advertisements. Managers can develop and use marketing tools to improve consumers' general attitude toward advertisements, and reduce the trust and privacy concern regarding consumers' personal information use. Third, the strongest contribution of this study is the cultural parallels and differences among three different socio-cultural perspectives. It shows that some of the features of social media advertisements are common across different cultural contexts. However, there is a need for customization in term of general attitude toward advertisements, trust and privacy issues depending on the socio-cultural perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and recommendations for future research</head><p>Despite the promising advertising opportunities provided by social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dehghani &amp; Tumer, 2015)</ref>, there is still much work to be done on how to theorise research in this area and on how to develop stronger conceptualisations and hypothetical relationships for consumer behavior towards SNA. In response to this call for further research on social network advertising we propose and test a conceptual model that enhance the understanding of social support theory.</p><p>By doing so, this research determines the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors towards This study has its own limitations. Firstly, the study has used a restrained approach regarding the perceptions of Facebook advertising and although the model has explained between 54-73% of variance in attitudes and behavior, a host of other perceptions could account for the remaining variance. Due to the dynamic nature of SNS, additional perceptions may also emerge in the future. The second limitation is that the research was limited to Facebook users.</p><p>Therefore, the conclusions cannot be generalised across all types of SNS, because the sites work differently; and they have different target markets. Future research could include comparisons among the users of different SNSs, given the growth in other SNSs such as</p><p>Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn It would be interesting to see whether SNS users' perceptions and attitudes differ, depending on the type of SNS in question. Additionally, the conclusions of this study cannot be generalised, because of its convenience sampling and the three-country context. Therefore, the context of future research could be expanded, to include other countries with different national cultures, such as Asian countries, for example. Lastly, we measure self-reported behavior due to the design of our study, that could lead to bias, future studies could use a experiential approach focusing on a specific brand to investigate possible causal relationships.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Facebook</head><label></label><figDesc>is a global phenomenon and as such users feelings and sequence of thoughts are influenced by the social environment where they grew up. As a result consumers' preferences and attitudes are influenced by culture (among other factors) and as a result "people and nations think, act and feel differently around the globe"<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(De Mooij, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, an culture understanding is important to facilitate advertising on global advertising platforms such as Facebook. The three country study (South Africa, Australia and Germany) is thus aimed to gain insight into Facebook advertising across cultures since it is evident that marketers in all three countries are utilising SNA. The current (2019) social network advertising segment amounts to US$1,621m in Australia, with an expected annual growth rate of 10.2% by 2023;</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Differences are not only apparent in the economic development of each country but they are also related to the networked readiness of each country, given that social media form part of ICT technology. The Networked Readiness Index (NRI) measures the capacity of countries to leverage Information Communication Technology (ICT) for increased competitiveness and well-being (Global Information Technology Report, 2016). The NRI includes 139 countries and the development and/or the readiness are measured with a seven-point index (1-not developed at all, and 7-well developed). The three countries differ in terms of their network readiness (Germany 15th, Australia 18th and South Africa 65th -out of 139 countries). This could have implications for how consumers use and view social networks in various countries. Two factors of the NRI are especially relevant to our study: (a) How widespread is the use of social media in a country? And (b) How developed are the laws related to ICT, such as consumer protection and e-commerce. The popularity and use of social networks are evident</figDesc></figure>

In addition to personal perception, trust in Facebook has significant influence on attitude toward Facebook advertisements in both South Africa =0.130, p&lt;0.01] and Australia [ =0.087, p&lt;0.05]. These findings support the findings of Shin (2010) and Schosser et al. (1999) supporting hypotheses H3 of this study.

It determines whether general advertising attitudes and privacy concerns have a moderating effect on the various attitudes towards Facebook advertisements. It also determines if cross-country difference exist in the context of Facebook advertising. The application of the social support theory to SNA, such as Facebook, remains scarce. It is evident that the information and appraisal aspect of the social support theory are especially relevant to SNA that is perceived as informative, entertaining, and assisting with self-image. We demonstrated that social media managers should understand the scope of standardization and customization for their Facebook advertising campaigns especially when they operate in multicultural settings. They should particularly consider the extent to which their target audience are interested to show tolerance toward privacy issue and attitude toward advertising in general.</figDesc></figure>
