<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Total quality management (TQM) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) are relevant management philosophies and frameworks that organisa ons use to help generate a sustainable compe ve advantage. This contribu on aims to study the influence of TQM social factors (leadership and human resource) and TQM technical and strategic factors (Strategy-Resources management and process management) with social results. The hypotheses proposed in our research model are tested on a sample of 116 Spanish companies, with experience in TQM through assessments by means of the European Founda on for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model. The par al least squares structural equa ons modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was used to test the research model. Our findings indicate that the EFQM Excellence Model is a reliable and valid framework with which to measure and improve the organisa onal social impact. The synergies and theindirect effects between the TQM cri cal factors, in the EFQM Excellence Model framework, cons tute a management system. Moreover, the TQM social factors and Strategy-Resources management factors determine the efficiency with which an organisa on manages its key processes, which have a significant impact on the social results that organisa ons are capable of achieving.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In an increasingly complex and uncertain environment, directors tend towards mime c isomorphism, that is, faced with the uncertainty of the environment they tend to behave like the other actors in the organisa onal field. For that reason, companies model themselves on other organisa ons which share their organisa onal context, choosing as models those which they perceive as having greater legi macy or greater success within the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983)</ref>. Therefore, in an environment dominated by uncertainty, directors tend to consider legi mate those prac ces that are considered as 'best prac ce' in the organisa onal field. This explains the prolifera on of the total quality management (TQM) models and the rise of corporate social responsibility (CSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ma en &amp; Moon, 2008)</ref>. The importance of these ques ons has led many authors to ask themselves if the key principles and factors of both models converge or diverge <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barre , 2009)</ref>. The basic ques on is: can a company simultaneously align its TQM and CSR objec ves and prac ces?</p><p>TQM is a comprehensive management philosophy oriented towards achieving excellent results in rela on to stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Prajogo &amp; McDermo , 2005)</ref>. TQM has a global and strategic dimension, as it affects not only the quality of products, services, processes, and management of the organisa on, but also the quality of the rela onships that it maintains with its environment and main stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kok, van der Wiele, McKenna, &amp;Brown, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>CSR refers to the set of business prac ces that meet or exceed the economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic expecta ons of society. It includes the overall rela onships of the organisa on with all of its stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tarı´, 2011)</ref>. For that reason, public authori es, professional colleges, and consumers increasingly demand that companies contribute greater benefits to society and measure their posi ve and nega ve impacts within it <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ma en &amp; Moon, 2008)</ref>. CSR is intrinsically linked to the concept of sustainable development and the management of the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the opera ons of organisa ons.</p><p>McAdam and <ref type="bibr">Leonard (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Olaru, Stoleriu, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">S¸andru (2011), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tarı´ (2011)</ref> suggest that quality management prac ces facilitate the development of environmental management, require ethical behaviour, need a stakeholder focus, and may facilitate the development of ac vi es that are socially responsible. It must not be forgo en that all the above must be achieved within terms of compe veness. This has brought about certain pressure to integrate the principles of CSR into quality management systems (ISO 9000), Excellence Models frameworks more used to implement the principles and prac ces of TQM. The established Excellence/TQM Models (Malcolm Baldrige Na onal Quality Award, the European Founda on for Quality Management Excellence Model, the Australian Business Excellence Framework, and the Canadian Framework for Business Excellence) all incorporate a social responsibility element, and advocate management prac ces compa ble with the ideals of CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ghobadian, Gallear, &amp; Hopkins, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>From the point of view of the specialised literature, the first authors to relate quality management principles and prac ces with social responsibility were termed quality gurus. Deming, Juran, and Crosby indicate the importance of the values, ethical behaviour, the mo va on, and the sa sfac on of the people (workers and directors) for the success of the quality ini a ves <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barre , 2009)</ref>. Later, the literature has been focused on analysing the impact of TQM prac ces on customer sa sfac on, workers' mo va on, and the company's image <ref type="bibr">(Calvo-Mora, Picón-Berjoyo, Ruiz-Moreno, &amp; Cauzo-Bo ala, 2014)</ref>. Along this line, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Locke , Moon, and Visser (2006)</ref> indicate that an important percentage of ar cles focusing on environmental subjects require greater a en on by the researchers on the social and ethics areas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tarı´ (2011)</ref> indicates that there are insufficient works simultaneously assessing TQM prac ces and social responsibility in the same study, and also that theore cal studies predominate over those of an empirical nature, and that within those of an empirical nature, those using qualita ve methodology are more abundant than those using quan ta ve methodology. In addi on, although numerous authors suggest there are rela onships between both approaches of management <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kok et al.,2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leonard &amp; McAdam, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mar ´n-Cas lla, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Withanachchi et al., 2007)</ref>, there is no consensus in the literature on the best way to integrate them, or which models are more effec ve in their implementa on and improvement.</p><p>Against this background, the present study raises the following objec ves:</p><p>1) To analyse the suitability (validity and reliability) of the EFQM Excellence Model to assess and improve an organisa on's social impact.</p><p>2) To study how organisa ons can improve their results in society through the management of their key processes related to the social impact and social responsibility of the organisa on.</p><p>3) To verify how a suitable strategic management of resources and alliances (TQM), strategic and technical factors) and the par cipa on and involvement of the leaders and the people of the organisa on (TQM social factors) are the forerunners of an efficient management of the processes and, indirectly, of the results and social impact of the organisa on.</p><p>4) To propose a series of recommenda ons for companies, when ini a ng the process of assessment and interpreta on of the results of the social impact of the company, by means of the EFQM model.</p><p>In this study, the EFQM Excellence Model <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2013) )</ref> was taken as a reference for three main reasons: (1) it is the most used framework for the implementa on of TQM principles and prac ces in organisa ons <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calvo-Mora et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Samson &amp; Terziovski, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van der Wiele, Dale, &amp; Williams, 2000)</ref>; (2) in 1991, it was the first QualityAward that explicitly included the importance of measuring the impact and the social results of an organisa on <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kok et al., 2001)</ref> and, in the current version of the model, a specific criterion (Society results) is reserved for it; and (3) as Mar n-Cas lla <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref> indicates, given the non-prescrip ve character of these excellence models, it is possible to give them an ethical and social responsibility focus when applying the excellence search criteria. This study con nues with a review of the literature in which the principles and evolu on of TQM and CSR are analysed. Later, the proposed model is presented, detailing the hypotheses that will be tested. This will be followed by a descrip on of the methodology and data analysis used. The results are then presented, which are followed by a discussion and the conclusions, indica ng limita ons and future lines of research of the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">TQM and CSR</head><p>TQM is a comprehensive organisa onal management approach. This approach is based on the correct integra on of certain cultural values and principles (con nuous improvement,innova on, and dynamism) into the strategy, structure, and processes of the organisa on. To put these values and principles into prac ce, organisa ons use a series of techniques, models, and systems oriented towards stakeholder sa sfac on and strengthening the compe veness of the organisa on.</p><p>Among the cri cal factors of TQM iden fied in the literature are an organiza onal culture oriented to con nuous improvement; a determined commitment and leadership by the management; strategic planning; con nuous improvement; a customer-and other stakeholderfocused approach; management based on data and informa on analysis; and the management of personnel, processes and suppliers or other partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sila &amp; Ebrahimpour, 2003)</ref>. In this respect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rahman and Bullock (2005)</ref> classify the cri cal factors of TQM as follows:</p><p>1) So aspects, corresponding to social and behavioural factors, such as an open and flexible culture, the management's commitment and leadership, the human resources management, and the focus on stakeholders.</p><p>2) Hard aspects, associated with the technical factors of the design, implementa on and improvement of the quality management systems, such as the control and management processes, the use of problem-solving tools, and the management of resources and supplier 3) Strategic aspects, that is, the need to integrate the quality objec ves, plans, and policies into the general strategic process of the organisa on.</p><p>On the other hand, CSR is defined as the commitment of an organisa on to assess and to take responsibility for the impacts that its decisions and ac vi es have on society and the environment, by means of an ethical and transparent behaviour that takes into considera on the interests of its interested par es, fulfils the applicable legisla on and is consistent with interna onal standards of behaviour, and is integrated into the whole organisa on and put into prac ce in its rela onships <ref type="bibr">('ISO, 26000', 2012)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carroll (1991)</ref>, there are four stages of social responsibility: economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic. The highest level of social responsibility is philanthropy, which has a posi ve influence on the reputa on and the economic performance of the organisa on <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brammer &amp; Millington, 2005)</ref>. For <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leonard and McAdam (2003)</ref>, CSR refers to the human rights of the workers, preserva on of the environment, and involvement in the community and social development. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kok et al. (2001)</ref> find 14 key elements of CSR which they divided into three groups: 1) External environment, which includes the rela onships with the community, the consumers, the suppliers, and the shareholders.</p><p>2) Internal environment, which refers to the culture of environmental protec on, working condi ons, empowerment, and involvement.</p><p>3) Ethical conscience, referring to the codes of behaviour, and ethical values and codes.</p><p>With respect to the rela onship between TQM and CSR, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leonard and McAdam (2003)</ref> tried to clarify this rela onship, based on the ethical founda on of both models. From the perspec ve of CSR, business ethics are not mere philanthropy, but an essen al founda on that allows the improvement of the organisa on and the development of society. Similarly, the TQM principles are based on the ethics of con nuous improvement of all the organisa onal processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Zairi &amp; Peters, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barre (2009)</ref> indicates that the con nuous improvement of quality requires a commitment to exceed the expecta ons of the customers and other stakeholders, which involves an important ethical base. For <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moir (2001)</ref>, CSR has a posi ve impact on the progress of businesses, as it reduces li ga ons, protects the brand image, improves customer sa sfac on, and reduces absenteeism and employee turnover, whilst retaining the personnel with the most talent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leonard and McAdam (2003)</ref> maintain that CSR approaches aspects such as employee sa sfac on, protec on of the environment, and sustainability so that it can be defined in terms of ethical legi macy or acceptable ethical behaviour and, second, can be seen from an instrumental perspec ve in which the image and the goals of the organisa on are a primary concern. In short, TQM is consistent with the ethical legi macy and instrumental vision of CSR. This suggests that CSR can be incorporated into organisa ons more effec vely, and in less me, by using the exis ng values, principles, and prac ces of TQM <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tarı´, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Social impact assessment in the EFQM Excellence Model</head><p>There are different frameworks for implemen ng the values, fundamental principles, and prac ces that characterise the whole TQM ini a ve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdullah, Uli, and Tarı´ (2008)</ref> differen ate between them: (1) based on quality gurus; (2) extracted a er theore cal and empirical research; and (3) excellence models (Deming Model, Malcolm Baldrige Model, and the European Founda on for Quality Management Model). In Europe, EFQM Excellence Model <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2013) )</ref> is the best-known reference when introducing and improving a TQM system.</p><p>Generally, excellence models include a set of guidelines that are made available to organisa ons so that they can develop the concepts of TQM and put them into opera on (Bou-Llusar, Escrig-Tena, <ref type="bibr">Roca-Puig, &amp; Beltrán-Mar n, 2009)</ref>. The validity of excellence models for TQM implementa on has been widely studied in the literature. Alonso-Almeida and Fuentes-Frias (2012), <ref type="bibr">Bou-Llusar et al. (2009), Curkovic, Melnyk, Calantone, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Handfield (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Flynn and Saladin (2001)</ref>, Gómez Gómez, Mar nez Costa, and Mar nez Lorente (2015), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pannirselvam, Siferd, and Ruch (1998)</ref> conclude that the most extended excellence models (EFQM model and Malcolm Baldrige Na onal Quality Award (MBNQA)) and their criteria do capture TQM core concepts and can predict the rela onships between TQM procedures and organisa onal performance. Moreover, Calvo-Mora, Picón-Berjoyo, Ruiz-Moreno, and Cauzo-Bo ala (2015) point out how the use of the EFQM Excellence Model guarantees that the management prac ces employed form a coherent system.</p><p>The EFQM Excellence Model has a flexible nature and can be applied to large and small organisa ons, in the public and private sectors, as well as to industrial and service companies <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2013))</ref>. In addi on, it is a dynamic model that has evolved and adapted to social changes. The base for the applica on of the model and the improvement of the management is self-assessment. Self-assessment measures the level of quality reached in an organisa on through a series of criteria and management and performance indicators. Once the self-assessment has been made, for which different methodologies exist, the organisa on can opt for certain stamps of recogni on or may even choose to present a candidacy for different quality awards. For this, it will have to be subjected to a process of external assessment by independent experts who will make a detailed analysis before they verify the self-assessment report presented by the organisa on.</p><p>In order to achieve sustained success in the management of the EFQM Excellence Model, the integra on of three components is proposed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): fundamental concepts of excellence, EFQM Excellence Model criterion, and Results, Approaches, Deploy, Assess and Refine (RADAR) logic <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2013))</ref>.</p><p>The eight fundamental concepts of excellence outline the founda on for achieving sustainable excellence in any organisa on. They can be used as the basis to describe the a ributes of an excellent organisa onal culture. The fundamental concepts of excellence are (EFQM, 2013) adding value for customers; crea ng a sustainable future; developing organisa onal capability; harnessing crea vity and innova on; leading with vision, inspira on, and integrity; managing with agility; succeeding through the talent of people; and sustaining excellent results over me.</p><p>The previously presented principles are condensed into nine dimensions or criteria which serve as a guide for the implementa on of the management system and the measurement of the results. These criteria are specified in five enablers (leadership, policy and strategy, partnerships and resources, people, and process), and four types of results which the organisa on a ains (customers, employees, society, and other key results).</p><p>To develop each criterion with more detail, these contain a variable number of subcriteria. Altogether, the model considers 32 sub-criteria which are to be approached when carrying out the complete self-assessment <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2013))</ref>. On the other hand, the RADAR logic scheme provides a structured approach to making the self-assessment on the basis of the EFQM model. The elements Approaches, Deploy, Assess and Refine are applied to the agents criterion and contribute evidence on how the organisa on is doing. The Results element is used to assess the results criterion and analyse what the organisa on obtains, as a result of its efforts.</p><p>In the EFQM model has been incorporated the growing importance of the CSR and sustainability for the management excellence in the organisa ons. For example, in the 2003 version CSR was first introduced as a Fundamental Concept, whilst in 2010 100 points were given to criterion 8 instead of the 60 points of the previous version. The 2013 version included, for the very first me, topics such as posi ve impact in the organisa on, triple bo om line, and accountability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Social impact and fundamental concepts of excellence</head><p>The aspects related to the social impact of the organisa on are present in the fundamental concepts and, specifically, in the so-called Crea ng a sustainable future. In this regard, excellent organisa ons adopt a strict ethical approach, are transparent, and are accountable to their stakeholders for their performance as responsible organisa ons. They consider and promote social responsibility and environmental protec on.</p><p>The social responsibility of organisa ons is defined in their values and integrated into them by means of public and transparent commitments, which contemplate all stakeholders. In addi on, they sa sfy and exceed the expecta ons, standards, and laws that are applicable to them. Also, they manage risks, and they seek and promote opportuni es to collaborate with society in mutually beneficial projects, promo ng and maintaining a high level of confidence among their stakeholders. They are aware of their impact on the present and future community and they are concerned about reducing any adverse impact to the minimum <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">(EFQM, , 2013;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Olaru, Dinu, Stoleriu, Sandru, &amp; Dinca˘, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Social impact and the EFQM Excellence Model criterion</head><p>Within the results criterion, Society Results analyses the social impact of the organisa on. In this point, it is necessary to highlight that for the EFQM Excellence Model, 'society'will be the par es which are in some way interested in the organisa on, with the excep on of shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees, as these stakeholders are considered in the rest of the results criterion.</p><p>Criterion 8 indicates that excellent organisa ons take exhaus ve measures and reach excellent results with respect to society, including the collabora on of the organiza on with philanthropic ac vi es, rela onships with authori es, ethics, social responsibility, environment protec on, etc. Within criterion 8 there are 2 sub-criteria: 8a. Measures of percep on and 8b. Performance indicators which specify and detail how to reach and improve the social impact of the organisa on.</p><p>Moreover, despite CSR and sustainability having a strong presence in social results criterion, this is not the only criterion in which EFQM included them. The fundamental concept of excellence 'Crea ng a sustainable future' is related in three sub-criteria in Leadership, one in Strategy, two in Partnerships and Resources, and one from Processes <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In short, it can be seen that the EFQM Excellence Model includes the most significant aspects of CSR when approaching the analysis of the social impact of an organiza on <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ascigil, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">McAdam &amp; Leonard, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Olaru et al., 2011)</ref>. More specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kok et al. (2001)</ref> conclude that criterion 8 of the EFQM Excellence Model contemplates 9 of the 14 aspects that these authors consider essen al to CSR: Community rela ons, social responsibility and new opportuni es, minori es/diversity and working condi ons, ethics awareness, educa on and training, consumer rela ons, natural environment, supplier rela ons, and the physical environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>The research model and the hypotheses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) have been posed, based on the structureof the EFQM Excellence Model, its basic premise, and the review of the specialised literature on TQM, the EFQM Excellence Model, and CSR. Regarding TQM prac ces, the enablers of the EFQM Excellence Model have been taken as reference and, more specifically, the grouping made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Calvo-Mora et al. (2014)</ref>. Through a factor analysis, the study summarises the enablers of the EFQM Excellence Model into three factors: Factor 1, which consists of the TQM social factors and includes leadership and human resources management. Factor 2, the strategic resources management of partners has elements related to strategy formula on and review. These are based on informa on, indicators, and organisa onal learning, as well as on factors related to external partnerships (suppliers and partners) and resource management. Factor 3, process management, encompasses the organisa on's key processes in order to generate an increasingly greater value for the customers and other stakeholders (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The grouping of the enabling agents from the EFQM model produced by Calvo-Mora et al. ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) was chosen as reference, as it allows working with an opera onally simpler research model (3 constructs or latent variables, instead of the 5 contained in the original EFQM model). In addi on, the proposed model is complete, as it includes the key elements of the TQM iden fied in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rahman &amp; Bullock, 2005)</ref>. The grouping of the enabling agents of the EFQM model into so , strategic, and hard is also used in other studies such as those by <ref type="bibr">Bou-Llusar et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown (2002), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reiner (2002)</ref>.</p><p>In short, the research model is based on finding which quality management prac ces may facilitate the development of social responsibility. More specifically, an organiza on can manage and improve its impact on society through the management and improvement of its key processes. However, for an efficient management of the processes, the organisa on must have the par cipa on and involvement of its leaders and its people (social factors), as well as a suitable strategic management of its resources and external alliances with the main partners with which it interacts (strategic resources management factors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">TQM social factors as drivers of TQM ini a ves</head><p>The leadership of the management and the involvement of the human resources are considered determining factors for the success of the TQM and CSR ini a ves <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fotopoulos &amp; Psomas, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pedersen &amp; Neergaard, 2008)</ref>. Thus, the management must act as a guide and driver in the process of implementa on of the EFQM Excellence Model, and must create and spread the values of excellence in management, as well as establishing goals and objec ves that are consistent with these values <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calvo-Mora et al., 2014)</ref>. From the CSR perspec ve, leaders must consider the needs of all stakeholders, crea ng models of ethical and socially responsible behaviour at all levels of the organisa on <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tarı´, 2011)</ref>. However, to achieve success, management commitment alone is not sufficient, but its involvement must also be demonstrated through investment in different resources (material, financial, knowledge, and technological) which support the a ainment of the objec ves and the improvement of all the processes (Suárez, Rolda´n, &amp; Calvo-Mora, 2014). In addi on, the organisa on, through the management and its leaders, must try to obtain the commitment and involvement of all the personnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tutuncu &amp; Kucukusta, 2007)</ref> and, in return, to empower their par cipa on in the decision-making and improvement ac vi es <ref type="bibr">(Seinor &amp; Swailer, 2004</ref>). To achieve this, the leaders must influence their employees, not only through the more technical aspects of the work, but also through the psycho-emo onal and ethical dimensions of the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tarı´, 2011)</ref>. These ac ons will lead to the correct execu on and improvement of the processes of the organisa on, which will lead to improved results. Finally, the crucial role played by the management and human resources in the formula on, deployment, implementa on, and control of the policies and strategies of the organisa on must not be forgo en. On the basis of the previous arguments, the following research hypotheses can be formulated: H1: TQM social factors are posi vely related to strategy and resources management. H2: TQM social factors are posi vely related to process management.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Rela onship between process management and social results</head><p>The EFQM Excellence Model establishes that the processes are the connec ng link between the remaining key factors of implementa on of the TQM and the results. Perianez-Cristobal, Calvo-Mora, and Navarro-Garcia (2014) indicate that organisa ons act more efficiently and obtain be er results when all their ac vi es are developed and managed as processes. Management by processes is a broad concept that includes the design of products, services, and opera onal processes that fulfil the expecta ons of stakeholders; the preven on of errors; control; and con nuous improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sila &amp; Ebrahimpour, 2003)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Sample</head><p>According to data contributed by the Centres of Excellence (an associa on which unites the efforts of Excellence Promo ng Centres throughout Spain, and which manages the Excellence Awards of the different Spanish Autonomous Communi es), the total number of organisa ons subjected to complete assessments during the period 2003-2010 was 355. A er contac ng the different regional associa ons, a total of 116 (32.67%) complete assessments provided.</p><p>The final sample was formed by 116 Spanish companies in private ownership, including 56 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (48.3%) and 60 large organisa ons (51.7%).</p><p>For the purposes of this study, and according to the criteria of the European Union (Recommenda on of the European Commission 96/280/EC), SMEs will be considered as those which employ less than 250 people, whose annual volume of businesses does not exceed 50 million euros, or whose annual general balance does not exceed 43 million euros. In addi on, the sample represents diverse sectors and produc ve ac vi es. More specifically, the sample is formed by 55 companies in the service sector (47.41%), 51 in the industrial and construc on sectors (43.97%), and 10 pertaining to agriculture and mining (8.62%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Data</head><p>The data were collected from the results of the self-assessment and external assessment process followed by the sample of Spanish companies using EFQM Excellence Model as a reference, between 2003 and 2010. The methodology of self-assessment followed by the companies was that of working groups. This methodology helps management to have a be er understanding of the model, reinforces its commitment to the implementa on, and the discussion and confronta on of ideas by members of the group create a common vision of the situa on of the organisa on and allow a consensus to be reached on strong points and areas of improvement <ref type="bibr">(Tarı´ Guillo´, López Gamero, &amp; Molina Azorín 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The scores of the companies are derived from applying the RADAR logic and its scoring matrices to the criterion of enabling agents and that of results. The scoring scale of the RADAR matrices for the enabling agents is divided into five sec ons that range from value 0 (no evidence) to value 100 (total evidence). For the 'results' criterion, the scale also varies between 0 and 100, but the significance of the extreme values changes according to the type of result that is being analysed (trends of the results, fulfilment of objec ves, comparisons with other companies, causes of the results, or sphere of applica on) <ref type="bibr">(EFQM, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>It can be said that the RADAR logic is a variant of the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) or Deming improvement cycle. The most important difference is that the RADAR model suggests that before Planning what is going to be done (Approach), it is necessary to determine the 'Results' that are required (the objec ves). This reinforces the importance of the cause-and-effect rela onship between the processes (what is done) and the results (what was obtained). The 'Deployment' is equivalent to the 'Do' of the improvement cycle and 'Assessment and Review' are equivalent to the last two steps, 'Check and Act' (EFQM, 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Measures</head><p>measures used to obtain the data are the 5 criteria which form the enabling agents of the EFQM Excellence Model and their 19 sub-criteria. As indicated previously, these criteria and sub-criteria were grouped into three dimensions or variables obtained a er a previous factorial analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calvo-Mora et al., 2014)</ref>. These dimensions represent the TQM social factors, as well as the factors of a strategic and technical nature.</p><p>For the measurement of the results in society, criterion 8 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) was used. More specifically, percep on measures and performance indicators are used. The percep on measures analyse the opinion that stakeholders of the company may have about the organisa on. Specifically, the EFQM Excellence Model summarises the percep on measures into five areas: environmental impact; image and reputa on; impact in society; impact in the workplace; and awards and press coverage.</p><p>The performance indicators are internal measures that the organisa on uses to supervise, understand, predict, and improve the performance of the management of its impact in society and to predict its percep on. These indicators must give a clear idea of the effec veness and efficiency of the deployment and execu on of the social and environmental strategy, its support policies, and its processes. The EFQM Excellence Model iden fies five possible spheres on which these measures can be focused: environmental results; fullfilment of the legisla on and the different official standards; results in society; results with respect to health and safety; and socially responsible management of purchases and suppliers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Data analysis: par al least squares (PLS)</head><p>The research model was tested using a structural equa ons model based on the variances, specifically, the PLS technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Reinartz, Haenlein, &amp; Henseler, 2009)</ref>. This technique, which uses the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) algorithm, is designed to reflect the theore cal and empirical condi ons of social sciences and behaviour, where there are usually situa ons with insufficiently theories and scarce informa on available <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chin, 2010)</ref>. .PLS allows the simultaneous evalua on of the measurement model and the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Roldan &amp; Sánchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. SmartPLS 2.0.M3 so ware was used (Ringle, Wende, &amp; Will, 2005).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>PLS methodology starts from the graphical descrip of the structural model. It is ma er of representa on by means of symbols of the rela onships exis ng between the latent variables (constructs), and of the rela onships exis ng between the indicators and the constructs of the measurement model. The latent variables are represented by means of circles, being able to dis nguish between independent (exogenous constructs) and dependent variables (endogenous constructs). In this study, the independent variable would be the social results construct, with the rest being endogenous constructs. The arrows, and their direc on, indicate the predic ve rela onships (hypothesis) between the latent variables (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roldan &amp; Sánchez -Franco (2012)</ref> indicate two stages in any PLS analysis: the evalua on of the measurement model and the evalua on of the structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Evalua on of the measurement model</head><p>Given that the measurement model has been designed as reflec ve, its evalua on has to be based with regard to reliability and validity <ref type="bibr">(Roldan &amp; Sanchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. In this vein, loadings of both indicators and dimensions exceed the 0.707 threshold. Consequently, indicators and dimensions are reliable. Constructs present high internal consistency since its composite reliability indexes are above 0.7. In addi on, convergent validity is achieved for all latent variables because the average variance extracted (AVE) ra os surpass the 0.5 benchmark (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Finally, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that the square root of the AVE of each latent variable is greater than its correla with any other latent variable. Thus, discriminant validity is reached, and it can be concluded that the main constructs measure different aspects. Note: Diagonal elements (bold) are the square root of the variance shared between the constructs and their measures (AVE). Off-diagonal elements are the correla ons among constructs. Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Effects on endogenous variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Evalua of the structural</head><p>The structural was based on the algebraic sign, magnitude and significance of the structural path coefficients, the R2 values, and the Q2 (redundancy) test for predic ve relevance <ref type="bibr">(Roldan &amp; Sanchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hair, Hult, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2013)</ref>, bootstrapping (5000 resamples) was used to generate standard errors, t-sta s cs, and percen le 95% confidence intervals. The endogenous constructs achieve R2 values higher than 0.22, highligh ng the value reached for the variable for Strategy-Resources management (0.6556). This is higher than the substan al level indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chin (2010)</ref>. In addi on, Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the amount of variance that each antecedent variable explains on each dependent variable.</p><p>A predic ng variable would have to explain at least 10% (0.1) of the variance of the variable that it predicts <ref type="bibr">(Roldan &amp; Sanchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. In this case, all the rela onships posed in the structural model fulfil this rule. The influence that the TQM social factor variable exerts on the rest of the variables is highlighted on explaining more than 65% of the variance of the Strategy-Resources management variable, and indirectly (through the two previous variables), explaining more than 22% of the Social Results variable.</p><p>In order to measure the predic ve relevance of the dependent constructs, the Stone-Geisser test (Q2) is used as a criterion. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chin (2010)</ref>, if Q2&gt;0, the construct has predic ve relevance. In the current model, all the values of Q2 of the dependent constructs display values over 0.18, which is why it can be said that the model has predic ve relevance.</p><p>In order to be able to verify the posed hypothesis, the precision and stability of the obtained es ma ons must be assessed. For this purpose the Bootstrap technique was used, which offers the standard error and the t values of the parameters. Following <ref type="bibr">Roldan and Sanchez-Franco (2012)</ref>, a Bootstrap test of 5000 subsamples was generated and a one-tailed Student t-test distribu on with n -1 degrees of freedom, where n is the number of subsamples to calculate the significance of the coefficients path. From these levels, the significance of the structural paths is obtained and, therefore, the support, or not, of the hypothesis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Specifically, the four hypotheses posed in the research were confirmed with maximum levels of significance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The results support the reliability, validity (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), and the high predic ve power of the EFQM model as a framework for the implementa on of TQM prac ces and for the measurement of the social impact of the organisa on. It presents explained variance (R2) values above 0.22, as can be observed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> and<ref type="table">Figure 3</ref>. Moreover, the proposed model shows a high predic ve validity, since the Q2 coefficient value is above 0 (Table <ref type="table">3</ref> and<ref type="table">Figure</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>More specifically, the research findings show that to obtain excellent social results, it is necessary to have a set of TQM enablers or prac ces present in the EFQM Excellence Model, which the systemic nature of TQM confirms <ref type="bibr">(Bou-Llusar et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eskildsen &amp; Dahlgaard, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zenko, Hrast, &amp; Mulej, 2013)</ref>. In spite of this, not all of the TQM prac ces have a direct or equally important influence on the social results. Thus, the direct and significant rela onship between Process management and Social results (H4) is confirmed. The importance of the processes in the social results is also reflected in the percentage of variance (R2= 22.03%). The impact of the processes on the results that the organisa on reaches in society has been indicated in the studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Al-Tabbaa, Gadd, and Ankrah (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">), Benavides-Velasco, Quintana-Garcı´a, and Marchante-Lara (2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">), and Olaru et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr">). More specifically, Álvarez García, Rama, Vila Alonso, and Fraiz Brea (2014)</ref>, in a structural analysis of the enabling agents of the EFQM model and the social impact, find posi ve and significant rela onships between management by processes and social impact (0.371; R2= 13.8%). However, in our work, the rela onship between both variables and the explanatory variance percentage is more elevated.</p><p>The proposed model also shows that the social impact of the organisa on cannot be improved solely by orien ng the key processes and ac vi es of the organiza on towards a socially responsible management <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rocha, Searcy, &amp; Karapetrovic, 2007)</ref>. The involvement of the main suppliers and partners, the efficient management of the resources, and the strategic considera on of quality and the CSR (Strategy-Resources management factors) are also cri cal variables. This fact is in accordance with that pointed out by Alvarez Garcia et al. ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdullah et al. (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rahman and Bullock (2005)</ref>. This aspect is verified on analysing the very high influence that these variables have on Process management (H3), which explains 46.05% of its variance (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). In addi on, the Strategy-Resources management factors have an indirect influence on Social results (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p><p>Finally, the obtained results show that companies which wish to improve their results and their social impact must take into account that TQM social factors are the most important in this respect. In this respect, management leadership and people management indirectly affect the social impact through their influence on the Strategy-Resources management factors and Process management variables (Indirect effect = 0.3426). In addi on, TQM social factors have a significant direct effect on Strategy-Resources management factors (H1) and Process management (H2) and explain a high percentage of the explained variance of both variables, specifically 65.56% and 19.42%, respec vely (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Although not directly related to the social impact, the existence of mul ple indirect effects, between the key factors of TQM and the results, has also been studied by <ref type="bibr">Curkovicet al.

Conclusions, limitations, and future research lines 7.1. Academic and theore cal implica ons As has been indicated in the discussion, it is not possible to find a unique management factor which affects the results that the organisa on achieves in society. This fact corroborates the mul ple rela onships that exist between the agents (criteria and sub-criteria of the EFQM model) which form the management system. Below, we present the rela onhips which we consider the most important for the improvement of the social impact of the organisa on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>The whole process begins with the leadership. The highest managers must create the ethical and social principles and values of the organisa ons. They must also lead by example of involvement with, and fulfilment of, these principles and values as cultural bases, through ac on and behaviour. These principles and values must be translated into ac ons by the management in response to the demands of society. These aspects are included in the Social factors of the proposed research model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>The integra on of the aspects related to CSR into the policy and strategy. The key elements for this are as follows: (1) the communica on and the results of the CSR policy of the organisa on; (2) the policies and equality of opportuni es; (3) demand for the fulfilment of values and the development of ac ons in CSR from suppliers and partners; and (4) the implementa on of standardised systems of management in ma ers of the (ISO 14000) and CSR (ISO 26000). These elements are included in the Strategy-Resources management factors and process management dimensions of the proposed model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Implica ons for business management</head><p>The concern of the organisa on about sa sfying the expecta ons of the people and ins tu ons related to it obliges it to consider in its strategy the need to act in terms of social responsibility and to measure its impact in the society in which it undertakes its ac vity. S ll recognising the inherent subjec vity of organisa onal ethics, understood in its widest sense, the respect of certain social standards (whether sanc oned by the effec ve legality or not) forms part of a TQM, which seeks long-term objec ves. This may lead to the sacrifice of obtaining certain short-term profits in the interest of the opportunity to show a tudes which contribute to a posi ve social image of the organisa on. In a broader sense, the management and con nuous improvement of quality involve considering the social customer as consis ng of the different segments that cons tute the organisa onal macro-environment (poli cal-legal, economic, environmental, and sociocultural). In addi on, the organisa must not forget that the rela onships with its stakeholders are based on a balance between rights and obliga ons; that is, they must not only receive, but also give. Thus, a rela onship of confidence between an organisa on and society can arise which will lay the founda ons of a socially responsible behaviour.</p><p>7.3. Recommenda ons for assessment and improvement of social impact A series of ac ons are detailed below that companies would have to develop to effec vely assess what they are doing to sa sfy the social client and how to improve their posi oning and social image:  Clearly iden fy the stakeholders that it includes in the group called 'society', as well as their needs and expecta ons.</p><p> Establish objec ves related to social impact: image; degree of influence on the local and na onal economy; ethics; support to educa onal, spor ng, or cultural ac vi es; philanthropic or support ac vi es to not-for-profit organisa ons; preven on of occupa onal risks; protec on and preserva on of the environment; etc. .  Maintain the commitment and involvement of the leaders and highest managers of the organisa on, who must create the ethical values and give an example of their applica on as cultural bases of ac ons and behaviour.</p><p> Involve and mo vate all the people of the organisa on and make them see the importance of their role in the improvement of the social impact.</p><p> Demand ethical and socially responsible values and behaviour from the main suppliers and partners.</p><p> Explicitly establish a policy and strategy rela ng to social responsibility.  Implement suitable channels for gathering informa on, communica ng and rela ng with society, and evalua ng their effec veness (surveys, reports, news in the media, mee ngs with interest groups, Market research, etc.).</p><p> Iden fy and effec vely manage the key processes involved in the rela onships that the company maintains with society and which can have the greatest impact on it.</p><p> Establish programmes and plans and assign specific resources to improve the social impact.</p><p> Design a system of measurement indicators that allow the monitoring of the effec veness of the processes, programmes, and plans related to the social impact of the organisa on.</p><p> Establish the mechanisms for informing and maintaining a fluid dialogue with the social stakeholders.</p></div>

The first limita on is due to the technique used for the proposed model: structural equa on modelling, which assumes the linearity of rela onships between the latent variables. The second is related to the no on of causality. Our study has considered a so modelling approach, oriented more towards predic on than causality. The third limita on refers to the design of the research being cross-sec onal instead of longitudinal. The fourth limita on is related to the sample and data collec on. In this sense, the sample size and the period of me in which the data have been collected (six years) may affect the interpreta on of the results and conclusions. Finally, the geo-graphical area selected for analysis can affect the results and conclusions. In this respect, ethical values and social orienta on of the companies can be different from one geo-graphical context to another.</p><p>The indicated limita ons cons tute challenges for the development of new research. In par cular, we can indicate the following: (1) To verify if the results obtained with our research can replicated, segmen ng the sample by size; (2) to deepen the understanding of the indirect rela onships in the model through the analysis of the media ng effects of the Strategy-Resources management factors and Process management variables.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
