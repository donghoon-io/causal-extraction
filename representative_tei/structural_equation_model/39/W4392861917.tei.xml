<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Attitudes toward suicide are complex and multifaceted, and their predictive roles in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not well understood. Elaborating on attitudes toward suicide can help contribute to suicide prevention. The current study examined whether and how attitudes toward suicide are involved in the ideation-to-action framework of suicide among college students. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 1427 Chinese college students (mean age, 22.42 years), of whom 570 reported suicidal ideation. Participants completed questionnaires to assess their endorsed attitude toward suicide, stigmatized attitude toward suicide, self-stigma toward suicide, depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Structural equation modeling revealed that the associations between the three types of attitudes, i.e., endorsed attitude, stigmatized attitude, and self-stigma, and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were fully or partially mediated by depression. The results suggested that attitudes towards suicide signi cantly in uence suicidal behaviors and future suicide prevention efforts should consider these in uences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Suicide, while not classi ed as a medical illness, remains a pressing public health concern (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). It holds the unfortunate distinction of being the second leading cause of death among individuals aged 15 to 29 worldwide (WHO, 2019). In China, the suicide mortality rate for urban adolescents and young adults (15-24 years old) underwent a sudden surge in 2020, surpassing the levels observed in the preceding decade (National Health Commission of China, 2022). For young adult college students in China, a complex interaction of internal and external factors, encompassing mental health, family dynamics, negative life events, and the social environment, contributes to the risk of suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Huang &amp; Saito, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jiang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Qiao et al., 2022)</ref>. Previous research indicates that attitudes toward suicide can potentially serve as either protective or risk factors for suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carpiniello &amp; Pinna, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kawashima et al., 2020)</ref>. The present study speci cally delves into the examination of attitudes toward suicide and their in uence on suicide behaviors among college students -a demographic group with an elevated risk of suicide. The ndings of this research could contribute to a deeper insight into the role that attitudes play in suicidal ideation and inform suicide prevention strategies tailored to college students.</p><p>The term "suicide" encompasses the act of intentionally ending one's own life <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Posner et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">VandenBos, 2015)</ref>. Heterogeneous de nitions have been used to identify different stages of the spectrum of suicide in the past decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Crosby, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Harmer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Klonsky et al., 2016)</ref>. For clarity and consistency, the current study adheres to the terminology and de nitions proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Klonsky et al. (2016)</ref>. Individuals experiencing suicidal thoughts are considered to have suicidal ideation, while those engaging in incomplete acts of self-harm are classi ed as having suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beck et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">VandenBos, 2015)</ref>. It is crucial to distinguish between people having suicidal ideation and people having suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Klonsky &amp; May, 2014</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Klonsky et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Klonsky et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Evidently, mental disorders are widely recognized as signi cant risk factors for suicide. Depression, in particular, has been extensively studied in the eld of suicidology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Huang &amp; Saito, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kay et al., 2009)</ref>. While depression alone may not be su cient to determine the presence of suicidal ideation or differentiate between individuals with suicidal ideation and those with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Klonsky &amp; May, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">May &amp; Klonsky, 2016</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Klonsky et al., 2021)</ref>, it remains a robust predictor of suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brown et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cheng et al., 2021)</ref>. Growing evidence suggests that depression plays a mediating role in the pathway from psychological distress to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Conejero et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020)</ref>. Consequently, depression stands as a reliable and robust factor in predicting suicidal ideation and attempts. On this basis, the present study proposed the 1 st hypothesis that depression would have a positive association with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.</p><p>In addition to depression, recent research has underscored the signi cance of attitudes toward suicide as a crucial factor in uencing suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Kim &amp; Park, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kodaka et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Shneidman, 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kawashima et al. (2020)</ref> elucidated that suicide beauti cation is negatively related to attitudes toward suicide prevention, while a positive association was observed between suicide stigma and suicide prevention initiatives. Similarly, tolerant and normalized attitudes toward suicide have been linked to an elevated risk of suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(McAuliffe et al., 2003)</ref>. Psychometricians have developed several scales to effectively measure these and relative attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Cwik et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Domino et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kodaka et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Renberg &amp; Jacobsson, 2003)</ref>. These scales categorize attitudes into distinct types, such as endorsed and stigmatized attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Domino et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lee et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, previous studies have investigated attitudes toward suicide and depression and found a signi cant association among the three constructs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Park et al. (2022)</ref> demonstrated that stronger attitudes toward suicide among Korean college students were a signi cant predictor of depression, which in turn was predictive of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), which is a recognized risk factor for suicidal ideation and attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hou et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Klonsky et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">You &amp; Lin, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Jiang et al. (2021)</ref> found that Chinese adolescents who perceived a negative attitude toward themselves from others were more likely to experience depression and NSSI. These ndings collectively support the notion that attitudes toward suicide can serve as a reliable predictor of depression. The present study aims to further elucidate this relationship by examining two general types of attitudes alongside depression to gain a comprehensive understanding of their in uence on suicidal ideation and attempts.</p><p>For endorsed attitude toward suicide, previous studies have established a positive association between endorsed attitude and suicide attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kawashima et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">McAuliffe et al., 2003)</ref>. This association can be attributed to a complex interaction of cultural and social factors. From the cultural perspective, suicide is not blamed when it is committed for a good purpose in traditional Confucian societies, it would even be considered as one of the acceptable approaches (e.g., protecting virtue; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bunney et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Fei, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fei, , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Zhang, 2009)</ref>. Research has consistently demonstrated that individuals' endorsed attitude toward suicide plays a critical role in shaping suicide rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Foo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Zhang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Zhang &amp; Liu, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>From the social perspective, public media also serves as a salient in uence on the formation of endorsed attitude toward suicide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Phillips (1974)</ref> proposed the concept of the "Werther effect," which suggests that media portrayals of suicide can induce imitation among susceptible individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ha &amp; Yang, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Scherr &amp; Reinemann, 2011)</ref>. The rise of social media has ampli ed concerns about suicide contagion, a phenomenon driven by social learning mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Biddle, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Choi &amp; Noh, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">De Leo &amp; Heller, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Pirkis et al., 2006)</ref>. Speci cally, studies have shown that individuals may attempt suicide using methods they have previously observed through media exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cheng et al., 2007)</ref> Based on the ideation-to-action framework as well as existing research on endorsed attitude, the current study proposed the 2 nd hypothesis that endorsed attitude toward suicide would have a directly positive relation with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts; and the 3 rd hypothesis that endorsed attitude toward suicide would have a positive relation with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts indirectly through depression (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>For stigmatized attitude toward suicide, studies on stigma emerged in the late 1890s and suggested that stigma is closely related to stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Corrigan, et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Link &amp; Phelan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Major &amp; O'Brien, 2005)</ref>. As a social phenomenon, stigma exerts signi cant social in uences. From the perspective of people who stigmatize others, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Dovidio et al. (2000)</ref> proposed that stigmatizing attitude and behaviors can bolster individuals' self-esteem and social identity, serving as a means of justifying their own status quo <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Zhang &amp; Yu, 2007)</ref>. Besides, in the eld of suicidology, stigma is recognized as a major obstacle to suicide prevention (APA, 2022; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hom et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Saxena et al., 2014)</ref>. Suicidal behaviors and individuals who have attempted suicide or have family members who have committed suicide may be confronted with stigmatization from the public <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Parker, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peters et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Worden, 2018)</ref>. Consequently, individuals with stronger stigmatized attitude toward suicide are less likely to engage in suicide attempts, as such attitudes may deter them from becoming part of the group they stigmatize. Our previous research also supports this c, demonstrating a negative association between individuals' stigmatized attitude toward suicide and their suicide behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Lyu &amp; Li, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study proposed the 4 th hypothesis that stigmatized attitude toward suicide would have a negative relation with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts; and the 5 th hypothesis that stigmatized attitude toward suicide would have a negative relation with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts indirectly through depression (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Regarding the term of stigma, it can be broadly categorized into public stigma and self-stigma <ref type="bibr">(</ref> has been shown to mediate the association between stigma and suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kaniuka, et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Zeng et al., 2018)</ref>. Hence, we proposed the 6 th hypothesis that self-stigma toward suicide would have a direct positive relation with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts; and the 7 th hypothesis that self-stigma toward suicide would have a positive relation with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts indirectly through depression (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>To test the hypotheses proposed above, we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) in three separate models to investigate whether and how attitudes toward suicide in uence the ideation-toaction framework of suicide among college students. For this purpose, we recruited a sample of Chinese college students, both those with and without suicidal ideation, and administered questionnaires to assess their endorsed attitude, stigmatized attitude, self-stigma toward suicide, depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Measures</head><p>Endorsed and stigmatized attitudes were separately measured by the Glori cation and Stigma subscales of the Stigma of Suicide Scale -Short Form (SOSS-SF; <ref type="bibr">Batterham et al., 2013a)</ref>. This 5-point Likert scale focuses on endorsement and stigmatized attitudes toward suicide, and each item is responded to by indicating numbers from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The two dimensions were assessed by calculating the total scores of all items within each subscale. The higher scores denote a stronger endorsed or stigmatized attitude toward suicide. The two subscales used in this study were extracted from a revised version of the Chinese SOSS (12 items). The Cronbach's α of this Chinese version scale in Chinese college students has been previously reported (Glori cation, .77; Stigma, .72; Han et al., 2017).</p><p>In the present study, Cronbach's α values for the Glori cation subscale and Stigma subscale were .72 and .85, respectively, demonstrating good internal consistency.</p><p>Depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999), a widely used tool for measuring depressive symptoms. This 9-item questionnaire focuses on depression symptoms in the past 2 weeks of individuals. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kroenke et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Williams, 2009)</ref>. Adding up all the items yields the total score, and a higher score means a higher level of depression. Acceptable reliability and validity coe cients of this scale among Chinese community samples have been previously reported (Cronbach's α is above .86; <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. The Cronbach's α of the scale was .84 in the current sample, demonstrating good internal consistency.</p><p>Suicidal ideation was measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">van Spijker, et al., 2014)</ref>. This 5-item questionnaire assesses suicidal ideation in the past month using an 11-point Likert Scale by measuring the frequency of suicide thoughts [from 0 (never) to 10 (always)], the degree to which the thoughts are uncontrollable [from 0 (no control) to 10 (full control)], the closeness to suicide attempts [from 0 (not close at all) to 10 (made an attempt)], the distress caused by the thoughts [from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely)], and the interference with daily activities [from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely)]. Adding up all the items yields the total score, and a higher score means a higher level of suicidal ideation. Participants with a total SIDAS score larger than 20 were indicated a high risk of suicidal behavior. Excellent reliability coe cients of this scale among Chinese college students have been previously reported (Cronbach's α &gt; .91; Han et al., 2017). The Cronbach's α of the scale was .88 in the current sample, showing excellent internal consistency. Suicide attempts were measured by the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Osman, 2001)</ref>. This 4-item questionnaire assesses suicidal attempts by measuring the lifetime suicide-related thoughts and attempts (from 1 to 4), the frequency of suicidal thoughts in the past year (from 1 to 5), the threats of attempting suicide (from 1 to 3), and the self-reported likelihood of suicide attempts (from 0 to 6). Adding up all the items yields the total SBQ-R score, and a higher score means a higher level of suicide attempts. Participants with a total SBQ-R score larger than 6 were indicated a high suicide risk. Acceptable reliability coe cients of this scale have been reported among Chinese college students (ρ = .79, ω = .075; Huen et al., 2022). In the current study, the Cronbach's α was .72.</p><p>Self-stigma toward suicide in the 570 participants who have suicidal ideation was further measured by the Self-blame subscale of the Personal Suicide Stigma Questionnaire (PSSQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Rimkeviciene et al., 2019</ref>). This 7-item subscale focuses on self-stigma toward suicide, and each item is ranged from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). The subscale was scored by adding up all the items, and a higher score means stronger self-blame toward suicide. Acceptable reliability coe cients of this scale among an Australian community sample have been reported (Rimleviciene et al., 2021). In the current study, the subscale was rst translated into Chinese by S.L. and then double-checked by Y.L. The Cronbach's α was .90, showing excellent internal consistency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data Analysis</head><p>All data analyses were conducted using JASP 0.17.1.0 (JASP Team) and Amos 27.0 (IBM Corp). Pearson correlation analyses were rst conducted to examine the correlations among endorsed and stigmatized suicides, depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Bootstrapping with 10,000 times replicates was used to determine a 95% con dence interval of correlation coe cients. A multicollinearity test was conducted and assessed with the variables of variance in ation factor (VIF &lt; 5.00; Shrestha, 2020). No multicollinearity was found in the current sample. According to Efron and Tibshirani (1993), bootstrap procedures offer an empirical means for determining statistical signi cance that circumvents the need to assume normality. Therefore, bootstrapping was used to due with the possible non-normal distribution of the data.</p><p>To test all hypotheses as well as the hypothesized model, we followed the suggestions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>. First, con rmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to con rm the measurement models for each scale had acceptable ts. Then the hypothesized relationships were tested with the structural models. Both measurement and structural models were performed with full-information maximum likelihood estimation. Bias-corrected nonparametric percentile bootstrap method was used to test the mediating effects. Statistical signi cance was determined with bias-corrected bootstrapping with 10,000 re-samples. For each estimate, 95% bootstrapped con dence intervals were also calculated, and a 95% con dence interval not including zero was deemed to be statistically signi cant.</p><p>Four indexes were used to assess the goodness of t of the models: the comparative t index (CFI ≥ .90; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bentler, 1990)</ref>; the incremental t index (IFI ≥ .90; Bollen, 1989), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR ≤ .10; <ref type="bibr">Kline, 2005)</ref>, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA ≤ .10; Hair et al., 2019; Xia &amp; Yang, 2019). As an index which highly sensitive to sample size, Chi-square test results were also reported but not used in assessing model t because they tend to be statistically signi cant due to a large sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Keith, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Measurement models</head><p>To test the models, observed indicators of the latent constructs were used. For each latent variable, all the items of the corresponding scale were used as observable variables. The measurement model of endorsed attitude showed a good t with χ 2 /df = 8.132, CFI = .926, IFI = .926, SRMR = .050, RMSEA = .067, 90%CI = [.063, .070]. The measurement model of stigmatized attitude showed a good t with χ 2 /df = 7.374, CFI = .927, IFI = .927, SRMR = .056, RMSEA = .067, 90%CI = [.064, .070].

All the observed variables were signi cantly loaded on their respective latent variables (all ps &lt; .001; see Online Resource 1). The results of con rmatory factor analyses demonstrated that all the scales used formed adequate measurement models, and thus provided evidence for the construct validity of the measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Structural Models</head><p>No latent variable exhibited multicollinearity issues in all the models, as all VIFs were below 5.00. Therefore, all the latent variables were included in the analysis of structural models. The structural model of endorsed attitude (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>), which is based on all college students, showed a good t to the data with χ 2 /df = 8.132, CFI = .916, IFI = .916, SRMR = .058, RMSEA = .071, 90%CI = [.068, .074]. The structural model of stigmatized attitude (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>) also showed a good t with χ 2 /df = 8.266, CFI = .916, IFI = .916; SRMR = .067; RMSEA = .071, 95%CI = [.068, .074]. The structural model of self-stigma (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>), which was based on the students with suicidal ideation, showed a good t with χ 2 /df = 3.436, CFI = .907, IFI = .907; SRMR = .067; RMSEA = .065, 95%CI = [.061, .070]. Thus, all three models were used in the subsequent bootstrapping and invariance testing analyses.</p><p>A bootstrap procedure recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Shrout and Bolger (2002)</ref> was used to examine the signi cant levels of indirect effects for the mediation models. The rst step in this bootstrap procedure was to create 10,000 bootstrap samples from the two original data sets respectively (N = 1427 and N = 570) by random sampling with replacement. The second step was to run the hypothesized structural models 10,000 times separately with these 10,000 bootstrap samples to yield 10,000 estimations of each path coe cient. The third step was to save the output of the 10,000 estimations of each path coe cient in the three models to calculate an estimate of the mediating or indirect effects.</p><p>We calculated the mediating pathways from endorsed attitude, stigmatized attitude, or self-stigma, through depression to suicidal ideation for each of the three models (i.e., Panel A: endorsed attitude → depression → suicidal ideation; Panel B: stigmatized attitude → depression → suicidal ideation; Panel C: self-stigma → depression → suicidal ideation). The pathways were calculated by multiplying 10,000 pairs of the path coe cients. The results from 10,000 bootstrap samples showed that the 95% CI for these indirect effects did not include zero, indicating that these indirect effects were statistically signi cant, with the direct effect from endorsed attitude to suicidal ideation as the only exception (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>).</p><p>For the model with endorse attitude in Panel A, there was a complete mediating effect from endorsed attitude to suicidal ideation through depression. For the model with stigmatized attitude in Panel B, there was a suppressing effect from endorsed attitude to suicidal ideation through depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cheung &amp; Lau, 2008)</ref>. Speci cally, the in uence of the indirect effect was opposite to the direct effect. For the model with self-stigma in Panel C, there is a partial mediation from self-stigma to suicidal ideation through depression, and its mediating effect accounted for 63.04% of the variance in the total effect.</p></div>

Anchored in the ideation-to-action framework, this study delved into the interaction between attitudes toward suicide with suicidal ideation and attempts.</p><p>The results across all three models corroborated the 1 st hypothesis, underscoring depression as a reliable and robust predictor of both suicidal ideation and attempts. This nding resonates with prior research among Chinese college students (Wu et al., 2020; <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, the results revealed that all three types of attitudes exerted signi cant in uences on suicidal ideation and attempts, with depression serving as the mediating factor. The hypotheses were supported for all but the 2 nd and 4 th one.</p><p>The present study revealed that depression fully mediates the association between endorsed attitude and suicidal ideation. The direct path between endorsed attitude and suicidal ideation was nonsigni cant. Similar relations between endorsement and suicidal ideation have been observed in previous research among college students <ref type="bibr">(Batterham et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Joe et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kawashima et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Zemaitiene &amp; Zaborskis, 2005)</ref>. This nding can be interpreted by the notion that such attitude may normalize suicide, rendering it a more acceptable, attainable, and desirable option during a psychological crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gibb et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lee et al., 2007)</ref>. Individuals with endorsed attitude toward suicide are less likely to perceive suicide as a crisis, thereby diminishing the likelihood of help-seeking behaviors and intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(McAuliffe et al., 2003)</ref>. This decreased inclination, in turn, increases their vulnerability to the relatively high risk of suicide and makes them less accessible to professional intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Calear et al., 2014)</ref>. Future studies could delve into the speci c role of help-seeking and attitude toward it in suicide and explore how attitude toward help-seeking in uence the pathway from endorsed attitude toward suicide to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.</p><p>Simultaneously, stigmatized attitude toward suicide hold considerable signi cance in the eld of suicidology. The present study demonstrated a signi cant negative association between stigmatized attitude and suicidal ideation, which was fully mediated by depression. Notably, the direct path between stigmatized attitude and suicidal ideation was positive but suppressed by the indirect pathway. The bootstrapping test results further indicated that the indirect path accounted for a larger proportion of variance compared to the direct path. The mediated pathway can be explained by the potential of stigmatized attitude to increase help-seeking intentions, thereby reducing depression and suicide risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Colucci &amp; Minas, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Dovidio et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Downs &amp; Eisenberg, 2012)</ref>. On the other hand, the direct pathway may be attributable to stigma internalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Corrigan et al., 2019)</ref>. Given that internalization processes can be obstructed and only a portion of the participants exhibited self-stigma toward suicide, the association between stigmatized attitude and suicidal ideation was relatively weak in our sample (N = 1427) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dreier et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Jung et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Distinguished from stigmatized attitude as public stigma, self-stigma emerges from the internalization of these negative perceptions, leading to exacerbated depressive symptoms and potentially contributing to suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aruta et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Corrigan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kaniuka et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Zeng et al., 2018)</ref>. The present study revealed direct and indirect associations between self-stigma and suicidal ideation. Notably, self-stigma toward suicide positively in uenced suicide attempts in students with suicidal ideation, with depression and suicidal ideation partially mediating this relationship. Consistent with prior research, self-stigma among students with suicidal ideation was identi ed as a critical predictor for further suicidal thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Lyu &amp; Li, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Rimkeviciene et al., 2015)</ref>. A plausible explanation is that individuals with self-stigma may experience guilt and self-blame, increasing their susceptibility to poor mental well-being and suicide, rendering self-stigma a signi cant barrier to seeking professional intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Maclean et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Saxena et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Williams et al., 2003)</ref>. Additionally, some studies suggest that negative public attitudes may accelerate suicide attempts in individuals with suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carpiniello &amp; Pinna, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Worden, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, self-stigma toward suicide may expedite the process of suicide in individuals with suicidal ideation.</p><p>The current study yields important implications for suicide prevention strategies. Firstly, endorsed and stigmatized attitudes toward suicide are purported to function as accelerators and barriers to suicide among all college students <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Downs &amp; Eisenberg, 2012)</ref>. Therefore, mitigating endorsed attitude toward suicide should be a central focus of overarching suicide prevention efforts. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kawashima et al. (2020)</ref>, the implementation of suicide education programs and the cultivation of public awareness can effectively enhance suicide literacy and advance suicide prevention initiatives <ref type="bibr">(Batterham et</ref>  Inevitably, there are some limitations regarding the current study. Firstly, it did not differentiate between self-stigma subtypes, namely perceived stigma and internalized stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Corrigan &amp; Penn, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Livingston &amp; Byod, 2010)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Corrigan et al. (2011)</ref> have asserted, assessing perceived stigma alone is insu cient to elucidate its impact. The detrimental effects of stigma are primarily driven by the internalization of stigma, also known as self-stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Corrigan et al., 2011)</ref>. Future studies should gather data on perceived stigma and, based on this information and self-stigma, delve into the internalization process of stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hanschmidt, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Nicholas et al., 2022)</ref>. Secondly, the data collection employed a cross-sectional design, with all data gathered at a single time point. However, given the reciprocal relationship between stigma and suicide, longitudinal data may be more effective in uncovering causal links <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carpiniello &amp; Pinna, 2017)</ref>. To enhance the understanding of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, future studies could consider conducting multi-wave longitudinal research <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Franklin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Maclean et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>This structural equation modeling study demonstrated that depression mediates the relationship between attitudes toward suicide and suicidal ideation and attempts. Speci cally, endorsed attitude, stigmatized attitude, and self-stigma toward suicide all exerted indirect positive or negative effects on suicidal ideation and attempts through depression. These ndings contribute to a deeper understanding of suicidal ideation and attempts and have implications for suicide prevention efforts. Future studies should further explore both public stigma and self-stigma to gain a better understanding of the internalized process of stigma toward suicide and its in uence on suicidal ideation and attempts. Additionally, employing a multi-wave longitudinal design could provide stronger evidence for the relationships between these variables.

Public stigma denotes the stigma held by others, and self-stigma represents the stigma held by people themselves (Corrigan, 2004; Corrigan et al., 2018; Guarneri et al., 2019; Kowalski &amp; Peipert, 2019). Stigmatized attitude is considered a form of public stigma. Existing research has demonstrated that individuals can internalize public stigma, by leading to a process of agreement, application, and then acceptance of these negative perceptions (Corrigan &amp; Rao, 2012; Livingston &amp; Byod, 2010; Rimkeviciene et al., 2019). Self-stigma, the outcome of internalization, has been associated with heightened depressive symptoms (Aruta et al., 2021; Corrigan et al., 2019).

Of these students, 9.82% were freshmen, 23.51% sophomores, 37.37% junior students, and 29.30% senior students or postgraduates. The current cross-sectional study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of BNU-HKBU United International College (Ref. No. REC-2022-01).

Several countries have implemented administrative measures to address endorsed attitude toward suicide and alleviate the risk of social media-related copycat suicide<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amitai &amp; Apter, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Domaradzki, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fahey et al., 2018)</ref>. Additionally, social media platforms can contribute to suicide prevention by providing professional support and fostering the development of interpersonal connections among users (Choi &amp; Noh, 2020; Ha &amp; Yang, 2021;<ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Robinson et al., 2016)</ref>. Secondly, self-stigma toward suicide is associated with an increased risk of suicide among students with suicidal ideation. Suicide prevention efforts should prioritize reducing self-stigma among these students. Considering that students with self-stigma toward suicide may be less inclined to proactively seek help, one potential approach is to encourage them to engage in regular professional counseling(Drum et  al., 2009; Han et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2007). Providing regular psychological assessments and counseling services can signi cantly improve personal mental health and reduce suicide risk (Teismann et al., 2018; Teismann, Brailovskaia, &amp; Margraf, 2019).</figDesc><table /></figure>
