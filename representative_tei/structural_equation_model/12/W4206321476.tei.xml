<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With their human-like nature, conversational agents (CAs) introduce a social component to humancomputer interaction. Numerous studies have previously attempted to integrate this social component by incorporating trust into models such as the technology acceptance model (TAM) to decipher the adoption mechanisms related to CAs. Given the heterogeneity of these previous works, the aim of this paper is to integrate empirical evidence on the role and influence of trust within the nomological network of the TAM. For this purpose, we conduct a meta-analytic structural equation modeling approach based on 45 studies comprising k = 155 correlations, and N = 13,786 observations. Our findings highlight the multifaceted role of trust as a mediator transmitting the effects of the technology-related perceptions that drive the intention to use CAs. Our results present a comprehensive overview in a thriving research field that can guide both future theory building and the designs of more trustworthy CAs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Conversational interactions between humans and computers became an area of interest as early as the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. However, in recent years, technological advancements in computing power and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have led to technological maturity and the proliferation of conversational agents (CAs) that are projected to have a market value of nearly $23 billion by 2024 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. A CA is software with a text-or voice-based interface that engages with users and exchanges information to serve general purposes or specific domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Today, CAs are used as digital assistants in a wide range of application areas, such as information retrieval, smart home control and customer service <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. A CA differs from other information technology (IT) in that, by leveraging natural language processing (NLP), it emulates humanlike behavior and allows users to interact more naturally with technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. This anthropomorphic aspect of CAs alters the common interaction with the software component in sociotechnical systems, raising questions for researchers concerning the conditions under which CAs are adopted or rejected <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>.</p><p>Given CAs are expected to be useful for many automatable tasks, while improving usability by allowing operations via natural language <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, empirical adoption studies often examine usage behavior by drawing on established technology acceptance theories, such as the technology acceptance model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. The TAM is a widely used theory in the realm of information systems (IS) that highlights technologyrelated user perceptions as determinants for adoption intentions in a parsimonious manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>. However, Wang and Benbasat <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> have recognized that, in the context of online recommendation agents (an early maturity form of modern CAs), technology-related perceptions are insufficient in capturing usage behavior. This is because users "treat computerized agents as social actors, and form social relationships that involve trust" <ref type="bibr">[14:79]</ref>. Therefore, in addition to original TAM constructs such as perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, trusting beliefs (i.e., benevolence, competence, integrity) toward the studied IT artifact are often embedded in empirical research to explain CA adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>. Similar to these studies, we use the term trust to refer to these trusting beliefs as drivers of trusting intentions. In fact, in previous studies, this form of trust (also referred to as trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>) has proven to be an important antecedent of the intention to adopt CAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>, whereas other studies have revealed no direct effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>. This heterogeneity of results can also be observed when examining the importance of other TAM-related constructs that impact CA acceptance. For instance, perceived ease of use affects CA-adoption intentions in the studies of Pal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> and Pitardi and Marriot <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, but has no significant effect in the studies of Rodríguez Cardona <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, Moussawi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, and Rese et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. These inconsistencies among CA-focused studies necessitate further research efforts to achieve an integrated and consistent understanding of the impact of trust within the nomological network of the TAM. Our study addresses this issue by meta-analyzing previous empirical knowledge to advance our understanding of the mechanisms affecting the willingness to interact with CAs. In doing so, we address the call for more trust-related research in the context of CAs <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies synthesizing empirical knowledge within the framework of the TAM neither integrated trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref> nor had any particular technological focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to provide such an integrated view of CA acceptance research by synthesizing empirical findings across domains and analyzing the variance between studies. Considering the above, we therefore pose the following research question (RQ): RQ: What is the role and influence of trust on the intention to adopt CAs within the nomological network of the TAM?</p><p>We answer this RQ by applying meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) on the fundament of the Trust-TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>. MASEM combines the strengths of meta-analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> by enabling us to first conduct a meta-analysis that builds on established empirical findings before fitting the data to the Trust-TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref> that we adapted to the CA context. Our goal is not to achieve novelty through the extension of the TAM, nor in the proposal of new constructs, but rather to approach the true effects of trust in conjunction with other TAM-related constructs, thereby strengthening the robustness of previous results and disentangling inconsistencies. These findings can guide the theory building of future studies in a growing body of research and inform design decisions.</p><p>The remainder of this paper addresses the theoretical underpinnings of trust in and adoption of CAs (Section 2). We then present the meta-analytical framework of this paper (Section 3) before elaborating on the underlying MASEM methodology (Section 4). The results of the MASEM are subsequently outlined (Section 5). This is followed by a discussion of the research's theoretical and practical implications and its limitations (Section 6). We conclude the study by highlighting the findings of our research (Section 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Adoption of conversational agents</head><p>CAs comprise "both text-based and voice-based automated dialog systems that can interact with a human user via natural language and answer questions on specific topics" <ref type="bibr">[26:2]</ref>. From a technical perspective, CAs leverage AI capabilities, including NLP and machine learning, to create a natural conversation flow between humans and machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. As such, CAs partly process users' sensitive and personal information in an automated manner and, for example, provide recommendations for medical treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. Since the functionality of CAs is generally substantiated by the storage of large amounts of data, many users are concerned about their privacy when using such CAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. According to a survey conducted by KPMG in 2020, only 28% of US citizens would trust AI-based assistants <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. In this context, trust refers to "an individual's belief in an agent's competence, benevolence, and integrity" <ref type="bibr">[30:76]</ref>, which provides the basis for trusting intentions.</p><p>Thus far, however, the IS discipline has examined the role of trust in the acceptance of CAs in a fragmented manner, primarily employing unique TAM extensions. For instance, Rodríguez Cardona et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> recently studied the acceptance of CAs within the insurance industry by including privacy concerns and trust into the TAM. Apart from confirming the inherent role of perceived usefulness as the main antecedent regarding the intention to use CAs, the results of their study reveal that trusting beliefs constitute an important precursor of the intention to use CAs, whereas privacy concerns negatively influence perceived trust. In addition, the study suggests that perceived ease of use facilitates the trust-building process. Conversely, an exploratory interview study by Laumer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> demonstrates that trust in the technology provider of healthcare CAs reduces individual privacy concerns and positively affects the expected utility of a CA. Etemad-Sajadi <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, in turn, found that, apart from the perceived ease of use, trust constitutes an important antecedent in the adoption of virtual agents on websites by positively influencing perceived utility, which in turn forms the main predictor of the intention to use.</p><p>In essence, the aforementioned studies indicate that a trustworthy and secure CA design remains necessary for adoption and, in line with the TAM, empirically confirm the inherent role of perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. However, other recent studies reveal contradictory results: For instance, Pitardi and Marriot <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> tested a theoretical model in relation to consumers' trust in voice-based CAs such as Amazon's Alexa. Although the authors find that perceived usefulness and ease of use does indeed affect the acceptance of CAs, they demonstrate that trust does not. However, this study indicates that privacy risks do not significantly influence trust in CAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Additionally, the studies by Moussawi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> and Rese et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> suggest that a high level of user friendliness does not necessarily promote the adoption of CAs, thereby contradicting the hypothesized relationships of the TAM.</p><p>In sum, IS research has so far provided an inconsistent picture of the role and influence of trusting beliefs on the individual adoption intentions of CAs. Considering the increasing diffusion of CAs, we argue that an integrated comprehension of previous empirical findings can contribute to resolve these inconsistencies and inform future theory building and artifact design. Therefore, our meta-analysis begins by synthesizing the data from extant IS research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Meta-analytical framework</head><p>According to Söllner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, four clusters of trust-based relationships are central to studies in IS research:</p><p>people-people, people-organizations, organization-organization, and people-technology. Our study is positioned in the latter cluster, which focuses on trust in IT artifacts. This line of literature encompasses many facets and approaches regarding how trust influences the mechanisms of technology adoption, thereby improving our understanding of how to enhance the design of trustworthy artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. To this end, trust is often embedded as an external variable in the TAM, with a variety of studies examining its nomological validity for different technologies and contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. This is not an uncommon procedure, since the TAM, as a key technology acceptance theory, is parsimonious in its original form <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, and empirical research usually extends the theory by including external factors to fit the context under investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Research model</head><p>Our meta-analytical framework, depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, draws on an earlier attempt to integrate the relational trust perspective with the TAM; Gefen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> combined both perspectives to study trust in e-vendors in the context of online shopping. This model was later adapted by Wang and Benbasat <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> by considering trusting beliefs toward artifacts in the context of recommendation agents and has been applied to modern CAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. The model adds trust (i.e. trusting beliefs) to the other determinants, such as perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as antecedents of the intention to use. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use thereby constitute the fundamental determinants of use intentions within the TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. Perceived usefulness refers to "the degree to which a person believes that a particular system would enhance his or her…performance," whereas perceived ease of use indicates "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort," <ref type="bibr">[34:320]</ref> which in turn affects perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>.</p><p>Within the Trust-TAM, trust plays a complementary role as an enabler of perceived usefulness, a mediator of the effects of perceived ease of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, and a determinant of the intention to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>. Trust is thereby a form of trusting beliefs which are reinforced by perceptions of competence (CAs' competence to effectively achieve the task goal), benevolence (CAs' conveyance that the user's preferences and interests are being pursued), and integrity (CAs' provision of unbiased and honest responses) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. For the purpose of the MASEM approach, we considered the reflective latent variable when coding correlations between trust and other constructs (based on the available correlation data in the majority of studies).</p><p>To further fit the CA context, we adapt the Trust-TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> and incorporate perceived privacy risk into the meta-analytical framework. This is because the findings concerning modern CAs indicate that risk is a considerable factor affecting trusting beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>, with these beliefs being the precondition of the willingness to take risks (i.e. intention to use) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. CAs usually process sensitive and personal data (e.g., health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>) that is ultimately processed on servers hosted by specific service providers who seek to gather large amounts of data to render their AI-based services as effective as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Thus, many users are concerned about their privacy, which affects their confidence in the benevolence of the technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. As a result, perceived privacy risk when using CAs is generally expected to negatively affect users' trust in CAs.</p><p>Our meta-analytic framework serves as a guiding model for the MASEM approach to examine the direct and indirect relationships between the variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research methodology 4.1. Literature selection and coding</head><p>In February 2021, we searched the Scopus, EBSCOhost, and the AIS Electronic Library databases to comprehensively search for published and unpublished literature. The inclusion of unpublished literature, such as working papers and dissertations, helps mitigate the danger of publication bias, which arises from empirical studies with significant results being more likely to be published than those with nonsignificant results <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. The initial database search was conducted by applying the key phrases (((Conversational OR Virtual OR Voice) AND Agent) OR Chatbot OR "Digital Assistant") AND (experiment OR survey OR empirical OR quantitative OR questionnaire) in an article title/abstract/keyword search, yielding in 3,573 hits. After removing 548 duplicates and non-English papers, two researchers independently assessed the relevance of the articles by reading the articles' titles and abstracts. We subsequently examined the full texts to decide whether to include articles.</p><p>To be included in the final sample, an article must (1) be exclusively focused on the role of trust in the adoption of CAs, (2) report quantitative findings on the studied relationships that can be extracted in the coding step, and (3) be written in English. As mentioned above, we included both published and unpublished studies for mitigating publication bias and excluded studies that used the same data set (duplicate studies). In addition, we also excluded studies that do not contain original study data (e.g., editorials and research in progress) and studies, that do not report relevant data (e.g., effect size measures). When relevant data was missing (e.g., no correlations were available), we contacted the authors and asked for the missing data. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we excluded 2,990 articles and identified a total number of 35 relevant articles. We additionally conducted a thorough forward and backward search, which yielded a further 10 relevant articles. Finally, our study sample comprised of 45 articles. 1  For the coding step, we prepared a coding scheme that enables us to systematically collect the research data prior to the data analysis step. The coding scheme contains relevant research information such as study and reviewer ID, authors, publication year, publication type, sample size, and the effect size measures of our research model's variables of interest, as described in Section 3. To ensure objectivity, consistency, and transparency during the coding step, we defined a set of coding rules which contains detailed guidance on how to code the independent and dependent variables and how to resolve conflicting cases. In addition, we assessed interrater reliability throughout the entire literature selection and coding process. This helped avoid selection biases and enhance the consistency of results, with an overall interrater reliability (Cohen's Kappa) of 0.73, which represents a substantial level of agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Meta-analytic structural equation modeling</head><p>The collected data was analyzed in two stages using the MASEM method. In the first stage, the collected 1 A complete overview of all included individual studies is available upon request. correlations of the primary studies are converted into a pooled correlation matrix. In the second stage, this matrix is fitted to the structural research model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. This approach is unique in that, although not all of the primary studies report all of the correlations that we consider in our study, we are still able to create an integrated picture from the single pieces of quantitative data <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. This, in turn, enables us to capture relationships that stem from different models derived from the various theories within our meta-analytic framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. For Stage 1, we adopted a statistical model of random effects. A random effects model stresses a heterogeneous population in which the true effect differs in each primary study. This is because the true effect is often obscured by sampling errors and between-study variances, such as different samples and research designs. The alternative of a fixed-effect model would underline a homogeneous population in which the true effect of the primary studies is only concealed by sampling error <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. We further followed the metaanalytic paradigm of Hedges and Olkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> and did not correct for reliability scores, as this correction procedure (usually conducted in psychometric meta-analyses) does not generally affect the results of MASEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</p><p>In light of the random effects model, we consider within-and between-study variance in the calculation of the correlation vector ri for each study i, so that ri = ρi + ui + ei, where ρi is the correlation matrix, ui the between-study variance matrix, and ei the sampling covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Leveraging the likelihood estimation method, we then calculated the pooled estimates, yielding the correlation matrix 𝑃, its sampling covariance matrix 𝑣, and the between-study heterogeneity 𝑇. These pooled estimates form the data basis for Stage 2, in which we fit the data to our proposed structural research model using the weighted least squares (WLS) method, thereby utilizing the asymptotic variances and covariances as the weight matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. To examine the indirect effects in the structural model, we follow the methodology of Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Following the MASEM procedure, we used the combined data of n = 45 studies, k = 155 correlations, and N = 13,786 observations to calculate pooled correlations in Stage 1. The derived meta-analytical correlations of each bivariate relationship are presented in the lower diagonal of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The resulting relationships range between -.23 (TR-PR) and .63 (PU-IU). All pooled correlations, except some relationships involving PR (PR-PU, PR-PE, PR-IU), are significantly different from zero given that the 95% confidence intervals (CI) do not enclose zero and the Z scores are larger than the respective critical Z scores of 3.29 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. According to Lipsey and Wilson's classification scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>, the correlations involving PR can be classified as small, the correlations concerning TR-IU as medium, and the remaining correlations involving either PU or PE as large. The heterogeneity values indicate a reasonably high dispersion of effects between the studies. This is evident from the Q-test of homogeneity, with a Q-value of 2821.01 (df = 145, p &lt; .01) that exceeds the critical Qvalue on the χ² distribution. Therefore, the null hypothesis, which states that the dispersion of effects is due to sampling error alone, can be rejected. The Q-test of homogeneity supports our underlying assumption of random effects. The heterogeneity between studies can be expressed by τ². However, to obtain a more intelligible value for the proportion of between-study variance to total variance, we added I² to the information in the upper diagonal of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, thereby expressing this proportion of the respective bivariate relationship. The values of I² vary between 71% and 97%.</p></div>

We obtained a good model fit with RMSEA and SRMR &lt;.05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Path analysis (cf. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) of direct effects revealed only significant effects, except for the relationship TR IU (β = .13, p &gt; .05). However, TR has a positive effect on PU (β = .44, p &lt; .001) and is, in turn, positively affected by PE (β = .48, p &lt; .001) and negatively by PR (β = -.21, p &lt; .01). The remaining direct relationships also reveal significant effects with PE PU (β = .35, p &lt; .001), PE IU (β = .19, p &lt; .001), PU IU (β = .44, p &lt; .001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. MASEM Stage 2 -Results</head><p>To advance our understanding of the adoption mechanisms in the nomological network, we tested for indirect effects (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). To this end, we follow the procedure of Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, which starts with establishing the significance of indirect effects. For this purpose, it is particularly advocated to employ the likelihood-based CI method when using MASEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. Significance regarding the indirect effects in the can be derived from the 95% likelihood-based CIs, ranging in the positive value range <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. The results indicate that PU is fully mediating the effect of TR on IU, as the direct relationship TR IU is non-significant. In contrast, the effect of PE on PU is partially (complementary) mediated by TR due to the significant direct effect PE PU. Another partial (complementary) mediation involves the relationship PE PU IU <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. The total effect indicates that PU is the most important determinant of the IU, followed by PE and TR. However, TR plays a key role in strengthening PU in the nomological network. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>By synthesizing the results of 45 CA studies, including 155 correlations and 13,786 empirical observations, through a MASEM approach, we contribute to enhancing the understanding of how trusting beliefs affect the adoption mechanisms of CAs.</p><p>We adapted the Trust-TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref> as a meta-analytic framework that merges the trust perspective with the TAM's technological perceptions of CAs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Implications for research and practice</head><p>MF1: Our results reveal that trust only indirectly affects the usage intentions of CAs via perceived usefulness. When users place trusting beliefs in a technology such as a CA, they perceive this technology as being useful. Users' perceptions that the technology is helpful for completing their task, in turn, strongly affect their intention to use, as is revealed by the TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. The meta-analytical results of our study support the notion in the literature that several usage contexts do not demand trust in technology. For example, Pitardi and Marriot <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> argue that trust in CAs is unnecessary because they are primarily used for simple tasks (e.g., for smart home applications such as turning lights on and off). However, in higher-risk settings, such as insurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, results from primary studies suggest small but direct effects, as the stakes are higher for the user. Trust has been emphasized as being highly context sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> and anecdotal evidence has indicated that user behavior varies depending on whether IT is applied in a utilitarian or hedonic context <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Three major IRs arise from MF1. First, more research is required to effectively comprehend the role of trust in affecting the intention to use CAs in different contexts and domains. Our literature search has revealed that the number of primary studies is currently insufficient for an extended meta-analytic context analysis per domain; for example, in health, insurance, and home contexts (IR1). Second, given the heterogeneity among individual CA studies, future meta-analyses should address the moderating effects of the application context to gain deeper insights into usage contexts in which trust is somewhat salient depending on the availability of sufficient primary CA studies (IR2). Third, scholars and practitioners should focus on promoting and emphasizing the system's usefulness when designing and introducing CAs (IR/IP3). As implied by MF1, the usefulness of CAs plays a crucial role in affecting the adoption intention. Thus, in addition to the highlighted role of trust in conceptualizing the benevolence, competence, and integrity level of CAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>, the usefulness of the technology must be addressed to enhance the adoption intention in the IT field. In this context, Rodríguez Cardona et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> recommend a "trade-off between practical use and trust," since the willingness to interact with a CA corresponds directly to the importance for a user of the use case. Thus, CA developers should direct their attention to improving the system's functionality by validating CA designs, assessing the effectiveness of task fulfillment, and conducting technology acceptance questionnaires to improve the user experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, thereby increasing the transfer of trustworthiness.</p><p>MF2: Contrary to the studies indicating that perceived ease of use has no effect on CA adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>, our integrated results provide evidence of a direct relationship between these variables. Moreover, we observed a strong direct impact of the perceived ease of use on trust, indicating that users tend to place trust in CAs that are perceived as easy to use. Perceived ease of use describes the perception of the effort required to use CAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Various studies have demonstrated that specific design elements can reduce effort in interacting with CAs, and thus increase usage satisfaction. For example, elements such as auto suggestion buttons can be integrated into text-based interfaces to reduce typing effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> In the case of voice assistants, predefined response options can guide the user through dialog <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Thus, MF2 implies that system designers should integrate functional and design elements into the user interface that help to improve the usability of the technology when designing CAs (IP.2.1).</p><p>Moreover, technological humanness is an issue that deserves more attention in CA research when studying the relationship between perceived ease of use, trust, and CA usage intentions. Technological humanness has recently emerged as a potent field of research that focuses on human-like design elements for CAs that render the human-computer interaction more natural and thus more effortless <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>. A comprehensive meta-analysis conducted by Blut et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> suggests that perceived ease of use acts as an operating mechanism of anthropomorphic design elements and mediates their effects on the intention to use CAs. Therefore, our metaanalytic framework nurtures the integration of further perspectives, such as the uncanny valley theory or the social presence theory, to explore the role of human-like aspects of CAs in building trusting beliefs and enhancing usage intentions in different contexts. This would contribute to extending the relational trust perspective and the usability aspects of the TAM (IR2.2).</p><p>Prior studies have provided evidence for the major role of social presence as an important determinant of trust when interacting with CAs, such as Alexa <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53]</ref>. However, anecdotal evidence has also suggested that the impact of human-like characteristics depends on specific contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. In particular, the human-like characteristics of a technology are considered helpful in building trust when the system is intended to be used as a surrogate for a human, whereas they are not helpful when the system is intended to replace a machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. Future meta-analyses should elaborate on this aspect by integrating the humanness level of CAs and usage contexts as further moderator variables (IR2.3). Deeper insights into usage contexts in which a particular level of humanness is required to generate trust would help system designers design trustworthy CAs and to increase usage intentions. For example, there is an interesting question to be answered regarding which level of humanness is necessary in which usage contexts.</p><p>MF3: Apart from the impact of ease of use on trust and use intention, results indicate that the effects of an effortless engagement with CAs on adoption intentions are indirectly transmitted through the perceived usefulness, and its effects on perceived usefulness are mediated through trust. This suggests that "even when the design of a [CA] is simple, clear, understandable and easy to learn, if the operational outcomes and expected benefits do not match the user's cognitive trust expectations, the [CA] will not contribute to optimize the customer experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Thus, perceived ease of use acts as a strong enabler of trustworthiness and perceived usefulness. However, perceived usefulness is ultimately the critical determinant that drives adoption. Hence, aside from the implications derived from MF2 (IP2.1/IR2.2/IR2.3) and, in line with suggestions from recent CA studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, we recommend developers adhere to effectiveness-enhancing design principles that ensure a goal-oriented, unambiguous conversational flow that takes into account confirmation and errorhandling strategies (IR/IP3).</p><p>MF4: While privacy risk is not a part of the original Trust-TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>, we included the construct in our meta-analytical framework, as prior studies frequently highlight privacy concerns that arise from the use of CAs and empirically confirm the negative effect of privacy risk on trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>. Our meta-analytical analysis confirms the inhibiting role on trust in CAs.</p><p>Although data protection laws have been tightened in regions such as Europe following the GDPR, users are still reluctant to entrust their data to CAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Legislatures must continue seeking ways to protect users' data and privacy regardless of where the servers are located (IP4.1). However, an excessive level of data protection restricts the capabilities of AI, necessitating a balance between privacy protection (e.g., pseudonymization, cyber security measures), legal requirements, and the use of data in leveraging the technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to legislative differences, privacy risks need to be assessed against the background of cultural diversity. Cultures, such as those in the Asian region, tend to exhibit more optimistic attitudes toward AI compared to cultures, such as those in the European region, which tend to be more averse to new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>. Future meta-analysis should incorporate such moderating influences when assessing the impact of privacy-risk effects on usage intentions (IR4.2). A deeper understanding of the circumstances under which cultural diversity accounts for differing risk perceptions would help system developers and managers design and establish country-specific levels of data protection.</p><p>Furthermore, Pitardi and Marriott <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> argue that the level of privacy concern may depend on whether the user perceives the CA as a standalone entity or as the provider behind the CA (e.g., Amazon behind Alexa). This perspective stems from conceptual differences between trust in the technology and trust in the provider <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. In the latter, the trustee is no longer the technological artifact, but the vendor managing the technology and the data. Thus, the trust level can vary significantly between these perspectives and can cause between-study variances <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Söllner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> argue that multiple targets of trust relationships matter to understanding adoption behavior regarding a technology. Therefore, we propose that future studies further explore institution-based trust in the context of privacy concerns to compare trust levels in different trust targets (IR4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Limitations</head><p>The applied methodological approach is not free of limitations. As with any meta-analytic approach, there is the issue of the "apples and oranges" problem that challenges the validity of results. This is because the approach incorporates different research results, measures and variables with varying research designs and populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. Since the purpose of metaanalysis is to synthesize research findings, the key is to find the appropriate scope of synthesis. We followed the recommended guidelines and set a specific research focus within the CA-adoption literature and identified the appropriate samples through a systematic literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. In doing so, we ensured that we are "combining apples and oranges to understand something about fruit [which] may make more sense than combining fruit and humans to understand something about organic matter" <ref type="bibr">[58:20]</ref>.</p><p>Another limitation concerns heterogeneity, which suggests moderator effects. We did not perform a moderator analysis primarily because of the unavailability of sufficient primary studies. Moderator analysis in MASEM approaches requires a larger number of studies because grouping (e.g., contextual moderator analysis regarding utilitarian and hedonistic application domains) divides the sample size into smaller subgroups for MASEM analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Future research should, first, continue to conduct primary research in different contexts and, second, examine meta-analytic moderator influences with an expanded sample.</p><p>Finally, we would stress that the studied form of trust is trusting beliefs, which is distinct from trusting intentions and trusting behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. This studied form of trust is often used synonymously with trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. These trust distinctions and terminologies are often vague and not clearly defined in the examined IS literature. Future research should pay attention to the distinction and the terminology of different trust forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>By placing the focus on CAs, we revisited the Trust-TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>, and undertook an integrated examination of the adoption mechanisms of modern voice-and text-based agents. Using the MASEM approach, we investigated how trust simultaneously interacts with perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived privacy to influence intentions to use CAs. Our findings demonstrated that trust does not directly influence usage intentions, but instead unfolds fully via perceived usefulness. Nevertheless, trust occupies a multifaceted role as a mediator that transfers the effects of perceived ease of use to perceived usefulness. Trust also functions as an interceptor of the inhibiting effects of perceived privacy risks. In addition, our results indicated that the most important criteria concerning adoption intentions are the perceived usefulness of CAs in automating tasks or achieving a specific goal, and the perceived ease of use through natural language.</p><p>With these insights into a variety of different CAs, use cases, and populations, we were able to contribute to a deeper understanding of the principal trust-building mechanism within the Trust-TAM and aid future theory building. This enhanced understanding helps scholars to identify future research opportunities and practitioners to direct their attention toward issues that are useful in designing trustworthy CAs. In essence, we were able to indicate that building trustworthy CAs is amplified by their ability to improve users' effectiveness and productivity. With this meta-analysis study, we were able to offer a holistic and consistent understanding of trust in and adoption of conversational agents based on prior CA studies from an emerging and dynamic research field.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>diagonal: average correlation of bivariate relationship; n = number of studies; significance: **p &lt; 0.001, *p &lt; 0.01, n. s. = not significant.
