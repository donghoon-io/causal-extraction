<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the years, the prevailing paradigm to improve individual and financial family wellbeing has been fixated on teaching financial education and providing financial information. The assumption in academic institutions and training centers for practitioners was that financial education and financial information were the first steps leading to general consumer 1 Afyon Kocatepe Üniversitesi, Fen-Edebiyat Fakültesi, ssaracli@aku.edu.tr, Orcid ID: <ref type="url" target="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4662-8031">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4662-8031</ref> 2 Big Cat Research, İstanbul, Turkey, murat@bigcatresearch.com, Orcid ID: <ref type="url" target="https://orcid.org/0000-">https://orcid.org/0000-</ref> <ref type="bibr">0002-1982-4849</ref> empowerment.

This conventional assumption was challenged by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">McGregor (2005)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(Delgadillo, 2014: 16)</ref>. Financial literacy is an issue which concerns all sections of society, thus also Y generation. The component parts of financial literacy can be discussed in the framework of financial knowledge, financial attitude and financial behavior. In this context, the main goal of this study is to examine the financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviors which plays an important role on the Y generation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) Y Generation (1980-1999):</head><p>Members of this generation composed of individuals born between 1980-1999, is a generation that has to work for living. In their lives, technology is the symbol of many things. They are narcissi, individual and entrepreneur. This generation, which does not like to work, loves entertainment and winning, acts aggressive to authority, consumes fast and has dissatisfied manner. Their most important characteristics are freedom and technology. Basic specifications of Y generation are their ability to use technology and loneliness. One other characteristics of this generation is self-confidence <ref type="bibr">(Çelik and Arslan Gürcüoğlu, 2016: 119)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, y belt is not easy to satisfy, eager to take responsibility, comfortable, comfortable in the face of high authority is expressed in the form of discomfort, y belt is the weakest points of concentration and time management can't be stated <ref type="bibr">(Baltaş, 2011: 54)</ref>.</p><p>The Y generation is able to do several jobs simultaneously, and if their employees are well managed, they become a rich source of talent. They want to take the time to develop these relationships and socialize <ref type="bibr">(Lovely and Buffum, 2007: 67)</ref>.</p><p>It is known that they are not too patient because they do not know the economic difficulties of Generation Y. This is the biggest disadvantage of the Y belt. Y belt is the most loyal follower of children's advertising world. Because the group literally has a consumer spirit. On the other hand, this generation of Brand Passion is much more than the other generations. They can even influence and direct their families that allow them to grow up like this. Individual demands are not limited and represent an important market segment for producers who realize this demand <ref type="bibr">(Holtzhausen, 2006: 315)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Carter (2008: 62)</ref> states that Generation Y is one of the most important generations for marketers as its members have strong ideas at an early age.</p><p>The Y generation, which shows different characteristic characteristics through birth periods and social cultural or technological events overlapped by these dates, carries the traces of its own period like other generations and is influenced by the unique structure of its time. People exhibit different purchasing behaviors as a result of their different wishes, habits and experiences. Each generation takes into account the likes of its own generation and is influenced by trends that are considered fashion. For this reason, marketing theorists have been able to divide the larger market into smaller chapters in order to identify and reach their target customers. One of these divisions is the method of separating people according to their ages <ref type="bibr">(Behrstock and Coggshall, 2010: 31)</ref>.</p><p>Marketers who can divide people according to their generations produce goods and services that will address these generations as a market segment based on the characteristics of these generations and form the marketing mix for the product accordingly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Sample and Scale</head><p>In this study, to collect the data set, Klontz Money Behavior inventory(Klontzet al, 2012:33) is translated and adapted to Likert scale type questionnaire, ranging from 1 'strongly disagree' to 5 'strongly agree' and it is applied to 372 individuals via Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) on Pollyfy application. To analyze the data, SPSS and LISREL software are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Exploratory Factor Analysis</head><p>Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is used when a researcher wants to discover the number of factors influencing variables and to analyze which variables 'go together'. A basic hypothesis of EFA is that there are common 'latent' factors to be discovered in the dataset, and the goal is to find the smallest number of common factors that will account for the correlations.Another way to look at factor analysis is to call the dependent variables 'surface attributes' and the underlying structures (factors) 'internal attributes' <ref type="bibr">(Tucker and MacCallum, 1997: 172)</ref>. Common factors are those that affect more than one of the surface attributes and specific factors are those which only affect a particular variable <ref type="bibr">(Yong and Pearce, 2013: 80)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) offers a means of developing and evaluating ideas about complex (multivariate) relationships. It is this property that makes SEM of interest to the practitioner of science <ref type="bibr">(Grace, 2006:4)</ref>. SEM represents the hybrid of two separate statistical traditions. The first tradition is factor analysis developed in the disciplines of psychology and psychometrics. The second tradition is simultaneous equation modeling developed mainly in econometrics, but having an early history in the field of genetics <ref type="bibr">(Kırmızı, 2008:89-90)</ref>.SEM techniques provide us with excellent tools for conducting preliminary evaluation of differential validity and reliability of measurement instruments among a comprehensive selection of population groups <ref type="bibr">(Raines-Eudy, 2000: 124)</ref>.</p></div>

EFA results and Cronbach's α values for the factors financial behavior and financial attitudes</p><p>As it can be seen from Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, according to the results of explanatory factor analysis, the items of the scale formed in two factors which we renamed them as Financial Attitude (FA) and Financial Behaviors (FB). The eigenvalues, variance explanation ratios of factors and the factor loadings of each item is also given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. The total variance explanation ratio of these two factors is calculated as 57.81.</p><p>Within the Financial Attitudes of Y generation, the item: FA4 "I have an emergency fund" has the greatest loading as 0.772. For the Financial Behaviors of this generation, FB1 "Financial issues do not confuse or depress me" has been found the most effective item with the loading of 0.779.</p></div>

For this model χ2 /df is obtained as 222.59/86 = 2.588 that means the model is statistically significant.</p><p>When we examine the most important variable on Financial Attitude, the item; "I have an emergency fund" is found the most effective one with the coefficient of 0.75.</p><p>The results also indicated that on the Financial Behaviors of Y generation, the most important variables are "I am securing my financial future" and "My financial behaviors are consistent with my values, goals and dreams." with the coefficient of 0.76. It can also be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> that the attitudes of Y generation has a positive and big effect on their financial behaviors with the coefficient of 0.84.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>Financial health is one of the most important terms for people to feel and behave better in daily life. As in the past it has been observed from many studies, people's behaviors have a great correlation with their financial situation.</p><p>Besides by the changing world, peoples (new generations) behaviors are also changing. In this study which we examined the relation between the financial attitudes and behaviors of Y generation, the results indicate that there is a positive and great correlation between these two terms.</p><p>On the other hand, for the financial behaviors of Y generation the most effective factors are found as: handling with a major unexpected expense, being aware of the current financial situation and knowing himself for not being confused.</p><p>Being in a good position from the financial health is very important for Y generation especially in our country in recent years. As a result of this study it can be recommended to the individuals of Y generation to be much healthy from the financial side of the life is that;</p><p>Having a monthly spending plan and obeying this plan and having a little emergency fund for the unexpected expenses, being aware of his/her current financial situation and being consistent with their goals are the most important factors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
