<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Pregnancy and childbirth may provoke various emotional responses in expectant fathers including excessive fear of childbirth. It is not unreasonable to assume that fear of contracting the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic, may have intensi ed fathers' fear of childbirth. This study aims to determine the mediating role of the expectant mothers' fear of childbirth in the relationship between expectant fathers' fear of COVID-19 and their fear of childbirth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted on 270 pregnant women and their spouses attending health centers from Aug 2021 to April 2022. Fathers' fear of childbirth scale (FFCS), Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A), and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were used to collect data. To examine the relationships between variables and to develop the nal model, we used the structural equation model (SEM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The prevalence of severe fear of childbirth in fathers and their female spouses were 40.9% and 22.4%, respectively. The mean score and standard deviation of fear of childbirth in the fathers and their female spouses were 49.2±17.1 and 62.5±29.4, respectively. Results showed that fathers' fear of COVID-19 was directly (B=0.44, p=0.004) and indirectly (B=0.13, p=0.015) associated with fathers' fear of childbirth. Also, women's fear of childbirth was positively associated with fathers' fear of childbirth (B=0.45, p=0.030). In the nal model, the values of χ2/df, CFI, PCFI, RMSEA, and SRMR were equal to 2.32, 0.94, 0.76, 0.07, and 0.06, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The ndings of the present study indicate that mothers' fear of childbirth has a mediating role in the relationship between fathers' fear of COVID and fear of childbirth. Therefore, to alleviate fathers' fear of childbirth, interventions to reduce fathers' fear of COVID-19 and women's fear of childbirth should be developed and implemented. The impact of fathers' mental health on the fear of childbirth in expectant couples should be further investigated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Pregnancy and childbirth may lead to different emotional responses in fathers. Some men may experience excessive worry, anxiety, stress and fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The most commonly observed paternal fears are concerns for the health and life of the baby and the partner and the competence and behavior of health professionals <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Approximately 13% of fathers experience severe fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>As a result of gendered behavioral norms <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, men usually hide their experience of fear of childbirth. This makes an accurate assessment of the extent of the problem di cult <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>According to the results of several studies, a number of factors have been found to be correlated with fathers' fear of childbirth. Fathers waiting for their partner's rst baby, those not very sanguine about the prospects of having a new child <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, those who are low income-earners, those suffering from anxiety and depression, and those not receiving adequate communal support are usually confronted with fears and worries related to childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Fear of childbirth is a signi cant and distressing experience for expectant fathers and may have poor consequences for the mental and physical health of fathers as well as their families <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. It may affect couple relationships and father's ability to support their spouses. Fathers with a severe fear of childbirth may experience an unpleasant feeling about pregnancy and childbirth <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. They may appraise the pregnancy, birth and the approaching parenthood with more di culties. They may also less often attend antenatal classes and may prefer a cesarean <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, even in developed countries, the quality and the extent of perinatal services for fathers are not considered to be adequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Whether they have been involved in childbirth or not, fathers feel that they do not have su cient knowledge about childbirth and are not adequately prepared for it <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. Men becoming a father for the rst time are usually eager to participate in the preparatory activities for childbirth and transition to parenthood. They expressed a need for support but they felt they were being excluded by health professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, due to gendered behavioral norms <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, men nd it di cult to talk about their worries, and this may be the reason behind perceived lack of social support.</p><p>Being reluctant to speak about their worries and not receiving support from others may intensify their fears. Antenatal classes speci cally for fathers with the aim of preparing them for childbirth has been recommended. These courses would reduce their worries and support the fatherhood process <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> but unfortunately, research in the eld of fathers' fear of childbirth is limited. Antenatal education has been recommended with the aim of enhancing fathers' childbirth-related self-e cacy and thereby reducing their fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Expectations of Iranian women regarding the role of the father in providing care and support before birth and during labor and delivery has evolved to become similar to those of western women <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These expectations may affect fathers' emotional involvement in pregnancy and birth events. In western countries men nowadays often attend the delivery of their own child. Childbirth positive emotions are reported to be predominant among these men <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. But in a country like Iran, where men are not allowed to attend at birth, they may experience anxiety and worry regarding childbirth because their information about birth is limited to media and their close relatives and spouse. The accuracy and usefulness of these ideas and information are often overestimated. In fact, professional support for fathers during their transition to parenthood is almost non-existent.</p><p>The outbreak of COVID-19 caused fear and anxiety among the public. There was great concern about contracting COVID - 19 among pregnant women and their family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The adverse effects of the pandemic with regard to mental and emotional state of pregnant women and their increased fear of childbirth have been noted in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. These fears and worries may in turn affect fathers' mental health and increase their fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>A number of studies have found that most fathers kept their fears to themselves and did not communicate with their spouses, friends or relatives about them <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. They were afraid they might transmit their worries to their spouses and thereby generate and increase their fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>However, an expectant father may express his fear of COVID-19 through non-verbal means such as an obsession with washing hands, excessive COVID-19 cleanliness, and wearing a mask <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. People in close relationships, such as married couples will easily understand each other's emotions and fears. So, one spouse's fear of COVID-19 may impact the other's fear.</p><p>Understanding potential factors related to fathers' fear of childbirth is of paramount importance to designing effective antenatal care especially during crisis situations. Whereas an extensive body of research has examined factors associated with women's fear of childbirth, much less attention has been paid to fathers' fear of childbirth. We hypothesize that fathers' fear of COVID-19 may directly and indirectly in uence fathers' fear of childbirth. Hence, this study aims to determine the mediating role of the expectant mothers' fear of childbirth in the relationship between expectant fathers' fear of COVID-19 and their fear of childbirth using a structural equation modelling approach. We believe that investigating factors relieving/intensifying the expectant fathers' fear of childbirth is useful and important in preparing couples for birth and parenthood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design, settings, and sampling</head><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted on 270 pregnant women and their spouses attending eight health centers under the supervision of Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences. Sampling was done from Aug 2021 to April 2022. The inclusion criteria were age higher than 16, reading ability, gestational age higher than 13 weeks, expecting a singleton healthy fetus, and consent to take part in the study.</p><p>Participants with psychiatric disorders undergoing treatment were excluded along with their spouses. In determining the sample size in the structural equation model, the number of items in the scale measuring the dependent variable is the main factor. Usually, 5 to 20 sample cases per item of the scale is regarded as acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. The father's fear of childbirth scale includes 17 items. Having 14 cases per item would imply a sample size of 240.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>We selected two health centers in each of the four regions of the city using a randomized strati ed sampling method. In this way, 8 centers were selected from a total of 16 in the city and the questionnaires were distributed in these centers. In each center, midwives recruited all eligible couples who attended the clinic and who consented to take part in the study. The midwives were instructed on how to perform the sampling. Overall 246 couples accepted to participate in the study. After signing an informed consent form, they lled out the questionnaires. Because of gendered behavioral norms which may result in the reluctance of men to talk about their fears <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and to offset this probable source of bias, we asked the fathers to ll out the questionnaires truthfully and promised them that their information would remain con dential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>Fathers' fear of childbirth scale (FFCS) Fathers' fear of childbirth scale (FFCS) was developed in 2021 in Iran to measure expectant fathers' fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. It contains 17 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I don't agree at all) to 5 (I completely agree). The scale's total score ranges from 17 to 85 [low <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr">(35)</ref>, moderate (36-54), high (≥ 55)]. It consists of two factors: fear of childbirth process (12 items) and fear of hospital ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>items). The two factors accounted for 50.82% of the total variance of the FFCS. The internal consistencies of both factors measured by Cronbach's alpha coe cient were greater than 0.70. The construct validity of the scale was perfectly con rmed for the two factor model (IFI = 0.919, CFI = 0.918, AGFI = 0.824, PNFI = 0.707, PCFI = 0.742, RMSEA = 0.083, CMIN/DF = 2.615) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In our study, we calculated a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.942 for the FFCS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaires (W-DEQ-A)</head><p>The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A) was developed by Wijma, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to measure a woman's prenatal perception of childbirth and her expectancy. It contains 33 items that are rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (extremely) to 5 (not at all). The minimum and the maximum total scores of the questionnaire are 0 and 165, respectively, with higher scores indicating higher levels of fear. Validity and reliability of the scales were con rmed during the scale's development process. The internal consistency of the scale was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93). The validity of the scale was con rmed by moderate correlations between the scale and other psychological instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The W-DEQ was translated into Persian. The Persian W-DEQ which consists of six factors, showed moderate correlation with the Childbirth Attitude Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The Cronbach's alpha coe cients of the scale and its factors were in the acceptable range (between 0.633 and 0.919) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In our study, we calculated a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.940 for the W-DEQ-A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S)</head><p>The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is one of the most widely used scales for assessing fear of COVID-19. It was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ahorsu et al. (2020)</ref> for the purpose of assessing fear of COVID-19. The scale was translated into Persian and the validity study for the scale was conducted using a sample of Iranian students <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. It is a unidimensional instrument consisting of 7 items rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 to 5 points). The total score ranges from 7 to 35 with higher scores indicating a higher level of fear of COVID-19. A Cronbach's alpha value of 0.88 was reported in the original study on the scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In our study, we calculated a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.886.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analyses</head><p>Data analysis was performed by SPSS v. 18 and Amos 24. Descriptive statistics were used for describing the characteristics of the participants. Normal distribution of the scales' scores was con rmed using skewness or kurtosis. An Alpha Cronbach coe cient was used to investigate the reliability of the scales.</p><p>To examine the relationships between variables and to develop the nal model, we used the structure equation model (SEM). We developed a hypothetical model using three concepts from previous literature reviews: expectant fathers' fear of childbirth and fear of COVID-19, and expectant mothers' fear of childbirth. The dependent variable was expectant fathers' fear of childbirth, the independent variables were the fathers' fear of COVID-19, and expectant mothers' fear of childbirth. We used maximum likelihood (ML) approach to determine values for the parameters of the model. We used the following goodness-of-t indices to assess the model t: 𝛘2/df with acceptable range of 1-5, CFI &gt; 0.90, PCFI &gt; 0.50, SRMR &lt; 0.10, RMSEA (0.05-0.08) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical considerations</head><p>We asked the couples who had verbally consented to participate in the study and had signed an informed consent form to ll out the questionnaires truthfully and promised them that their information would remain con dential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Out of 270 couples, 24 couples did not consent to participate in the study due to time constraint (response rate of 88.8%). After entering data into the SPSS le, nine questionnaires were removed because of incompleteness. Missing data in the scales and the subscales were substituted with the mean values of scores in each scale or subscale for each participant. The SPSS software was used for this purpose and missing data substitution was done only in cases where 20% or a lesser proportion of the data were missing in a scale. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> contains the characteristics of participants taking part in the study.</p><p>The mean and standard deviation of men's age and education were 31.7 ± 6.1 and 12.4 ± 4.0 years, respectively. The average gestational age of women was 26.7 ± 8.5 weeks. Women who were primigravida comprised 55.3% of the sample. Severe fear of childbirth was reported by 22.4% of the women. The prevalence of low, moderate, and severe fear of childbirth in fathers was 24.1%%, 35.0%, and 40.9%, respectively. The mean score and standard deviation of the fathers' and mothers' fear of childbirth were 49.2 ± 17.1 and 62.5 ± 29.4, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the model is acceptable (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>).  In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, the nal results including total, direct, and indirect standardized effects using SEM model are presented. Results showed that fathers' fear of COVID-19 (measured by FCV-19S) was directly (B = 0.44, p = 0.004) and indirectly (B = 0.13, p = 0.015) associated with fathers' fear of childbirth. Moreover, women's fear of childbirth (measured by W-DEQ) had positive effects on fathers' fear of childbirth (B = 0.45, p = 0.030). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We hypothesized that fathers' fear of COVID-19 may directly and indirectly in uence fathers' fear of childbirth. Our results showed that fathers' fear of COVID was directly and indirectly associated with fathers' fear of childbirth. be more precise, father's fear of COVID, in addition to affecting his own fear of childbirth directly, mother's fear of childbirth which in turn increases father's fear of childbirth. In other words, women's fear childbirth plays a mediating role in the relationship between fathers' fear of COVID fathers' fear of childbirth. Results of a study on pregnant women showed that of COVID-19 played a mediating in the relationship between perceived stress and fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Findings of a qualitative study on 20 fathers in the UK indicate that the pandemic-related maternity restrictions had undesirable consequences on paternal childbirth experience <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Our results indicate that women's fear of childbirth is directly associated with fathers' fear of childbirth. Therefore, interventions to reduce women's fear of childbirth may alleviate fathers' fear of childbirth. This result is in agreement with the result of a study on 502 expectant Iranian fathers and their wives which found that mother's fear of childbirth affected father's fear of childbirth in both direct and indirect ways. In the indirect chain of causation, mother's fear of childbirth increased paternal depression, anxiety, and stress and thus led to higher levels of paternal fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Our ndings agree with other studies that have shown that the mental health of spouses is interdependent <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>. This implies that, improvements in the mental state of each of the spouses is bene cial to the other and this mutual interaction would lead to an enhanced and satisfying childbirth experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>. Men usually do not have access to reliable information about pregnancy and childbirth and as a result their spouse is their main source information on such matters. This may explain the direct impact of the women's fear of childbirth on their spouses <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Because expectant fathers' attendance in prenatal preparation classes could lessen their spouses' fear of childbirth, programs developed to enhance and improve couples health should as far as possible be carried out in pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>According to our results the prevalence of severe fear of childbirth in fathers was 40.9% which is comparable with the ndings of an Iranian study which used the same tool to measure fathers' fear of childbirth and found a prevalence of 42.23% <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In a study in Turkey, 54.3% of fathers' had fear of childbirth <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. The prevalence of severe fear of childbirth in Swedish fathers was reported to be 13% <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. The difference between our results and the results of the Swedish study may be due to different instruments used to measure expectant fathers' fear of childbirth and also the very different sociocultural environments. The high prevalence of severe fear of childbirth in Iranian expectant fathers found by our study and a previous one means that fathers' fear of childbirth is a national health concern that needs to be addressed. The mean score and standard deviation of the father's and mother's fear of childbirth were 49.2 ± 17.1 and 62.5 ± 29.4, respectively. These results are comparable with those reported in a previous study in Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (50.11 ± 13.65) and (58.11 ± 24.32).</p><p>Our sample comprised only men who accompanied their wives to health centers. This group of men may have been more supportive partners with better marital relationship with their spouses than those who did not attend the health centers. Therefore, our results cannot be generalized to all fathers. We recommend that future studies be conducted in maternity hospitals where most fathers accompany their wives and wait for the birth of their baby. Those fathers may experience higher levels of fear and anxiety during labor and birth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and strength</head><p>The rst limitation of this study is we used self-reporting questionnaires which are generally considered less reliable compared to clinical ndings. second limitation is that fathers nd it di cult to express their fear because of gendered behavioral norms which may result in the reluctance of men to talk about their fears <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> especially in a conventional society such as Iran. However, to offset this likely source of bias, we emphasized to the fathers that they should ll out the questionnaires truthfully. We used a convenience sampling technique which may limit the external validity of the study.</p><p>Most of the studies in the eld of fathers' fear of childbirth are qualitative. The strong point of the present study is that it is a quantitative study. Also by using SEM analysis, we could determine the simultaneous effect of several variables on the dependent variable. This approach can detect latent variables which are not directly observable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The aim this study was to determine the mediating role of the expectant mothers' fear of childbirth in the relationship between expectant fathers' fear of COVID-19 and their fear of childbirth using the structural equation modeling approach. Results indicate that women's fear of childbirth has a mediating role in the relationship between fathers' fear of COVID and fear of childbirth. This implies that fathers may pass on their fear of COVID-19 to their wives and increase their fear of childbirth. This heightened fear can in turn be transmitted back to fathers and increase their level of childbirth fear. Therefore, to alleviate fathers' fear of childbirth, fathers' fear of COVID-19 and women's fear of childbirth should be reduced. Healthcare workers through their emotional and professional support could contribute to fathers having a more positive and satisfying experience of childbirth and transition to parenthood especially during di cult and stressful periods like the pandemic. The impact of fathers' fears, anxieties and worries on expectant fathers' and their spouses' fear of childbirth should be further investigated. </p></div>
