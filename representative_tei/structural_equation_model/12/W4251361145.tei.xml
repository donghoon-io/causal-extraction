<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is a valid indicator for kidney function, both in healthy and diseased people. Different factors can affect GFR. The purpose of this study is to assess a causal model to show direct and indirect effects of GFR-related factors using structural equation modeling. Patients and methods : We analyzed data from recruitment phase of Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease cohort study.</p><p>Data on socio-behavioral, nutritional, cardiovascular, and metabolic risk factors were entered in a conceptual model in order to test direct and indirect effects of the associated factors on GFR, separately in male and female, using the structural equation modeling. Results : Of 8927 individuals participated in this study, 4212 subjects were male (47.2%) and 4715 subjects were female (52.8%). The obtained standard deviation of GFR was 76.05 (±14.3) per 1.73 . Filtration rate for 11.52%, 72.96% and 15.50% of people were &lt;60, and , respectively. Hypertension in both gender and atherogenic factor in male directly, and in female directly and indirectly had a decreasing effect on GFR. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and smoking in male and female, directly or indirectly through other variables, was associated with a decrease in GFR. In female, diabetes had a decreasing direct and indirect effect on GFR. Obesity in female was directly associated with increasing and indirectly associated with decreasing ltration. Conclusion : According to our results, increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and high blood lipids, and BUN had a decreasing direct and indirect effects on GFR. Although low GFR might have different reasons and it is not a consistent sign of CKD, our ndings, in line with other reports, provide more detailed informations about important risk factors of low GFR. Public awareness about such factors can improve public practice of positive health behaviours.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high rates of mortality and cardiovascular complications. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is a valid indicator for kidney function, both in healthy and diseased people <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In 2013, reduced GFR resulted in 4% or 2.2 millions of deaths in the world, more than half of which caused by cardiovascular (1.2 million people) and end-stage renal diseases (ESRD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> The results of clinical trials have shown that decreased GFR is an independent risk factor for all causes of deaths and adverse cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. There are also strong evidences suggesting that development and progression of CKD has caused by risk factors for cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. These risk factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> According to the literature, known risk factors for CKD development and progression include: age, Diabetes Mellitus (DM), high blood pressure, obesity, dyslipidemia, and smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the results of previous studies, GFR depends on several factors and associated factors can directly and indirectly effect on GFR. One of methods for assessing of direct and indirect effects of relevant factors on GFR using a conceptual model is Structural Equation Model (SEM). SEM, as a multivariate statistical model, is powerful method for simultaneous analysis of complex relationships between observed and latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. SEM is a combination of path analysis and factor analysis and it can test a model with several dependent variables simultaneously affected by several independent variables, directly and indirectly <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Aim of this study is to use SEM to assess the conceptual pathways and identify the most important risk factors associated with GFR in the subjects aged between 35 and 65 years, in the cohort study of Ravansar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Participants</head><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted based on baseline phase for Ravansar Non Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort study, in the west region of Iran. RaNCD cohort study which is a part of a nationwide Prospective Epidemiological Research Study in IrAN (PERSIAN) conducted amongadults aged&gt; = 35. More information are available at the cohort protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>Anthropometric indices were determined by bioelectric impedance device. The subjects' heights were measured by a stadiometer with an accuracy of 1 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by squared height (m). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> Percent Body Fat (PBF) was classi ed to 5 groups: 5-10 (Essential Fat), 11-14 (Athletes), 15-20 (Fitness), 21-24 (Average), and 24&gt; (Obese) for male and 8-15 (Essential Fat), 16-23 (Athletes), 24-30 (Fitness), 31-36 (Average), and 37&gt; (Obese) for female. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> According to the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) on diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults (Adult Treatment Panel III), Waist to Hip ratio (WHR) ≥0.90 cm in female and ≥0.85 cm in men were classi ed as abnormal <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. According to guidelines of International Kidney Foundation, CKD is de ned as renal abnormalities or GFR&lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (1.0 ml/s/1.73m2) present for more than three months. Renal abnormalities can be diagnosed by pathologic disorders or markers of dysfunction, including abnormalities in blood or urine test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> In this study, Modi cation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was used for estimating GFR from age, sex, and creatinine level: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> GFR = 1.86 × (SCr (-1.154) )× (Age (-0.203) ) × (0.742 if Female)</p><p>To describe the subjects, GFR was categorized into 3 groups of &gt;90, 60-90, and &lt;90 ml/min/1.73 m2. To analyze the structural part, GFR was used as quantitative variable in the model. Blood pressure was measured after 15 min. of rest twice in the right arm and twice in the left using a sphygmomanometer (Riester Duplex 1948, Germany); The mean value of the two measurements was taken as the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Given the criteria recommended by the Eighth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-8), people with systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and/or a history of taking blood pressure-controlling medications were classi ed as hypertension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> Diabetes Mellitus (DM) was de ned based on the American Diabetes Association's criteria for Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) ≤126 Mg /dl and/or patients who use insulin and/or glucose-lowering agents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> Smoking was introduced as a self-reported variable (1-no smoking, 2-smoking, 3-former smoker). BUN was calculated based on the quantitative values and plasma atherogenic index was calculated according to the following formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Atherogenic coe cient = [Total cholesterol]-[HDH cholesterol] / [HDL cholesterol]</head><p>Physical activity, calculated according to individual's activity per day, was another variable introduced based on the 22-item questionnaire in RaNCD cohort study. Finally, the collected data were extracted based on the Met index and resulting values were entered into the model. Nutritional status of the subjects was determined according to a valid and reliable FFQ customized to the local culture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> Consumption of red meat (including red meat, processed meat, and other (liver, heart, gizzard) was another variable derived from FFQ, calculated based on grams of meat intake per day, and the results were put into the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Methods</head><p>In the rst step, Spearman's rank correlation was applied, and stepwise linear regression was obtained to assess the associations between the study variables and to implement the conceptual framework. Next step, structural equation modeling (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was applied to assess the conceptual model (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Structural equation modeling includes causal modeling, analysis of covariance structures, and latent variable models. This model is a generalization of multivariate multiple regression that allows one to estimate the strength and sign of direct and indirect effects for complicated causal schemes with multiple dependent and independent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In order to create constructs (or factors), we applied con rmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA is a multivariate statistical technique that is used to test whether measures of a construct are consistent with a researcher's understanding of the nature of that construct (or factor). The objective of con rmatory factor analysis is to test whether the data t a hypothesized measurement model. Path standardized coe cients (β) as the effect sizes of this model were calculated. Goodness of t (GOF) indices (e.g. Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), root mean square residual (RMSR) and standardized RMSR) were applied for assessing of tness of the model. All of the statistical analysis was performed using AMOS-SPSS 22 and STATA 14.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX). P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically signi cant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Of 8927 individuals participated in this study, 4212 (47.2%) subjects were male and 4715 (52.8%) subjects were female. The mean of age was 48.2±2.1 (range:35-65) years. Prevalence of hypertension in female and male was 16.35% and 10.22%, respectively. prevalence of BMI ≥30 was 37% in female and 16.6% in male. The mean of atherogenic index was 187.8 in female and 180.1 in male. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows distribution and statistical comparision of the studied variables between three groups of GFR. The mean of GFR was 76.05±14.3. 214 (5.1%) male and 815 (17.3%) female had GFR &lt;60. In fact, GFR was associated with high age, hypertension, diabetes, blood lipids, BUN, and physical activity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> part Aand B: shows structural equation models for assessing direct and indirect effects on GFR for both females and males by standardized path coe cient and goodness of t indices. In female, atherogenic variable had direct (β = -0.19) and indirect (β = -0.01) decreasing effects via BUN, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity on GFR. BUN had direct (β = -0.22) and indirect (β = -0.02) decreasing effects via high blood pressure on GFR. High blood pressure was associated with decreased GFR (β = -0.12). Diabetes had direct (β = -0.04) and indirect (β = -0.02) decreasing effects on GFR. Obesity had direct and positive (β = 0.10) and indirect and negative (β = -0.02) effects on GFR. Diabetes and BUN were associated with high blood pressure (β = 0.17 and β = 0.15, respectively). In male, atherogenic variable had a decreasing direct effect (β = -0.13) on GFR. BUN had direct (β = -0.17) and indirect (β = -0.01) decreasing effects via high blood pressure, as an intermediate variable, on GFR. High blood pressure had (β = -0.12) decreasing direct effect on GFR. Smoking had decreasing direct (β = -0.02) and indirect (β = -0.005) effects, via obesity and high blood pressure, as intermediate variables, on GFR. Physical activity had decreasing direct (β = -0.20) effect with obesity and decreasing indirect (β = -0.02) effect with diabetes via obesity as an intermediate variable (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>All of goodness of t indices indicated that the model has acceptable t. The results of the model tness were reported in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Several risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, high blood lipids) can effect CKD which has had almost the same effects on different populations.. Multivariate analysis of a retrospective cohort study on patients with renal disease in Japan (2012) showed that smoking habit, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and low HDL, each had an independent effect on CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Other studies also showed similar results regarding the effects of high blood pressure and high TG and LDL levels on CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>Obesity is usually measured by BMI, but can also be estimated through other indicators such as fat mass, WC, skin thickness and body fat percentage. Nevertheless, none of these can provide an accurate assessment of obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. So, a combination of these variables, as a hidden variable of obesity in a structural model, can prevent measurement error caused by selecting just one variable as an indicator of obesity.</p><p>In the current research, obesity in female had direct (positive) and indirect (negative) effects, via hypertension and diabetes, on GFR. In different studies, different ndings have been reported on the effect of obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>A meta-analysis showed that there is U-shape relationship between eGFR and death rate; eGFR&lt; 60 ml/min/173m 2 increases death rate incrementally, but eGFR&gt; 105 ml/min/173m 2 results in sharp decrease in death rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Iseki et al. reported an independent relationship between obesity and ESRD <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Similar to those with overweight BMI range, BMI&lt;30 was associated with ESRD <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Hypotheses suggest that low muscle mass is associated with low levels of serum creatinine, and thus, low GFR in normal people with no CKD. Nonetheless, obesity increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and through these variables, it affects low GFR.</p><p>In RaNCD cohort study, low prevalence of GFR in female was due to inadequate physical activity and high prevalence of metabolic risk factors (obesity, high blood lipids, and high blood pressure) for cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Another effective variable in this study was BUN which had negative direct and indirect relationship with GFR in both males and females. BUN is a sign of proper kidney functioning. The main causes of increased BUN are high-protein diets, low GFR, and congestive heart failure. BUN may increase independent from changes in creatinine and GFR. Such increase is due to reabsorption fromproximal tube through the activity of reninangiotensin-aldosterone sympathetic nervous systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. There is a non-linear relationship between increasing BUN and decreasing GFR. Signi cant GFR decrease (&gt;75%) is associated with an increase in BUN in the early stage of a renal disease. On the other hand, a relatively minor decrease in GFR is associated with a relatively high increase in urea concentrations and serum creatinine <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Here, BUN had a negative and indirect effect via high blood pressure, as an intermediate variable, on GFR.</p><p>Findings of previous studies suggested that high blood pressure is signi cantly associated with increased kidney damage in female and male <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. A meta-analysis study in 2014 showed a signi cant relationship between high blood pressure and incidence of ESRD <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. In the current research, high blood pressure was directly related to decrease in GFR.</p><p>Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and CKD. In a research on 12728 subjects with 2-year follow up, it was found that high triglyceride and low HDL, both are risk factors for increased creatinine. These lipide pro les had confusing effects on creatinine after adjustment for other risk factors <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>.The mechanisms by which fat hurts the kidneys are not clear, but glomeruli sclerosis and atherosclerosis seem to have similar effects <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>.The current research ndings showed that atherogenic has direct and indirect relationship with low levels of GFR.</p><p>There were no no signi cant relationship between physical activity and consumption of red meat with GFR.</p><p>It is worthy of note that, this study is the rst by using SEM for assessing the risk factors associated with GFR.</p><p>The most important strength of the present study was the sample size which was large enough to investigate the association between all the above mentioned variables with GFR. Using the SEM and path analysis we were successful to investigate both direct and indirect effect of GFR risk factors. However, our study suffered from following limitations:</p><p>1. Cross-sectional nature of the study -in this type of researches exposure and outcome are measured just once and since they have no causal follow-up, they cannot emphasize on causal relationships.</p><p>2. The researchers' de nition of GFR was only based on serum creatinine criterion which may lead to biased classi cation.</p><p>3. For the subjects with normal kidney functioning, eGFR measurement was performed with less accuracy than those with CKD, but it was more accurate than serum creatinine or Cockcroft-Gault equation.</p></div>
