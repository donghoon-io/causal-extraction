There is a positive relationship between age and NT-proBNP. <ref type="bibr">15 16</ref> Women were more likely to have a high NT-proBNP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and there is an inverse relation between BMI and NT-proBNP. <ref type="bibr">18 19</ref> In general, the inter-relationships between NT-proBNP, urea or creatinine, age and BMI have principally been studied by traditional multiple linear regression analysis, which explores a correlation between one dependent variable and the number of independent variables; this may ignore the complexity of relations between related variables. The purpose of the study was to use structure equation modes (SEM) path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> to assess the relations between changes in NT-proBNP at 1 year and pre-specified variables known to be associated with NT-proBNP: age, sex, BMI, eGFR, loop diuretics, ACE inhibitor (ACEi). Changes in BMI and changes in eGFR were also considered. Our hypothesis was that absolute changes in NT-proBNP during the first year's follow up are related to baseline value of NT-proBNP and renal function and also related to age, loop diuretics and changes in renal function (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p>Patients referred for the assessment of possible heart failure to a local heart failure clinic (Kingston-upon-Hull, UK) between the years 2002 and 2010 had symptoms, signs, electroand echocardiograms recorded and blood samples taken for routine haematology and biochemistry including urea. The NT-proBNP samples were collected in ethylene-diaminetetra-acetic tubes, spun at 3000 r.p.m for 15 minutes in a cooled (4°C) centrifuge and the plasma was stored at -80°C until batch analysed. The assay used was the Elecsys proBNP (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). eGFR was calculated using modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula based on 4 variables: serum creatinine, age, ethnicity and gender. Patients had further routine clinic visits at one year.</p><p>Heart failure was defined as: symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of heart failure in the presence of: either left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% (or equivalent) or NT-proBNP&gt;400pg/ml. All patients provided written informed consent for their data to be used and the study was carried out in accordance with the Declarations of Helsinki and the European Standards for Good Clinical Practice. Ethical approval was granted by the Hull and East Yorkshire Local Research Ethics Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>The characteristics of patients are described by three different groups: a) all patients; b) heart failure; and c) patients in whom heart failure was excluded. Continuous variables are expressed as median and inter-quartile range and categorical variables as frequency and proportion. The continuous variables were tested for normality of distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to study associations between changes in NT-proBNP with pre-specified variables included baseline level NT-proBNP, eGFR, age, sex, BMI, loop diuretics, ACE inhibitor, changes in BMI and changes in eGFR. The change was measured as an absolute change between baseline and 1 year follow-up visit. Log transformation of NT-proBNP was used to meet the assumption of the model. Scatter plots and Pearson correlation coefficients were used initially to investigate correlations.</p><p>We used path analysis, a special case of structural equation modelling (SEM) <ref type="bibr">20 21</ref> in which a number of multiple regression models is considered simultaneously. SEM explores more complex relationships between variables than traditional regression analysis and includes measurement error. SEM path modelling links direct and indirect variables through a medium variable, and thus an individual variable can be both an independent variable and a dependent variable at the same time. There are two stages to path analysis: an initial path model is constructed; and then the relative strength of each independent variable on the dependent variable is estimated. We estimated the model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation; chi-square, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> were used to evaluate the goodness of model fit. Chi-square&gt;0.05, RMSEA&lt;0.05 and CFI&gt;0.9 indicate that the model fits the data well.</p><p>Assumptions of linearity were tested in each linear regression. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 19 software. The level of statistical significance was set at p=0.05 with two tails.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Patient characteristics are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Of 1006 patients with a follow-up NT-proBNP at 1 year, the median age was 72 (IQR: 63-78) years, 732 (73%) were men, 662 (66%) had LVSD and 769 (76%) had NT-proBNP&gt;400pg/ml at baseline. Age, urea, creatinine, left atrial dimension and heart rate were higher, and eGFR, QRS width, systolic BP and BMI were lower, in patients with HF compared with those without HF. For all patients at one year, 243 (24%) patients had at least a 50% reduction in NT-proBNP, 199 (20%) had at least a 50% increase. Only 40 (3%) had &lt;3% change (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the changes in variables at one year for the whole population and for patients with HF. The median NT-proBNP fell but renal function worsened at one year follow up compared with baseline for both populations (p&lt;0.001 for all). There was a strong linear correlation between baseline BMI and changes in BMI at 1year (r=0.86, p&lt;0.001). The scatter plots in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>showed the relations between baseline and 1 year for NT-proBNP and eGFR, respectively.</p><p>The SEM model fitted the data well (chi-square = 18.55, df = 10, p=0.05, CFI = 0.995, RMSEA = 0.029) implies that there is no reason to reject the relationships hypothesized in the original model. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the results. Change in NT-proBNP was most strongly related to baseline NT-proBNP (the standardized coefficient (r) was 0.73, p&lt;0.001). Lower eGFR at baseline was slightly associated with an increase in NT-proBNP (p=0.06), and there was a weak negative correlation between change in eGFR and change in NT-proBNP (p=0.07). Change in NT-proBNP was not related to age and loop diuretics. The model accounted for 56% of the variance in change NT-proBNP at 1 year. Baseline NT-proBNP was strongly, positively related to age and taking loop diuretics (p&lt;0.01 for all), and was negatively related to eGFR and BMI (p&lt;0.01). Change in BMI were negatively related to baseline BMI and age (r=-0.30 for baseline BMI, r=-0.14 for age, p &lt;0.01 for both), this means that the higher the BMI at baseline, the greater decrease in BMI at 1 year. Change in BMI was also slightly related with taking loop diuretics (r=0.07, p=0.01). Changes in eGFR were negatively correlated to age, baseline eGFR and baseline NT-proBNP (p&lt;0.01 for all).</p><p>In addition, there was a strong negative correlation between age and eGFR (r=-0.46; p&lt;0.001), and a negative correlation between age and BMI (r=-0.23, p&lt;0.01).</p><p>There were the potential relationships between baseline age, eGFR, loop diuretics and BMI with changes in NT-proBNP due to the strong correlation between changes in NT-proBNP and baseline NT-proBNP. Creatinine and urea were not included as they are highly correlated with eGFR. The similar results were found in patients with HF (not shown). The final relations between changes in NT-proBNP at 1 year with the other variables were shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The structural equation modelling method used in this study demonstrated that change in NT-proBNP was mostly associated with baseline NT-proBNP. Changes in NT-proBNP were not directly correlated with age, BMI, eGFR and loop diuretics, but they are highly correlated with the baseline NT-proBNP, implying that a change in NT-proBNP was potentially related to age, BMI, eGFR and loop diuretics. The study showed that a change in NT-proBNP were not potentially associated with gender and ACE inhibitor.</p><p>Several studies indicated that renal dysfunction influences NT-proBNP. <ref type="bibr">8 9 24 10 25</ref> Our results confirmed the previous studies that there was a negative association between eGFR and NT-proBNP. One study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> showed that the absolute change in NT-proBNP at 5 years was associated with poorer renal function (eGFR) (standardized coefficient (r) = -0.12, p = 0.001), this was similar with our study that changes in NT-proBNP at 1 year was negatively associated with eGFR (r = -0.03, p = 0.06). Less information is available concerning the relationships between the changes in NT-proBNP and renal function.</p><p>The SEM path analysis studies the possible direct and indirect factors of the variable simultaneously. This method has been applied for cardiovascular research field although with very limited applications. <ref type="bibr">27 28</ref> Our study showed that change in NT-proBNP at 1 year was not only considered with baseline NT-proBNP but also included the factors that were associated through baseline NT-proBNP, such as age, BMI, eGFR and taking loop diuretic to exploring their potential relationships fully (total effects). The correlations obtained from SEM method are more robust compared with separate multiple regressions due to use correlated error terms. In contrast, traditional multiple regression models assume that all predictors are independent; however, in reality these independent variables are always correlated to each other in some degrees, such as eGFR and age. As far as we know, this is a first article to apply SEM method in the field to investigate the relation between changes in NT-proBNP and renal function. Hope this study will give insight into understanding the relationship between NT-proBNP and renal function further in patients with suspected HF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study was an observational study; the time point at 1 year was not exactly same for all patients. We also found that baseline sinus rhythm was negatively associated with baseline NT-proBNP (SR vs not SR, p&lt;0.001) and changes in NT-proBNP (SR vs not SR, p&lt;0.001) but their correlations were not very strong and were not included into the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In a model including age, sex, BMI, eGFR, loop diuretics, ACE inhibitor and NT-proBNP measured at baseline and follow-up, baseline NT-proBNP was the main determinant of subsequent change in NT-proBNP at 1 year.</p></div>
