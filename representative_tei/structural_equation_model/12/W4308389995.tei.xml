<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Approaches to learning in higher education are part of students' practices that have a considerable effect on learning outcomes. Students who care for every detail in their course content with the intent to achieve conceptual understanding (deep approach) are more likely to perform better than others who only rely on memorization of key points (surface approach). Approaches to learning have been conceptualized to include "predispositions adopted by an individual when presented with learning materials and strategies used to process the learning contents" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Zakariya, Bjørkestøl, Nilsen, Goodchild, &amp; Lorås, 2020)</ref>. It is an essential factor in students' practices that has received increased attention in recent times. Perhaps, as a result of international campaigns on aligning university education towards developing learners' deep approaches that will enable them to navigate easily through an increasingly changing society.</p><p>Several empirical studies have been reported on the factors that encourage or discourage the adoption of either deep or surface approaches to learning. One of these studies is a critical review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baeten, Kyndt, Struyven, and Dochy (2010)</ref>. Therein, a total of 118 empirical studies were reviewed, and the results can be summarized as follows: satisfaction with course quality, big five personality traits except for neuroticism, and emotional stability are some of the factors that stimulate adoption of the deep approaches to learning. It was also found that students that experience intrinsic motivation, and who are self-efficacious and self-confident are most likely to adopt deep approaches to learning. In a follow-up quasi-experimental study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baeten, Struyven, and Dochy (2013)</ref> investigated the contribution of some teaching methods on students' approaches to learning. They found that adoption of deep approaches to learning decreases among the participants in a lecture-based group while they remain stable in a student-centred learning environment over a period.</p><p>More so, Von <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Stumm and Furnham (2012)</ref> conducted an empirical study involving 579 psychology and computer science undergraduate students on relations between approaches to learning, personality, intelligence and intellectual engagement. It was found that deep approaches to learning strongly related to intellectual engagement while personality and intelligence explained 25% variability in surface approaches to learning among the subjects of their study. In an attempt to unravel the interwoven bond between critical thinking, self-efficacy and learning approaches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyytinen, Toom, and Postareff (2018)</ref> conducted an empirical study involving 92 science education undergraduate students in Finland. Their results showed that students with high self-efficacy also adopt deep approaches to learning. Some researchers have studied relations between approaches to learning and other factors in domain-specific contexts. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mji (2000)</ref> found that there was a strong relationship between students' different conceptions of mathematics and their approaches to learning the subject.</p><p>Despite the importance of approaches to learning and its relations with some affective constructs, e.g. self-efficacy there are few studies on its relations with attitudes of students. One of the relatively recent studies on this topic is the report by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alkhateeb and Hammoudi (2006)</ref> on the relations between attitude towards mathematics and students' approaches to learning. In their study, students with a positive attitude towards mathematics were identified with deep approaches to learning while those with a negative attitude towards mathematics were identified with surface approaches to learning approaches. However, their study had some methodological issues such as the use of regression analysis to examine the relations between these constructs, given that the regression analysis does not account for measurement errors in the predictor variable(s). Another methodological issue in their study involved the use of mean scores derived from item parcelling of ordinal variables which could lead to biased results because of violation of multiple assumptions, e.g. tau-equivalent, and normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zakariya, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the present study was motivated by the sparsity of studies on the relationship between attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning coupled with some methodological issues observed in available studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alkhateeb &amp; Hammoudi, 2006)</ref>. Further, to the best of our knowledge, there was no validation study on the attitude subscale of the Norwegian national mathematics test for the past fifteen years. The national mathematics test is a test that is conducted every two years and designed to assess pre-university knowledge of mathematics of year-one undergraduate students across universities in Norway. The validity of this test is essential to ensure the test measures what is purported to measure, which will facilitate more accurate interpretations of its ensuing results. Therefore, the primary purposes of the present study are to use a structural equation modelling approach to (a) validate the attitude subscale of the Norwegian national mathematics test; (b) expose the impact of attitude towards mathematics on students' learning approaches. The use of the structural equation modelling approach will avail us an opportunity of taking of care of the two methodological issues involved in the use regression analysis that is typically used in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alkhateeb &amp; Hammoudi, 2006)</ref>. In the next section, a conceptual framework coupled with a theoretical perspective that justifies the rationale for finding the relations between these constructs is discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</head><p>A theoretical structure that could be used to justify the relations between attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning is social cognitive theory. This theory sees an individual's behavioural changes as consistently being regulated and modified by interacting with social factors in the environment whose feedback influences the next actions and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bandura, 2001)</ref>. Central to this theory is the concept of reciprocal determinism that postulates a dynamic relationship between personal, behavioural, and environmental determinants <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandura, 2012)</ref>. Even though both the attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning are personal factors, it is presumed that the dynamic relationship between the determinants (personal, behavioural, and environmental) can be extrapolated to within the personal determinants (cognitive, affective and biological factors). As such, a causal relationship between attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning can be theoretically postulated. Empirical evidence has shown that students' attitude towards learning mathematics is greatly influenced by consistent interactions with teachers, peer groups and parents (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Davadas &amp; Lay, 2017)</ref>. In other words, students whose teachers are efficacious, motivate them to learn, give positive feedback, maintain good teacher-student relations are more likely to develop a positive attitude towards mathematics. This, in turn, influences their approaches to learning the subject.</p><p>Several attempts have been made to conceptualize and operationalize both attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning. Attitude towards mathematics has been conceptualized to include appraisal, valuation and enjoyment of mathematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Zakariya, 2017)</ref>. It is a construct whose multifaceted nature has influenced, to a great extent, the development of its measuring instruments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Palacios, Arias, &amp; Arias, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Zakariya, 2017)</ref>. Some of these instruments have contributed significantly to the measurement of this construct as well as in relating it to other constructs from quantitative research perspectives. However, for the purpose of this study, a 5-item unidimensional attitude scale which is part of the national mathematics test in Norway, was selected. Our choice of this scale was prompted by two factors: (a) availability in the Norwegian language; (b) our quest to provide construct and discriminant validity which is lacking in the literature.</p><p>In addition, the "revised two-factor study process questionnaire" (R-SPQ-2F) has been identified as one of the best instruments for measuring students' approaches to learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(López-Aguado &amp; Gutiérrez-Provecho, 2018)</ref>. R-SPQ-2F was chosen for the present study because of its high psychometric properties, a small number of items and ease of score interpretations. Further, Norwegian validations of this instrument have been undertaken (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Zakariya, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zakariya et al., 2020)</ref>. The Norwegian version has ten items on deep subscale and nine items on surface subscale with evidence of construct validity, discriminant validity, and internal consistency of its items.</p><p>Based on the postulates of the social cognitive theory coupled with previous literature, the two hypotheses of the present study are stated as follows, while Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts these hypothesized relations:</p><p>(H01) There are substantial positive impacts of attitude towards mathematics on deep approaches to learning.</p><p>(H02) There are substantial negative impacts of attitude towards mathematics on surface approaches to learning.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD SAMPLE AND MEASURES</head><p>The sample for this study was made up of 196 year-one engineering students, including 34 females and 162 males with an average age of 24.64 years. Two online survey instruments were completed by the students, including R-SPQ-2F (Norwegian version) and attitude towards mathematics scale (AtMS). R-SPQ-2F is a 19-item questionnaire in which respondents rated their level of agreement from (1) 'never or only rarely true of me' to (5) 'always or almost always true of me' to statements like "I test myself on important topics until I understand them completely" (deep approach), "I see no point in learning material which is not likely to be in the examination" (surface approach), etc. On the other hand, AtMS is a 5-item scale in which respondents rated their level of agreements from (1) 'strongly disagree' to (4) 'strongly agree' to statements like "I work with mathematics because I like it", and "I'm interested in what I learn in math".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>The analyses proceeded in two stages. Stage one involved fitting a measurement model to examine the construct validity and unidimensionality of the AtMS. In this stage, AtMS data were screened for outliers, normality assumption, skewness, and kurtosis. It was found that AtMS contained excess kurtosis (absolute value &gt; 2) and both Kolmogorov-Smirnov's and Shapiro-Wilk's tests were significant for each item which showed that the data were not normally distributed. Thus, weighted least square mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator was used for the confirmatory factor analysis as it is robust enough to perform well under violation of multiple assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Suh, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zakariya, Goodchild, Bjørkestøl, &amp; Nilsen, 2019)</ref>. Further, both the item and scale reliability indices of AtMS were investigated using latent factor approach as opposed to the Cronbach alpha coefficient.</p><p>Analyses in stage two involved validating a structural model that explains the relations between attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning. It consisted of evaluating the model and conducting exploratory post hoc analysis for its improvement. The structural equation modelling approach was used to either confirm or falsify the causal hypothesized relations between attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning without claiming outright causation between the constructs. Model fits were assessed based on a combination of criteria as proposed in literature which includes: 𝜒 2 ratio to the degree of freedom (df) less than 3, significant estimated parameters, comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) close to or ≥ .95, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤ .06, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) ≤ .08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. All the analyses were performed using Mplus 8.3 software, and the results are presented in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STAGE ONE: MEASUREMENT MODEL AND RELIABILITY</head><p>A one-factor model was evaluated for the measure of attitude towards mathematics, and the results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOF indices</head><p>Model The results of the selected goodness of fit (GOF) indices, presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (Model 1) showed an appropriate fit of the one-factor model AtMS. However, the significant chi-square value, its ratio to df &gt; 3, and the low value of TLI, suggest that the model can be improved. Thus, a post hoc analysis was conducted using suggestions from modification indices. On this basis, two error covariances were included in the model between item 02 and item 04 as well as between item 01 and item 05. These resulted in a significant improvement in the model (Model 2) as indicated by the significant chisquare difference test statistics with Satorra-Bentler correction Δ𝜒 [2] 2 = 80.516, 𝑝 &lt;</p><p>.001. The model chi-square value is no longer significant, which is expected and its ratio to df &lt; 3, CFI, TLI, RMSEA and SRMR, all now within the recommended ranges. These suggest an excellent fit of Model 2. All the factor loadings are found to be significant, and all the items are reliable with an ordinal coefficient alpha of .78 on the whole measuring instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STAGE TWO: STRUCTURAL MODEL</head><p>In an attempt to test hypotheses one and two, we evaluated two structural models. The first model (Model 3) concerns the impact of attitude towards mathematics on the two dimensions of approaches to learning the subject. The second model (Model 4) concerns the final improvement of Model 3 through post hoc analyses. Selected GOF indices of these models are presented in The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> (Model 3) showed an appropriate fit of the model except that both CFI and TLI are relatively low and close fit probability assessment of RMSEA was significant which implies the model is not close enough to the data. As the first step in post hoc analysis of the structural equation modelling approach, we scanned through the estimates and discovered that item 4 and item 10 of the surface approach subscale of R-SPQ-2F had non-significant factor loadings. These items were deleted from the model, and the resulting model improved significantly as indicated by the significant chi-square difference test statistics with Satorra-Bentler correction Δ𝜒  The illustrated results by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> show that there is a significant positive impact of attitude towards mathematics on deep approaches to learning (β= .377, p &lt; .05) and a significant negative impact on the surface approaches to learning (β= -.371, p &lt; .05) which confirm hypothesis one (H01) and hypothesis two (H02) respectively. These findings could be interpreted to mean that students who have a high (positive) attitude towards learning mathematics are more likely to adopt deep approaches to learning the subject. On the other hand, students who have a low (negative) attitude towards mathematics are more likely to adopt surface approaches to learning the subject. It is also revealed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> that attitude towards mathematics explained 14.2% and 13.8% variances in predicting deep and surface approaches, respectively. These percentages of explained variances appear low. However, they are statistically significant. The low percentages of explained variances in deep and surface approaches are suggestive of the presence of other factors that are not captured in the present study and yet influence the adoption of students' learning approaches. In the next section, we present a brief discussion of the significant findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Attempts are made in the present study to provide empirical evidence for construct and discriminant validity of a 5-item attitude subscale of the Norwegian national mathematics test and to expose the impact of attitude towards mathematics on students' learning approaches. The attitude subscale was found to be unidimensional, and possesses construct validity, it discriminates cleanly between two approaches to learning and it has high internal item consistency with an ordinal coefficient of .78. However, this validity evidence was achieved after accounting for two error covariances between item 02: "I work with math because I like it" and item 04: "I'm interested in what I learn in math" as well as between item 01: "making an effort in math is important because it will help me in work I will be doing later" and item 05: "mathematics is an important subject for me because I need it when I want to study further".</p><p>It is important to remark that the error covariances appear to make sense conceptually since both item 02 and item 04 seem to capture intrinsic motivation part of attitude and item 01 and item 05 seem to capture usefulness of mathematics part of attitude. This finding corroborates other studies that have reported multidimensional attitude scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Palacios et al., 2013)</ref>. Further, the reliability coefficient of the AtMS (α = .78) is higher than that of the perception of utility subscale (α = .679) reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Palacios et al., 2013)</ref> and that of the usefulness of mathematics subscale (α = .75) reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Zakariya, 2017)</ref> even though the final reliability coefficients of the whole scales reported in the two previous studies are higher than α = .78 that was found for the AtMS.</p><p>Another important finding of the present study is the substantial positive impact of attitude towards mathematics on the deep approaches to learning as well as the substantial negative impact on the surface approaches to learning. These findings, on the one hand, suggest that year-one engineering students who enjoy mathematics, who are interested in the subject and recognize the utility of mathematics to their future studies are more likely to adopt deep approaches to learning the subject. On the other hand, the findings suggest that year-one engineering students who find mathematics less enjoyable and struggle to discover its relevance to their future studies may tend to adopt surface approaches to learning the subject. These findings agree with the report by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alkhateeb and Hammoudi (2006)</ref> and partly support some reported results by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">García, Rodríguez, Betts, Areces, and González-Castro (2016)</ref>. More importantly, we do not claim outright causal relations between these constructs. However, our results have only provided tentative empirical evidence that confirms our hypothesized causal relations between engineering students' attitude towards mathematics and approaches to learning. Future replication studies are recommended to confirm these findings in independent samples. Finally, it is hoped that the findings of this study have shed some light on a general understanding of the causal relations between the attitude of students towards mathematics and their approaches to learning the subject. This could be of help to university teachers and other stakeholders in designing appropriate interventions to support the students.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1shows hypothesized impact of attitude measured by five items (att01 -att05) on both deep and surface approaches each measured by ten items and nine items respectively with an error correlation (indicated by the double-headed arrow) between deep and surface approaches.
