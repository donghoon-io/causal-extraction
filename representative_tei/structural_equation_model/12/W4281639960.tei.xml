<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Conceptually, although the effectiveness of communication is generally associated with the development of language skills, studies that model this relationship comprehensively are limited. Based on this, the current study examines the relationship between different linguistic variables (listening skills, attitude towards reading habits, speech self-efficacy, and writing disposition) and their own and communication skills. The study data was collected from 566 prospective teachers in Turkey. As a result of the study, the theoretical structure between linguistic variables and communication skills has been statistically proven. In the model, it was seen that the model-data fit was at a good level (χ²/df=4.46, CFI=.955, RMSEA=.078, SRMR=.033). The proposed model indicates that listening skills affect communication skills at a medium level and speech self-efficacy at a high level. In addition, writing disposition affects communication skills indirectly through speech self-efficacy, and reading habits affect communication skills indirectly through both listening skills and speech self-efficacy. The highest relationship is between listening skills and speech self-efficacy. Also, the relationships between all the variables are significant. The study supports existing hypotheses about the role language plays in communication skills.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Communication is not a linear or one-dimensional process. Rather, it is a complex process that includes elements such as observing, listening, revealing critical information, interpreting information, and communicating the information to others <ref type="bibr">(National Research Council [NRC], 2011, p. 9</ref>). This process is carried out by "social actors" and community members who undertake linguistic to and communicative tasks in specific settings and areas of action <ref type="bibr">(Council of Europe, 2001)</ref>. These actors communicate by listening and understanding different types of verbal messages; speaking briefly and clearly; following the process of writing; writing different types of texts for various purposes; and being able to read and understand different texts by adopting strategies suitable for different reading purposes and various text types <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Binkley et al., 2012)</ref>. Therefore, communication is closely related to language skills. Basically, language, which is a communication system, consists of four important skill areas: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The development of communication skills is both a cause and a natural consequence of the development of these complex interrelated language skill areas with various cognitive, affective, psychosocial, and behavioral dimensions. Coordination and positive transfers between language skill areas contribute to the competence to communicate effectively, which is the ultimate goal of language teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nan, 2018)</ref>. Considering the opposite, language-based cognitive and affective problems of individuals will have a detrimental impact on their ability to communicate effectively.</p><p>Deficiencies in individuals' communication skills have been reported in research conducted in various fields, such as education <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Durukan &amp; Maden, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gökçe &amp; Atanur Başkan, 2012)</ref>, health <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kumcağız, Yılmaz, Balcı Çelik, &amp; Aydın Avcı, 2011)</ref>, tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ceylan, 2015)</ref>, and sports <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Özbey &amp; Doğu, 2020)</ref>; however, the reasons of this problem stemming from language skills have not been sufficiently focused. Although the relationship between</p><p>The communication principles and basic skills dimension include principles such as being a purposeful and process-based activity, including interconnected elements, realizing within the framework of certain rules, and being influenced by cultural factors. In addition, communication includes many sub-skill areas such as transparency, providing feedback, sending the message in effective ways, empathy, listening, persuasion, leadership, and self-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bambacas &amp; Patrickson, 2008)</ref>. Another sub-dimension is self-expression, which is defined as "the free expression of one's feelings, thoughts, talents, attitudes, or impulses" <ref type="bibr">(VandenBos, 2015, p. 955)</ref>. Non-verbal communication is a type of communication based on coding non-verbal symbols and signs and decoding messages encoded by others <ref type="bibr">(Eaves &amp; Leather, 2018)</ref>. These elements include facial expression, eye behaviour, bodily communication (postures), proxemics, gaze, tactile / haptics, personal appearance, and vocalic communication <ref type="bibr">(Eaves &amp; Leather, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Matsumoto, Hwang, &amp; Frank, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>"Willingness to communicate" (WTC), which was first conceptualized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">McCroskey and Baer (1985)</ref> in mother tongue teaching, is "personality-based, character-like predisposition" (p. 1) as well as being sensitive to situational conditions and restrictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(McCroskey &amp; Baer, 1985)</ref>. Moving the concept to the field of second language teaching, MacIntyre, Clement, Dornyei, and Noels (1998) defined the willingness to communicate as "readiness to enter into discourse at a particular time with a specific person or persons <ref type="bibr">" (p. 547)</ref>. This element affects people's initiation and maintenance of a communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cao &amp; Philp, 2006)</ref>. This dominant personality structure, which permeates every aspect of an individual's life, has an important effect on "social, educational and organizational achievements" <ref type="bibr">(Richmond &amp; Roach, 1992, p. 104)</ref>.</p><p>Listening Skill: Listening skills (LS) are "one of the basic ways of communicating and learning, which includes understanding, interpreting, and evaluating the message correctly" (Ministry of National <ref type="bibr">Education, 2006)</ref>. The fact that it is seen as one of the receptive language skills in the literature causes it to be labeled as a passive process. Listening mainly focuses on actively building information rather than receiving and storing information passively <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Rost, 2020)</ref>. Listening is a special interpretation process that focuses on understanding and contextualizing what is heard as the deliberate communicative expressions of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Burleson, 2011)</ref>. This active skill area includes cognitive, affective, behavioral/verbal, behavioral/non-verbal, and behavioral/interactive dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Halone, Cunconan, Coakley, &amp; Wolvin, 1998)</ref>. Among these, especially the interaction dimension, makes listening an important communication activity. Because the meaning in listening is formed by both the speaker and the listener in communicative contexts <ref type="bibr">(Rost, 2020, pp. 265-266)</ref>. In this context, effective listening is defined as "the dynamic, interactive process of integrating appropriate listening attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors to achieve the selected goals of a listening event" <ref type="bibr">(Thompson, Leintz, Nevers, &amp; Witkowski, 2004, p. 240)</ref>. In this context, paying close attention to what is said, asking the other party to explain exactly what you mean, and demanding repetition of ambiguous ideas or statements are among the characteristics of effective listening, which is an interpersonal skill <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Klein, DeRouin, &amp; Salas, 2006)</ref>. According to research, good listening skills lead to greater academic and professional success, as well as increased interaction and relational pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bodie &amp; Fitch-Hauser, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Effective Speech Self-Efficacy: Self-efficacy is conceptualized in the social cognitive theory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandura (1997)</ref>, which accepts that people's thoughts and actions arise as a result of dynamic interaction between personal, behavioral, and environmental effects <ref type="bibr">(Schunk &amp; Pajares, 2010, p.668)</ref>. In this theory, it is argued that the things that individuals think, feel, and believe affect their choices and behaviors; that they can make inferences about the results by examining the adequacy of their behavior themselves; and that they can mentally keep the belief that they have developed in terms of their ability to guide their next behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>. Self-efficacy is a central motivational variable that can affect task preference, attempt, patience, purposefulness, flexibility, and accomplishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Schunk, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Schunk &amp; Pajares, 2010)</ref>. This motivational variable has been defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bandura (1997)</ref> as "beliefs in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments" (p. 3). Based on this definition, speech self-efficacy can also be defined as the belief in one's own knowledge, skill, and competence level in order to organize, execute, and control a series of operations necessary for the success of the speech act.</p><p>People with low self-efficacy beliefs in a certain field "perceive difficult tasks as personal threats and tend to lose faith in their abilities easily because they focus on their own personal deficiencies and the obstacles, they face rather than how they can successfully perform the task" <ref type="bibr">(Dörnyei &amp; Ushioda, 2011, p.16)</ref>. People with high selfefficacy approach difficult tasks not as threats to be avoided, but as challenges to be overcome <ref type="bibr">(Schunk &amp; Pajares, 2010, p.670)</ref>. These individuals also tend to have lower anxiety levels, use more flexible learning strategies, and show higher interest in academic tasks <ref type="bibr">(Mills, 2014, p.9)</ref>. However, they have more control over their own learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Pintrich, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Zimmerman, Bonner, &amp; Kovach, 1996)</ref>. In terms of speaking, people with high self-efficacy have better speaking skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Leeming, 2017)</ref> and people with low speech self-efficacy have higher speaking anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Gürsoy &amp; Karaca, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Attitude towards Reading Habit: Attitude is "the way a person consistently thinks or feels about something or is disposed to react to it; often used with reference to how a person values something, i.e., how far he is for or against it" <ref type="bibr">(Sutherland, 1995, p. 40)</ref>. "Attitudes can be influenced by and can influence beliefs, affect, and behavior in relation to the attitude object" <ref type="bibr">(Matsumoto, 2009, p. 59)</ref>. Reading attitude is defined as "a set of acquired feelings about reading that consistently predispose an individual to engage in or avoid reading" <ref type="bibr">(Conradi, Jang, &amp; McKenna, 2014, p. 154)</ref> and is accepted as one of the main factors affecting an individual's reading intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Mathewson, 1994)</ref>. Developing an attitude toward reading habit (RH) allows an individual to continue reading activity permanently and frequently throughout their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Odabaş, Odabaş, &amp; Polat, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Writing disposition: Disposition is "a recurrent behavioral, cognitive, or affective tendency that distinguishes an individual from others" <ref type="bibr">(VandenBos, 2015, p. 323</ref>). These repetitive tendencies, which direct the person's activities such as thinking, feeling, acting, and reacting <ref type="bibr">(Matsumoto, 2009, p. 167)</ref>, are related to internal factors rather than external factors <ref type="bibr">(Sutherland, 1995, p. 129)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Driscoll and Wells (2012)</ref> conceptualized these personal internal qualities as "habits of mind." In this context, they consider disposition in relation to factors such as context, the process and time of learning as well as personal characteristics, and draw attention to the fact that tendencies are a concept that determines how these characteristics are used or applied rather than intellectual characteristics such as knowledge or skills. Within this theoretical framework, writing disposition (WD) is a comprehensive term that encompasses emotional qualities such as writing "self-discipline, perseverance in the face of difficulties, tolerance of ambiguity, autonomy, willingness to take risks, motivation, self-efficacy, and interest" <ref type="bibr">(Piazza &amp; Siebert, 2008, p. 275)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Piazza and Siebert (2008)</ref> listed the critical affective dimensions, which constitute the dispositional aspect of writing, as confidence, persistence, and passion. Of these elements, confidence refers to an individual's belief in his writing ability and does not doubt his effectiveness as a writer. Persistence reflects the willingness of the author to devote time to writing and to continuous effort. Passion can be conceptualized as an intense urge or desire to write, a strong commitment to writing, and the pleasure of writing over and over again <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Piazza &amp; Siebert, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In this conceptual framework, the current study aims to determine the link between linguistic variables and the effects of these variables on CS. In this context, the hypotheses of the study and the theoretical and empirical background supporting these hypotheses are expressed in the following section:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: There are positive relationships between the RH with LS and ESS.</p><p>Listening and reading, sharing similar decoding processes, are important tools for acquiring linguistic knowledge and developing linguistic understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Hoover &amp; Gough, 1990)</ref>. The mental skills required to understand and interpret what is heard can be developed through reading or thinking about what is read. Competencies gained through reading can be expanded by listening studies. In this respect, reading and listening skills are complementary to each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Göçer, 2019)</ref>. This link between reading and listening, both receptive skills, has been reported in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Diakidoy, Stylianou, Karefillidou, &amp; Papageorgiou, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hoover &amp; Gough, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Powell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Wolf, Muijselaar, Boonstra, &amp; Bree, 2019)</ref>. Reading, which is a graphical system, and speaking, which is a phonological system, are interrelated <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arıcı, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gibson, 1972)</ref>. When a person who brings grammatical information to reading can decode graphic elements and know the punctuation marks, he can automatically transfer this information to speech <ref type="bibr">(Gibson, 1972, pp. 9-12)</ref>. Speaking is one of the tools people use to share the information they have acquired through reading with others. Reading affects speaking positively in terms of both pronunciation and content. Therefore, being a good reader is a necessity for successful speaking <ref type="bibr">(Arıcı, 2012, p. 12)</ref>.</p><p>There are correlational studies in the literature that prove these theoretical relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Demir &amp; Börekçi, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tekşan &amp; Çinpolat, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Oğuz, 2009)</ref>. In one of these, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Demir and Börekçi (2021)</ref> determined that the number of books at home and the amount of daily reading of secondary school students were related to their perceptions of verbal expression self-efficacy. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Oğuz (2009)</ref> found that one of the reasons for the prospective teachers' inadequacy in verbal expression skills was that their reading habits were not sufficiently developed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tekşan and Çinpolat (2018)</ref> revealed that there is a positive and significant relationship between prospective teachers' attitudes towards speaking self-efficacy and reading habits.</p><p>Hypothesis 2: There is a positive relationship between WD and ESS.</p><p>There is a reciprocal relationship between speaking and writing, which are productive skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kantor &amp; Rubin, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Kroll, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Moxley, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nan, 2018)</ref>. Both skills are based on a common cognitive skill set that includes working memory, linguistic cohesion, and morphological knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Shanahan, 2006, p. 180)</ref>. The mechanisms of speaking and writing, which enable the construction of grammar forms, are related. Although the outcomes of both skills are different, they use similar syntactic representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cleland &amp; Pickering, 2006)</ref>. Speaking helps a person become familiar with language material, make language production a fluent process, and use language skills. This, in turn, contributes to the person's ability to think quickly and express himself in a logical way, which has a positive effect on his writing skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nan, 2018)</ref>. Especially during social conversations, many skills, such as giving information about a subject chosen by the speaker or shaping a message according to a certain audience, are strategies that he can later use in explanatory and persuasive writing <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Weissberg, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Studies in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carlisle, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dockrell &amp; Connelly, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Motallebzadeh, Ahmadi, &amp; Hosseinnia, 2018)</ref> also support this relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Motallebzadeh et al. (2018)</ref> found that EFL learners' speaking and writing skills are highly correlated. The study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dockrell &amp; Connelly (2016)</ref> with primary school students revealed a significant relationship between students' forming oral and written sentences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Carlisle (1996)</ref>, in his study in which students with learning difficulties were included in the sample, revealed "there was a moderately strong relationship between the ability of children to produce morphologically complex words in a verbal task and the accuracy of using morphological forms in their stories" (p. 69). This study was noteworthy as it showed the relationship between speaking and writing, and that students' verbal language errors explained many of their morphemic errors in writing.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: There are positive relationships between LS, ESS, and CS.</p><p>Listening is a key skill in acquiring other language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Doğan, 2012)</ref>. By listening, individuals learn how to behave, distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior patterns, and tailor their actions to a specific communication context <ref type="bibr">(Brownell, 2010, p. 142)</ref>. Therefore, listening is a prerequisite for communication. As a matter of fact, the findings that the failure to acquire the right listening habit is one of the challenges faced in daily communication in daily life supports this thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Yalçın, 2002)</ref>. "Educational research has consistently shown that many students lag behind in verbal communication and literacy development due to a lack of LS" <ref type="bibr">(Rost, 2020, p. 265)</ref>. It is pointed out in studies in the literature that listening is an important component of communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brownell, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cooper, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Davenport Sypher, Bostrom, &amp; Hart Seibert, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Doğan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kline, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Villaume &amp; Bodie, 2007)</ref>. People reach the competence of listening by communicating, and they achieve their communication goals by listening <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cooper, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Speaking has two basic functions. The first function is expressed as transactional (transferring information and exchanging services) and the second is interpersonal (establishing and maintaining social relationships) <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Thornbury, 2005)</ref>. We can assume there is a theoretical relationship between ESS and communication, especially since the social cognitive theory, in which the concept of self-efficacy is shaped, emphasizes the interaction of personal, behavioral, and environmental dimensions; and the motivation, effort, and continuity elements of selfefficacy are also important in initiating and maintaining communication.</p><p>This theoretical relationship has also been proven by correlational studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bria &amp; Jouybar, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Demir, 2017)</ref>. In one of them, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bria &amp; Jouybar (2016)</ref> found in their study that there was a statistically significant relationship between EFL students' desire to communicate, language competence, and verbal competence. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Demir (2017)</ref> found that listening accounts for 57% of speaking self-efficacy.</p><p>Hypothesis 4: There are positive indirect relationships between RH and WD and CS.</p><p>Reading is a purposeful activity that has a social and an individual aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Schwab &amp; Hughes, 2010)</ref>. Its being a social activity makes it one of the more important communication skills. As a matter of fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Russell (1951)</ref> states that reading is not only the acquisition or absorption of ideas, but also communicating with others. Thus, developing reading skills affects both the attitude towards communication and CS. He points out that reading is a skill that is more related to communication situations in the social environment and contributes to socialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Russell, 1951)</ref>. Reading is also a communication activity in terms of rhetoric. During this process, both sending and receiving readers gain insights into how communication works <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Tierney &amp; Shanahan, 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Phillips (1978)</ref> states that "reading is communication when the materials reflect reality, and the reader develops skills and strategies parallel to the decoding process used in real life" (p. 284). For this reason, he argues that reading skills and verbal activities should be integrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Phillips, 1978)</ref>.</p><p>There is a purpose-to-tool relationship between writing and communication. While effective communication is one of the most important purposes of writing, writing has always been one of the most powerful tools of communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kansızoğlu, 2019)</ref>. In addition, factors such as confidence, self-efficacy, self-regulation, motivation, and persistence in WD suggest there may be a theoretical relationship between CS and WD <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Piazza &amp; Siebert, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>It is accepted that reading and writing are two skill areas that have common, similar, or overlapping operations, processes, and sub-skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbott, Berninger, &amp; Fayol, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Grabe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Schoonen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Shanahan &amp; Lomax, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Tierney &amp; Pearson, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Tierney &amp; Shanahan, 1991)</ref>. These two skills, which are a constellation of cognitive processes at various language levels (phonemic, orthographic, semantic, syntactic, pragmatic), depend on the same information representations, cognitive processes, contexts, and contextual constraints, so their development processes are parallel to each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Fitzgerald &amp; Shanahan, 2000)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Process and Tools</head><p>Before starting the data collection process in the study, necessary permissions were obtained from the researchers who developed the measurement tools used and from the relevant institution to collect data. The data collection tools were delivered by the researchers as a paper-pencil test and were carried out face-to-face, which took approximately 75-90 minutes to complete. Information about the measurement tools used in the study is presented below.</p><p>Communication Skills Scale: The Communication Skills Scale was developed by Korkut-Owen and Bugay (2014) to determine the extent to which individuals possess qualities that enrich communication. For this purpose, item samples in the measurement tool were presented as "When I talk to someone, I check if I understand them correctly before I answer them", "I keep in mind that the words chosen are also important when texting" The measurement tool was developed by the researchers with four dimensions, measured by 25 five-point Likert type items. The four dimensions were "principles of communication and basic skills," "self-expression," "active listening and nonverbal communication," and "willingness to communicate." Researchers conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to establish measurement tool's the construct validity. They concluded from the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) that the four-factor solution explained 45.95% of the variance and that this variance ratio was sufficient. They confirmed structure with the fit indices (χ²/df = 1.40; CFI = .91, IFI = 0.91, TLI = .90, RMSEA = .046, SRMR = .068) obtained from the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the four-factor structure. The reliability of the scale was demonstrated by examining the relationship of the scale with similar scales, the differences between the groups of the scores obtained from the sub-dimensions, test-retest correlations, and Cronbach's alpha values.</p><p>Listening Skill Scale: The Listening Skill Scale developed by <ref type="bibr">Kuzgun and Cihangir (2000)</ref> was revised by Cihangir Çankaya (2012). Cihangir Çankaya (2012) noted that LS, which are defined as the skills of asking open or closed questions, observing the speaker, encouraging, reflecting content, summarizing, and reflecting emotion, can be measured with the scale. Sample items to measure LS include:"I can understand the feelings and thoughts of the other person while listening and convey that I understood to him/her through my words and/or nonverbal actions," and "I have difficulty in making eye contact with the other person while listening." The measurement tool was revised by the researcher as two dimensions with 15 items on a five-point Likert scale, namely "effective listening behaviors" and "ineffective listening behaviors." By exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, Cihangir Çankaya (2012) obtained evidence of the construct validity of the measurement tool. The researchers concluded from EFA that the two-factor structure explains 44.65% of the total variance, and that the structure has two factors. They stated that the model data fit was at a good level according to the fit indexes (χ²/df = 1.59; CFI =.98, NFI= 0.96, AGFI =.97, RMSEA =.04) they had obtained from CFA. The reliability of the scale was demonstrated with Cronbach's alpha values obtained as.82 for the effective listening behaviors sub-dimension,.76 for the ineffective listening behaviors sub-dimension, and.83 for the whole scale.</p><p>Effective Speech Self-Efficacy Scale: In order to be used in the study, it was aimed to choose the appropriate measurement tool by examining the items and validity-reliability results of the measurement tools available in the literature. Although the "Effective Speech Scale" developed by Çintaş Yıldız and Yavuz (2012) was deemed appropriate, the fact that its items were prepared as a checklist led the researchers of this study to develop a new measurement tool. In order to measure ESS, the items and dimensions of the "Effective Speech Scale" were taken as a basis, and a 36-item Likert-type draft scale was prepared by literature review. In the scale development study, 553 individuals studying at the education faculty of a state university were included in the sample using the convenience sampling method. First, data for EFA (n = 351) were obtained. According to the results obtained from EFA, a scale implementation (n = 202) was carried out for CFA. In the development of the measurement tool, the analyses were carried out using the "haven" <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Wickham &amp; Miller, 2020)</ref>, "psych" <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Revelle, 2020)</ref>, "REdaS" <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Maier, 2015)</ref>, "MVN" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Korkmaz, Goksuluk, &amp; Zararsiz, 2014)</ref>, "lavaan" <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>, "semPlot" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Epskamp, &amp; Stuber, 2014)</ref>, and "sirt" <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Robitzsch, 2020)</ref> packages in the R software (R Core Team, 2020). The adequacy of the sample size for EFA was tested by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test (KMO). The analysis was continued as the KMO was obtained as.93 indicated that the sample was sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013)</ref>. Variance-covariance matrices obtained as a result of Bartlett's test (χ2=3364.102; sd=210; p&lt;0.001) were found to be suitable for factor extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Çokluk, Şekercioğlu, &amp; Büyüköztürk, 2010)</ref>. EFA, the results of which are given in Appendix A, was carried out using the principal factor solution method and promax, which is an oblique rotation method. It is seen that all of the items on the scale except M2 ("I can clear my speech from unnecessary details") have a factor load above the.30 limit. Although the M2 item has a low factor load (.29), it was not removed from the item set because it was considered theoretically important by the researchers and was not far below the limit value.</p><p>It was observed that the four-factor structure, which explains 49% of the total variance, is also suitable for theoretical foundations. First, in order to verify the four-factor structure, we tested the normality assumption using Mardia's univariate and multivariate normality tests. The skewness and kurtosis values in both univariate and multivariate normality were statistically significant (p &lt;.001) and normality was not achieved. For this reason, CFA was continued with the WLSMV method. In the CFA model, see Appendix B, there are path coefficients and errors related to observed variables, and correlations between latent variables. When the fit indices obtained from the model are examined (𝜒2= 233.532, df=183, p=0.007, 𝜒2/df=1.27; CFI=.958; TLI=.951; RMSEA=.037; SRMR=.049), it can be said that the model-data fit is at a perfect level. In order to determine the reliability of the scale, Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficients were estimated. It was obtained as.80 for the presentation self-efficacy dimension,.82 for the vocal self-efficacy dimension,.75 for the style and expression self-efficacy dimension, and.86 for the audience consideration dimension. A stratified alpha of.92 was calculated for the whole scale. According to these values, it can be said that a valid and reliable "Effective Speech Self-Efficacy Scale" has been developed.</p><p>Attitude Scale Towards Reading Habits: Susar Kırmızı (2012) determined the attitude levels of pre-service teachers towards reading with the Attitude Scale Towards Reading Habits. For this purpose, the items in the measurement tool can be exemplified as "I have a guilty conscience the day I sleep without reading," "Instead of seeing reading as a leisure activity, I make time to read books." The researcher developed 34 items in three dimensions as "attitudes towards meeting the learning needs and having fun," "attitudes towards the meaning and indispensability of the habit of reading books," and "attitudes towards the development of book reading habits" using a five-point Likert type measurement tool. As a result of the EFA the researcher conducted to determine the structure of the measurement tool, she estimated the variance explained by the scale three dimensions as 57.92 and stated that the three dimensions were appropriate. The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients calculated to determine the reliability of the measuring tool were found to be.78 for the first dimension,.88 for the second dimension, and.72 for the third dimension.</p><p>Writing Disposition Scale: The "Writing Disposition Scale" developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Piazza and Siebert (2008)</ref> was adapted into Turkish by <ref type="bibr">İşeri and Ünal (2010)</ref>. "I have the skills I need to write well" and "Writing gives me great pleasure" are examples of items on the scale developed to measure individuals' writing skills. The measurement tool was adapted by the researchers as in the original, consisting of three dimensions: "trust", "continuity", and "passion" with 21 five-point Likert type items. Concerning the construct validity of the measuring tool, researchers carried out EFA and CFA. They concluded from EFA that the three-factor structure explained 46.26% of the variance and that this variance rate was sufficient. They verified the structure with the fit indices they obtained from CFA for the three-factor structure (χ²/df= 1.243; CFI = .998, GFI= 0.996, AGFI= 0.992, NFI =.992, RMSEA =.008). The researchers found the Cronbach Alpha coefficients for reliability at.874 for the whole scale,.882 for the passion dimension,.734 for the confidence dimension, and.639 for the continuity dimension. Since the validity and reliability study of the measurement tool was carried out with primary school students, CFA was applied to the structure specified by <ref type="bibr">İşeri and Ünal (2010)</ref> with the study group data to use the measurement tool in this study. For the analysis, the "haven" <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Wickham &amp; Miller, 2020)</ref>, "MVN" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Korkmaz et al., 2014)</ref>, and "lavaan" <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> packages were used in the R software. The Mardia test was used to validate the normality assumption, and it revealed that univariate and multivariate normality were not achieved (p.001). For this reason, the WLSMV estimation method was used for CFA. As in the adaptation study for the three-factor structure, when the modification suggestions (four modifications with estimated parameter changes above.10) presented by the analysis regarding the error values of the items within the same dimensions were made, it was observed that the fit indices indicated the acceptable level for model-data fit (χ²/df = 3,202; CFI =.911, RMSEA =.062, SRMR=.047). In addition, the standardized path coefficients of the observed variables are between.49 and.96, and the absence of error values greater than.76 indicates that the structure is verified. For this reason, it can be said that the data obtained from the measurement tool are suitable for use in this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>In the analysis of the data, the "stats" (R Core Team, 2020), "haven" <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Wickham &amp; Miller, 2020)</ref>, "MVN" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Korkmaz et al., 2014)</ref>, "Hmisc" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Frank &amp; Harrell, 2020)</ref>, "lavaan" <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>, and "semPlot" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Epskamp &amp; Stuber, 2014)</ref> packages were used in the R software. Before the analysis of the data obtained, 21 individuals who left the whole scale blank in one or more of the measurement tools given in the application and had missing data in their demographic information were excluded from the data set. In addition, considering the Mahalanobis distance coefficients in terms of variables used in the model, the versatile extreme values (n = 31) were removed from the data set because they do not belong to any group systematically. Whether the data met the assumption of normality was examined by Mardia's test of normality. It was found that both univariate and multivariate normality were not provided (p &lt;.001). Since a normal distribution was not provided to determine the relationships between variables, the Spearman rank difference correlation was examined. Since the WLSMV method is recommended to be used when the data does not show a normal distribution <ref type="bibr">(Finney &amp; DiStefano, 2006)</ref>, the structural equation model (SEM) established in this study to reveal the relationships between variables was established with the WLSMV method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Before the structural equation modeling, the Spearman rank difference correlation was examined in order to obtain preliminary information about the relationships between variables and to form a basis for modeling. The results obtained are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The variables in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> were obtained with the average scores of the relevant measurement tools and dimensions (for CS). When the correlation coefficients were examined, there was a positive relationship among all variables. If the coefficients are smaller than.30, it is at a low level; when they are between.30 and.49, it is at a medium level; and when they are.50 and larger, there is a high level of correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>. All coefficients were statistically significant except for the correlation coefficient between listening and writing variables. For this reason, no relationship was established between listening and writing variables in SEM.</p><p>A structural equation model, which is assumed to predict the CS of LS, ESS, RH, and WD, was established under the name of Model 1. On a suggestion by the program, two modifications were made regarding the established model, which were also theoretically related. One of the modifications was the covariance between the error values of ESS and LS. In the model, it was seen that the endogenous variables of ESS and LS were explained only by the exogenous variables of WD and RH. However, it is known that many environmental factors can affect both speaking and listening. Listening and speaking are two interrelated and complementary language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Göçer, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nan, 2018)</ref>. A person learns to speak by listening; speaking improves the acquisition and internalization of new information and provides a creative use of language. It provides a large number of language materials to be used in listening and speaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nan, 2018)</ref>. For this reason, new exogenous variables were added to the model in order to reduce the unexplained part (error) of the speaking and listening endogenous variables.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, different variables were not focused on. Therefore, the proposed modification between the errors of the two variables is included in the model. Another modification suggestion is among the errors of the second (self-expression) and fourth (willingness to communicate) dimensions of the CS scale. Given that both errors belong to dimensions for measuring the same skill, adding the modification to the model was considered suitable. Studies revealing the relationship between self-expression and willingness to communicate variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baki, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Karadağ, 2019)</ref> constitute the rationale for the proposed modification. Model 2: The full latent variable model created with the suggested corrections is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The fit coefficients of Models 1 and 2 and the cut-off values that were acceptable in the literature and indicate good fit are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kline, 2015)</ref> When Model 2 fit indices are compared with cut-off values in the literature, it is seen that CFI and SRMR values indicate perfect fit, while RMSEA values show acceptable fit. The value of χ² / df was statistically significant (p &lt;.001). This value showed that there was a significant difference between the theoretical model and the established model. However, as the sample size increased, the significance increased, so it rarely points out that there was no difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Weston &amp; Gore Jr, 2006)</ref>. For this reason, it was accepted that the model fits the data. The direct and indirect effects of Model 2 are included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> was examined, it was seen that all path coefficients, error variances, and covariances between variables were significant. There are low level positive and significant relationships between RH, LS, and ESS, at.267 and.263, respectively. These results showed that the first hypothesis of the research was confirmed. The second hypothesis, which stated that there was a positive relationship between WD and ESS, was confirmed by the moderately positive (.328) relationship between the variables. There was a moderate and highly positive relationship between LS and ESS, which was thought to directly affect CS, as.341 and.682, respectively. This relationship revealed that the third hypothesis of the research was also confirmed. Finally, when the indirect relationships between the RH and WD and CS were examined, it was found that WD affected CS through the effective speech variable, while the RH affected CS through both ESS and LS. These effects were found to be low-level positive, at.224,.180 and.090, respectively, and it was determined that the fourth hypothesis was also accepted.</p></div>

The results of the study, in which the relationship expressed conceptually in the literature was tested with a comprehensive model, are as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effect of RH on LS &amp; ESS</head><p>The Model 2 established in the study showed that the RH had a weak direct significant (r = .267, p &lt;.05) effect on the LS. Studies revealing the relationship between LS and reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Demir, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Diakidoy et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Wolf et al., 2019)</ref> also support this finding. In one of these studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Demir (2017)</ref> revealed that the habit of reading books and the time allocated for reading books have a significant effect on the development of LS. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Diakidoy et al. (2005)</ref> found that listening and reading scores were significantly correlated at all four different grade levels in primary and secondary school, and the relationship between the two variables was stronger as competence in decoding processes improved. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Wolf et al. (2019)</ref> concluded that "reading comprehension explained 34% of the variance in listening comprehension, and listening comprehension explained 40% of the variance in reading comprehension" (p. 1747). Studies show that vocabulary was an especially important factor that improved this relationship. Because vocabulary is an important element, which contributes to understanding what is both read and heard <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Wolf et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Wolfgramm, Suter, &amp; Göksel, 2016)</ref>. Exposing themselves to practical and contextual words through listening improves their vocabulary in reading, which positively affects reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nan, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In Model 2, one of the variables in which the RH has a positive direct effect was speech self-efficacy. This effect was weak but significant, according to the established model (r = .263, p &lt;.05). It was seen in studies conducted on similar samples that obtained findings that matched the current study. Among these, the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tekşan and Çinpolat (2018)</ref> reported that there was a positive and significant relationship (r =.515) between prospective teachers' reading habits and their perceptions of speech self-efficacy. The significant relationships between variables, such as the time allocated for reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Demir, 2017)</ref>, the frequency and amount of reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hayran, 2020)</ref>, and the self-efficacy of speech were determined. The studies in which it was conducted also support the results of the current research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship Between WD and ESS</head><p>WD was found to have a moderate effect (r =.328) on ESS in Model 2. The results of some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carlisle, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dockrell &amp; Connelly, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hubert, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Motallebzadeh et al., 2018)</ref> in which the relationship between speaking and writing was reported, support these findings. Although these studies reveal the relationship between the skill dimension, not the writing disposition, and speaking, their findings are remarkable. In one of these studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Motallebzadeh et al. (2018)</ref> found that there is a high level of correlation between the speaking and writing skills of EFL students. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hubert (2008)</ref>, in his study with university students learning Spanish as a foreign language, revealed that this correlation is weak at the beginner level and much stronger at intermediate and advanced levels. Similar findings showing the relationship between speaking and writing were found in studies conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Carlisle (1996)</ref> with students with learning difficulties, and with primary school students by <ref type="bibr">Dockrell &amp; Connely (2016)</ref>. This is also important in terms of showing that the relationship between speaking and writing is not limited to the results obtained from a particular sample group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship Between LS, ESS, &amp; CS</head><p>Model 2 demonstrates that LS has a moderate effect (r =.341) on CS.

In their study, Davenport <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sypher et al. (1989)</ref> found that various aspects of listening (selective listening, short-term listening, short-term listening with rehearsal, lecture listening, interpretive listening) and each of the skills related to communication (cognitive differantiation, persuasive arguments, self-monitoring, perspective-taking) revealed medium and high positive correlations. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Şimşek (2019)</ref> found a significant positive correlation between effective listening and mental and behavioral communication levels, and ineffective listening and mental, affective, and behavioral communication levels. Considering these results, it can be said that one of the factors determining the quality of communication is effective LS.</p><p>According to Model 2, ESS has a strong influence on CS (r =.682). This result is similar to the findings of studies in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baki, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bria &amp; Jouybar, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Motallebzadeh et al., 2018)</ref> that reveal the relationship between speech as a whole and CS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baki (2018)</ref> found in his study that there was a significant positive correlation between speech self-efficacy and CS of Turkish prospective teachers. Similar findings were obtained in the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bria and Jouybar (2016)</ref>. In this study conducted with EFL students, a statistically highly significant relationship (r =.786) was found between the willingness to communicate and the students' oral fluency. Accordingly, it was determined that those who have a higher level of willingness to communicate express themselves more fluently. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Motallebzadeh et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect Relationships Between RH, WD, and CS</head><p>The Model 2 showed that WD affects CS with the effective speaking mediator variable and the effect was weak (r = .224). <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Motallebzadeh et al.

In the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Saracaloğlu et al. (2009)</ref>, it was found that there is a positive and weakly significant relationship between prospective teachers' reading interests and the competence sub-dimensions of their CS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kaynar (2007)</ref> found in his study with high school students that the effect of reading habits on improving vocabulary was positively reflected in communication and improved students' CS. Attitude can affect the reading skill level that a person will ultimately acquire through its effect on factors such as participation and practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(McKenna, Kear, &amp; Ellsworth, 1995)</ref>. Communication was also a skill area that required a certain level of participation and practice. Therefore, a person who reads books regularly and has a positive attitude towards reading can find the opportunity to put it into action through listening and speaking in communication environments. The fact that the RH was a significant predictor of CS can be associated with this situation.</p><p>A remarkable point the Model 2 was that ESS functioned as a mediator variable in the relationship between both reading habit and WD and CS. Other studies that investigated the relationship between speaking and communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baki, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bria &amp; Jouybar, 2016)</ref> found the role of this mediator variable and the critical function of speech in communication became more understandable.</p><p>The model also found a low-level significant relationship (r =.149; p &lt;.05) between RH and WD, which was related to CS.

In addition, the results obtained in the present study support the findings of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bolat, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Eroğlu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Lee, 2005)</ref> in which the relationship between dimensions such as writing self-efficacy and writing skills and reading habits was reported. It would be appropriate to discuss the possible reasons for this relationship on the basis of the theoretical connection between reading and writing, which was the umbrella concept of two variables. Both skills are developmental, mostly based on similar knowledge and communicative processes in which there is a transfer of knowledge and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Shanahan, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>All these findings reveal the importance of linguistic skills in improving prospective teachers' communication skills. Therefore, a teacher education isolated from language skills will have a negative impact on teachers' communication activities in and out of the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>In this study, a model that reveals the relationship between language and CS was tested. Since there are many linguistic variables that can affect communication processes, future research may focus on variables that are not tested in this model. These include various dimensions of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, such as metacognition, motivation, anxiety, and self-regulation. The effects of these factors alone or as synergistic effects on CS or communication-related sub-skill areas can be investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bodie &amp; Fitch-Hauser (2010)</ref> stated that if listening is a critical component of communication, it is necessary to discover how the structures that affect communication affect listening, and thus the role and function of listening in the communication process should be further defined. This recommendation can also be generalized to other language skill areas. In this context, the effects of various factors such as personality structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Sims, 2017)</ref>, culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Collier, 1986), and</ref><ref type="bibr">gender (Marsnik, 1993)</ref> on language skills can be analyzed comparatively.</p><p>The participants of this study were prospective teachers. In future studies, the generalizability of the model tested in this research to different samples can be investigated. Since it was not included among the hypotheses, the role of participants' demographic and socioeconomic differences in different CS levels was not emphasized in the study. Gender is one of these variables. The correlation coefficients in the model established in this study, where the study participants were mostly women, and the coefficients in the model established in a study where male participants are predominant or both genders are equivalent may differ. This situation may be subject to investigation.</p><p>In addition, age-dependent change in the relationship between language skills can be determined by longitudinal studies. Two or more models tested in the same study can be analyzed comparatively. In the study, the relationship between variables was discussed in a theoretical and research-based manner, and the mediator variables that were effective in the emergence of this relationship were not focused on much. In future studies, the mediating role of variables such as vocabulary, phonological awareness, and declarative knowledge can be tested. In addition, the research was carried out with participants whose native language is Turkish. A similar study can be conducted on participants who are learning Turkish or another language as a second language, and the relationships between variables can be investigated.</p><p>Considering that one of the basic competencies that a teacher should have is communication skills, it is clear that determining the relationship between this skill and which linguistic variables and at what level will have various practical benefits. First of all, this gives an idea to education administrators and experts on which elements should be given priority in the development of prospective teachers' and teachers' communication skills. This situation has a potential benefit, especially in shaping the content and general structure of pre-service and in-service training. These trainings can be organized on topics such as effective listening strategies, factors that facilitate the acquisition of reading habits, applied activities that will improve speaking self-efficacy, and practices that can positively affect affective orientations towards writing. In addition, in the current study, a high level of relationship was found between listening skills and speaking self-efficacy. This finding is an important argument for many curricula where these two linguistic outcomes are combined under the name of "verbal interaction skills." The relationship between affective, cognitive, and behavioral variables of language and communication skills can be tested on a larger sample in more comprehensive studies. The results of such studies can be shared with various stakeholders, including pre-service teachers, teachers, and experts through an authorized institution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>From the model established by this study, it is possible to draw a series of conclusions regarding the structure of communication and its relationship with language skill areas. In the model, LS and ESS are variables that directly affect CS, while WD affects CS indirectly through ESS and reading habits indirectly through both LS and ESS. The variable that affects CS at the highest level is ESS, and ESS is in a higher relationship with LS compared to other variables. However, the relationships between all the variables are significant. This network of relationships demonstrates that the development of language skills will have a positive effect on CS. However, the findings also support the assumption that language skills are a whole and that practices aimed at developing a skill area reflect positively on other language skills. This positive transfer can occur not only among cognitive factors such as skills but also among variables with different qualities such as self-efficacy, attitude, and disposition. As a result, the theoretical framework was supported by structural equation modeling in the study conducted to reveal the relationships between language skills and the effects of these skills on CS. The network of relationships between language skills and CS has been proven on a statistical basis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
