<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Although the quality of health services has been improved and infection prevention and control methods have been developed, the occurrence of nosocomial infections remains a health threat to patients and hospital staff <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Due to the biological characteristics of nosocomial infection pathogens, such as antibiotic resistance and high pathogenicity, as well as the sensitivity and frailty of hospitalized patients, there is a strong relationship between nosocomial infection and mortality <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>.</p><p>Nosocomial infections affect many patients around the world. Roughly, 15% of hospitalized patients suffer from these infections. The economic losses from these infections are increasing. The incidence rate in developed countries is about 3.5% to 12%. The prevalence of these infections in underdeveloped countries is about three times higher than in developed countries <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. In these countries, this rate varies between 5.7-19.1% <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. In Iran, most of these infections occur in intensive care units and surgical wards <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Giving the role and duties of clinical staff in hospitals, they can be a factor in the transmission of nosocomial infections. Adherence to infection control instructions such as the use of masks and cleaning and disinfection of hands and equipment after contact with patients and their contaminated equipment is the most important duties of these employees. Therefore, adherence to these behaviors can reduce nosocomial infections (3).</p><p>To prevent and control nosocomial infections, it is essential to determine the predictors of preventive behaviors of nosocomial infection. For this end, effective models are needed to improve patient safety and reduce nosocomial infections (6). Social cognitive theory is a comprehensive theory. According to this theory, behavior is formed from the interaction of environmental, personal and behavioral factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>Self-regulation, self-e cacy, outcome expectation, and environment are important constructs of social cognitive theory (8, 9). These constructs can be used as a guide for developing procedures and implementing of interventions to change healthy behaviors. Bandura emphasized that self-regulation strategies (i.e., ability to self-monitor and evaluate their behavior) must be used to set goals and plan to adopt and maintain a behavior (8). Self-monitoring is a guide to evaluating one's progress toward goals, which leads one to a behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The results of the study indicated that self-regulation is one of the determinants of behavior related to standard precautions such as hand hygiene <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>A study showed that nurses in the intensive care unit need to strengthen self-e cacy as one of the internal factors in order to carry out infection control-related behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Another study also showed that self-e cacy is related to nursing care <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p>In previous studies, the effect of social cognitive factors on hand hygiene as one of the measures in the control and prevention of nosocomial infections has been investigated, but the effect of social cognitive factors on compliance with standard precautions for nosocomial infection control is not well understood.</p><p>In a study that was conducted to identify social cognitive factors affecting on hand hygiene in hospital nurses, subjective norms, attitudes, perceived behavioral control, risk perception and intention were identi ed as important predictors of hand hygiene <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Structural equation modeling helps researchers determine how the theory works to in uence the outcome because it approaches the model through predictor variables, the mediation, and the consequence of the variables' relationships with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. It is used for testing several theoretical models, which de ne the structure of constructs and their relationship with each other <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</p><p>This study aimed to provide Structural equation model to predict social cognitive theory on behaviors related to prevent and control of nosocomial infections in nursing staff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>This study used a cross-sectional, self-reported design in evaluating the predictors of behaviors related to prevent and control nosocomial infections among nursing staff.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and setting</head><p>The research sample was selected from the nursing staff (nurse and assistant nurses) working in the intensive care units including CCU, ICU, NICU, dialysis units in academic hospitals in Mashhad, Iran in 2020. A convenience sample of 280 nursing staff were selected for the study. Inclusion criteria were willingness to participate in the study, employment in intensive care units for more than 6 months. Exclusion criteria was incomplete of the questionnaire by study participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study tools</head><p>This study used a self-report questionnaire to collect data. This questionnaire included 2 part; part 1 included demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, educational status, training about nosocomial infections and job). Part 2 elicited constructs of social cognitive theory including perceived barriers, task self-e cacy, self-regulation, outcome expectations, perceived environment, modeling, social support, and behaviors related to prevent and control of nosocomial infections. This part of questionnaire included 36 items (perceived barriers 5 items, task self-e cacy 4 items, self-regulation 5 items, outcome expectations 4 items, perceived environment 2 items, modeling 3 items, social support 3 items, and practices of nosocomial infection control 10 items). Each item in this section were scored from 1 to 5 on a Likert scale from completely disagreement to completely agreement.</p><p>The content validity methods were used to assess the validity of the questionnaire. For this purpose, the opinions of 10 expert in health education, nursing, and infection control on the items of the questionnaire were received and the items were modi ed or deleted based on their suggestions. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity ratio (CVR) assessed for each items of structures (self-e cacy, modeling, social support, self-regulation, perceived environment, perceived barriers, outcome expectation, and behaviors). The CVR value for the items was between 0.76 and 0.91. Also, the CVI value for the items was between 0.81 and 0.98. The reliability of the instrument was evaluated using test-retest method and Cronbach's alpha test. For external reliability, 30 nurses and assistant nurses completed the questionnaires twice with an interval of 10 days, except for the study sample, and the data were analyzed by Pearson correlation coe cient. Cronbach's alpha test was also used to assess internal validity (Table1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>The collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) for evaluating the normality of variables and descripting of statistics.</p><p>The t of the constructs of social cognitive theory for behaviors related to the control of nosocomial infections in hospital nursing staff was examined using the latent variable structural equation model (SEM) with AMOS software version 24. Structural equation modeling is a detailed statistical method for testing models that contain both causal relationship and correlations between observed variable and latent variables. SEM is used in social and behavioral sciences, education, biology, economy, marketing and medicine, which is based on substantial or suggested theories that describe and explain phenomena under investigation. We used R2 and the path coe cients to test the t of the model. Before carrying out the SEM analysis, the normality of variables was examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. All the indicators in the model were treated as re ective indicators of their respective constructs. The goodness-of-t of the model was con rmed using the χ2 statistic, RMSEA (Root-Mean-Square Error of Approximation), CFI (Comparative Fit index), IFI (Incremental Fit Index), PNFI (Parsimonious Normal Fit Index), and PGFI (Parsimonious Good Fit Index) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Parameter estimation and effect analysis were performed using the bootstrapping method. Statistical signi cance was set at P&lt;0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Participants had a mean of age 35.42±8.06 years. Fifty-six percent (N=157) of participants in this sample were men, and most of the samples had a bachelor's degree (N=181). Eighty percent of the samples participated in an infection control training course (N=223) (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>Before performing the structural equation model, rst, the remote points and the normality of the variables were examined. The remote points were checked with the help of the value of Mahalanobis distance of each observation and if necessary, they were removed. In the study of critical ratios of skewness or elongation of variables, the normality of multivariate was con rmed, therefore, the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters. Then, the structural equation model of social cognitive theory constructs was examined and analyzed. Based on the results of the indicators, the desired model has been accepted) X 2 = 1184.739 (p&gt; 0.05), df= 572, X 2 /df = 2.07, CFI = 0.910, RMSEA = 0.062, PNFI = 0.739, and PGFI = 0.811, IFI = 0.910, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>The effect size of social support on perceived environment was 0.502, perceived environment on task self-e cacy 0.264, social support on task self-e cacy 0.550, outcome expectations on self-regulation 0.729, task self-e cacy on self-regulation 0.140, perceived environment on self-regulation 0.037, selfregulation and outcome expectations and barrier on behavior Respectively 0.490/0, 0.780, -0.211. Also, the percentage of direct and indirect effects were (62.68) and <ref type="bibr">(37.32)</ref>, respectively (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p><p>The constructs of barriers, perceived environment, outcome expectations, task self-e cacy, social support, and modeling were able to predict 70% of the variance of Self-regulation construct. Also, the constructs of this model were eventually able to predict 15% of the variance of behavior construct (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The results of the structural equation model showed that self-regulation, outcome expectations, and barrier constructs had a direct effect on behavior and the highest effect was related to self-regulation structure (p &lt; 0.001). The direct effects of the constructs included 62.68% of the total effects. The constructs of social support, modeling, perceived environment and task self-e cacy had an indirect effect on behavior and the most impact was related to the constructs of perceived environment (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Indirect impacts of structures accounted for 37.32% of the total impacts (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, the role of social cognitive theory constructs as predictive factors of behavior related to the control and prevention of nosocomial infections in hospital nursing staff was evaluated. Structural equation analysis shows that the theoretical model is suitable for the data and explains the nosocomial infections control behavior in the hospital nursing staff. In the test of goodness-of-t of the nal modi ed model, the absolute t indices (χ2, and RMSEA), the comparative t indices (IFI and CFI) and parsimonious t indices (PCFI and PNFI) met the criteria, indicating that the model-t well with the data. The literature described that a good model is with insigni cant χ2 (p ≥ 0.05), IFI ≥ 0.90, PGFI ≥ 0.50, RMSEA ≤ 0.08, PNFI ≥ 0.50, and CFI ≥ 0.90 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> .</p><p>Our research results show that self-regulation directly plays an important role in the performance of hospital nursing in controlling and preventing nosocomial infections. Consistent with these results, a study showed that the process of self-regulatory is an important predictor of hand hygiene <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. In fact, when individuals control their performance, they are more likely to set more realistic and challenging goals, thereby helping to overcome behavioral barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, the results show that independent of self-regulatory behaviors, self-e cacy has little effect on behaviors. Consistent with our results, studies have shown that one of the determinants of healthy behavior is self-e cacy, which can predict various healthy behaviors, including prevention of nosocomial infections and hand hygiene (26, 27). Although self-e cacy is often a powerful predictor of behavioral adoption and maintenance in healthy behaviors, a meta-analysis showed that self-e cacy has different effects on healthy behaviors are (28). Researchers also describe people who have a high level of selfe cacy trying harder to achieve their goals when faced with obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, outcome expectation is in uenced by modeling, and directly and indirectly affects the behavior of nursing staff through self-regulation. Other researchers have also shown that observational learning can enhance outcome expectations and can in uence behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Contrary to these results, in another study that showed the results of predicting the constructs of protection motivation theory integrated with the outcome expectation construct of the social cognitive theory related to protective measures against Ebola infection, the outcome expectation construct did not predict the protective behaviors of nurses against Ebola infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that the perceived environment affects barriers. Barriers also have a direct and negative effect on the preventive behavior of nosocomial infections in hospital nurses. Consistent with these results, other studies have shown that barriers such as insu cient knowledge, personal attitude and judgment, environmental constraints, and insu cient leadership skills have a negative effect on nurses' adherence to standard precautions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, social support is another determinant of nosocomial infections prevention behavior, which indirectly affects it. The in uence of social support on preventive behaviors of nosocomial infections was through self-regulation, self-e cacy, perceived environment and modeling. Based on these results, the literature describes that self-e cacy and social support are important facilitator of self-regulation, especially planning (36). In another studies, social support, including institutional and management support for stablishing a safe environment and providing facilities, had a signi cant impact on compliance with standard precautions (such as hand hygiene) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</p><p>Our results showed that modeling has a negative effect on the preventive behavior of nosocomial infections in hospital nursing staff. This factor also had an indirect effect on behavior through barriers. The literature points out that the role of a mentors as a role model affects the hand hygiene behavior of nursing students <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. In another study, the lack of appropriate role models was identi ed as one of the problems of non-compliance with standard perceptive measures, which was caused by environmental factors and barriers (including con icts between professional, unsupported organizational culture and nancial issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, perceived environment had an indirect effect on the preventive behavior of nosocomial infections in the hospital nursing staff through barriers. Consistent with these results, earlier studies have shown that environment factors (for example, lake of access to personal protective equipment, heavy workload, and crowded ward) can have a signi cant impact on compliance with standard precautions by healthcare staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study tested the predictive effect of social cognitive theory constructs on a set of behaviors preventing nosocomial infections. While, previous studies have examined factors related to hand hygiene behavior. This study was conducted in all intensive care units in several hospitals, therefore, the generalized ndings are appropriate. One of the weaknesses of the study is that the effect of knowledge and demographic factors such as age, gender and education, which have been identi ed in previous studies as important factors on adherence to preventive behaviors of nosocomial infections, was not examined. This study was also conducted in teaching hospitals that have special conditions in the hospitalization, treatment and nursing-care processes, and therefore it is necessary to examine the interaction of environmental, personal and behavioral factors in other non-teaching and private hospitals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The present study demonstrates that self-regulation, outcome expectations, and barriers have a signi cant impact on adherence to preventive behavior of nosocomial infections in nursing staff. In addition, current analyzes shows that although self-e cacy is an important precursor to self-regulation, social support was even a stronger predictor. The social support indirectly affected self-regulation through self-e cacy. In addition, social support directly led participants to use self-regulation strategies, and therefore, more compliance with prevention behaviors of nosocomial infections. It is suggested that policy makers and planners try to reduce barriers, strengthen behavioral motivation, and empower nursing staff by teaching self-regulatory strategies such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and planning to promote behaviors that prevent nosocomial infections. In addition, it is recommended that future behavioral psychology models be used in future studies to test the relationship between other variables and preventive behavior of nosocomial infections in other health care providers and non-governmental hospitals.</p></div>
