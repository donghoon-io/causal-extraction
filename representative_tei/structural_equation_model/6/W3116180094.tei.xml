<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Addiction to drugs and alcohol constitutes one of the significant factors underlying the decline in life expectancy in the US. Several context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In particular emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and self-development efforts are known to be some of the factors associated with addiction recovery. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not directly observable and quantifying, and assessing their impact can be difficult. Based on social media posts of users engaged in substance use and recovery on the forum Reddit, we employed two psycholinguistic tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Empath and activities of substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze behavior underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to assess the effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>We found that both emotional distress and physical pain significantly influence addiction recovery behavior. Self-development activities and social relationships of the substance users were also found to enable recovery. Furthermore, within the context of self-development activities, those that were related to influencing the mental and physical well-being of substance users were found to be positively associated with addiction recovery. We also determined that lack of social activities and physical exercise can enable a relapse. Moreover, geography, especially life in rural areas, appears to have a greater correlation with addiction relapse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The paper describes how observable variables can be extracted from social media and then be used to model important latent constructs that impact addiction recovery and relapse. We also report factors that impact self-induced addiction recovery and relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Substance use constitutes a major contemporary health epidemic. There were 70,237 substance use overdose deaths in 2017, which was a 9.6% increase from 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In the US, abuse of alcohol and other illicit drugs is estimated to lead to a monetary impact of over $740 billion annually because of increased expenses related to loss of work productivity, health care, and crime <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Substance use can also increase the risk for liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, or lung diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and especially infectious diseases such as Hepatitis B, or C, and HIV/ AIDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Drug addiction was usually considered a moral or character flaw. This view has undergone a significant change and addiction is now considered a chronic illness characterized by health deterioration, poor social functioning, and loss of control over substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Substance use has also been established to change the brain function and makes a user crave drugs. The substance use journey typically begins with experimentation and because of the perceived positive effects, a person gets addicted. After an individual decides to break the addiction cycle, they typically experience physical and emotional withdrawals that are manifested through sadness, restlessness, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and cramping. Depending on factors such as the substances used as well as the amount and duration of use, such symptoms typically last for 3-5 days and can be managed by medications, vitamins, and exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The notion of "recovery" is polysemous in that it may be considered as an ongoing process or as a granular event <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Regardless, recovery is a long-term process requiring continuous effort and diligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Substance withdrawal management regimes that can lead to recovery from addiction involve managing both physical and emotional symptoms experienced by individuals as they give up drugs. To manage these symptoms, individuals are typically recommended to focus on self-development <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> with the help of their families, and friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Many individuals however, relapse into drug use because they fail to follow substance use disorder treatment regimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Though managing emotional and physical symptoms during drug withdrawals is manifestly important, these constructs are multifarious, latent (i.e. not directly observable), and difficult or impossible to directly measure. In this paper, we have proposed the use of structural equation modeling (SEM)-a multivariate latent variable modeling technique to estimate critical latent constructs (italicized hereafter) such as emotional distress, physical pain, self-development, and relationships by analyzing social media activities of substance users. Social media has generated recent interest as a novel source of information in drug abuse epidemiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Being semi-anonymous, social media consists of unfiltered and self-reported conversations and activities of an individual. Of the different social media platforms, we used drug use and recovery data available on Reddit. This social media forum is the fifth most visited website in the USA and has over 330 million active users <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Reddit is a community-based social media forum where the communities (called subreddits) are created based on common interest. Members of the subreddit can post, vote, and comment in the subreddit. Each subreddit has moderators who ensure that the content posted by the members of the subreddit are topically focused. At the time of writing, there are more than 138,000 subreddits on Reddit <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, with a number of subreddits focusing on recreational drug use (RDU) and drug addiction recovery (DAR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem formulation and overview of proposed approach</head><p>Our aim was to determine the effect of emotional distress, physical pain, self-development efforts, relationships (of the drug user), and geographic disparities on drug addiction recovery and relapse, using SEM as a rigorous modeling methodology. Solving this problem required addressing the following sub-problems: first, we needed to identify and determine the instances of emotional distress, physical pain, self-development efforts, relationships, and geographic disparities in the social media posts and activity of the drug users. Then, we had to come up with a model to infer the relationships between the unobserved constructs (emotional distress, physical pain, self-development efforts, and relationships) and the observable construct drug addiction recovery (determined by observing if a user posted in a drug addiction recovery forum). Our approach consisted of the following steps: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> we used two psychometrically validated dictionaries, namely, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Empath, to identify instances of emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, self-development efforts, and geographic disparities present in the posts of the drug user. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> We also utilized the forum activity of the users on Reddit to identify the instances of self-development efforts and relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> We applied SEM to identify and quantify the relationship between emotional distress, physical pain, self-development, relationships, and geographic disparities on one hand and drug addiction recovery and relapse on the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior work</head><p>A number of recent works have utilized data from social media in conjunction with methods from machine learning and natural language processing to study and understand patterns associated with a diverse set of health-related issues, such as influenza <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In terms of studying substance abuse, early works focused on manual identification of themes and tonality of the drug use posts on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The image-based social media platform Instagram was analyzed to conduct content analysis for codeine misuse in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Studies have also investigated the use of social media for examining geographic differences in opioid-related discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and identified topics related to substance delivery methods, drug types, and other factors associated with recreational drug use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> transductive classification was applied to identify opioid addicts on Twitter. Other works have identified opioid use related tweets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and studied information sharing amongst drug users on Reddit <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Drug addiction recovery has been the focus of far fewer works. Among the latter, in our previous work Eshleman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, random forests were used with subreddit activity as features to identify users open to addiction recovery interventions in a predictive setting. The Gini impurity criterion, which measures how often a random element from a set would be labeled incorrectly if labeled according to the distribution of labels in the set, was used to rank the different subreddits on the basis of their importance. This analysis found correlations amongst subreddit categories, such as, mental health, spirituality, and relationships with addiction recovery behavior. The SEM model in the current work was developed using two latent variables-"relationships" and "mental and physical well-being", both of which were directly inspired by findings reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In particular, we used user activity in the following subreddits: "relationships", "rela-tionship_advice", "parenting", and "childfree" to reflect the latent variable "relationships". Similarly, we used subreddits, such as, "meditation", "yoga", "gainit", "bodyweightfitness", and "running" to estimate the latent variable "mental and physical well-being". In other works, MacLean et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, used a trans-theoretical model of behavior change to predict the stages of addiction recovery and relapse. Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, used the cox regression model to identify transitions to addiction recovery subreddits. Chancellor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, studied recovery-related posts on Reddit to identify clinically unverified treatments for drug withdrawal popular amongst drug users on Reddit. Rubya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>., investigated how users in online recovery communities enact anonymity Finally, Tamersoy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, studied Reddit forums to characterize smoking and drinking abstinence and were able to predict long-term and short-term abstinence.</p><p>The current work addresses two outstanding issues in this problem domain at the state-of-the-art: first, drug addiction recovery and relapse involves (latent) variables that cannot be directly measured and have to be inferred from observable variables. Second, the addiction and recovery processes involve complex interplay of relationships between the observed and latent variables, which needs to be characterized. Current methods in the area involve variables that have to be explicitly measured and consequently are incapable of addressing these two issues. We demonstrate how SEM can be a powerful framework to test, evaluate, and characterize multivariate causal relationships in addiction recovery and relapse where both observable and latent factors are involved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The withdrawal management model obtained using LIWC variables</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary statistics</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we present the correlations between the LIWC indicators in the withdrawal management model. From this data we observe that the majority of the LIWC variables are positively correlated with each other. We also observe some correlations that are not so obvious. For example, we see that the second (0.78) and third highest (0.72) correlations were for the categories "swear" and "sexual", and "anger" and "sexual". As displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the high correlation was due to common expletives in these categories. We also see that the LIWC category "health" had high correlation values with categories, such as "negative emotion" (0.39), "sad" (0.25), and "anxiety" (0.28). This indicates that users in our dataset usually talked about health (physical symptoms) in the context of negative emotions-as may be expected for users experiencing withdrawals.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> we compare the values of the indicators for "emotional distress", and "physical pain" between the users who posted or did not post in DAR subreddits. The corresponding table for Empath variables is presented in Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>. We used  LIWC to determine the value of each indicator for the posts of drug users in our dataset.</p><p>Then the distributions of the values of indicators for the set of users who posted in a DAR subreddit was compared with the set of users who did not post in a DAR subreddit with the null hypothesis being that there was no difference between the distributions. The Mann-Whitney U-test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a non-parametric test, was used to compare the distributions and we observe statistically significant differences between the two set of users for each observable variable. The values of the indicators of the latent variable "emotional distress" were found to be higher for the users who displayed addiction recovery behavior. Posts corresponding to addiction recovery behavior typically consisted of higher values for the LIWC categories: "feel" (20%, p &lt; 0.005), "anger" (22.2%, p &lt; 0.005), "authentic" (9%, p &lt; 0.005), "sexual" (13.3%, p &lt; 0.005), "negative emotion" (20%, p &lt; 0.005), "sad" (25%, p &lt; 0.005), "affect" (7.5%, p &lt; 0.005), "anxiety" (26.0%, p &lt; 0.005), and "swear" (16.6%, p &lt; 0.005) as compared to the other LIWC categories used by us (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Similarly, the values for the indicators of the latent variable "physical pain" were higher for the users who displayed addiction recovery behavior. Accordingly, our data shows that drug users complained about their health and physical discomforts during the withdrawal phase. Correspondingly, these posts were found to have higher values for the relevant LIWC categories: "body" (5.4%, p &lt; 0.005), "health" (30.3%, p &lt; 0.005), "biology" (13.3%, p &lt; 0.005), and "death" (28.5%, p &lt; 0.005) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Positive correlations are color-coded in blue and negative correlations in red. The size of each square represents the magnitude of the correlations. As this visualization indicates, every variable-pair in the model was positively correlated. The two highest correlations values were observed for the variable pairs "anger" and "swear" followed by "anger" and "sexual"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> displays the final LIWC withdrawal management model with factor loadings (the value for correlations are not displayed in the figure to maintain clarity). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the effect of the variables "emotional distress" and "physical pain" on drug addiction recovery behavior is studied. We estimated the latent variable "emotional distress" with nine LIWC categories: "negative emotion", "sad", "anger", "anxiety", "feel", "affect", "swear", "sexual", and "authentic". The latent variable "physical pain" was estimated using four indicators "biology", "death", "health", and "body". All of the paths in the model were found to be statistically significant. Both "emotional distress" and "physical pain" were found to influence addiction recovery behavior. However, "emotional distress" was found to be more evident in withdrawal as compared to "physical pain"; all of the indicator variables for "emotional pain" were found to have a strong effect on withdrawal, with the LIWC categories "anger" and "swear" being the two most significant indicators.</p><p>RMSEA, SRMR, CFI, and TLI were used to assess the model fit. The results based on the hypothesized model indicated a decent fit with RMSEA = 0.08, TLI = 0.90, CFI = 0.95, and SRMR = 0.07. The relatively higher value observed for the RMSEA was due to the covariance between the LIWC categories. These covariances increased the number of paths that had to be estimated in the model, reduced the degrees of freedom of the model, and led to relatively higher RMSEA values. The values for the TLI, CFI, and SRMR indices all indicate high-quality model fit. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> summarizes the results of the final SEM model.  The withdrawal management model obtained using Empath variables</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary statistics</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> we present the correlations between the Empath indicators for the withdrawal management model. Similar to the LIWC variables, all of the Empath variables in the model were also found to be positively correlated with each other with the categories "pain" and "shame" (0.89) followed by "suffering" and "hate" (0.71) having the highest correlation values. The Empath category "suffering" was also found to be correlated with "medical_emergency" (0.22), "weakness" (0.25), "health" (0.34), Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Correlation diagram of the Empath variables present in the withdrawal management model (see also Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Positive correlations are color-coded in blue and negative correlations in red. The size of each square represents the magnitude of the correlations. As this visualization indicates, every variable-pair in the model is positively correlated. The two highest correlation values were observed for the variable-pairs "pain" and "shame" followed by "suffering" and "hate"</p><p>and "pain" (0.69) indicating that users in the withdrawal phase discussed physical symptoms in the context of distress. In Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> we compare the values of the Empath based indicators for "emotional distress", and "physical pain" between the users who post and do not post in DAR subreddits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path analysis</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> displays the Empath indicator-based withdrawal management model with factor loadings (the value for correlations are not displayed in the figure to maintain clarity). In this figure, the effect of "emotional distress" and "physical pain" on drug addiction recovery behavior is studied. We estimated the latent variable "emotional distress" with four Empath categories: "negative_emotion", "hate", "shame", and "suffering" The latent variable "physical pain" was estimated using four indicators ""pain", "medi-cal_emergency", "weakness", and "health". All of the paths in the model were found to be statistically significant. As was the case for the model built using LIWC indicators, both "emotional distress" and "physical pain" were found to influence addiction recovery behavior. All of the indicators for "emotional distress" had a strong positive effect, with "shame" and "suffering" being the most contributory. Similarly, all of the indicators for the "physical pain" had a strong positive effect, with "pain" having the highest effect. As opposed to the LIWC model, however, "physical pain" was found to be more evident in withdrawal as compared to "emotional distress". The model quality was determined using RMSEA, SRMR, CFI, and TLI. The hypothesized model indicated a good fit with RMSEA = 0.07, TLI = 0.96, CFI = 0.98, and SRMR = 0.03. Similar to the LIWC model, the relatively higher value observed for the RMSEA was due to the covariance between the Empath categories. The values for the TLI, CFI, and SRMR indices all indicate highquality model fit. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> summarizes this SEM model. The recovery efforts model obtained using subreddit activities</p></div>

From the figure and table, we observed that unlike the LIWC variables the correlation values between the forum activity displayed across different subreddits was low. The highest correlation was between the forums "careerguidance" and "resumes" (0.3), followed by "entrepreneur" and "careerguidance" (0.2).</p><p>The comparison of the forum activity for the users who posted and did not post in a DAR subreddit was conducted in a manner similar to that described in the withdrawal management model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>). The values of the subreddit activities corresponding to the latent variable "mental and physical well-being" were higher for users who displayed addiction recovery behavior. Some of these subreddits were: "fitness" (66.6%, p &lt; 0.005), "meditation" (85.7%, p &lt; 0.005), "yoga" (85.7%, p &lt; 0.005), "gainit" (66.6%, p &lt; 0.005), "bodyweightfitness" (100%, p &lt; 0.005), and "running" (75.8%, p &lt; 0.005) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>). Similarly, the values for the subreddit activities corresponding to the latent variable "career" were higher for users who displayed addiction recovery behavior. Some of these subreddits were: "jobs" (96.2%, p &lt; 0.005), "entrepreneur" (66.6%, p &lt; 0.005), "careerguidance" (66.6%, p &lt; 0.005), and "resumes" (66.6%, p &lt; 0.005). Finally, the values of the subreddit activities corresponding to the latent variable "relationships" were also found to be higher for users who displayed addiction recovery behavior. Examples of subreddits for which enhanced activity was observed included: "relationships" (66.6%, p &lt; 0.005), "relationship_advice" (50%, p &lt; 0.005), "parenting" (50%, p &lt; 0.005), and "childfree" (66.6%, p &lt; 0.005) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref>).</p></div>

We estimated the latent variable "mental and physical wellbeing" with six indicators: "fitness", "meditation", "yoga", "gainit", "bodyweightfitness", and "running". The latent variable "career" was estimated using four indicators "jobs", "entrepreneur", "careerguidance", "resumes". Finally, the latent variable "relationships" was estimated using the following four indicators: "relationship_advice", "relationships", "parenting", and "childfree".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of emotional distress and physical pain in withdrawal management</head><p>We observed that both emotional distress and physical pain played a significant role for redditors who display addiction recovery and relapse related behavior. To understand the reason behind this observation we further investigated the posts from individuals discussing their withdrawals from drugs. We observed that users As indicated by this model, "positive emotion΄", "career΄", and "urban΄" were found to positively influence the relapse behavior of a drug user typically experienced both physical pain and emotional distress during withdrawal. Also, we often observed users to have employed chemical treatments such as methadone and suboxone, alternative therapies such as kratom, xanax, and loperamide, as well as other supplements known to suppress physical symptoms of withdrawal. Interventions for assuaging emotional distress were found by us to be less prevalent. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref> we present example posts describing some of the measures taken by individuals to suppress physical pain and discomfort. Interestingly, many users who had successfully managed their withdrawal process and were well into recovery, were observed by us to display a sense of loss after giving up their drug of choice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationships</head><p>We found that "relationships" had a positive effect on addiction recovery. Unsurprisingly, friends and family play an important role in the addiction recovery efforts of an individual. There are many reasons that underlie this finding. First, the stigma associated with drug use causes an individual to feel shame and fear discrimination. Consequently, they don't feel safe to discuss their issues with co-workers, or strangers. It has been shown that addicts and recovering addicts feel comfortable in sharing their addictions and recovery journey with friends and family <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Research has  also highlighted the willingness and positive outcomes of users undergoing addiction recovery efforts with the help and support drug-free friends, family members, and significant others <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Our analysis of social media data led to similar conclusions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jobs and career</head><p>We observed a negative, albeit statistically insignificant, effect of career/job opportunities on addiction recovery behavior.

Our results identifying the impact of family and friends, selfdevelopment efforts, emotional distress and physical pain on addiction recovery can be utilized to provide direction for a person's recovery. For example, an individual in the initial stages of abstinence may be asked to focus on mental and physical well-being, and at least for some time stay away from high pressure situations (new jobs or returning to a previous stressful job). Their family and friends could also be made aware about their role in an individual's recovery and how they provide a safe non-judgmental space for the afflicted individual. Additionally, efforts could be made to manage emotional pains and cravings during and after the withdrawal period.</p></div>

The paper presents different SEM models to quantify the relationship Tomorrow will be day 10 from snorting dope and honestly it's been great! I also got a 2nd full time job at night last month so which keeps me busy and helps me sustain myself. Feels great to have some money for once!

It helped me stay busy and get over my cravings. The enjoyment I felt moving forward in my career was so much more enthralling than getting high off any other drug between a number of observable and latent variables and their link to substance addiction.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize social media data and SEM to measure the latent constructs associated with substance abuse and recovery. Our results underscore the value of information present on social media platforms like Reddit to the study of substance misuse and design of interventions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data source and participants</head><p>We used a set of 117 recreational drug use (RDU) subreddits, and 29 drug addiction recovery (DAR) subreddits reported in our prior works to identify users discussing drug use and recovery on Reddit <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> we had utilized the word2vec algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> to create a term embedding space. In this space related terms were grouped using an iterative set expansion technique to construct drug-use and addiction-recovery lexicons. These lexicons were subsequently employed to characterize the different subreddits following which bi-clustering was used to cluster the different RDU and DAR subreddits. These bi-clusters were further manually curated to arrive at two RDU, and DAR subreddits sets. For this paper, we further identified 170,097 unique users discussing their drug use and recovery from these two RDU and DAR subreddit sets. For each of these users we retrieved their 1000 most recent posts (the specific number of retrieved posts was platform imposed) using the praw api <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Finally, we filtered out those users who had less than five nonempty posts in the RDU and DAR subreddit sets. As a consequence of this filtering, we ended up with a set of 7025 users consisting of 2679 users who posted in both RDU and DAR subreddit, and 4346 users who posted only in an RDU subreddit. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">17</ref> we present example posts in different RDU and DAR subreddits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of modeling and analysis</head><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref> we display the key steps of our analysis process. We used LIWC or Empath to analyze the posts of the users in our dataset to extract language features, such as, negative emotions, anxiety, and pain, associated with recovery/relapse behavior of drug users. We next hypothesized certain unobserved (latent) variables for the observed features as well as the relationship between observed and latent variables. The model and its goodness of fit was iteratively analyzed and refined using SEM to obtain the final path diagram displaying the interrelationships between latent and observed variables and recovery/relapse behavior. In the following, we describe each of the modeling steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic feature specification using LIWC and Empath</head><p>LIWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and Empath <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> are text analysis tools developed to measure psychological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components in a given text sample using humanvalidated dictionaries. Given a piece of text, these dictionaries can be utilized to make complex determinations, such as, calculating the percentage of terms related to sadness, religion, finance, negative emotions, or physical activity. In particular, LIWC outputs the percentage of total words that belong to 90 unique categories defined therein. Empath operates similarly and uses over 200 categories. Empath can also be used to create new categories by defining appropriate seed terms. Our research used the existing categories of Empath.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic concepts and definitions of structural equation modeling</head><p>In this section we describe the essential terms and concepts used in SEM. SEM is also referred to as the analysis of co-variance structure as model fitting is accomplished by utilizing the observed co-variances of the variables. For a detailed explanation of SEM, the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. SEM models are represented as a graphical representation of variable relationships and are called path diagrams. In SEM terminology observed variables (manifest variables) are those variables that are present in the dataset and can be measured. These variables are represented as rectangles in a path diagram. By contrast latent variables are not directly observable. Latent variables can be interpreted as the causes of manifest variables and are represented as ovals in the path diagram. In these diagrams, putative relationships between two variables are represented as directed edges (paths) weighted by path coefficients that are analogous to regression coefficients. Latent variables or error terms that co-vary are joined by curved arrows in the path diagram. SEM designates two other sets of variables: exogenous variables are determined to be outside of the model and have no paths pointing to them while endogenous variables are determined by the system of equations and have at least one path pointing to them. Both exogenous and endogenous variables can be observable or latent. Finally, for a specific model, its degrees of freedom (d), denotes the number of model parameters that are allowed to vary. Specifically, d is the difference between the number of possible parameters that can be estimated and number of actual parameters estimated. The number of possible parameters is quadratic in p -the number of observed variables while the number of estimated variables consists of all the paths (direct effects, correlations, error terms) being estimated in the model. A model is considered to be under-identified, justidentified, or over-identified if d &lt; 0, d = 0, and d &gt; 0 respectively. To estimate and evaluate the relationships in the model correctly we need to have d &gt; 0.</p><p>It is important to clarify the relationship between SEM and another popular graphbased probabilistic reasoning framework, called Bayesian Networks (BN). We begin by noting that SEM does not denote a single technique; it refers to a family of related procedures. This family can be broadly characterized in terms of taking three inputs and generating three outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The inputs being: (1) one or more qualitative causal hypotheses, (2) a set of questions about causal relations among variables of interest, and (3) a model instance. The outputs of SEM are: (1) estimates of model parameters for hypothesized effects, (2) a set of logical implications of the model that can be tested in the data, and (3) a measure of how well the testable implications of the model are supported by the data. The point of SEM is to test a theory by specifying a model that represents predictions of the aforementioned theory from among plausible constructs measured with appropriate observed variables. BN represent dependencies among sets of random variables as (causal) graphs which are traversed to update conditional probabilities of events. The ideas underlying BN have been extended to the broader problem of causal inference under a framework called the structural causal model (SCM), which is subsumed under the umbrella of SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. In our problem context, a direct application of BN entails limitations. In particular, BN cannot differentiate between causal and non-causal relationships without intervention from a domain expert <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Furthermore, it is non-trivial to employ BN while differentiating between latent and observed variables-a core requirement in our research. Finally, the output of BN is known not to be well suited for theoretical explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The process of structural equation modeling</head><p>SEM is an iterative process and involves the following steps: (1) Model specification: At this step a researcher hypothesizes the latent variables, the observed variables, and the relationships between them. (2) Estimation: The proposed model structure is estimated by using covariance analysis to solve a system of equations representing the interrelationships in the system. (3) Evaluation of model fit: The model fit can be evaluated using a variety of measures, such as, the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employing SEM for social media data modeling: an operational explanation</head><p>In this section, we explain the progression of our analysis-process from Reddit posts to a final SEM model. As the specific context, we describe the withdrawal management modeling process using LIWC indicators. To generate this model, we had used 209,804 posts from 7025 drug users. The withdrawal management model involved nine LIWC categories: "negative emotion", "sad", "anger", "anxiety", "feel", "affect", "swear", "sexual", and "authentic" which were postulated to capture the emotive underpinnings of a post. Similarly, the four LIWC categories: "biology", "death", "health", and "body" were postulated to describe physical discomfort. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> we present example posts and the terms identified by LIWC for the aforementioned categories. We also present post-specific LIWC category values in the table. Also, Additional file 2: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> contains the LIWC category values for a sample set of 1000 users engaged in substance use. Finally, the (binary) variable "recovery" was the outcome variable of the model; it was set to 1 if an individual posted in a DAR subreddit else it was set to 0. As explained in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>, the posts of these users were analyzed using LIWC to generate the matrix M 7025x14 .</p><p>In SEM, variables that can be measured constitute the observable variables. In our context (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) this role was fulfilled by the thirteen LIWC categories listed above (these variables are represented as rectangles in the path diagram shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Our hypothesis was that the latent variables (represented as ovals in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>):</p><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C = C(θ) (2) y = By + Ŵx + ζ (3) F ML = log |C(θ )| + tr SC -1 (θ ) -log |S| -(m + n)</formula><p>"emotional distress" could be measured using the LIWC categories: "negative emotion", "sad", "anger", "anxiety", "feel", "affect", "swear", "sexual", and "authentic", while the latent variable "physical pain" could be measured via the LIWC categories: "biology", "death", "health", and "body". Finally, we hypothesized that these two latent variables had a direct effect on the recovery behavior as reflected by the Reddit posts of drug users. We measured the recovery behavior (observed variable) by using a binary variable "recovery" which was set to 1 if a user was found to have posted in drug addiction recovery forum. Alternatively, this variable was set to 0. The reader may also note that "emotional distress", and "physical pain" were the only endogenous variables in the model; the rest of the variables being exogenous.</p><p>Next, in the SEM estimation step the difference between the population covariance ( C ), i.e., the covariance observed in LIWC variables and the "recovery" variable for the population of 7025 drug users and the hypothesized-model-predicted covariance ( C(θ) ) was minimized. For our dataset, the standard form of the structural equation (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)) relating the endogenous and exogenous variable took the following form:</p><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), y(14 × 1) denotes the 14 exogenous variables (13-LIWC categories and 1-recovery variable), x(2 × 1) denotes the 2 endogenous variables ("emotional dis- tress" and "physical pain"), and ζ (14 × 1) denotes the specification errors. The matrix B (14 × 14) denotes the effect of the exogenous variables on other exogenous vari- ables while the matrix Γ (14 × 2) denotes the coefficients of regression of the LIWC variables on the endogenous variables. The maximum likelihood function explained in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) is used to fit the structural model equations by minimizing the fitting function (F ML ) and obtain the model shown graphically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model evaluation</head><p>In SEM, the model fit is evaluated by examining difference between the sample covariance ( C ) and the covariance ( C(θ ) ) computed using the model. The goal is to mini- mize the difference between C and C(θ) . The simplest fitting function for SEM models is the Chi-square fit χ 2 = (N -1)F ML . However, this function is affected by sample size; large sample sizes may increase the χ 2 value even if the difference between C and C(θ ) is small and small sample sizes may lead to Type II errors [50]. The χ 2 function however, is used as part of other fitting functions. Typically, these fitting functions are of three types: relative goodness-of-fit functions, parsimony functions, and functions that determine absolute (standalone) fit.</p><p>Examples of relative goodness-of-fit functions include the CFI (Eq. 5) and TLI (Eq. 6) measures. These measures compare the proposed model against a baseline model where all variables are allowed to have a variance, but none are allowed to co-vary.

The RMSEA takes into the account the complexity of the model by penalizing models with lower degrees of freedom since such models lead to higher values of RMSEA.

Finally, SRMR [see Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>] is an example of an absolute fit index.

An advantage of using SRMR over CFI, TLI, and RMSEA is that it is independent of the sample size.</p><p>In the above equation C ii and C jj are the observed standard deviations and p is the number of observed variables.

Emotional distress and negativity during withdrawal is characterized by aggression, anxiety, and loss of temper <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. The medical approach to manage withdrawal symptoms typically involves gradually tapering doses of drug agonists to diminish the bodily discomforts and prevent a relapse. However, there are no clear methods to measure, and compare the intensity of either emotional distress or physical pain during withdrawal. In the following we describe the development of SEM models to determine the effect and importance of "emotional distress", and "physical pain" in withdrawal management using linguistic features determined using both LIWC and Empath. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">6) TLI = χ 2 B d B -χ 2 I d I χ 2 B d B -1 (7) RMSEA = χ 2 I -d I (d I )(n -1) (8) SRMR = p i=1 i j=1 C ij -C(θ ) ij C ii C jj 2 p(p + 1) 2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining observed variables using LIWC</head><p>We used nine LIWC categories: "negative emotion", "sad", "anger", "anxiety", "feel", "affect", "swear", "sexual", and "authentic" to measure the latent variable "emotional distress". Examples of terms in each of the categories are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">18</ref>. The categories "negative emotion", "sad", "anger", and "anxiety" consisted of terms that had a negative connotation or valance and reflected negative thoughts. The category "feel" consisted of terms related to bodily sensations, while the category "affect" consisted of terms having both a negative and a positive connotation. We included the LIWC category "swear" as one of the indicators for "emotional distress" because we noticed that it was common for drug users to employ expletives to express their physical and emotional anguish. We also included the LIWC category "sexual" as one of our indicators for "emotional distress" because of analogous reasons. "Authentic" was a summary variable and was calculated as a single value for a given text input. The algorithm in LIWC for determining the authenticity of a text was developed based on the studies on deceptive and truthful communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>; it determines the openness, honesty, and disclosure of a given body of text. Consequently, there are no example terms for "authentic" in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">18</ref>. To reflect the latent variable "physical pain", we used the following four LIWC categories: "biology", "death", "health", and "body". Example terms in each of these categories are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">18</ref>. The category "biology" contained terms related to human biology and biological activities. Terms representing death were present in the category "death" (bury, coffin, kill). The category "health" consisted of a number of terms related to medicine and health of an individual. The category "body" consisted of terms related to body parts and bodily functions. Additional file 2: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> contains the LIWC category values for a sample set of users engaged in substance use. Finally, the (binary) variable "recovery" was the outcome variable of the model; it was set to 1 if an individual posted in a DAR subreddit else it was set to 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining observed variables using Empath</head><p>We used four Empath categories: "negative_emotion", "hate", "shame", and "suffering" to measure the latent variable "emotional distress". Examples of terms in each of the categories are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">18</ref>. The categories "negative_emotion", "hate", "shame", and "suffering" all consisted of terms that had a negative undertone and reflected negative feelings. To reflect the latent variable "physical pain", we used the following four Empath categories: "pain", "medical_emergency", "health", and "weakness" (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">18</ref> for examples). The category "pain" contained terms related to physical discomfort. Terms representing a medical emergency were present in the category "medical_emergency". The category "health" consisted of a number of terms related to the health of an individual and the category "weakness" consisted of terms related to lack of strength of an individual. Again, the (binary) variable "recovery" was the outcome variable of the model; it was set to 1 if an individual posted in a DAR subreddit else it was set to 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SEM model for withdrawal management</head><p>The SEM modeling was conducted using the lavaan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Here, we estimate the effect of "emotional distress" and "physical pain" on drug addiction recovery behavior using LIWC and Empath. As mentioned before, drug addiction recovery behavior was measured using an observed variable ("recovery"). The reader may note that the LIWC model was based on our estimation of the latent variable "emotional distress", using nine indicators [(1)"negative emotion", (2) "authentic", (3) "sad", (4) "affect", (5) "anger", (6) "anxiety", (7) "sexual", (8) "feel", and (9) "swear"]. Similarly, the latent variable and "physical pain", was estimated with four indicators [(1) "health", (2) "biology", (3) "death", and (4) "body"]. The Empath model estimated the latent variable "emotional distress", using four indicators [(1)"negative_emotion", (2) "hate", (3) "suffering", and (4) "shame"]. Similarly, the latent variable "physical pain", was estimated with four indicators [(1) "health", (2) "weakness", (3) "pain", and (4) "medical_emergency"]. It may be noted that the LIWC and Empath categories were not exclusive in that terms could simultaneously belong to different categories. We also observed that terms of certain categories frequently cooccurred. For example, in posts describing effects of withdrawal, expression of negative emotions or terms describing sadness would usually co-occur with terms associated with health. Consequently, such variables were allowed to co-vary in our models. The specific models obtained using the LIWC and Empath variables are described in the "Results" section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SEM model for recovery</head><p>Self-development efforts and relationships have been found to be indispensable for drug addiction recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Family support, especially for adolescents in long term residential programs has been proven to be necessary for successful recovery from addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Studies have also showed that having a strong social and family resource improves the chances of addiction recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p><p>Self-development efforts encompassing activities that lead to mental and physical well-being, such as regular exercise, meditation, and yoga have been observed to help heal the body and mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>. Such activities have also been shown to address psychological and physiological needs of a recovering addict by reducing negative feelings and preventing weight gain following abstinence. Additionally, regular exercise is known to alleviate physical and mental stress. It is also known to positively alter the brain chemistry as it releases endorphins and creates a natural high, similar to ones released when an individual uses drugs. Studies have shown that addition of exercise as a lifestyle change leads to abstinence or reduction in drug use <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Mediation and yoga has also been proved to help individuals in their withdrawals and addiction by acting a calming effect during their period of struggles <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Professional activities constitute another aspect of self-development. However, the literature on the importance of jobs, and career on addiction recovery is ambiguous: some sources suggest that a stable job helps provide the recovering addicts with income and health benefits, improved mental health, and a purpose in their life. For example, Flynn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, found job/career to be one of the fundamental personal motivations for a recovering addict to stay sober. The importance of vocational rehabilitation and job search as one of the services in the social model of recovery has also been noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Other works have found that employed individuals undergoing recovery are more engaged in recovery activities and are more likely to abstain from substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. However, studies also have found that returning to old jobs, or stress experienced at work can lead to drug use and relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Amongst these, Buczkowski et al., identified smoking environment at work as one of the triggers for relapse of smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. The stress associated with changing jobs has been cited to lead to substance use relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Furthermore, the social stigma associated with drug addiction has been found to play a major role in the unwillingness of working individuals to opt for recovery interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. Finally, since employers are prejudiced against recovering addicts applying for jobs, such situations can also lead to a relapse or unwillingness to come out as an addict <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p><p>Because of the aforementioned reasons self-development efforts and relationships play a pivotal role in withdrawal management and drug addiction recovery. We therefore construct a SEM model to determine the effect and importance of the latent variables "mental and physical well-being", "career", and "relationships" in drug addiction recovery. To estimate these latent variables, we utilized forum activity of the drug users in multiple subreddits related to self-development efforts and relationships. We used the number of times an individual posted in the following eight subreddits: "fitness", "meditation", "yoga", "gainit", "bodyweightfitness", and "running" to estimate the latent variable "mental and physical well-being". Similarly, we used the posts in the subreddits: "jobs", "entrepreneur", "careerguidance", and "resumes" to estimate latent variable "career". As indicator variable for "relationships" we used the posts in the four subreddits: "relation-ship_advice", "relationships", "parenting", and "childfree". Finally, our outcome variable for the model was "recovery". The SEM model captures the effect of these variables on addiction recovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling addiction relapse</head><p>As described above, the variables "emotional distress", "physical pain", "relationships", and "self-development" were found to play a critical role in addiction recovery. In addition to these factors, religion and geographic disparities were also found by us to influence the process of recovery. These results are supported by previous work in the field of relapse where it was found that recovering individuals display higher levels of religious faith <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Similarly, researchers have observed that addicts living in a rural setting have a higher chance for relapse as compared to their urban counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> because of limited access to relapse prevention facilities and preventive medications. In the following, we describe models that study the effect of the aforementioned latent variables along with demographic setting for drug users who undergo relapse. We defined relapse as the event of an individual posting in an RDU subreddit after posting in a DAR subreddit. Individuals who never posted in an RDU subreddit after posting in a DAR subreddit were defined to be in (continued) recovery. Based on these definitions 2363 individuals in our dataset were found to have relapsed, while 1355 users displayed continued recovery. To study users who relapsed while minimizing the impact of stray postings, we investigated only those users who had at least five posts in succession in a DAR subreddit before they were defined to have relapsed. Similarly, to study users who displayed signs of continued recovery we investigated only who had at least five posts in DAR subreddits before they stopped posting. As a consequence of this filtering, we ended up with a total of 174 users of whom 108 were identified to have relapsed while 66 users were identified to have continued their recovery journey till our observations concluded. Also, to extract relapse specific information, we scaled the values for LIWC and Empath categories by dividing them by the number of days between the post under investigation and the day when the user was defined to have relapsed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1Correlation diagram of the LIWC variables present in the withdrawal management model (see also Table1).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining observed variables using LIWC for modeling relapse</head><p>While modeling users who relapsed we observed a limitation of using psycholinguistic dictionaries such as LIWC and Empath. Anti-social behavior, lack of religious expression, physical exercise, and positive emotion increases the chances of a relapse. However, using these dictionaries we could only obtain a value for the presence of such categories, i.e., the absence of such psycholinguistic information was not represented via any appropriate categories. To overcome this weakness and to build a model for relapse using LIWC, we generated values for such (absent, in LIWC or Empath) variables by subtracting the numeric weight of the corresponding LIWC/Empath categories from 1. For example, if a post had a value of 0.2 for the category "friends", we calculated the value of "friends΄" (i.e. the negation of the category "friends") to be 0.8 (hereafter, such variables are referred to as negated variables and denoted by a prime). We used negation of the following six LIWC categories "friend", "we", "shehe", "you", "male", and "female" to represent and study the latent variable "anti-social". To model lack of physical exercise and religious expression we used the negation of LIWC categories "motion" and "religion". The (binary) variable "relapse" was the outcome variable in our model; it was set to 1 if an individual relapsed else it was set to 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining observed variables using Empath</head><p>We used Empath to model the relapse behavior as a consequence of lack of positive emotion, career interests, and urban facilities. Similar to obtaining the values of LIWC categories for modeling relapse, we used negation of the following four Empath categories "joy", "zest", "cheerfulness", and "positive emotion" to study the latent variable "positive emotion΄" (lack of positive emotion). To model "career΄" (and lack of career development), we used the negation of the following three Empath categories: "blue_collar_job", "white_collar_job", and "office". Finally, to model "urban΄" (i.e., the lack of an urban setting and facilities) we used the negation of LIWC category "urban". The (binary) variable "relapse" was the outcome variable in our model; it was set to 1 if an individual relapsed else it was set to 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The SEM model for relapse of addiction</head><p>In this model we estimated the effect of factors including the social and physical activities of a drug user, their positive or negative emotions, recourse to religion, career-related activities, and location (urban or rural) on relapse by employing linguistic characteristics determined using LIWC and Empath. The relapse behavior was itself measured using the observed variable "relapse". The latent variable "anti-social" was estimated using six negated LIWC categories ("friend΄", "we΄", "shehe΄", "you΄", "male΄", and "female΄") and two observed negated variables "motion΄" and "religion΄". The Empath model estimated the latent negation variable "positive emotion΄" using four negated categories ("joy΄", "zest΄", "cheerfulness΄", and "positive emotion΄"). Similarly, the latent negated variable "career΄" was estimated using three negated categories ("blue_collar_job΄", "white_col-lar_job΄", and "office΄"). Finally, the variable "urban΄" corresponding to the location of the user was an observed variable in the model. The models obtained using the LIWC and Empath variables are described in the "Results" section.</p></div>
