<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study aimed to assess effects of the sets of EBV and HPV expressed proteins simultaneously on the sets of cellular/inflammatory factors in breast and thyroid cancers using structural equation modeling. In this multi-center case-control study, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 83 breast and 57 thyroid specimens were collected from the eligible patients. In addition, 31 and 18 histopathological evaluated normal breast and thyroid samples were also examined as age-matched healthy controls. In addition, ELISA and Real-time PCR were used to measure the expression level of viral and cellular/inflammatory genes and proteins. Structural equation modeling was used to test the causal associations between the sets of EBV and HPV expressed proteins with inflammatory factors in breast and thyroid cancers development. Breast cancer patients had a higher incidence of HPV-positively and EBV-positively than healthy controls (OR=1.66, 95%CI=0.79-3.47, P-value=0.177), (OR=3.18, 95%CI=1.52-6.63, P-value=0.002), respectively. In addition, thyroid cancer patients had a significantly higher incidence of EBV-positivity than healthy controls (OR=3.72, 95% CI=1.65-8.36, P-value=0.001). After fitting the SEM model, HPV proteins factor has significant direct and total effects on the cellular/inflammatory factors in breast cancer (direct effect: β=0.426, P-value=0.01; total effect: β=0.549, P-value&lt;0.001). However, EBV proteins factor has most significant total effect on the cellular/inflammatory factors in breast cancer (total effect: β=0.804, P-value&lt;0.001) than the cellular/inflammatory factors in thyroid cancer (total effect: β=0.789, P-value&lt;0.001). For the first time, a significant association between EBV and HPV -genes, anoikis resistance and the development of breast and thyroid cancers demonstrated by using SEM, Simultaneously.</p></div>

Furthermore, the effects of the viruses and their expressed proteins on the cancers have been demonstrated. Therefore, assessing simultaneous, group, and casual effects of HPV and EBV viral factors on the cellular signaling and inflammatory factors based on the conceptual diagram of associations by structural equation modeling (SEM) could be very helpful to investigate the involved molecular pathways of viral infections in cancers. SEM as a multivariate multiple regression allows one to estimate the strength and sign of direction and indirection associations for complicated causal schemes with multiple dependent and independent variables. The SEM has several advantages such as detection of most important viral and cellular factors in occurrence and progression of the cancers and it allows to calculate direct, indirect, and total effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Sobel, 1987)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the current study, it was shown that the expression levels of LMP-1, LMP-2A, and EBER-1, EBER-2 (EBERs) were higher in breast cancer tissue compared to their matched healthy controls while in the same compartment was not significant for thyroid cancer (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The association between the expression of LMP-1, LMP-2A, and EBERs with survivin, CD44, PTPN13, and Bcl-2 have been reported previously <ref type="bibr">(Port, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsang and Tsao, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Moghoofei et al., 2019)</ref>. Having in mind that EBERs are involved in resistance to apoptosis <ref type="bibr">(Li, 2015)</ref>, our findings can indicate that the mentioned EBV gene products could exert different effects on the expression levels of anoikis inhibitory genes which consequently could lead to development of thyroid cancer. Moreover, as it was showed the mentioned EBV factors showed most direct (β=0.504, P-value&lt;0.001), indirect (β=0.30, P-value=0.011), and total (β=0.804, P-value&lt;0.001) significant effects on the cellular signaling and inflammatory factors in breast cancer than thyroid cancer group (direct effect: β=0.411, P-value&lt;0.001; indirect effect: β=0.278, P-value=0.028; total effect: β=0.789, P-value&lt;0.001) (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Interestingly, previously it has been shown that the expression levels of EBV genes (LMP-1, LMP-2A, EBER-1, and EBER-2) in thyroid tumor tissues were higher than healthy controls <ref type="bibr">(Moghoofei et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Among the HPV genes, the expression levels of E6 and E7 were higher in breast cancer tissues than controls while E2 was not significantly different in the same groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The final products of this genes targets p53 and RB (of the most important genes controlling cellular processes) and could disrupt the cell cycle, transformation initiation, and finally tumor development <ref type="bibr">(Doorbar, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Khodabandehlou, 2019)</ref>. Previous studies demonstrated that E6 and E7 (as the antagonists) could interact with BRCA1 and alter its activity. It has been shown that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in the repair process of DNA damage in different tissues and any reduction and/ or disruption of these two proteins may lead to cancer <ref type="bibr">(Friedenson, 2007)</ref>. Also, BRCA1 is able to interact with the important regulatory cellular factors such as RB and p53 (co-activator of p53-mediated transcription) which this interaction is necessary for G1 checkpoint in the cell cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Zhang, 2005)</ref>. Therefore, HPV oncoproteins (E6 and E7) could exert their effects on the functions of p53 and RB through BRCA1 pathway. As Khadabandehlou et al. showed, the expression levels of RB, p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were decreased in HPV-positive patients with breast cancer compared to same HPV-negative patients and healthy controls (p&lt; 0.05) (Khodabandehlou, 2019). In the current study, according to the path standardized coefficients (β) presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, HPV factors had a non-significant indirect effect (β=0.123, P-value=0.09) on the cellular signaling and inflammatory factors in patients with breast cancer. Although, these factors showed significantly direct and total effects on the cellular signaling and inflammatory factors in the breast cancer group (direct effect: β=0.426, P-value=0.01; total effect: β=0.549, P-value&lt;0.001).</p><p>Another important aspect regarding the role of viruses in tumor development is chronic inflammation. This phenomenon affects different phases of tumor life including initiation, progression, and development (Goldszmid, 2014). Considering the role of inflammation in cancers, the TNF-α--NF-κB axis has been shown to induce the malignant behavior and invasiveness of breast cancer. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β, are the inflammatory cytokines with the potential of inducing different pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is the key element of angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Esquivel-Velázquez, 2015)</ref>. The role of viruses in inducing of inflammation and correlation of the induced inflammation with tumor development have been demonstrated in different studies <ref type="bibr">(Coussens, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fernandes, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mesri, 2014)</ref>. In this study, there was an association between increases in the expression levels of some EBV genes (LMP-1 and LMP-2A) and increased level of expression in some inflammatory cytokines in patients with breast and thyroid cancers. Furthermore, Morris et al. indicated that LMP-1 was associated with increased expression of the IL-1 that involves in inflammation and several changes in host-cell gene expression <ref type="bibr">(Morris et al., 2008)</ref>. Furthermore, LMP-1 is involved in the induction of several important regulatory factors such as NF-kB, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and growth factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Etemadi et al., 2017)</ref>. The inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β could induce cancer cells proliferation and tumoral invasion through activation of <ref type="bibr">NF-κB (Khodabandehlou, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, this study showed the association between expression levels of EBER-1 and EBER-2 with the evaluated inflammatory cytokines. In agreement with the current results, <ref type="bibr">Li et al., (2015)</ref> demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines can be induced by EBERs gene products in nasopharyngeal carcinoma through TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3) signaling pathway. In addition, their results approved that LMP-1 could lead to up-regulation of some inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α.</p><p>In the current study, the expression of inflammatory cytokines was higher in the OTTP (breast and thyroid) when compared to their healthy controls. Also, their levels of expression were associated with the over-expression of viral factors including E2, E6, and E7. These mentioned inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β) not only are involved in inflammation but also are role player factors in the angiogenesis <ref type="bibr">(Keshavarz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Norooznezhad et al., 2014)</ref>. It has been shown that tumor angiogenesis is correlated with the invasiveness and metastasis in patients with breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Weidner et al., 1991)</ref>.</p><p>The obtained results from the current study using advanced predictive regression, SEM, confirmed our previous data, which evaluated the direct and indirect effects of viral proteins and their interactions with cellular factors on the tumor development. However, structural equation modeling has some limitations such as dealing with missing data and small sample size in this study.</p><p>EBV infection and the induction of inflammatory factors have previously been shown to be associated with breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Richardson et al., 2015)</ref>. In this study, the presence of EBV and HPV in breast cancer significantly increased expression of the pro-carcinogenic factors, TGF-β and  in breast tissue compared with viral-negative tissue. Furthermore, levels of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-1 and TNF-α, the pro-proliferative transcription factor, NF-κB, as well as ROS and RNS levels, were significantly increased in viral positive compared with viral negative breast tissue Previously, other studies investigated the effect of EBV load in the sera and tumor tissue on the survival of patients with breast cancer <ref type="bibr">(Marrão et al., 2014)</ref>. The expression of P53, RB, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were decreased in HPV-positive patients with breast cancer compared to the same patients with HPV-negative results and healthy controls. Also, it was shown that the presence of the HPV was associated with increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TGF-β, TNF-α, and NF-kB) and tumor progression.</p><p>In conclusion, taken to gather, this study demonstrated that the presence of EBV and HPV in tumoral tissue could significantly increase the expression of a number of anoikis resistance, cellular signaling, and inflammatory genes which are important factors in the development of breast and thyroid cancers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
