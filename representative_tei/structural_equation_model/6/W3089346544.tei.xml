<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Childhood maltreatment affects the mental state of adults in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Previous research suggests that childhood maltreatment experiences increase the salience of stressful life events in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Additionally, individuals who were first exposed to childhood maltreatment or interpersonal violence during middle childhood had more emotional dysregulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The correlation between childhood maltreatment and personality is complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and childhood trauma exposure affects clinical psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Different types of childhood maltreatment are interrelated and are associated with differing severity of psychological distress in adulthood. Childhood maltreatment has various effects on mental function during adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Exposure to trauma at different ages differentially impacts depressive symptoms during adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Childhood maltreatment impacts biological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For example, previous research suggested that the short alleles of the serotonin transporter length polymorphism affect the correlation between childhood maltreatment and depression in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Experience of the traumatic events in childhood doubles the risk of late-life depression and increases the risk of recurrent depressive episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, the influence of childhood neglect on the course of depression is considered to be independent of sociodemographic and clinical variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Recent research has suggested that an insecure attachment and parental maltreatment increased the risk of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Therefore, childhood maltreatment has various effects on depressive symptoms in adulthood.</p><p>In some cases, childhood maltreatment influences depression through other mediators. Childhood maltreatment indirectly worsens depressive symptoms via affective temperaments or neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Moreover, childhood maltreatment not only directly affects mental disorders but also indirectly affects them through vulnerability characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The influence of childhood maltreatment on depression is mediated by several factors. Interpersonal sensitivity and trait anxiety mediate the influence of childhood maltreatment on depression in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Various factors influence the relationship between childhood maltreatment and adulthood depressive symptoms.</p><p>Regarding the correlation among childhood maltreatment, socioeconomic status, and adult memory, early stressful events affect cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, the influence of childhood maltreatment on neurocognitive development is not fully elucidated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Recent research has suggested that the experience of childhood violence victimization does not affect later cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, whereas nonsexual maltreatment in childhood is associated with attention problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Cognitive function is correlated with neglect but not sexual or nonsexual abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Furthermore, childhood neglect correlates with cognitive impairment in adulthood, independently of mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Emotional neglect during childhood is particularly detrimental to memory in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Thus, childhood maltreatment, especially neglect, plays an important role in cognitive impairment during adulthood.</p><p>Childhood maltreatment correlates with a poorer quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Adverse childhood experiences also correlate with poor general health and quality of life in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Childhood maltreatment also affects social functioning in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>; moreover, it poorly affects the socioeconomic status in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Childhood maltreatment is considered to determine the health-related quality of midlife in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and correlates with intimate partner violence victimization in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Regarding its mediator effects, childhood maltreatment indirectly worsens wellbeing via affective temperaments <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Furthermore, childhood maltreatment mediates the long-term consequences of household dysfunction in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Therefore, childhood maltreatment affects various aspects of social function in adulthood.</p><p>Depressive symptoms affect social function in the general adult population, and they may do so directly or indirectly via cognitive dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Thus, cognitive function mediates the effect of depressive symptoms on social function. Recent research has suggested that cognitive complaints and depression severity affect social function, although objective cognitive impairments do not affect social function in major depressive disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. A relationship between cognitive complaints and social function has been reported in euthymic bipolar disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. There is an important correlation between social function and cognitive function, especially subjective cognitive function. Because childhood maltreatment influences depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and functional disability, childhood maltreatment may influence the mediator effect between these three variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> in addition to the moderator effect. However, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of this relationship.</p><p>We previously reported the relationship between depressive symptoms, congitive function, and social function in Japanese adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In the present study, we hypothesized that childhood maltreatment affects depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and functional disability and that depressive symptoms and cognitive function mediate the effect of child maltreatment on functional disability. According to this hypothesis and previous research, we performed a structural equation modeling to investigate whether depressive symptoms and cognitive complaints mediate the influence of childhood abuse on functional disability in adults from the community who volunteered for this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>All participants were recruited between April 2017 and 2018 at Tokyo Medical University in Japan. This research was part of a larger study on mental health in Japanese adults, in which several questionnaires were used a part of an investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. This study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Tokyo Medical University (Ethics Approval Number: SH3502). After receiving a complete explanation of the research, written informed consent was provided by all participants (N = 597). Of this total, 556 participants completed all assessments, including demographic characteristics and evaluation scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p>Participants completed all assessments, including the Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment (COBRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Childhood maltreatment measure. CATS is a 38-item self-assessment scale that assesses childhood maltreatment. It consists of a five-point assessment (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = very often, and 4 = always) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. For the present study, the Japanese version translated by Tanabe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> was used, and a total score of 38 items was calculated. The internal consistency of the overall CATS, as reflected in Cronbach's alpha, was 0.90. The total score was calculated by adding each score rated on a five-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = very often, and 4 = always). There were no missing data. It contains questions related to the individual's childhood or adolescent experiences of sexual mistreatment, physical mistreatment and punishment, psychological mistreatment, physical or emotional neglect, and negative home environment (e.g., parental substance abuse or fighting). For example, one item asks, "Did your parents ridicule you"? <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The CATS scores correlated significantly (r = 0.44; p &lt; 0.001) with scores on Bernstein and Putnam's Dissociative Experiences Scale. The Gutman split-half reliability of CATS was 0.86 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Depressive symptoms measure. PHQ-9 is a self-assessment scale that evaluates the depression severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. A Japanese version was previously developed and exhibited good validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Scores were summed. This study used a summary score for evaluating the severity of depressive symptoms. In particular, we calculated the number of times (0-27 points) the patients experienced nine depressive symptoms in the previous two weeks using a four-point Likert scale for each item (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, and 3 = nearly every day). For the Japanese version of PHQ-9, the sensitivity (90.5%) and specificity (76.6%) were confirmed using the optimal cut-off points �10 for depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Subjective cognitive assessment. COBRA is a 16-item self-assessment scale that is used to evaluate neurocognitive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Items are assessed using a four-point scale (0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often, and 3 = always), and all items relate to daily life. A total score is calculated by summing all responses, with a maximum score of 48. Higher scores indicate higher levels of cognitive complaints. The validity and reliability of the Japanese version have been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. COBRA is recommended for screening neurocognitive dysfunction of remitted bipolar patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Moreover, it can evaluate cognitive complaints in the general adult population <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In remitted bipolar disorder, a cut-off value &gt; 14 of the COBRA total score is used to indicate moderate to severe self-reported difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. These recommendations are for bipolar patients and not nonclinical individuals; however, the cut-off value is also helpful when using the COBRA in the general adult population <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The Japanese version of COBRA had very high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.887) for the total score <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Functional disability scale. SDS evaluates global functional disability and includes three items on disability that affect working, social functioning, and family living <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Participants were assessed on a 10-point visual analog scale for each item. The highest total value is 30, with the lowest value showing the least illness disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>There were no missing data, and no multicollinearity was present in multiple regression analysis. Multiple regression analyses (by the forced-entry method) were performed using the SDS total score as the dependent variable, with COBRA, PHQ-9, CATS, and clinical parameters as independent variables; with COBRA total score as the dependent variable and PHQ-9, CATS, and clinical parameters as independent variables; and with PHQ-9 summary score as the dependent variable and CATS and clinical parameters as independent variables. Before assessing the interaction, centering was performed on the mean scores. A covariance structure analysis was subsequently performed to investigate the relationship between the parameters using maximum likelihood robust estimation. The model was evaluated according to the multiple fit criteria of the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the root-meansquare error of approximation (RMSEA). We used the following criteria: TLI above 0.97, a CFI above 0.97, and an RMSEA below 0.05 show a good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Mediation analysis was performed using the robust maximum likelihood estimation method. All statistical analyses, except for structural equation modeling, were performed using STATA/MP 16 (Stata Corp, LLC, College Station, TX), and structural equation modeling was performed using Mplus version 8.4 (Muthe ´n &amp; Muthe ´n, Los Angeles, CA, USA); p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A total of 556 nonclinical adult participants were included in this study (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and functional disability</head><p>Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed that there were significant relationships between the CATS total score and the PHQ summary score, COBRA total score, and SDS total score (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The associations among the PHQ-9 summary score, COBRA total score, and SDS total score were statistically significant. The COBRA total score significantly correlated with SDS total score (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The correlation between childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and functional disability was statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between demographic characteristics, child abuse, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and functional disability</head><p>Multiple regression analysis-with the SDS total score as the dependent variables and demographic data, CATS total score, PHQ-9 summary score, and COBRA total score as the independent variables-was performed. The CATS score, PHQ-9 score, and COBRA total score significantly predicted the SDS total score (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Multiple regression analysis-with the COBRA total score as the dependent variable, and demographic data, CATS total score, and PHQ-9 summary score as the independent variables -was performed. The PHQ-9 score significantly predicted the COBRA total score (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Multiple regression analysis-with the PHQ-9 summary score as the dependent variable and demographic data and CATS total score as the independent variables-was performed. Marital status, psychiatric history, and CATS score significantly predicted the PHQ-9 summary score (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Multiple regression analysis by forced injection method-with the CATS total score as the dependent variable and demographic data as the independent variables-was performed. Years of education significantly predicted the CATS total score (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the interaction between child maltreatment, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function. No significant interaction was observed between the parameters (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>In summary, child maltreatment, depressive symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction significantly predicted functional disability. Cognitive function was significantly impacted by depressive symptoms, and depressive symptoms were significantly impacted by marital status, psychiatric history, and childhood maltreatment. Years of education significantly predicted childhood maltreatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modeling</head><p>To evaluate the correlations between childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and functional disability, we performed a structural equation modeling on the basis of the results of the multiple regression analyses. Regarding direct effects, cognitive function (0.136, p &lt; 0.01) and depressive symptoms (0.524, p &lt; 0.001) had significant effects on "Disability." (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Depressive symptoms (0.394, p &lt; 0.001) had a significant direct effect on cognitive function, whereas childhood maltreatment did not (0.045, p &gt; 0.05). Childhood maltreatment had a significant direct effect on depressive symptoms (0.315, p &lt; 0.001). Depressive symptoms (0.054, p &lt; 0.01) and childhood maltreatment (0.188, p &lt; 0.001) had significant indirect effects on "Disability." According to the mediation analysis, the indirect effects of childhood maltreatment via depressive symptoms (0.165, p &lt; 0.001) and via depressive symptoms and cognitive function (0.017, p &lt; 0.01) on "Disability" were statistically significant, whereas the indirect effects of childhood maltreatment via cognitive function (0.006, p &gt; 0.05) on "Disability" was not statistically significant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study used structural equation modeling to show the relationship between childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, and functional disability. Our results demonstrate that childhood maltreatment indirectly affects functional disability via depression and cognitive function. Interestingly, the direct effects of childhood maltreatment on cognitive function and functional disability were not statistically significant, while the direct effect of childhood maltreatment on depressive symptoms was statistically significant.</p><p>In the structural equation model, childhood maltreatment affected cognitive function and functional disability only via depressive symptoms. Therefore, we suggest that depressive symptoms are important in the correlation between childhood maltreatment and cognitive function or functional disability in Japanese adults.</p><p>This study demonstrates that childhood maltreatment affects depressive symptoms directly. This finding is consistent with the results of previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. According to the previous study, trait anxiety mediates the effects of childhood maltreatment on depression in the general adult population <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. We recently investigated the relationships between affective temperaments, subjective cognitive function, and social function, and showed that subjective cognitive function mediates the influence of affective temperaments on social function <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In this study, assessments on affective temperaments or anxiety have not been performed, which is a limitation of this study. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, multiple regression analysis shows that childhood maltreatment, marital status, and psychiatric history predict depressive symptoms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Depressive symptoms are generally affected by various kinds of sociodemographic factors. In this study, most individuals were employed during the assessment, which limits our conclusions to people who were not employed, because employment status affects social functions According to previous research, trauma exposure at different ages differentially impacts depressive symptoms in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this study, the age of childhood maltreatment was not controlled. This is also a limitation of this research. The results of the multiple regression analysis show that only years of education predict child maltreatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Years of education correlate with intelligence quotient (IQ); therefore, we speculate that childhood maltreatment correlates with IQ. Regarding the relationship between childhood violence victimization and IQ, previous research suggested that a low IQ in victimized subjects was largely contributed by cognitive dysfunction which predated childhood maltreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In this study, years of education did not significantly predict subjective cognitive impairment, which means acquired deterioration (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Years of education was also strongly associated with socioeconomic status, and research has shown that child maltreatment occurs more in people with low socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Therefore, individuals with a low IQ may tend to have an experience of childhood maltreatment.</p><p>Previous research suggested that the patterns of childhood maltreatment correlate with the severity of mental illness in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. In this study, the patterns of childhood maltreatment were not considered; that is, we used the data of the CATS total score. Therefore, we cannot discuss different types of childhood maltreatment. This is another limitation of this study. Recent research suggested that insecure attachment and parental maltreatment increased the risk of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Future studies should investigate the complex relationships between types of childhood maltreatment and adulthood depressive symptoms.</p><p>This research shows that childhood maltreatment indirectly affects cognitive function via depressive symptoms. Recent studies suggested that neglect affects cognitive dysfunction in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, whereas the correlation among childhood violence victimization and later cognitive function is considered to be non-causal <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In this study, childhood maltreatment includes both neglect and abuse, which may be affected by the non-significance of the direct effect on cognitive function in the structural equation model. Although this is also a limitation of this study, we found an indirect effect of child maltreatment on cognitive complaints through depressive symptoms in our model. Our results demonstrate the indirect effect of child maltreatment on cognitive complaints in adult community volunteers. Previous research suggested that childhood neglect particularly affects memory function in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Future studies should study the correlation among childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, and memory function in Japanese adults.</p><p>This study demonstrates that childhood maltreatment indirectly affects functional disability. In the structural equation model, cognitive function mediates the effect of depressive symptoms on functional disability (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The mediator effect of cognitive function between depressive symptoms and life quality has been reported in our previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Previous studies suggested that childhood maltreatment affects socioeconomic outcomes and household dysfunction in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. In this research, according to the outcomes of the multiple regression analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), the effects of functional disability were significantly predicted by childhood maltreatment. Thus, childhood maltreatment may correlate with adulthood functional disability.</p><p>Regarding the mediator effect on childhood maltreatment, affective temperaments mediate the effects of childhood maltreatment on depression, especially neglect <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Vulnerability characteristics mediate the effect of childhood maltreatment on incident mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Interpersonal sensitivity mediates the effect of childhood maltreatment on depression in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In addition, trait anxiety mediates the effect of child maltreatment on depression in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In this study, the moderator effects of childhood maltreatment on cognitive function or functional disability have not been shown (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Regarding the relationship between the moderator effect and childhood maltreatment, the moderator roles of affective temperaments, child maltreatment, and adulthood life events on depression have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Future studies should investigate the moderator effects of childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms on cognitive complaints in a larger sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Self-report measures were used in this study, which are subject to bias. In addition, a retrospective measure of child maltreatment was used in this study, whereas research has shown that the correlation between retrospective and prospective measures of child maltreatment is low. Retrospective self-reports of childhood maltreatment may need to consider the current mood state to account for potential memory biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Moreover, mediation analyses was performed whereas all measures were concurrently measured. This study cannot identify causal relations among the parameters because this research followed a cross-sectional design. The participants were adult volunteers from the community. This limits the generalizability of the results to other communities. In addition, the participants were adults from the community recruited using convenience sampling in Japan; therefore, our conclusion may not be applicable to other communities, children, or adolescents. Other limitations include the heterogeneous characteristics of the volunteers, including a range of healthy and unhealthy individuals from diverse social and educational backgrounds. Moreover, we could not control for the effect of medication and mood symptoms on measures at the time of the assessment. Furthermore, we used self-assessments; therefore, childhood maltreatment, depressive cognitive function, and social function should also be evaluated using objective assessments in future studies. Most participants (98.4%) were employed at the time of the study; thus, it was not an economically deprived group, and therefore, the sample was skewed to include more functional adults who could hold down a job. This may also limit the variability of cognitive functioning within the sample and its interaction with the other variables. Finally, sociodemographic variability is a limitation because we used self-rating assessment on childhood maltreatment in the community adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Our results reveal that childhood maltreatment affects depressive symptoms, and cognitive function mediates the effect of depressive symptoms on functional disability in adult volunteers from the community. Childhood maltreatment affects functional disability indirectly via depressive symptoms and via cognitive function through depressive symptoms. We conclude that depressive symptoms and cognitive function play important roles in the effect of childhood maltreatment on functional disability in adult community volunteers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig 1 shows  this equation, as well as the results of the standardized path coefficients.
