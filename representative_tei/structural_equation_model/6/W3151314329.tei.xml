<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The psychological resources of teachers are increasingly important as the nature of teaching changes with increasing pressure from policymakers, politicians, and communities. Teachers are now held responsible for students' affective and psycho-social progress as well as their academic success <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Pillay et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kurniawan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Suprapto et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ersozlu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ledger et al., 2019)</ref>; career in teaching is recognized as one of the most demanding and distressing professions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kyriacou, 2001)</ref>. Affect is central to the teacher identity and the work of teachers because they establish closer relationships with students for longer periods of time than other professionals do with their clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Klassen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lutovac &amp; Kaasila, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Simsek, &amp; Yazar, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The deep level of emotional connection between teachers and students means that teachers' emotional states have a profound effect on not only their own well-being, but also on the attitudes and behaviors of their students and the emotional climate of the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Becker et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reyes et al., 2012)</ref>. Teachers genuinely express their own feelings in the classroom, along with surface and deep acting. Emotional regulation of these types helps teachers meet their professional goals, and might, therefore, influence their wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Yin, 2016)</ref>. For early-career teachers, personal attributes related to responsiveness to requests of students and teaching environment, resilience at school, self-reflection, resourcefulness, and developing good relationships are considered essential parts of the emotional work required by their profession as they adjust to teaching <ref type="bibr">(Buchanan, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Teachers' affective well-being has further implications, which occur at the school-level, related to their resolutions to discontinue their employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(McInerney et al., 2015)</ref>. Teacher's affective wellbeing impacts turnover and retention of teachers in Hong Kong, where affective commitment (i.e., emotional attachment of teachers to their profession), was favored over normative (i.e., feelings of obligation and duty) and continuance (i.e., fear of  ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ losing salary, status, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(McInerney et al., 2015)</ref>. This is in agreement with findings in European/English-speaking countries: according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Meyer et al. (2002)</ref>, these three types of commitment are negatively related to thoughts about resigning from the occupation as well. However, affective commitment maintains a high correlation with outcomes that are related to employee such as anxiety, family-to-work conflict, and outcomes that are related to organization such as participation, performance, and willingness to serve the organization even not included in job description.</p><p>Teachers' affect thus influences teachers' own wellbeing and their retention in the profession, rendering teacher attrition costly to both the individual teacher and to the community <ref type="bibr">(Buchanan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Schuck et al., 2012)</ref>. In the US, the turnover level in teaching is as high as 30% (and 50% in some areas of excessive poverty, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ingersoll (2001)</ref> and reaches 40% in Australia and some other OECD countries within five years of starting the profession <ref type="bibr">(Buchanan, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Institutional factors (at the federal, state, and school levels) also affect retention. A large-scale and broad survey that is conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics of US among schools and teachers with nation-wide representation revealed that high turnover rates result from small income levels, lack of enough support received by institutional management, insufficient control mechanisms, restricted access to institutional decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ingersoll, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Although teacher turnover is costly to states and schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Haynes, 2014)</ref>, it is challenging for educators to establish long-term relationships with the school communities they serve <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Darling-Hammond, 2010)</ref>. Stressful working conditions are among the critical antecedents of teachers' intentions-to-leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Weiss, 1999)</ref>, and a high rate of teacher turnover generates a lack of qualified teachers in many countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hong, 2012)</ref>. This is a major problem for Turkey and other countries, especially in disadvantaged schools in which teachers feel more pressure from stressful working conditions coupled with a lack of support <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Darling-Hammond, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Özoğlu, 2015)</ref>. The working conditions, time pressure, high workload, material deficiencies, lack of resources, and students' negative and uncertain attitudes are the main challenges that STEM teachers face in Turkey and other countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asunda &amp; Walker, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ejiwale, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Said, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Shadle et al., 2017)</ref>. In Turkey, teacher salaries are low, and there is a downward trend in the popularity of the teaching profession compared to the other OECD countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(OECD, 2018)</ref>. There are also resource gaps which reduce the ability of institutions to furnish students with the required instructional opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Özoğlu, 2015)</ref>. Consequently, disadvantaged schools face higher intensity of teacher turnover and often need to employ inexperienced or out of field teachers, (including Science and Mathematics teachers), to fill the vacancies <ref type="bibr">(Özoğlu, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the personal and public costs of teacher turnover are high. Consequently, more research that contributes to understanding the antecedents of teachers' affective well-being and potential psychological resources that aid them in remaining in the profession is essential. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hall-Kenyon et al., 2014)</ref>. One such theoretical model is that of teacher 'self-efficacy' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Efficacy, Affective Well-Being, and Intent-to-Leave</head><p>Self-efficacy is a belief about personal characteristics that embody individuals' thoughts, perceptions, attitudes, behaviors, and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>. The term self-efficacy describes a belief possessed by individuals about the extent to which they can cope with the challenges and control the actions that influence their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>. Self-efficacy is an organizational facilitator that empowers teachers to develop constructive perspectives and valuable schemes to deal with negative ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Betoret &amp; Artiga, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Erdem, 2015)</ref>, which may shield teachers against the harmful effects of job stress, such as burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Schwarzer &amp; Hallum, 2008)</ref>. Self-efficacy perceptions are not implicitly appraising. These perceptions are constructed aside from the reflections on the potentials of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gist, 2018)</ref>. On the contrary, primarily, self-efficacy beliefs are constructed from an individual's unique experiences and their interpretations related to the observers' field of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rittmayer &amp; Beier, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tatar &amp; Buldur, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shauka et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Science educators committed substantial time and efforts to develop professional tools in the field of science teaching for evaluating self-efficacy. These tools include Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI) by <ref type="bibr">Riggs (1988), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Riggs and</ref><ref type="bibr">Enochs (1990)</ref>, and Teaching Science as Inquiry (TSI), which was developed by <ref type="bibr">Smolleck et al. (2006)</ref> based on National Science Education Standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mintzes et al., 2013)</ref>. According to the research results, individuals with a solid science knowledge and a tendency to participate in reformist teaching actions exhibits maximum degrees of self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mintzes et al., 2013)</ref>. Usually, performing better and staying longer in STEM ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ instruction is directly proportional with the individuals' STEM self-efficacy <ref type="bibr">(Rittmayer and Baier, 2010)</ref>. However, to date, no studies have investigated the links between affective wellbeing and self-efficacy -and the effects of that link on intent-to leave -in STEM teachers. This study thus makes this new contribution to the literature.</p><p>Self-efficacy and well-being. Recent studies demonstrate that belief of teachers about their degrees of self-efficacy are significantly correlated to their sense of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Collie et al., 2016)</ref>. Teachers of high degrees of self-efficacy may create a high-quality classroom environment in which the teacher and students have more positive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dofková, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Guo et al., 2012)</ref>. Given the close relation between teachers' affective well-being and their self-efficacy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Collie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Çalışkan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Huang &amp; Yin, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Yuruk, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Koksal, 2018)</ref>, the relations between self-efficacy and an individual teacher's perceptions, attitudes, and feelings have led to a new line of inquiry about the variables related to teachers' affective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Klassen &amp; Chiu, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Affective well-being. Affective well-being is comprised of the strength and regularity of good and bad feelings and state of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Luhmann et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Warr (1990)</ref> conceptualized affective well-being as comprising four dimensions: enthusiasm, contentment, anxiety, and depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van Horn et al. (2004)</ref> suggested three oppositional sides of affective well-being: enthusiasm-depression (e.g., burnout), pleasure-displeasure (e.g., job satisfaction), and, tiredness-vigor (e.g., well-being). In this study, work-related stress and burnout (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van Horn et al., 2004)</ref>, and depression (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Warr, 1990)</ref> were measured in Science and Mathematics teachers as aspects of their affective well-being.</p><p>Burnout result from prolonged job-related stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jennett et al., 2003)</ref>, especially when educators accept that they are unable to deal with the workplace adversities <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Maslach et al., 2001)</ref>. Working under the pressure of the high demands of the teaching profession, teachers are more prone to burnout if they lack appropriate psychological resources to cope with it <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Klusmann et al., 2008)</ref>. Consequently, teachers who can successfully adapt to the stressful requirements experience fewer job burnouts (E.M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Skaalvik &amp; Skaalvik, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">2010)</ref>.</p><p>Teachers feel stressed when there is a mismatch between job requirements and their abilities to deal with those requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hakanen et al., 2006)</ref>. According to Hobfoll et al. 's Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, individuals cannot deal with the destructive effects of negative experiences at work if the psychological resources which enable them to be more resilient are depleted <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hobfoll et al., 2000)</ref>. These individuals, working at a highly demanding work environment, feel stress, anxiety, and burnout at the same time as they are trying to cope with their negative emotions. If their coping strategies become ineffective, and they feel that their resources have become significantly depleted, they may relinquish their tasks and experience depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hobfoll et al., 2000)</ref>. There is experimental evidence that self-efficacy beliefs of the teachers and frequency of job burnout and depression are inversely proportional <ref type="bibr">(Capone &amp; Petrillo, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Several research studies have shown that teachers' self-efficacy has a positive effect on their affective wellbeing in terms of decreasing levels of stress, burnout, depression, and intent to leave and increasing commitment to their employment and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aloe et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jeon et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klassen &amp; Chiu, 2011)</ref>. This indicates that teachers' self-efficacy beliefs count among the psychological resources that strengthen them against the negative effects of work-related stress, burnout, and depression. H1: Self-efficacy impact stress, burnout, depression, and intent to leave directly and negatively. H2: Self-efficacy negatively impact burnout through the mediatory influence of stress. H3: Self-efficacy negatively impact depression through the mediatory influences of stress and burnout.</p><p>Intent-to-leave, which can predict employment-related 'teacher turnover, ' is likely another important outcome of teachers' low levels of self-efficacy and affective well-being; when teachers cannot cope with the stressful situations they face in the classrooms and the systems in which they work, they are inclined to leave their schools or leave the teaching profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Borman and Dowling, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gist, 2018)</ref>. Teachers who do not have substantial psychological resources to cope with the challenges at work can suffer from a lack of satisfaction, motivation, and belonging, and then, feeling emotionally exhausted, they are more inclined to leave teaching (E.M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Skaalvik &amp; Skaalvik, 2011)</ref>. For Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) discipline, lack of adequate number of teachers is a serious problem. Unfortunately, STEM classes experience the highest idle time <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cowan et al., 2016)</ref>. According to a meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Borman and Dowling (2008)</ref>, since science and mathematics are required for all graduates in US and in many countries, attrition in teachers is more common for teachers of these subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Wright et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ H4: Self-efficacy negatively impacts teachers' intent-to-leave through the mediatory influences of stress, burnout, and depression.</p><p>Science and Mathematics teachers are more susceptible to experience poor affective wellbeing because they have unique stressors at work such as the difficulty of the subjects they are expected to teach, students' amotivation, high levels of anxiety, and low levels of confidence to learn those difficult subjects, and the troubles in getting the required materials to teach science or mathematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beilock et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Halim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Soyibo, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. It means that Science and Mathematics teachers need stronger levels of self-efficacy to cope with all those subject-specific difficulties and protect themselves from the adverse consequences of poor affective wellbeing such as intent-to-leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Liu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Perera &amp; John, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Teig et al., 2019)</ref>. Although self-efficacy and affective wellbeing are the matters of interest to attract and retain Science and Mathematics teachers, most of the studies in the literature about this topic were on the general teachers. To date, no single study has explored the impact of Science and Mathematics teachers' self-efficacy on their intent-to-leave through the mediating effects of their affective well-being indicators. Therefore, the current research aims to explore the effect of self-efficacy on intentto-leave through the mediating effects of affective well-being indicators in terms of stress, burnout, and depression. Based on the aforementioned hypotheses, the proposed model shows that affective well-being indicators play a significant mediating role in the relation between teachers' self-efficacies and their intent-to-leave (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Background</head><p>As methodology, we employed a survey-based correlational design in which self-reported scales of selfefficacy, stress, burnout, depression, and intention to leave were administered to the Science and Mathematics teachers. A structural equation modelling approach was adopted for the analysis based on the a priori hypotheses. This research was conducted in 2018 academic year, with the Science and Mathematics teachers working at the secondary schools in South and East Anatolia in Turkey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>The population of this study was comprised of Science and Mathematics teachers working at 876 secondary schools in twelve cities in the South and East region of Anatolia. All the Science and Mathematics teachers were surveyed at the selected schools 232 clustered, randomly-selected secondary schools. There were 376 Science and ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ Mathematics teachers working at the selected schools. The response rate was 87.5% with 329 teachers who agreed to answer the questions. The minimum sample size required for this number of population at a 95% confidence interval was reached with the current teacher sample.</p><p>The demographic information of the sample shows that were 199 male teachers (60.5%) while 130 of them were females (39.5%). The majority of the teacher participants' experience range was between one to ten years (50.8%, n=167). A great number of the teachers' age range was between 31-40 years (41%, n=135).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments and Procedures</head><p>Ethical permission for this study was taken from the research ethics board of the university of the first author. Data for the study were obtained from questionnaires, answered on 5-point Likert-type scales. Each point in the scale was: "5= I totally agree"; "4= I agree"; "3= I agree partially"; "2= I don't agree"; and "1= I don't agree at all". Information about these scales is given as follows.</p><p>The Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale was translated to Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Yılmaz et al. (2004)</ref> and was originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Schmitz and Schwarzer (2000)</ref>. This scale measures teachers' self-efficacy beliefs on their competencies of dealing with the most compelling duties at school even under the pressure of various stressors and negative feelings. There were eight items in the scale and none of the items was deleted. The scale consisted of two factors with acceptable Cronbach's Alpha coefficients as follows; Coping business behavior: .73 and Innovator business behavior: .77. The overall Cronbach's Alpha coefficient of the scale was .785. The factor analysis (KMO = .811, Bartlett = .000, explained variance = 58.02 %) produced good fit indices (χ² = 22.797, df = 13, χ²/df = 1.754, p-value = .044, Comparative Fit Index [CFI] = .983, Incremental Fit Index [IFI] = .983, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation [RMSEA] = .048, Tucker &amp; Lewis Fit Index [TLI] = .973).</p><p>A four items scale was used to measure teacher stress, which was prepared by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Karakus (2013)</ref>. This scale measures teachers' general stress levels related to the teaching profession and working conditions at school. None of the items was deleted and the factor analysis (KMO = .720, Bartlett = .000, explained variance = 50.93 %) confirmed the unidimensionality of this scale with acceptable fit indices (Cronbach's Alpha = .802, χ² = .18, df = 1, χ²/df = .18, p-value = .892, CFI = 1.00, IFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .000, TLI = 1.00).</p><p>The short version of the Burnout Inventory was translated to Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Tumkaya et al. (2009)</ref> and originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pines (2005)</ref>. This self-report burnout scale assesses teachers' mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion levels. There were seven items and none of the items was deleted. The factor analysis (KMO = .891, Bartlett = .000, explained variance = 52.02 %) confirmed the unidimensionality of this scale with good fit indices (Cronbach's Alpha = .859, χ² = 3.023, df = 4, χ²/df = .756, p-value = .554, CFI = 1.00, IFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .000, TLI = 1.00).</p><p>Teachers' depression was measured by a scale developed by the International Personality Item Pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goldberg, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goldberg et al., 2006)</ref> and translated to Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Karakus (2013)</ref>. This scale measures the general symptoms of teachers' depression such as pessimism, hopelessness, sadness, and meaninglessness. Five items (of six) remained after factor analysis (KMO = .881, Bartlett = .000, explained variance = 75.86 %) and the unidimensionality of this scale was confirmed with acceptable fit indices (Cronbach's Alpha = .895, χ² =1.340, df = 2, χ²/df = .000, p-value = .670, CFI = 1.000, IFI = 1.000, RMSEA = .000, TLI = 1.000).</p><p>Teachers' intentions-to-leave school was measured by a three items scale prepared by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Karakus et al. (2014)</ref>. These questions assess the teachers' ideas about quitting their current school and their plans to look for a new school. None of the items was deleted and the factor analysis (KMO = .821, Bartlett = .000, explained variance = 58.58 %) confirmed the unidimensionality of this measurement tool with good fit indices (Cronbach's Alpha = .949, χ² = 1.677, df = 1, χ²/df = 1.677, p-value = .195, CFI = 1.00, IFI = 1.000, RMSEA = .050, TLI = 1.00).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and reliability analyses were done for each individual scale employed in the current research, using the Maximum Likelihood method. The measurement model was developed first, letting the covariances free between the latent variables, and then, the structural model was developed, by defining the causal relationships between the latent constructs based on the apriori hypotheses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Results and Correlations</head><p>Descriptive results and correlations between the variables included in this study are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. According to the mean scores in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, teachers' levels of self-efficacy are relatively high (4). They also have moderate levels of depression, burnout, stress, and intent-to-leave (3).</p><p>Correlation matrix reveals that self-efficacy has negative relations with stress, burnout, depression, and intent to leave, and stress, burnout, depression, and intent to leave are all positively correlated with each other.</p><p>Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on all the scales used in this study. As suggested by the modification indices, three error covariances were defined in the measurement model along with the deletion of two items. D6 and B5 items were deleted, respectively. D6 was deleted because it had a low factor loading under 0.30. B5 was deleted because it had a high error variance and inflated the general chi-square value of the model. Between the items of B6 and B7, D2 and D3, and S1 and S2, error covariances were defined to solve the problem that occurred because of the high relations between their errors. After these modifications, the measurement model had adequate fit indices (χ² = 590.864, SD = 309, χ²/df = 1.912, IFI = .948, TLI = .940, CFI = .947, RMSEA = .053). There are relatively high and meaningful correlations between the latent constructs in the measurement model (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The relations between the latent variables in the measurement model were significant and the directions of the correlations were in line with the apriori hypotheses illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. It enabled the researchers to delete the covariances and define the causal relations between the latent constructs in the next step in order to develop the structural model. The insignificant paths of Efficacy→Leave (ß= -.167, p= .447), Burnout→Leave (ß= -.091, p= .417), Efficacy→Depression (ß= -.062, p= .307) and Stress→Depression <ref type="bibr">(ß= -.091, p= .191)</ref> were trimmed from the model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). ∆χ² values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows that none of the deleted paths caused a significant change in χ² values and the fit indices did not change significantly after those paths were trimmed. The final model still had adequate fit indices (χ² = 594.935, df = 313, χ²/df = 1.901, CFI = .947, IFI = .948, RMSEA = .052, TLI = .941).  The final structural equation model reveals that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy are less likely to experience negative affective states and therefore, they less frequently intend to leave their schools. More specifically, stress is a partial mediator in the relation between self-efficacy and burnout, stress and burnout are full mediators in the relation between self-efficacy and depression, and finally, stress, burnout, and depression are full mediators in the relation between self-efficacy and intent-to-leave (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Although there are individual studies about the relations between individual variables (such as self-efficacystress, self-efficacy -burnout, self-efficacy -depression, and self-efficacy -intent-to-leave), we used a unique ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ perspective of psychological resources and developed a model with an original combination of the relevant antecedents of Science and Mathematics teachers' intentions-to-leave, which affects the actual turnover rate of the teaching force. The results of this study provide some insights to educational leaders and communities on how to increase teacher retention in Science and Mathematics education because attracting and retaining STEM teachers is a greater problem than in any other discipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cowan et al., 2016)</ref>.

As the results of the current study revealed, teachers with high levels of self-efficacy experienced less stress, burnout, and depression, and consequently, they less frequently intended to leave their school.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Firstly, the current study employs a cross-sectional and correlational design. It does not guarantee the causal relations between the independent and dependent variables. Although self-efficacy is the exogenous variable and the other variables (affective well-being indicators and intent-to-leave) are indigenous variables in this study, there might be bidirectional (or reciprocal) relations between those variables. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Huang and Yin (2018)</ref> tested the effect of affective well-being indicators on teachers' self-efficacy levels and found that pleasant affect was more closely related to teachers' self-efficacy than negative affect. However, in the current study, we found that teachers' self-efficacy contributes to their affective well-being. Longitudinal studies can be designed, and non-recursive structural equation models can be tested in future studies to understand the nature of the relations between those variables.</p><p>Secondly, we used only self-reports from teachers in the sample to collect data about teachers' self-efficacy, affective well-being, and intent-to-leave. Although the teachers are the best target group to collect data about their own self-efficacy beliefs, well-being indicators, and intentions, the shared variance between the variables examined in this study might have biased the results of this study. Although the scales we used in this study were valid and reliable ones, using only self-reported measures to collect data from the same respondents might have caused self-exaggerating or self-derogatory biases in this study. More objective and clinical methods can be used in future studies to understand the nature of teachers' beliefs, intentions, and well-being levels.</p><p>Finally, among many other possible antecedents of teacher turnover, the current research focused on only self-efficacy and affective wellbeing indicators of teachers as the antecedents of their intentions-to-leave school. The findings of this study sheds light on this issue from a psychological resource perspective. Other studies can develop different models focusing on social or organizational antecedents of teacher attrition and retention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Implications</head><p>This exploratory study shed light on the outcomes and benefits of Science and Mathematics teachers' levels of self-efficacy in terms of their affective well-being and retention in educational employment. However, we measured ISSN 1648-3898 /Print/ ISSN 2538-7138 /Online/ beliefs, intentions, and stated affects in the form of stress burnout and depression. Further studies are needed to understand the effect of self-efficacy on teachers' long-term outcomes, such as trait affects, performance, and actual turnover. The influence of specific dimensions of teacher self-efficacy, such as personal teaching efficacy, general teaching efficacy, and disciplinary efficacy can also be probed in future studies to understand the nature of the actual psychological resources teachers have to cope with their negative emotions. Future studies can also examine the most effective coping strategies teachers use to increase their affective well-being and retention rates. The current model, while it shows that self-efficacy is a psychological resource that enables teachers to cope with challenges, does not identify the actual mechanisms and strategies teachers use to improve their affective wellbeing and the other positive outcomes.</p><p>As one of the most important psychological resources, the self-efficacy of Science and Mathematics teachers should be nurtured by educational leaders to increase their affective well-being and retention. Science and Mathematics teachers should be provided with more learning opportunities to fill the gaps in their pedagogical content knowledge to increase their positive perceptions about their competency levels. There is empirical evidence that such in-service training activities enhance Turkish Science and Mathematics teachers' competencies in planning, implementation, and evaluation of the instructional process of Science and Mathematics education <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bozkurt Altan &amp; Ercan, 2016)</ref>. Educational leaders should also empower Science and Mathematics teachers to build more positive attributes to their competencies in teaching.</p><p>The results imply that teachers with high levels of self-efficacy feel more competent to handle stressful situations at work and consequently are less likely to experience burnout and depression. Accordingly, professional development programs can be organized for teachers to build confidence in their competencies to deal with challenging situations in their schools effectively. Rather than just focusing on how teachers can better meet the needs of their students, educational leaders should determine the potential stressors that Science and Mathematics teachers face at school, then include effective coping strategies in professional development programs to build higher levels of self-efficacy among teachers.</p><p>The results clarify the importance of workplace stressors on teachers' affective well-being and attrition. To alleviate the psychological challenges faced by Science and Mathematics teachers, school leaders should create positive climates at work and introduce policies to focus more on mitigating the psychological burdens of teachers. This includes providing them with opportunities for appropriate professional development.</p><p>This study is the first to analyze Science and Mathematics teachers' self-efficacy, affective well-being indicators, and intent-to-leave simultaneously. The results showed that Science and Mathematics teachers with high selfefficacy are more resilient to the adverse effects of stressful situations at work, and therefore, they less frequently experience burnout and depression. Because of their beliefs about their competence and their positive affective states, they are less likely to intend leaving the profession.</p><p>This study addresses one aspect of the current problem of teacher retention in Science and Mathematics education. It provides insights about teachers' beliefs in their competence and their affective well-being, and how this impacts their intentions-to-leave the profession. The current paper is an initial contribution, and further studies that explore the relations between Science and Mathematics teachers' self-efficacy, affective well-being, and retention rates will add more to the field.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Abstract.</head><label></label><figDesc>The current research aims to explore the impact of Science and Mathematics teachers' self-efficacy on their intentions to leave through the mediating effects of their affective wellbeing (stress, burnout, and depression). Data were collected from 329 teachers of Science and Mathematics who were selected randomly with a clustered sampling method from 232 secondary schools in South and East Anatolia, Turkey. The structural equation model that yielded the best fit indicated that as teachers' self-efficacy levels increase, their stress, burnout, depression, and intent-to-leave levels decrease. Teachers with high selfefficacy are less likely to develop intentionto-leave because of their positive affective well-being indicators. Results suggest that maths and science teachers who have optimistic beliefs in their capabilities can more easily cope with the stressors at work and have better affective well-being, and consequently, a lower level of intentionto-leave. The results provide educational leaders with insights as to how better to retain qualified Science and Mathematics teachers.</figDesc></figure>
