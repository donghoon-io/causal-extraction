<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There is a growing interest in the analyses of process data (e.g., intraindividual, intensive longitudinal, diary, or micro-analytical data) in educational research, and in the social sciences. This trend follows a general surge in studies using ambulatory measurement (e.g., experience sampling, ecological momentary assessment) for collecting real-time self-reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hamaker &amp; Wichers, 2017)</ref>. Focus is on the sequence of events. These are multiple learning experiences that take place within a relatively short time-window. Situation-specific reports allow participants to report on an event close in time to the experience of the event. This reduces recall bias and enhances contextual closeness of the resulting data. Educational researchers interested in learning processes have collected process data in order to understand fluctuations of a multitude of variables, for example: interest, self-regulation, motivation, competence beliefs, and engagement. The resulting data allows us to investigate how these variables are associated within and between time-points, and whether there are individual differences in such associations (for an overview see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Murayama et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The process-perspective was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schmitz (2006)</ref> according to which researchers, first, investigate the shape and form of changes in real-time (i.e., the process) and second, investigate the effects of instruction on these processes. Third, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hamaker (2012)</ref> researchers would then investigate whether there are individual differences in the effects of instruction on the processes, and fourth, whether these differences are predictable by individual characteristics. In this tutorial, a series of intraindividual models relevant for educational research are presented. As example data we use controlled and autonomous motivation, which are two of many key dimensions for describing learning in classrooms. Controlled motivation represents effects of instruction in the form of demands, pressure and expectations in the classroom, and autonomous motivation represents the sense of self-direction, enjoyment, interest and choices during the learning process, both as experienced by students. This presentation complements other tutorials on multilevel modelling (MLM, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hox, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Moskowitz &amp; Hershberger, 2002)</ref>, MLM applied to diary data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bolger &amp; Laurenceau, 2013)</ref>, and multilevel structural models (MSEM; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hox, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morin, Bollen, Nagengast &amp; Scalas, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Silva, Bosancianu &amp; Littvay, 2020)</ref>. The models presented here are suitable for data which includes time-points nested in students, for which researchers want to specify latent multiple-indicator constructs. These are referred to as intraindividual structural equation models or "ISEM". While educational researchers who have applied MLM and MSEM have typically focused on students nested in classrooms or schools, the sequence of models presented here can serve as a protocol for educational researchers who want to venture into the emerging field of intraindividual research, focusing on time-points nested within students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An intuition for intraindividual data</head><p>According to self-determination theory motivation is conceptualized on a continuum from autonomous (or intrinsic) to controlled (or extrinsic) motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Intrinsic motivation depicts the reasons for regulation as inherently internal, such as carrying out an action because one enjoys it, has the choice to do so, or one is interested in it. When actions are perceived as internally regulated individuals feel autonomous. In classrooms most learning goals are set by teachers, who can decide on the contents, sequence, and pace of the teaching, consistent with ideas of teacher-centered instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cornelius-White, 2007)</ref>, teacher-directed instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Connor, Morrison &amp; Petrella, 2004)</ref>, direct instruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Flanders, 1970)</ref>, or structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jang, Reeve &amp; Deci, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Skinner &amp; Belmont, 1993)</ref>. When teachers set expectations and support students at the same time, students sense of autonomy can be maintained even under pressure. If the expectations are upheld with threats, deadlines and negative repercussions for the individual, the sense of autonomy may be replaced by a sense of coercion.</p><p>In order to get an intuition for intraindividual data, let's start by looking at data from two fictional students. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we see that students report their experienced controlled and autonomous motivation five times the second day of the study. There are Note: Auto T -1 is the lag, Auto D-1 is the within-schoolday lag, Auto S-1 is the within-school-subject lag. The first occurrence each day and school-subject is coded missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Malmberg &amp; Martin, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>many ways in which we can make sense of these time-points nested in students, according to the organisational structure of school-life. The self-reports are nested within days, but can also be thought of as structured by school subject. school subject (to the right). We can see that the self-reports vary below and above the daily means, the daily means are different from each other, highest on Wednesday and lowest on Thursday. Alternatively, when we group the ratings by school-subject we see differences in controlled motivation. It is low during the one Arts lesson and relatively highest during English lessons. These structures have been taken into account in modelling in different ways. For example, in their study spanning four weeks, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Martin et al., 2015)</ref> found that there was the most variance between lessons, the least variance between weeks, and moderate variance between students. Other studies have found small effects of school-subject (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tolvanen et al., 2011)</ref>. In the present study we included time-of-day and day-of-the-week as predictors in the models.</p><p>To the left in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>  controlled and autonomous motivation of the first student is moderately positive, the intraindividual correlation is r = 0.32), i.e., at points in time when controlled motivation is high, autonomous motivation is high. This student might interpret the teachers' actions as providing structure and guidance. For the second student, this correlation is negative (r = -0.34), i.e., when controlled motivation is high, autonomous motivation is low. This student might interpret the teacher's instruction as demanding, and to some extent coercive.</p><p>The difference in intraindividual correlations is important, as this suggests there might be individual differences in associations between controlled and autonomous motivation. Exploring such differential effects of controlled motivation on autonomous motivation would be an important research question (i.e., individual differences in slopes). After that one would investigate if any individual characteristic could predict such differential effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hamaker, 2012)</ref>, (i.e., moderators of the association between controlled and autonomous motivation).</p><p>Third, we can also think of the data-points in their chronological order, and estimate associations between each data-point (at Time T) and each previous time-point (the lagged time-point Time T-1) as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. This gives two auto-regressive correlations, the association between each observation of the same variable at T and the preceding time-point T-1. It gives two cross-lagged correlations, the association between one of the variables at T and the other variable at T-1. We can then estimate further associations between these four variables. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> we can see that both students have fairly stable impressions of controlled motivation over time. The association between controlled motivation at Time T and T-1 is r = .42. The stability of autonomous motivation is slightly higher for the first (r = .58) than for the second student (r = .46). A higher level of previous autonomous motivation is associated with a higher level of concurrent controlled motivation for the first student (r = .43), but not for the second student (r = .06). An opposite pattern is found when we look at the association between concurrent autonomous motivation (at T) and the preceding controlled motivation (T-1). We see that a higher level of previous controlled motivation is unrelated with the concurrent autonomous motivation for the first student (r = -.01), but negative for the second student, i.e., the higher level of controlled motivation the lesson before, the lower is autonomous motivation in the concurrent lesson (r = -.32). The directionality in the effects over time is different for the two students. Student 1 might perceive the teacher as tightening the grip the higher autonomous motivation is the previous lesson, i.e., the student has an evocative effect on the teacher <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nurmi, 2012)</ref>. Student 2 seems to be more evoked by the teacher's action the previous lesson, i.e., an effect of the teacher on the student the subsequent lesson.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models for intraindividual data</head><p>Models for intraindividual data are not new. The multilevel model for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hox, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Raudenbush, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 2012)</ref>, and the latent growth model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Grimm, Ram &amp; Estabrook, 2017)</ref>, enable the estimation of individual differences in change over time. Multivariate time-series analysis enables the estimation of stability over time, and effects of one time-varying variable on another <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Schmitz &amp; Skinner, 1993)</ref>. While growth models can be specified with as few as three time-points (or two time-points for a change model), time-series analyses typically require 100 data-points.</p><p>Models for intraindividual studies, ranging between 20-40 observations per participant, has too many time-points for a growth model, and too few time-points for a time-series analysis, making the lagged-variable approach attractive (Musher-Eizenman,</p><p>Nesselroade <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">&amp; Schmitz, 2002)</ref>. Many intraindividual studies to date have made use of scale-scores or single-item response variables used with multilevel models. The structural equation model (SEM) was developed to use for multiple-indicator constructs in single-level models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jöreskog, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1982)</ref>. Later developments allowed constructs at two levels to be fitted (B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Muthén, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Muthén, , 1994) )</ref> merging the best of two worlds MLM and SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Mehta &amp; Neale, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondalh &amp; Xiaahui, 2012)</ref>. The doubly latent model has advantages over and above the use of scale-scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lüdtke et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>

First, we need to ensure that the hypothesized factor structure of our latent constructs fit data. Then, we pursue two types of models with particular focus on the time-structure. The models presented here can be summarized as (1) measurement models and covariate effects models (Models 1a, 1b and 2); (2) models for individual differences in effects of </p></div>

We start by investigating whether our hypothesized factor structure fits the data. We test our a priori idea that controlled motivation can be measured with two items and autonomous motivation with three items. Whether this model fits data or not is determined by the goodness of fit indices. We fit this model at both levels at once. At the within-level, we model how the reports of situation-specific experiences fit the pooled situation-specific constructs. At the between-level, we model how the students' average experiences (average across all the reports during the week) fit the student-level constructs. This will be done in two steps, the second step incrementally stricter than the first.</p><p>Upon establishing that the model fits data we can inspect how large proportion of variance there is at the between-level, by inspecting the intraclass correlations (ICC).</p><p>This gives us an idea of how much students deviate from the grand-average (at the between-level) and how much students deviate from their own average (at the within-level).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariate effects.</head><p>For researchers covariates can be important, either for answering a substantive research question (e.g., what is the effect of gender on motivation?), or for statistical control, to rule out that the sought effects are not due to extraneous factors (e.g., what is the association between controlled and autonomous motivation controlling for time of day?).</p><p>Important covariates to include could be features of the time-structure and characteristics of participants. In the present example, we illustrate the use of such level-specific covariate effects on motivation. At the within-level, we included time of day and day of the week, and gender and year-group at the between level. Depending on the role of the covariates, whether these answer specific research questions of the researcher or are used as statistical controls, their meaning could vary across projects.</p><p>After inspecting covariate effects on key outcomes, researchers could then in their specific design, decide to keep the covariates included in the model or to exclude them.</p><p>In the sequence of modelling here, we for simplicity remove the covariate effects in the subsequent models. This model is called a fixed effect model in MLM literature.</p><p>In the following steps we pose Models 3a, 3b and 4, in which the chronological order of time is not explicit in the research questions instead modelling "individuals as their own controls", while in Models 5 to 6 we explicitly include this chronological order, by using lagged variables.</p><p>Individuals as their own controls. Upon establishing the first theoretical idea of intraindividual research, understanding the shape and form of processes (as done descriptively), researchers would be interested in whether instruction (controlled motivation) has an effect on processes (autonomous motivation). Phrased differently, we in Model 3a investigate whether a students' autonomous motivation in a particular situation is predicted by controlled motivation in that situation. In other words, when controlled motivation in a situation is higher than the students' average controlled motivation, is autonomous motivation then higher or lower? We only model this association at the within-level of Model 3a. This model is estimated so that the effect of controlled on autonomous motivation is the same for all students. This model is called a random intercept, fixed effect model in MLM literature, but in contrast to the the previous fixed effect model (Model 2) we include the predictor variable as a latent construct.</p><p>We then go on to investigate whether there are individual differences in the association between controlled and autonomous motivation, in Model 3b. Here we allow the regressions to look different for each student (individual differences in slopes), meaning that some students could be more autonomously motivated when controlled motivation is high, and others less motivated. As will be shown there were indeed individual differences in this association. This model is called a random intercept, random effect model in MLM literature. It means that the regression slope for each student is estimated to deviate from the average slope (the fixed slope in model 3a).</p><p>In Model 4 we include a student-characteristic as a moderator of the association between controlled and autonomous motivation. Technically we include students' academic performance at the between-level in the model to predict the individual slopes. This model is called a cross-level interaction, or slopes-as-outcome model in MLM literature, analogous to a moderator in the single-level parlance. It means that we regress the individual regression slopes on the moderator.</p><p>Chronological order of time. When we want to take account of the chronological order of the data, we can conceptualize the time-structure in educational studies in many ways, e.g., time-points nested in days, nested in weeks, nested in students <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Martin et al., 2015)</ref>, fixed effects of time-structure variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Tolvanen et al., 2011)</ref>, as lagged models <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Musher-Eizenman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Schmitz &amp; Skinner, 1993)</ref>, or Dynamic SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asparouhov, Hamaker &amp; Muthén, 2018)</ref>. There are two important issues regarding the lagged structure of educational data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Malmberg &amp; Martin, 2019)</ref>, first, whether to lag within school-days (e.g., D-1 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) or within school-subjects (e.g., S-1 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), and second what to do with downtime, when students are away from school? In this example we use the within school-subject lag. In Model 5 we investigate whether autonomous motivation is stable between time S-1 and S (note that S is the same time-point as T), i.e., whether a previous learning experience in a particular school subject predicts the subsequent learning experience in that particular school subject, even though these might be a day apart, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>?</p><p>In Model 6 we are interested in the directionality in learning experiences, i.e., reciprocal effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guay, Marsh &amp; Boivin, 2003)</ref>, over time, particularly, does autonomous motivation in a previous lesson predict controlled motivation in the subsequent lesson, or does controlled motivation in a previous lesson predict autonomous motivation in the subsequent lesson?</p><p>Summary of models. In order to specify theory-informed models for intra-individual data (1. What is the shape and form of the processes? 2. How does instruction predict process(es)? 3. Are there individual differences in the predictions? and 4. Are there individual-level moderators of the predictions?), a set of models was presented and summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Upon establishing that one's indicators fit the hypothesized factor structure, and effects of any necessary covariates, the researcher can embark on modelling associations between constructs (i.e., "Individuals as their own controls"), or explicitly focus on the lagged chronological sequence of experiences. We will now illustrate these models using empirical example data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Procedure</head><p>Example data are part of the Learning Every Lesson (LEL) study (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Malmberg, Walls, Martin, Little &amp; Lim, 2013)</ref>. A subset of 202 students, in 14 classrooms, who had reported between 10 to 24 times during a calendar week, on average 14.9 time-points (SD = 3.2; in total 3,017 responses (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Malmberg &amp; Martin, 2019)</ref>. Of these 77 (38.1%) were in Year 5 and 125 (61.9%) in Year 6. There were 93 (46.0%) boys and 109 (54.0%) girls. Their mean age was 10.5 years (SD = 0.65). We used time-stamp data for creating covariates for the analyses: time of day, and day of the week (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Student-reports of school subject (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) were used for creating the lagged school-subject variable S-1 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>) . Teachers reported the students' most recent academic performance, but imputed for five students. Otherwise the dataset was listwise deleted for simplicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Students' real-time experiences of learning were measured using the Learning Experience Questionnaire (LEQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Malmberg, Woolgar &amp; Martin, 2013)</ref>. Autonomous motivation included three items in response to the opening phrase "why were you doing this task?...I enjoyed it", "I was interested" and "I chose it" (1 = not at all, 4 = very much). We report McDonald's ω (the proportion of shared variance between the items of each construct; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">McDonald, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Revelle &amp; Zinbarg, 2009)</ref> for each construct, ω W = 0.83; ω B = 0.89. We calculated the average and variation in internal consistencies across time-segments (cross-sections of the data): M a = .84; SD a = .07). Controlled motivation included two items "I had to do it" and "my teacher wanted me to do it" (1 = not at all, 4 = very much; ω W = 0.76; ω B = 0.94; M a = .83; SD a = .08). Descriptives for the raw and lagged data are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. The lagged variables have missing data. This data is missing by design, assumed to be Missing Completely at Random (MCAR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models and findings</head><p>The specification of and key findings from the models included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> are now presented. All models were fitted in Mplus (B. <ref type="bibr">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">-2017)</ref>, and made available in the supplementary materials.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models 1a and 1b. Two-level Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>We started by inspecting descriptive data. As some of the indicators exceeded ± 1 for skewness, although none exceeded ± 3 for kurtosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair Jr, Black, Babin &amp; Anderson, 2014)</ref> , we used Robust Maximum Likelihood (MLR) which adjusts the standard errors for minor deviations from normality in all models (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</p><p>Intraclass correlations showed that 29% to 47% of the variance was at the between-level, suggesting that taking account of the multilevel structure is warranted. The graphical representation of the MCFA follows the logic of placing the observed variables in the mid-section, with the between-part of the model above (with parameters indexed with "B") and within-part of the model below (with parameters indexed "W"). Please see the Supplementary Materials for the models represented in further detail in LISREL notation.</p><p>We specified MCFAs in Models 1a and 1b, to test whether the hypothesized factor structure would fit the data. Following the legend in Fig 3 , we start with the raw data depicted in rectangles in the mid-part. Our five manifest (observed) variables provide the input information needed for the model: the variance-covariance matrix (see explanation in next paragraph). This information is partitioned into a within-part and a between part, giving a variance/covariance-matrix for each level. The smaller circles above and below the rectangles (linked with a directional arrow fixed at 1) depict this level-specific variance-covariance information. They are depicted as latent variables as it is not observed in the raw data. Latent constructs at the within ("W") and between levels ("B") are specified to predict the variance in the level-specific (latent) indicators.</p><p>Arrows pointing from latent constructs to smaller circles are factor loadings, indicating this directionality: the construct predicts each manifest variables via regression-paths, e.g., enj B = intercept B + factor-loading B × latent construct B + a uniqueness B .</p><p>Although controlled motivation would not be identified on its own, as there are only three pieces of information (two variances and one covariance; 2 × (2+1) / 2 = 3), and we would want to estimate four parameters, and autonomous motivation is saturated (as there are 3 × (4+1) / 2 = 6) six pieces of information for estimating six parameters. For the two constructs, we have five indicators which give (5 × (5+1) / 2 = 15) 15 elements in a variance-covariance information matrix to estimate the model on: 5 variances and 10 covariances. The factor structure is the same at the within-level (representing the time-points) and the between-level in the model (representing the students), but the factor loadings are allowed to be different at the two levels. This is called configural invariance. As the students were nested in 14 classes, we also need to take this level of the hierarchical structure into consideration. We do so by adjusting the standard errors in the model for the classroom-level clustering. In Model 1a the factor loadings are allowed to be different at the two levels.</p><p>In the next step, we continue to investigate whether the hypothesized factor structure fits our data, but impose a stricter measurement model, called weak invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Meredith, 1993)</ref>, in order to establish an equivalent metric of the parameter estimates (e.g., B, R 2 ) across the two levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Morin et al., 2014)</ref>. This is done by equating the factor loadings to be equal across the two levels. These are indicated with subscripts (a) to (e) in Fig 3.</p><p>We  <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">and West (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hox (2002)</ref>. Thresholds for good fit are RMSEA below 0.06 and SRMR below 0.08, and CFA above 0.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Both models 1a and 1b fitted data well as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. When we plot the factor scores of students'  Although it would be possible to jump directly to Model 4 for answering this particular research question, we here split up the steps for demonstrating transparency and good practice to incrementally build up models (see <ref type="bibr">Fig 4)</ref>. By going slowly step-by-step, we can keep an eye on whether model fit and parameter estimates become unreasonable at any stage. Details for all steps are available in the Supplementary Materials. We model autonomous motivation at both the within and between-levels, and controlled motivation at the within level only, as a predictor of autonomous motivation.</p><p>Autonomous motivation is equipped with a disturbance term, which captures the residual in the regression equation: auto W = βcntr W + residual.</p><p>In Model 3a we are interested in the fixed effect of situation-specific controlled motivation on situation-specific autonomous motivation. We keep in mind this is the pooled average across all the situations. This effect was β = 0.12, p = n.s., meaning that students jointly experience somewhat (but not significatly) elevated enjoyment, interest and choice (autonomous motivation) in situations when teacher expectations (controlled motivation) were above their average controlled motivation (as the indicators of controlled motivation were centred within clusters; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Enders &amp; Tofighi, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Malmberg, Walls et al., 2013)</ref>). This effect is shown as parallel regression slopes in quadrant B of Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>, as all individual effects were estimated to be equal to each other.</p><p>In Model 3b we allowed both the intercept and the slope of each regression line to vary for each student. This is indicated as a dot in the within-part of the model, and we include a new construct "random slopes", at the between level. The average "random slopes" is the fixed effect of controlled on autonomous motivation (B = 0.06, p = 0.39), and the variance is the deviation of the individual slopes from this average slope (ψ = 0.62, p ≤ 0.001). The steepness of the slope was unrelated to the student-average autonomous motivation ρ = 0.02, p = 0.49). This means that some individual students feel inspired when demands are higher, while others get turned off when demands are higher, as shown in panel C of Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>.</p><p>In Model 4 we include a student-level moderator of the association between controlled and autonomous motivation. Both the individual slopes construct and student-average autonomous motivation were regressed on academic performance. We find that academic performance predicts the slope (β = -0.23; p ≤ 0.001). This is referred to as a cross-level interaction, slopes-as-outcome model, or moderation effect.</p><p>This effect is plotted in panel D of Fig 5 . For relatively higher achievers an elevated controlled motivation was associated with lower autonomous motivation, and for relatively lower achievers with a higher autonomous motivation. This finding demonstrates how differently students interpret their teachers' actions, depending on whether they are low, mid-range, or high-achievers.  Note: Please see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> for an overview of the specified models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lagged-effect model</head><p>We now include constructs representing the lagged effects of the previous school-subject-lagged report (at time S-1)(see Models 5 and 6 in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>). Thus, the lagged indicators had S-1 to cho S-1 were included to load on their respective controlled S-1 W and autonomous S-1 W constructs. Importantly, all the uniquenesses of like indicators, e.g., int S-1 and int S , are allowed to correlate to account for the dependencies of the observations within each student (see Supplementary Materials). Only the concurrent time-point constructs are included at the between-level.</p><p>In order to investigate how stable students' autonomous motivation is from one lesson in a particular school-subject to the next, Model 5 included the lagged construct of autonomous motivation at time S-1 at the within level, as a predictor of autonomous motivation at time S. This is referred to as the auto-regressive path, interpreted as the rank-order stability of each student's experiences between the concurrent and previous time-point. Positive stability indicates that the level of autonomous motivation is consistently similar at each across the time-points. Negative stability indicates that a higher autonomous motivation at the previous time-point is associated with a lower autonomous motivation at the concurrent time-point. The stability of autonomous motivation was β = 0.32, p ≤ 0.001, meaning that on average a higher level of autonomous motivation at time S-1 predicted a higher level of autonomous motivation at time S. It would be possible to investigate whether stability of autonomous motivation varies across the students (i.e., whether there are individual differences in stability between time S-1 and S) by specifying a model as in 3b.</p><p>We then, in Model 6 investigated the reciprocal effects between controlled and autonomous motivation over time, both the auto-regressive (i.e., from controlled W S-1 to controlled W S , and autonomous W S-1 to autonomous W S ), and cross-lagged associations (i.e., from controlled W S-1 to autonomous W S , and from autonomous W S-1 to controlled W S ) at the within-level of the model. Controlled motivation was grand-mean centred in order to interpret the effects of the controlled and autonomous motivations in the same metric across the constructs. Both motivations were stable over time: the auto-regressive path for controlled motivation was β = 0.30, p ≤ 0.001, and autonomous motivation was β = 0.33, p ≤ 0.001. A higher level of autonomous motivation predicted a higher level of subsequent controlled motivation β = 0.10.</p><p>Controlled and autonomous motivation were positively associated at the previous time-point ρ = 0.26, and the disturbance terms were associated at the concurrent time-point ρ = 0.18 (i.e., the association between controlled and autonomous motivation, controlling for the previous time-points).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model summary and interpretations</head><p>To sum up the modelling, we first found that the hypothesized factor structure fitted the manifest items, also across the two levels of measurement, providing a solid base for interpreting situation-specific and individual differences in autonomous and controlled motivation. Applying an "individuals as their own controls" perspective on the modelling showed that students' experiences of controlled motivation were unrelated to their autonomous motivation. Then we found that some students were inspired by an elevated level of controlled motivation, and other were put off. It turned out that relatively lower-achievers were more inspired and relatively higher-achievers were somewhat put off. Applying a "lagged variable-perspective" showed that both autonomous and controlled motivation were quite stable from one subject-specific lesson to another. If a student experienced a higher level of autonomous motivation in the previous lesson, they experienced more controlled motivation in the concurrent lesson.</p><p>The findings thus provide much support for teachers' perceptions that a teacher's "one size fits all" instruction for a task, can switch one student on, but deter another. A teaching strategy at the group-level, might not fit particular students in particular situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and conclusions</head><p>The aim of this tutorial was to provide an overview of ISEMs for educational researchers interested in the analysis of process data collected in educational contexts, using ambulatory techniques. Followed theoretical proposals by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schmitz (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hamaker (2012)</ref>, three broad types of models were proposed for investigating the associations between process (here: autonomous motivation) and instruction (here: controlled motivation): 1) measurement models and covariate effects models; (2) models for fixed, random, and moderator effects; and (3) models for reciprocal (auto-regressive and cross-lagged) effects of chronologically ordered data. Model specifications were given in the Supplementary Materials, and interpretations of key findings were given above. The discussion below focusses on considerations for (1) design of studies, (2) operationalization of measures, and (3) models and choices of software and estimators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design of intraindividual studies</head><p>The example data used in this presentation was correlational, and the modelling design two-level: time-points nested in students, adjusting standard errors for the classroom-level. This design works quite well for student groups in primary school, which stay relatively intact from one lesson to another. However, this design might not necessarily fit secondary school students, in which students belong to multiple student-groups depending on which subject they study. We know from intraindividual studies of teachers, that their experiences vary across student groups, with different student-group characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Malmberg, Hagger &amp; Webster, 2014)</ref>. To accommodate such structures (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mainhard, Oudman, Hornstra, Bosker &amp; Goetz, 2018)</ref>, future intraindividual studies could be planned as multiple membership or cross-classified designs. Situational student-reports and teacher-reports could be nested in multiple students, multiple student-groups, and their multiple teachers. If researchers were to include both student and teacher reports, i.e., cross-assessed data, this could reduce self-report bias. For example, all students in a class could report on their interaction with the teacher each lesson, while the teacher could report on the interaction with a select number of target-students each lesson. While software for MLM enable modelling of multiple membership and cross-classified structures, these structures are not at the time of writing well-implemented in SEM software. At the time of writing xxM <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mehta, 2013)</ref> allows specification of three or more hierarchical and cross-classified levels.</p><p>Second, while our data is correlational, the technique is amendable to intervention studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bolger and Laurenceau (2013)</ref> illustrated how to apply MLMs for experimental intraindividual data, by including experimental condition as a predictor of onset levels of an outcome variable (i.e., a point in time at which researchers expect no differences between groups), and differences in slopes (i.e., if the experimental group changes more in the expected direction than the control group), analogous to model 2 above (i.e., experimental condition would be a between-level predictor). The next generation intraindividual within-person designs for educational research could follow recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schmiedek and Neubauer (2019)</ref>. In their "nudge" design, random allocation of encouragement could be given to individuals (e.g., "go on", "you're getting there", "don't give up"), so that effects of situation-specific encouragement on situational outcomes could be estimated. In this case, the experimental condition would be a within-level predictor.</p><p>Regardless of whether the study is correlational or experimental, the number of time-points, students, teachers, and classes need to be balanced so that substantive research questions can be answered. In the current example, no classroom-level effects were possible to estimate. Finding the optimal balance of structural elements of schooling is important. While some studies, like the current one, focussed on the complete coverage of all school subjects during a calendar week, other studies have focussed on a particular school subject, for example all science lessons over six weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Patall, Hooper, Vasquez, Pituch &amp; Steingut, 2018)</ref>. Finding the optimal number of self-reports that are feasible to collect also merits consideration. For example, if we collect data up to three times per lesson (e.g., beginning, middle, and end), or task (beginning, 5 minutes in, 10 minutes in, end) we can get closer to the processes we are studying. We can also capitalize on the rapidly advancing technology and smart-wear.</p><p>Event-driven data-collection can be facilitated by e.g., being prompted to complete a brief survey every time we sit down in front of our computer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How many items, situations, and persons are needed?</head><p>How many items do we need for capturing intraindividual constructs? Arguments are made for and against single item indicators, and multiple item indicators. Fewer items are faster to respond to and might reduce response fatigue. More items take longer to complete and might prompt greater reflection time, more recall bias, and elevate response fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goetz, Frenzel, Stoeger &amp; Hall, 2010)</ref>. Single-item measures typically correlate highly with corresponding multiple-item constructs. Multiple item-constructs can also be highly intercorrelated <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Vasalampi et al., 2016)</ref>. Finding the optimal balance between the number of items required and participants' response fatigue is an important issue to resolve for future simulation studies with implications for real-world data-collection.</p><p>How many observations do we need? Although some rules of thumb for multilevel models are around, e.g., at least 10 time-points of at least 30 persons, a recent simulation study <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schultzberg &amp; Muthén, 2018)</ref> suggests that models with more persons and fewer time-points are generally more robust than models with fewer persons and more time-points. The number of time-points and persons required increases with the number of parameters researchers want to specify, e.g., random effects requiring more participants than fixed effects specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Software and estimators for intraindividual studies</head><p>The models presented here would be possible to extend in multiple directions.</p><p>While the number of time-points in an intraindividual study is typically larger than that of a growth-curve model, an alternative could be to apply differential equation SEM. In this specification, it is possible to estimate departures from a baseline and seeing how fast individuals can return to this baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deboeck, 2013)</ref>, and whether there are individual differences in the time required for returning to baseline. For example, how fast can a student return to his or her average level of autonomous motivation after a tough challenge which has lowered this motivation?</p><p>Another possible extension is the mixture model, a technique used for extracting profiles across variables, typically at the individual level, e.g., "high motivation profile" vs. " low motivation profile". Two-level mixture models have started to emerge in the context of students nested in schools, in which clustering has been carried out at both levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collie, Martin, Papworth &amp; Ginns, 2016)</ref>. Also a profile study at the situation-level has been carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Neubauer, Dirk &amp; Schmiedek, 2019)</ref>. Applying this method to time-points within persons, enable researchers to create profiles of situations (i.e., at the within-level), and compare student profiles (i.e., at the between-level) based on proportions of situation-specific profiles.</p><p>Thirdly, there is a rapid expansion of available freeware for modeling MSEM, such as lavaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>, xxM <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Mehta, 2013)</ref>, and OpenMx <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Neale et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Commercial software like Mplus (B. <ref type="bibr">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">-2017</ref>) can be used interactively through MplusAutomation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hallquist &amp; Wiley, 2018)</ref>. Software with Bayesian estimation exist such as blavaan, stan and brms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bürkner, 2017)</ref>, which use the R-interface to communicate with C++. Space does not allow for elaborating on Bayesian models, but many introductions are available, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Van de Schoot et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kaplan &amp; Depaoli, 2012)</ref>. Importantly, Bayesian estimation can overcome overcome some of the problems researchers encounter in MSEM such as negative uniquenesses, and out-of-bound parameter estimates, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Zitzmann, Lüdtke, Robitzsch &amp; Marsh, 2016)</ref>. They also estimate random effects and parameters in cross-classified data efficienlty <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asparouhov et al., 2018)</ref>, and can provide robust parameter estimates for as few as 13 upper-level units of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hox, Van de Schoot &amp; Matthijsse, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
