<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Staff training and development is an essential programme necessary for improving staff performance. The study sought to assess staff training and development programmes and performance of teaching staff at the various departments of the University of Cape Coast. A cross-sectional survey of 193 Faculty members, selected through a simple sampling technique, was conducted to assess whether the trained faculty of UCC were performing their task up to expectation. The study revealed that although the training programmes are not perceived as fair enough, it has positively affected staff professional knowledge, intellectual planning, class attendance and assessment. The respondents also believe that there has been improvement in their instructional delivery due to the training programmes of UCC. It is therefore recommended for management of the University to provide equal opportunity for staff in terms of training through a quota system. The study further recommends for wide communication of the modalities for selection of faculty for further studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The human resource in every organisation are the assets on which competitive advantage is built, in that, skills and competencies of staff are unlikely to be imitated by competitor organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Desimone &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harris, 1998 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Harbison, 1973)</ref>. In economic terms, the performance of an organization can be expressed in terms of the effectiveness and utilisation of human energies, skills and knowledge for increased output. <ref type="bibr">Schultz,1961</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Davenport, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">, and Adu,1969)</ref> argued, that the knowledge, skills and competencies which staff bring to their jobs as a result of their education and training should be regarded as a form of capital which is capable of providing returns and therefore requires further investment to develop in order to achieve increased performance. Consequently, there is the need for effective and continuous formulation and implementation of Human Resource Development (HRD) policies.</p><p>The effectiveness and success of training depends on staff training and development policies of the organisation, effective assessment of staff and organisational training needs, positive learning and training environment, active support of top management, and the relevance of the content of the training to the business strategic needs of the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armstrong, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Noe 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Senge 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Desimone &amp; Harris, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the tremendous contribution universities have to make to national development. Developing the human resource (HR) therefore, can no longer be peripheral to a university's success and must be a priority of university management. HRD policies are intended to help improve the knowledge, skills and competencies of staff to perform their duties effectively and hereby increasing their overall performance. The positive impact of training and development interventions on staff professional competencies will make them satisfied with their job and further lead to enhanced performance.</p><p>The above view has been confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cole, (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stoner (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Griffin (1999)</ref> who define training as the process of equipping an individual or an employee to gain competences in their present or future work through the acquisition and development of appropriate skills, knowledge and attitudes to contribute to efficiency and productivity.</p><p>Giving the indispensability of staff training and development as a major force in the economic success of any institution, universities cannot afford but to develop the requisite manpower to support both the productive and service industries. Universities are required to produce strategic managers and leaders to support strategic decision making at all levels of the economy. The achievement of these feats requires that universities recruit and develop the capacity of high calibre staff that will facilitate the pursuit of the goals of the universities which are teaching, research and community service.</p><p>The University of Cape Coast was established in 1962 as a University College. On October 1, 1971, the College attained the status of a full and independent University, with the authority to confer its own degrees, diplomas and certificates by an Act of Parliament -The University of Cape Coast <ref type="bibr">Act, 1971 [Act 390</ref>] and subsequently the University of Cape Coast <ref type="bibr">Law, 1992 [PNDC Law 278]</ref>. As a dynamic public tertiary institution of excellence, it has incorporated training and development of its staff in its strategic objectives of recruiting and retaining high calibre teaching and administrative staff with the view to build capacity for teaching departments for effective teaching and research to meet the challenge of increasing student numbers <ref type="bibr">(DHR, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, staff training and development was given prominence in the late 1990s. The Training and Development Section was therefore established in 1997 and charged with the responsibility to plan, coordinate and implement staff training and development policies and programmes of the University. In this regard, the section started implementing a broad-based policy. This policy aims at providing advice, opportunities and facilities to enable employees train in the critical areas of specialties and needs. In 2010/2011, the University spent an amount of GH¢200,000.00 and GH¢450,000.00 on staff training and Faculty development respectively. In 2011/2012, GH¢400,000.00 and GH¢700,000.00 were also spent on staff training and Faculty development respectively (University of Cape Coast <ref type="bibr">Annual budget, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">and 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">and DHR report, 2012)</ref>. Through these interventions, the University has been able to develop a number of staff in and outside Ghana. However, these staff training and development interventions and teaching performance at the departments have not been assessed over the years.</p><p>The present study will, therefore, assess whether staff training and development interventions are improving the job satisfaction of teaching staff as well as their performance of teaching at the various departments of the University of Cape Coast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>Behavioural theories have been used to explain human behaviour phenomenon that often involve needs and the quest to satisfy those needs. Fundamentally, training and development have often been necessitated by needs, so that the fundamental idea of training is rooted in the needs theory. This implies that training is based on needs to improve upon current performance. So that it is expected that once training is completed there would be transfer of what is learnt onto the job. This is also the view in the expectancy theory. Vroom's original presentation of expectancy theory placed it in the mainstream of contemporary motivation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Moorhead &amp; Griffin, 1992)</ref>. In the view of <ref type="bibr">Vroom (1964, p. 17)</ref>, expectancy is about a momentary belief concerning the likelihood that a particular act will precede a particular outcome. His formulation suggested that job performance is the result of the interaction of two components, force and ability, with ability representing the potential for performing some task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schultz (1961)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Becker (1964), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kiker (1966)</ref> define human resource as the aggregation of investments in activities, such as education, health, on-the-job training and migration that enhance an individual's productivity in the labour market or job performance. Human resource is about the knowledge, skills and experiences acquired by the individual, which is put into productive activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sharma, 2007</ref> referred to these human potentials as Human capital because they are translated into real value and productive activities.</p><p>HRD is a series of organised activities conducted within a specific time and designed to produce behavioural change or change performance. HRD basically consist of three components -training, development and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nadler, 1970)</ref>. Training has been defined as the process of equipping an individual or an employee to gain competences in their present or future work through the acquisition and development of appropriate skills, knowledge and attitudes to contribute to efficiency and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cole, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Stoner, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">and Griffin, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cole (2005)</ref>, attempts to draw a line between training and development. He defines training as preparation for an occupation or for specific skills which is job oriented and narrower in conception than education or development which covers broader view of knowledge and skills acquisition geared toward improving employee potential in general.</p><p>From the above definitions, training can be said to be job specific while development seeks to enhance the employee potential for present and future performance. Training should be on-going since job demands are dynamic with respect to information and technological revolution. It helps staff to acquire and apply knowledge, skills and competencies for the achievement of individual tasks and/or objectives of the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Desimone &amp; Harris, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Khanka, 2007)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models for training</head><p>There are different approaches to training. However to ensure that training is organised in a more systematic and formal manner, organisations often develops a training guide that facilitate its training activities. The following are some of the processes involved in conducting an effective training:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Training policy</head><p>First there should be a training policy. To understand what a training policy is, it is necessary to examine what various experts on policy-making have defined as policy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dror (1968)</ref> defines policy as "major guidelines for action directed at the future and aimed at achieving what is in the public interest". On his part, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson (1975)</ref> defines policy as "purposive course of action followed by an actor or set of actors in dealing with a problem of concern". <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hannagan (2002)</ref> sums up the above in his definition of policy as a set of decisions of courses of action deliberately taken by an organisation or government concerning the methods of accomplishing some purpose or goal within a specified situation.</p><p>It is clear from the above that policies must not be mere declaration of intent. Every policy must involve the making of decision, which must be implemented for the purpose of achieving set goals within a particular period of time. In the course of implementation, specific guidelines that must be supported by routine supervision to back the operational directives are given. Whatever the operational directives, decisions taken must fit into the major guidelines. An action plan detailing the programme of implementation is a necessary condition for the success of policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anku, 2010)</ref> In the Training Policy Statement, emphasis is laid on the design and preparation of a training plan, which is based on training needs assessment and availability of financial and other resources. Therefore, it is important to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the existing training strategies and to ascertain the training on teaching performance. The need for a systematic and planned policy for staff development is, in all circumstances, vital <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adu, 1969)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Training goals and objectives</head><p>Second, no training can be effective if there are no clear and specific, measurable and realistic goals and objectives set. Training goals describe the direction of the long-term perspective while training objectives, reflects specific measurable desired result. Training objectives should focus on the specific skills and competences participants should gain by the end of the training programme <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kapur, 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Armstrong (2006)</ref> explains further that the fundamental objective of training is to help the organization achieve its purpose by adding value to its human capital.</p><p>One of the cardinals of the objective of the staff training and development policy of the University of Cape Coast therefore is to equip staff with competencies to improve their own performance as well as the performance of the University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing needs for training and HRD</head><p>Another important activity is the needs assessment. The concept of need, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Desimone and Harris (1998)</ref>, typically refers to a discrepancy between what an organisation expects and what actually occurs. A 'need' therefore can be described as a gap between current performance and desired or expected performance. Training needs assessment is a tool utilised to identify what educational causes or activities should be provided to employees to improve their work productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rae, 2003 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Noe, 1999)</ref>. Need assessment involves organisational analysis, person analysis, and task analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining appropriate training method and programmes</head><p>Once training needs have been identified and objectives set, it is expedient that the trainer selects the appropriate training method to satisfy the need which can achieve the set objectives. In general, training methods can be grouped into two categories: On-the-job methods, which typically occur in the employee's normal working setting; and off-the-job or classroom methods, which typically take place away from the job <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Desimone &amp; Harris, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>On-the-job-training occurs when workers pick up skills whilst working alongside experienced workers at their place of work <ref type="bibr">(Emefah, 2007)</ref>. On-the-job training may take different forms, which include coaching, mentoring and job rotation. Coaching has been defined as support requested by or offered to professional learners who own the responsibility for their learning development <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Megginson, Banfield, &amp; Joy-Matthews, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Harris (2000)</ref> has also defined coaching as "an informal unplanned training and development activities provided by supervisors and peers" (pp. 351-352). While coaching may provide valuable help for employees, it should be viewed strictly as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for formal training and development programmes. Coaching is an intervention delivered by an external professional coach and it is skills or competency focused.</p><p>Mentoring is a learning situation which is broader than that involved in coaching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Megginson and Clutterbuck (2005)</ref> posit that "offline help by one person (normally a senior person) to another in making significant transmission in knowledge, work or thinking" (p. 13).</p><p>Mentoring is concerned with passing on knowledge, insight and attitudes as well as skills. Mentors, it should be pointed out here, are not necessarily the line managers but other senior managers in the organisation. This enables mentoring to proceed in a relatively friendly fashion without the stress of accountability being present. The mentor as an experienced professional opens the pathway to the new professional to become established.</p><p>Job Rotation is a formal planned programme that involves assigning trainees to various jobs in different parts of the organisation. The purpose of job rotation is to provide trainees with a larger organisational perspective and a greater understanding of different functional areas, as well as a better sense of their own career objectives and interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Harris, 2000)</ref>. Job rotation helps to improve participants' job skills, increase job satisfaction, and provide valuable opportunities for networking within the organisation.</p><p>Off-the-job training occurs when workers are taken away from their place of work to be trained. This may normally take place at a training agency or local colleges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pettinger (2002)</ref> opines that there is a great range and variety of methods available and each brings its own opportunities, advantages and consequences. Training can take the form of lectures or self-study and can be used to develop more general skills and knowledge that can be used in a variety of situations, like management skills programme. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Off</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of training and development programmes</head><p>Given the importance of training programmes, one might expect that HRD programmes are regularly and carefully evaluated. However, this is not the case. Many articles have been written about the importance of conducting evaluations, but more organisations pay lip service to evaluations than actually conducting them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gilley, Eggland and Gilley (1992)</ref> intimated that successful training programmes must meet specific learning objectives, measure the effectiveness of learning specialist and the competencies of programme design, determine the impact that learning had on a person and whether or not a change in behaviour occurred. This purpose leads to the question whether the training programme enabled the learner to develop adequate knowledge, skills and attitudes in order to close the gap between 'actual' and 'expected'. There are several possibilities why evaluation is not done more frequently, because it requires time, resources, procedures and expertise, thus making it difficult to indulge in.</p><p>HRD professionals should recognise the importance of evaluating HRD programmes and the variety of ways in which evaluation can be conducted taking into consideration the nature and extent of the programme <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Desimone &amp; Harris, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Al-Athari and Zairi (2002)</ref> examined the evaluation of training interventions in five United Kingdom organisations (recognised as best practice organisations in their T&amp;D activities) and 77 Kuwaiti organisations (40 from the government sector and 37 from the private sector). The study revealed that the majority of respondents, both in the government and private sectors alike contended that evaluation of training interventions were done occasionally and the most popular evaluation technique used by both government and private sector organisations were questionnaires.</p><p>The paper looks at staff training and development interventions and teaching performance. It is assumed that given the same qualification and working environment, and resources, and support, it is expected that additional improvement in teacher competences should lead to improved satisfaction with his/her job and eventually affects the performance in general. Performance indicators are used to indicate in observable behaviours, the types and quality of performance associated with performance standards. Thus performance indicator is a tangible behaviour that can be observed or documented to determine the degree to which the standards are met <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Stronge, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Stronge identified the teacher and how s(he) engages and maintains students in active learning; builds upon students' existing knowledge and skills, differentiates instruction to meet students' needs, reinforces learning goals consistently throughout the lesson as well as uses a variety of effective instructional strategies and resources as some performance indicators. In addition the teacher should be able to use instructional technology to enhance student learning and communicates and presents material clearly, and checks for understanding. These are at the periphery of teacher performance. This teacher effectiveness performance evaluation system has been applied by several students groups and associations including evaluating teacher performance in New Jersey, USA.</p><p>Apart from Stronge's indicators, the framework for teaching evaluation instrument (2013 Edition) by the Dainelson Group, also identified four main areas for assessing teacher performance. First is teacher planning and preparation which involves demonstration of knowledge of content and pedagogy, demonstration of knowledge of students, setting instructional outcomes and demonstration of knowledge of teaching. Other indicators are design of coherent instruction and design of student assessments.</p><p>The next is the classroom environment. The specific activities include creation of an environment of respect and rapport, establishing a culture for learning and management of classroom procedures. The teacher should also be able to manage students' behaviour and organise physical space.</p><p>The third major performance evaluation activity centres on instructional delivery. This involves communication with students, using questioning and discussion techniques. The other indicators are how to engage students in learning, use assessment in instruction and demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness.</p><p>Lastly the assessment of the teacher performance also looks at professional responsibilities including reflecting on teaching, maintaining accurate records and communicating with families. Other issues include participating in the professional community, growing and developing professionally as well as showing professionalism.</p><p>The Virginia Department of Education, in their guideline for uniform performance standards and evaluation of teachers (July, 2012) has also employed six main areas which are professional knowledge, instructional planning, instructional delivery, learning environment, professionalism and student academic progress for assessing teacher performance.</p><p>The University of Cape Coast Directorate of Academic Planning and Quality Assurance uses the following performance standard criteria to assess the performance of teaching staff in the University. These are knowledge of course content, attendance to lectures, mode of delivery and assessment with a rating of 1.00 (Poor) to 4.00 (Excellent).</p><p>The foregoing assessment criteria can be summarised into five main areas as professional knowledge, instructional planning, instructional delivery, teacher attendance and student academic progress/assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Framework</head><p>Following from the above discussions and other empirical perspectives, a conceptual framework was designed to guide the study. The framework was guided by the Stronge (2012) who proposed seven teacher performance standards. These include professional knowledge, instructional planning, instructional delivery, assessment of/for learning, leaning environment, professionalism and student progress. Each of the above has its performance indicators. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Professional Knowledge</head><p>The teacher demonstrates an understanding of the curriculum, subject content, and the developmental needs of students by providing relevant learning experiences. The teacher maintains a commitment to professional ethics, communicates effectively, and takes responsibility for, and participates in, professional growth that results in enhanced students learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructional Planning</head><p>The teacher plans using the school's curriculum, effective strategies, resources, and to meet the needs of all students. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructional Delivery</head><p>The teacher effectively engages students in learning by using a variety of instructional strategies in order to meet individual learning needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of/for Learning</head><p>The teacher systematically gathers, analyzes, and uses all relevant data to measure student academic progress, guide instructional content and delivery methods, and provide timely feedback to both students and parents throughout the school year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Teacher Attendance</head><p>The teacher maintains a commitment to professional ethics, attends lectures as scheduled, and actively engages students throughout the lesson period to enhance students learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfaction</head><p>It is assumed that given the same qualification and working environment, and resources, and support, it is expected that additional improvement in teacher knowledge, skills and competencies should lead to improved satisfaction with his/her job and eventually affects the performance in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>The performance indicators are used to indicate in observable behaviours, the types and quality of performance associated with performance standards. Thus performance indicator is a tangible behaviour that can be observed or documented to determine the degree to which the standard is met. These are knowledge of course content, attendance to lectures, mode of delivery and assessment with a rating of 1.00 (Poor) to 4.00 (Excellent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>To assess the effects of staff training and development policies of UCC on teaching performance, the views of 180 academic staff of the University of Cape Coast were collated through a questionnaire survey. This represents an 87.8 percent response rate from 205 questionnaires distributed to lecturers selected using a simple random sampling technique. These teaching staff have met all the stringent employment criteria mandated by the National Accreditation Board of the country. They therefore have an in-depth appreciation of research methods and the reasons for staff training and development programmes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The items on the questionnaire used for the study were based on literature and past studies.</p><p>The study used reflective questions to measure the constructs. Respondents were made to rate their level of agreement with all questions on a four point scale where one (1) was strongly disagree and four (4) was strongly agree.</p><p>Reliability results of the questionnaire items used for discussions have been presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Structural Equation Modeling Procedure</head><p>This study used the Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) tool to test the inter-relationships among the variables under study. Application of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) as compared to regression-based approaches, which only analyze one layer of linkages between independent and dependent variables at the same time, SEM allows the simultaneous modeling of relationships among multiple independent and dependent constructs <ref type="bibr">(Gefen, Straub, &amp; Boudreau, 2000)</ref>. PLS also involves no assumptions about the population or scale of measurement <ref type="bibr">(Fornell &amp; Bookstein, 1982)</ref>. It can be run using nominal, ordinal or interval scales. Similarly, PLS is quite robust with regard to inadequacies like skewness, multicollinearity of indicators and misspecification of the structural model <ref type="bibr">(Cassel et al, 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct Validity</head><p>The PLS estimation allows to easily test the convergent validity, discriminant validity and internal consistency of the items. Convergent validity was confirmed by examining the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) value and the factors loadings of each item. For discriminant validity, the square root of AVE of each construct was computed and compared with the correlation between constructs.</p><p>The AVE includes the variance of its indicators captured by the construct relative to the total amount of variance, including the variance due to measurement error <ref type="bibr">(Bagozzi, Yi, &amp; Phillips, 1991)</ref>. The AVE should exceed a value of .5 to highlight a construct convergent validity <ref type="bibr">(Fornell &amp; Larcker 1981)</ref>. The results of PLS indicate that all AVE values passed the suggested value of 0.5 <ref type="bibr">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gefen et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wixom &amp; Watson, 2001)</ref>, ranged from 0.4543 to 0.9796 (see Table ). Similarly, the factors loadings of the all items were significant and higher than the suggested value of 0.5 <ref type="bibr">(Nuunally, 1978)</ref>. It ranged from 0.6296 to 0.989. All square roots of the AVE were larger than the correlation coefficient between constructs, indicating that each construct was closely related to its corresponding measurement items. This supports the discriminant validity of the measures. This is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of Results</head><p>Assessment, attendance and instructional planning have positive and significant impact on the satisfaction of teaching staff where as delivery and conduct knowledge has a negative impact. This could be explained by the fact that the more the training policy intervention positively influence or improve the professional knowledge of staff it leads to their dissatisfaction. Teachers are able to judge better the delivery or weakness of facilitators. Again with improved delivery staff expects the facilitators to measure up to standard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy Recommendation</head><p>The training policy direction must therefore be graduated or enhanced. The selection of facilitators for training programmes should critically look at. Facilitators should be ones who are more knowledgeable in content and delivery to motivate participants.</p><p>The results have confirmed that satisfaction actually leads to performance. This is shown by an r 2 of 48.2% of which is significant on performance. This implies that when staff is satisfied with the training policy in tremendous in place by the University, they will be satisfied with the job and will eventual lead to improved performance. The structural equation reveals that the direct impacts are higher than the indirect ones. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. A training policy sets out in writing the purpose, scope, and composition of a training program. It is useful to have a document that describes the training program from several perspectives, and made accessible to both management and employees. The University of Cape Coast derives its training requirements from the Act establishing the University (Act 278) 1992, The Unified Condition of Service for Junior and Senior staff and the Scheme of Service for Senior Members.
