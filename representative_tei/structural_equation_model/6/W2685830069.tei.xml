<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Authentic leadership is an emerging construct which has attracted scholars and practitioners alike due to the felt need of ethical climate in organizations among rising corporate scandals. Though considerable attempts have been made to further refine the construct by undertaking validation studies in different cultures, no study has reported validation of authentic leadership questionnaire in the Pakistani context. This study offers new contributions towards the validation of the authentic leadership questionnaire from Pakistani context and reports the results of confirmatory factor analysis, reliability, and construct validity by analyzing responses from three independent nationally representative samples (n=580). Such need has been felt by many authors to provide the evidence of validity in other cultures like Asia. Using structural equation modeling through AMOS, this study concludes that the authentic leadership questionnaire is a valid and reliable construct in the Pakistani culture too. The model fit indices indicate that the second order model of authentic leadership is more robust and preferable than the first order model and the composite factor. Positive impact of authentic leadership on championing and partial mediation of management support and affective commitment to change between authentic leadership and championing indicate predictive validity of authentic leadership questionnaire. Implications, limitations, and future recommendations are discussed.</p></div>

In recent times when more focus is being put on the integrity and transparency of leaders amongst ethical climate of organizations due to rise in the corporate scandals like that of Enron in USA and Axact in Pakistan <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andreoli &amp; Lefkowitz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Treviño, Nieuwenboer, &amp; Kish-Gephart, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Popularity of the authentic leadership theory among scholars is evident from the rising number of theoretical and empirical studies in the past decade and the emergence of different scales to tap the authentic leadership behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Neider &amp; Schriesheim, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Walumbwa, Avolio, Gardner, Wernsing, &amp; Peterson, 2008)</ref>. For every emerging construct, it is necessary that it should be investigated in different cultures so that its generalizability across many cultures may be established. Though considerable attempts have been made to further refine the construct by undertaking validation studies in different cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, &amp; Walumbwa, 2005)</ref>, very rare attempts have been made to test this important construct in Pakistani culture (e.g. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adil &amp; Kamal, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Zubair &amp; Kamal, 2015)</ref> but no study has reported psychometric properties for validation of the authentic leadership questionnaire in Pakistani context.</p><p>This study offers new contributions towards the validation of the authentic leadership questionnaire from Pakistani context and reports results of confirmatory factor analysis, reliability, and validity by analyzing responses from three independent samples. Such need has been felt by many authors to provide the evidence of validity in other cultures like Asia (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Banks, McCauley, Gardner, &amp; Guler, 2016, p. 13)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Roof (2014)</ref> who reviewed 138 papers including the samples from Canada, USA, Germany, Norway China, Taiwan, Iran and Belgium to consolidate psychometric properties of the authentic leadership questionnaire, but could not find any study from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Author argues that although the results regarding the validation of authentic leadership questionnaire are so far encouraging yet as the questionnaire is at its early stage and validation of new constructs is an ongoing process, therefore, there is need to undertake more studies to know whether the authentic leadership questionnaire is valid construct across different cultures (p.7). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Avolio and Walumbwa (2014)</ref> also argue that major work on authentic leadership has taken place in the Western cultures therefore, answer to the question of relevance of the authentic leadership to other cultures across the world needs further exploration (p.351). <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Luthans and Avolio (2003)</ref> defined authentic leadership as a "process that draws from both positive psychological capacities and a highly developed organizational context, which results in both greater self-awareness and self-regulated positive behaviours on the part of leaders and associates, fostering positive self-development". The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Luthans and Avolio (2003)</ref> leads towards the development of the authentic leadership construct which has been so far tested in variety of contexts and has also been criticized for different reasons such as its redundancy with other leadership constructs like transformational leadership <ref type="bibr">(Avolio, Walumbwa, &amp; Weber, 2009, p. 424;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Banks et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gardner et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Walumbwa et al. (2008)</ref> has provided detailed definition of authentic leadership as the behaviour of the leaders which emanates from positive organizational behaviour with major focus on ethical climate. Authors described that authentic leadership comprises four inter-related factors, these are, self-awareness, relational transparency, balanced processing and internalized moral perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bakari, Hunjra, &amp; Niazi, 2017)</ref> 2.1.1 Self-Awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lagan (2007)</ref> described self-awareness as the ability of a person to be aware of and accept his / her own "motives, feelings, desires, and self-relevant cognitions". In the views of <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Walumbwa et al. (2008)</ref> authentic leaders are aware about their own strengths and weaknesses. They not only know themselves accurately but they are aware about the context in which they are working and how this context adds meaning to their behaviour. They also know about the perception of others about them, their level of awareness of self, morality, and values <ref type="bibr">(Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthans, &amp; May, 2004, p. 4</ref>). Authentic leadership is 'being yourself' and understanding the passions and motivations <ref type="bibr">(George, 2003, p. 11)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Relational transparency</head><p>Relational transparency refers how transparently and truly the leaders communicate with others; it is the exposure of one's own real and genuine self in contrast to inaccurate, biased and fake self <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gardner et al., 2011)</ref>. By demonstrating their true self, leaders can easily gain the trust of their followers and enhance their commitment to the organization and leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gardner et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kernis, 2003)</ref>. Relationally transparent leaders do not hide anything rather they say exactly what they mean to say, realize their mistakes if committed, invite others' comments and criticism on their own decisions, actions and personality, propagate truth and possess harmony in their emotions and feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bakari et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gardner et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Balanced processing</head><p>Balanced processing, as the name suggests, is concerned with the leaders' behaviour characterized by their ability to process the true and relevant information objectively before inferring any conclusion during decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Walumbwa et al., 2008, p. 95)</ref>. This is related to transparent decision making based on objective analysis of data, incorporating views from all relevant quarters, inviting and welcoming opposite thoughts that may challenge their long rooted beliefs, being impartial while processing information and avoiding exaggeration and distortion of facts <ref type="bibr">(Gardner et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kernis, 2003)</ref>. Balanced processing results in the integrity of decision-making, followers' sense of supportiveness of their leaders, and followers' psychological capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gardner et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ilies, Morgeson, &amp; Nahrgang, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Internalized moral perspective</head><p>To be aware of one's own personal and core values, and ability to foster these values in followers is called internalized moral perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Luthans &amp; Avolio, 2003)</ref>. It is a kind of self-regulation in which behavior is adjusted to carry out equitable and fair decision making based on the high standard of ethical conduct. These decisions reflect not only values that are propagated by leader's practices and proposed by leaders but core values of organizations, groups, and society as a whole <ref type="bibr">(Avolio &amp; Gardner, 2005)</ref>. Authentic leaders through internalized moral perspective identify and analyze core ethical issues and feel responsibility to deal with issues following well-established ethical manner. It is the lens through which authentic leaders recognize ethical dilemmas, evaluate options, and take necessary action authentically <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(May, Chan, Hodges, &amp; Avolio, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical literature reveals that authentic leadership is related to different outcomes such as job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Laschinger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Onorato &amp; Zhu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Penger &amp; Černe, 2014)</ref>, structural empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Read &amp; Laschinger, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wong &amp; Laschinger, 2013)</ref>, psychological empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Tsemach, 2014)</ref>, personal identification and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fox, Gong, &amp; Attoh, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wong, Spence Laschinger, &amp; Cummings, 2010)</ref>, organizational identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(García-Guiu, Molero, &amp; Moriano, 2015)</ref>, psychological capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amunkete &amp; Rothmann, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Woolley, Caza, &amp; Levy, 2010)</ref>, intention to leave <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Laschinger &amp; Fida, 2014)</ref>, workplace bullying (Warszewska-Makuch, Bedyńska, &amp; Żołnierczyk-Zreda, 2015), organizational justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(García-Guiu et al., 2015)</ref>, work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Giallonardo, Wong, &amp; Iwasiw, 2010)</ref>, work climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Nelson et al., 2014)</ref>, psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Nelson et al., 2014)</ref>, creativity and innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Müceldili, Turan, &amp; Erdil, 2013)</ref>, management support for innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cerne, Jaklic, &amp; Skerlavaj, 2013)</ref>, cynicism <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Laschinger &amp; Fida, 2014)</ref>, voice behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hsiung, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wong et al., 2010)</ref>, commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Darvish &amp; Rezaei, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gatling, Kang, &amp; Kim, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rego, Lopes, &amp; Nascimento, 2016)</ref>, behavioural integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Leroy, Palanski, &amp; Simons, 2012)</ref>, Performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Leroy, Anseel, Gardner, &amp; Sels, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Leroy et al., 2012)</ref>, extra effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jacques, Garger, Lee, &amp; Ko, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Peus, Wesche, Streicher, Braun, &amp; Frey, 2012)</ref>, inter-professional collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Regan, Laschinger, &amp; Wong, 2016)</ref>, Self-Effi-cacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rego et al., 2016)</ref>, citizenship behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cottrill, Denise Lopez, &amp; Hoffman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Shapira-Lishchinsky &amp; Tsemach, 2014)</ref> to name the few. Despite popularity of authentic leadership in positive organizational theory, no study has been found that have investigated role of authentic leadership in the context of organizational change, such need has been felt by authors like <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Williams, Pillai, Deptula, and Lowe (2012)</ref>, this study also fills this gap too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Authentic Leadership, Management Support for and Affective Commitment to Change, and Championing</head><p>To provide the evidence of predictive validity of AL, some hypotheses are formulated and tested using the data of employees of Pakistan Railways. We begin with the description of empirical literature on the relationship among authentic leadership, management support for change, affective commitment to change, and behavioural support for change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Role of authentic leadership in employees' support for change</head><p>Leaders are thought to be primarily responsible for the success and failure of any planned change initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Battilana, Gilmartin, Sengul, Pache, &amp; Alexander, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hina Jawaid, Berntson, Baraldi, Näswall, &amp; Sverke, 2010)</ref>. Leaders set the stage for the successful internalization of the change program at the hands of employees by providing them meaningful support, sharing information, participating in decision making, and above all setting a personal example as being true, transparent, and credible leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bouckenooghe, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burnes &amp; By, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Carmeli, Schaubroeck, &amp; Tishler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lines, Sullivan, &amp; Wiezel, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Herscovitch and Meyer (2002)</ref> defined championing as an employees' behaviour of supporting the change beyond what is expected from them. Employees not only themselves put extra effort for the success of change program but they involve others to embrace the change. Although no study has been found that may have instigated authentic leadership in the context of the change, this study endeavors to provide relevance of authentic leadership in change management. Empirical literature suggests that authentic leadership has been found positively related to employees' extra effort surrogate to championing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jacques et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Peus et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Williams et al. (2012)</ref> also felt the need to test authentic leadership in employees' support for change thus, we infer following hypothesis: H1: Authentic leadership is positively related to championing behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Mediating role of management support and affective commitment to change</head><p>Theory of authentic leadership converging both leadership ethics and the theory of positive organizational behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Walumbwa et al., 2008)</ref> suggests that authentic leaders can influence employees' behaviours by fostering positive beliefs in employees such as a study found authentic leadership positively impacted employees' organizational commitment through mediation of psychological capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rego et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The authentic leadership has also been tested in the context of innovation and creativity by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cerne et al. (2013)</ref>. Analyzing multilevel dyadic model, authors found authentic leadership positively related to creativity and innovation at individual and team levels, whereas, employees' perception of management support mediated the relationship between authentic leadership and creativity. Another study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Joo, McLean, and Yang (2013)</ref> argued that authentic leaders through their transparency and support mechanism create an environment conducive to embrace the change and enhance creativity in the face of uncertainty and ambiguity. They argued that employees will likely support the change, if they think that their leaders are 'fair and supportive <ref type="bibr">' (p.406)</ref>. Authors like <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Santhidran, Chandran, and Borromeo (2013)</ref> have also suggested to check the likely mediating role of employee perceptions of change -supportive management between leadership and employee behavioural support for change in some other Asian countries. Thus, we hypothesize following: H2: Management support for change mediates the relationship between authentic leadership and championing Research suggests that commitment to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Herscovitch &amp; Meyer, 2002)</ref> especially affective commitment to change has been regarded as important predictor of behavioural support for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bouckenooghe, Schwarz, &amp; Minbashian, 2015)</ref> but how it facilitates leadership intervention in bringing support for the change is less knowm (M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Choi, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hill, Seo, Kang, and Taylor (2012)</ref> who found positive impact of trnasformational leadership on commitment to change suggested that commitment to change may mediate the relationship between leadership and chamioning behaviour of behavioural support for change (p.773).</p><p>van der Voet (2015) found positive impact of direct supervisors' transformational leadership style on affective commitment to change in public sector context of Netherland. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kiersch and Byrne (2015)</ref> found positive and significant relationship of authentic leadership to affective commitment. The relationship was mediated by employee perception of justice. Based on the suggestions of the authors, it is important to note that affective commitment to change may facilitate authentic leadership in the organizational change. Thus, we infer the following hypothesis: H3: Affective commitment to change mediates the relationship between authentic leadership and championing behaviour </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Research Setting, Sample, and procedure</head><p>Sample 1. Initially an online link of 16-item ALQ was sent to 400 faculty members of the universities of Pakistan through their official emails sought through respective Quality Enhancement Cells. At least three reminders were sent to them every two months. We received 104 responses yielding response rate of 25%. The majority of respondents were from two major agricultural universities of the Punjab province, a military university at Islamabad, a large general university at Jamshoro, Sindh and some other universities. The sample included 29 (28%) females; having mean age of 35 years and most of them were Ph.D degree holders i.e. 39 (37%).</p><p>Sample 2. The second sample comprised of the employees of three health sector organizations of Sindh province undergoing structural changes. About 260 respondents returned usable questionnaire out of 340 distributed yielding the response rate of 74%. Majority of the respondents were male 190 (73%), number of doctors, nurses and para medical staff was 51, 62 and 131 respectively. From employees' age perspective 74 employees were in the age bracket of 31 to 40 years. This sample was also highly educated having 144 (55%) graduate degree holders. Sample 3. The third sample included the responses form 216 employees of Pakistan Railways working at different levels of employment. The responses were collected from a main HQ, four divisional headquarters and various railways stations across Pakistan. The majority of respondents were male (90%) and having mean age of 38 years. 60% respondents reported their education as intermediate level. Pakistan Railways was selected as it has been under massive reforms in recent times. Various efforts have been made to improve services of Pakistan Railways. These reforms resulted slight increase in number of passengers carried <ref type="bibr">(47,690 in FY 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">-14 to 52,951 in FY 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">-15), passenger kilometers (19,778,557 in FY 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">-14 to 20,288,038 in FY 2014-15)</ref> and gross earnings in rupees <ref type="bibr">(22,800,217 in FY 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">-14 to 31,924,757 in FY 2014-15)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Pakistan-Railways, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>It must be noted that the sample 2 was a part of a major study aimed to tap the employees' perceptions during organizational change and role of authentic leadership in fostering employee support for planned change <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bakari, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bakari et al., 2017)</ref>. Part of third sample has been reported in validation study of readiness for change scale (under preparation). This study reports the results regarding the validity of the Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ) and its relationship with employee perceptions and behaviours in order to provide the evidence of reliability and validity of ALQ in Pakistani setting.</p></div>

It also explores the data set and helps researcher to find out set of factors which may possibly symbolize data <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>. Main objective of CFA is to measure the validity of measurement factors available in variables within the theoretical framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 2000)</ref>. The criteria used to investigate model fitness and other psychometric properties are summarized in table 1. In order to measure relative contribution of each item to a particular factor, the criteria of factor loadings are applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Harmann, 1976)</ref>. All factor loadings should be statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) and value of factor loadings greater than .5 is preferable. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the standardized regression weights (factor loadings) achieved through AMOS Graphics 18.0 for the authentic leadership and its 4 dimensions.</p></div>

(2008)</ref> during the development and validation process of authentic leadership questionnaire conducted CFA using AMOS to check whether the second order factor existed for the authentic leadership. Using data of 224 employees from USA, they tested three alternatives; first alternative was one factor model in which all 16 items of authentic leadership were grouped to form one grand authentic leadership factor, in second alternative all items loaded on their respective factor i.e self awareness, balanced processing, moral / ethical, and relational transparency and factors were connected to correlate with each other, third option was second-order model. In this model all items were subject to load on their respective factor / dimesnion and all factor were to laod on second order authenitc leadership factor. Using CFI, RMSEA, and chi square fit indice, they compared three models and found second order model best fitting, robust and preferable to other models. While some studies have also reported a composite score of 16 items as single factor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gardner et al., 2011)</ref>. A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Penger and Černe (2014)</ref> have also commented that conceptual similarity exists among four dimensions of authentic leadership, therefore, one single factor of authentic leadership may be used as it will explain better overlap among dimensions (p.515).</p></div>

Analysis of table 5 reveals that in sample 1, all the three options yielded the results which meet the cut-off criteria. The values of relative chi square are less than 3 for sample 1 in all three models which shows excellent fit of model to the data. The values of CFI are all greater than .90 and RMSEA is less than or equal to .08 thus sample 1 which included highly qualified respondents of higher education sector of Pakistan revealed that ALQ is highly valid construct. Whereas, in sample 2, where the responses from doctors, nurses, and para medical staff of Sindh province of Pakistan were analyzed, results revealed that second order factor model yields better results as compared to other two options, and the same is true for third sample comprised of employees of Pakistan Railways. These results are in line with previous literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Walumbwa et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Structural Model Estimation</head><p>To test the predictive power of authentic leadership, a structural model is created. Source: Developed for this study using primary data.</p><p>We report hypothesis testing through structural equation modeling using AMOS 18.0 software. For the mediation analysis, there are variety of procedures applied to test the effect of intervening variable on the relationship between predictor and outcome variable, three methods are widely used. First, causal steps approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> is frequently and most widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hayes, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In this approach authors suggest that three steps must be met before proceeding to mediation; the relationship between independent and dependent variable (1st step), independent and mediator (2nd step), mediator and dependent variable (3rd step) must be significant, only then mediation analysis can be done Second popular method is Product of Coefficients Strategy which is the extension of the causal approach. In this approach path from independent variable to mediator (a) and from mediator to dependent variable (b) are same as in causal approach. For the determination of path 'c' i.e. from independent variable to dependent variable, first, the product of beta coefficients of paths 'a' and 'b' is obtained which is then divided by the product of standard errors of 'a' and 'b'. For this, several formulas are used. Most popular is Sobel's test <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sobel, 1982)</ref>. This approach relies on the assumption of normality which is not possible in the case of small sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bollen &amp; Stine, 1992)</ref>, to overcome this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Preacher and Hayes (2004)</ref> suggested a bootstrapping technique.</p><p>Third, bootstrapping technique resamples the original sample and draws a new sample which then computes direct, indirect, and total effects. This is the highly sophisticated method and equally powerful in simple and multiple mediating models. Like the Sobel's test, bootstrapping is sometimes considered as supplement to causal steps method <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hayes, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Despite sophistication of Bootstrap method this study has applied SEM and reported hypothesis testing in simple mediation models using individual mediators with individual dependent variable, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> approach as it is widely used in the social sciences, easy to understand, simple to explain the causal paths and their effects <ref type="bibr">(Hayes, 2009, p. 411)</ref>. This method is still used widely in very recent articles being published in impact factor journals (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yoon, Jang, &amp; Lee, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Hypothesis testing results suggest that authentic leadership is positively related to championing behaviour and the relationship is partially mediated by management support and affective commitment to change. The results of this study are in line with literature as authentic leadership has been found positively contributing to employee behaviours through influencing mechanism of first creating positive beliefs and perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amunkete &amp; Rothmann, 2015)</ref>. These results suggest that authentic leaders by promoting their self as men of integrity can enhance employees' feelings that the change program is viable and supported by principal officers and it will yield benefits to employees <ref type="bibr">(Joo et al., 2013, p. 408;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Leroy et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>A recent study which analyzed responses from Pakistani public sector employees tested the relationship between commitment to change and behavioural support for change. In their results affective commitment to change was not found positively related to championing behaviour (M. S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adil, 2016)</ref>. There was need to retest affective commitment to change with championing behaviour so that relevance of affective commitment to change with Pakistani setting may be verified. In the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Herscovitch &amp; Meyer, 2002)</ref> affective commitment to change was found strong predictor of championing behaviour as compared to normative and continuous commitment to change. Results of this study support consensus of literature about the relationship between affective commitment to change and championing behaviour. Moreover, this study further strengthens the claim of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cerne et al. (2013)</ref> who found authentic leadership positively related to employee innovation and creativity, employee perception of management support for innovation mediated the relationship. Moreover, this study has answered a call for research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Joo et al. (2013)</ref> who suggested to check mediating role of employee perception of being trusted by their leaders (e.g. management support for change; p.406).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Significance of Study</head><p>Results of this study are very important as we have provided evidence of model fitness of measurement model through CFA by using three independent samples. We have also provided the evidence of construct validity, convergent validity, reliability, and predictive validity of authentic leadership construct. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies which have provided evidence of validation of authentic leadership through providing data from such diverse sources from Pakistani settings. Recent study of A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adil and Kamal (2016)</ref> tested authentic leadership in higher education sector of Punjab and Islamabad and reported positive role of authentic leadership with psychological capital. Our study extends their results by providing across the Pakistan representation of university teachers as well as representative sample of Pakistan Railways and health sector organization sample and reports the validity of ALQ alongwith hypothesis testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Limitations and Future Recommendations</head><p>Main limitation to this study is the use of cross sectional data. Though timeline of data collection in three samples is different but this study has not reported temporal difference in the data therefore there is need to investigate authentic leadership questionnaire using a longitudinal data. Another limitation may be that this study has used employees' behavioural variables as outcomes of authentic leadership. As authentic leadership is somewhat related with other ethical leadership constructs such as transformational leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Banks et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Joo &amp; Nimon, 2014)</ref>, there is need to root out correlation between authentic leadership and spiritual leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Avolio &amp; Walumbwa, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, which uncover positive relationship of authentic leadership with change related employee attitudes and behaviours, we propose that authentic leadership is highly relevant for Asian countries therefore, scholars should further investigate it to test its importance in prediction of some other important constructs such as change related OCB (J. N. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Choi, 2007)</ref>, cynicism about change <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Wanous, Reichers, &amp; Austin, 2000)</ref>, and resistance to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Oreg, 2006)</ref>. Authentic leadership has also provided important insights regarding employees' psychological processes (e.g. psychological capital; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amunkete &amp; Rothmann, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Woolley et al., 2010)</ref>, there is need to investigate the influence authentic leadership may exert on employees' dispositional factors such as dispositional resistance to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Oreg, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Although this study has incorporated responses from three different samples from Pakistan, majority of the respondents belonged to public sector organizations and service sector. Therefore, in order to develop more consensus on the validity of ALQ in the Asian context, there is a need to involve more respondents from private sector and manufacturing organizations to know difference among public and private sector employees with regard to concept of authentic leadership. This will help understand employee perception of the authentic leadership in public and private organizations. Moreover, scholars are emphasizing the need for responsible leadership in Asian context, there is need to test whether authentic leadership can correlate positively with Responsible Leadership Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fernando, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Voegtlin, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Practical Implications</head><p>This study also suggests some practical implications for the organizations, as there is widespread need of ethical and moral leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Avolio et al., 2009)</ref> the executives need to arrange training programs for middle and senior level managers to develop authentic leadership behaviours in them. As ALQ is globally valid construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gardner et al., 2011)</ref> and equally valid for Pakistan as per findings of this study, therefore, it may provide valid measurement tool to track the development of authentic leadership behaviours in managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Walumbwa et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Aim of this study was to report the reliability and validity of authentic leadership questionnaire. For this, SPSS and AMOS were used to compute Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability, construct validity and structural model. Overall results of this study support the notion that authentic leadership questionnaire may be valid and reliable measure in the organizational change context of developing countries of Asia like Pakistan. Results also suggest that in public sector organizations of Pakistan where corruption and frauds are rampant, leaders' authenticity and integrity is necessary subject of attention. It may provide great source for positive employee behaviours in the organizations which may not only contribute towards organizational effectiveness but for the welfare of society.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
