While according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Griffin (2005)</ref> consumer loyalty is a concept of loyalty that leads more to behaviour than attitude and a loyal consumer will show a purchase behavior which is defined as a regular purchaser and shown over times by some decision making units. Loyalty is important concept in marketing because loyalty is one of the factors to be able to determine the market share of a company.</p><p>Consumer loyalty is a behavioral drive to make purchases repeatedly and to build consumer loyalty to a product/service that is produced by a company that takes a long time through a repetitive purchasing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(OLSON, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Loyalty does not only mean the existence of consumer wishes to buy back the same brand in later time, but also the consumer have a psychological commitment or attitude towards the brand.

Loyalty can also refers to the preference of tourists to purchase a particular brand of a product category. This occurs because tourists feel that a brand is able to offer the product features, product image or product quality level which matches to the price. Basically, the first time tourists will experiment in the purchase of a product, after they try the product and feel satisfied, they will make it a habit and will continue to purchase the same product because they feel the product is more secure and known <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(GIDDENS, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Consumer Satisfaction</head><p>Johnson and Fornell (1991) stated that consumer satisfaction is the result of a thorough evaluation of the top performing consumer products which they consume. Yi (1991) identified two different concepts of customer satisfaction, namely transactionspecific satisfaction and overall satisfaction. Transaction-specific satisfaction is a concept that refers to the assessment of customer satisfaction after purchasing particular products or brands.</p><p>While overall satisfaction is a concept that measures the satisfaction (dissatisfaction) of tourists towards particular products or brands as a whole based on  <ref type="bibr">ijmp.jor.br v. 10, n. 5, September-October 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">ISSN: 2236-269X DOI: 10.14807/ijmp.v10i5.937</ref> the entire experience in consuming these products or brands. Thus overall satisfaction could be viewed as a function of all transaction-specific satisfaction that occurred before. In this study, the concept of customer satisfaction that used is overall customer satisfaction.

According to Hasan (2009) consumer satisfaction is a feeling of consumer in good response of products or services that has been consumed. In general satisfaction can be defined as a comparison between results received or services in consumer expectations, results received or services at least must be equal with consumer expectations, or even beyond it. <ref type="bibr">Kotler (2009)</ref> revealed that satisfaction is as feelings of like or dislike someone for a product after he/she compared a product performance with his/her expectations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Simamora (2008)</ref> argues that customer satisfaction is the result of experience in the product.

The population in this study were all tourists who visiting the Samosir Region. The sample used non probability sampling, allowing the opportunity for someone to be a respondent was not known. Sampling of tourists in this study was determined by quota sampling as many as 200 respondents either male or female. In this study, the sampling technique was accidental sampling, which was how to obtain samples based on tourists who was found when conducting the study, which was taken from the research site without distinguishing the origin of the tourists.</p><p>Data collection techniques used in this study includes interviews and questionnaires to the relevant parties. In its implementation, researchers get respondents by visiting respondents one by one, then asking their willingness to become respondents in this study, after the respondents are willing, the authors interview respondents one by one based on the prepared questionnaire.</p><p>The interview was carried out in the morning until noon when the visitors arrived. Before the questionnaire was distributed, validity and reliability tests were carried out first.. The technique of data analysis in this study is descriptive and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)</p></div>

Based on the testing of mediation variables, it is evident that the tourist satisfaction variable acts as an intervening variable for the effect of exogenous variables on the marketing mix and service quality on tourist loyalty.
