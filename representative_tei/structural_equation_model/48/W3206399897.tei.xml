<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A lot remains unexplored regarding the antecedents and outcomes of telemedicine acceptance from health service marketing perspective. This study addresses this gap by integrating the Health Belief Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model in the context of generation Y and Z's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collected from 293 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results confirm theoretical rigor of integrating two models examining the antecedents and user satisfaction as an outcome of telemedicine acceptance. The findings also suggest marketing strategies for implementing telemedicine during pandemic. Future research directions are highlighted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The recent proliferation of chronic diseases and consumer consciousness of their health safety is accelerating the rise of retail healthcare industry. Hence, the mark between retail and healthcare is fading <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Smith &amp; Bernene, 2014)</ref>. Retail health clinics, otherwise known as convenient care clinics, is gaining much acceptance as it can provide fast, cheap, and convenient health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hunter, Weber, Morreale, &amp; Wall, 2009)</ref>. As part of its innovation and expansion, telemedicine represents a major technology-driven health service, which is supplementing traditional and retail channel of healthcare delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gaur, Sobhani, &amp; Saxon, 2019)</ref>. The outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated the need for telemedicine as a safe and fast way to receiving health service from remote location by maintaining social distance and staying at home. Telemedicine is "the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve patients' health status" (American Telemedicine <ref type="bibr">Association, 2020)</ref>. Now this kind of technology-based health service is becoming more accessible, as more people now own mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(García, Tomás, Parra, &amp; Lloret, 2019)</ref>. In the current study's context, telemedicine is recognized as an actual medical consultation provided to individuals by healthcare providers using mobile phones.</p><p>It is also argued that healthcare's future includes not only the conventional healthcare providers but also the intrusion of related technologies (e.g., telemedicine) and marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson, Rayburn, &amp; Sierra, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Butt, Iqbal, &amp; Zohaib, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, conventional healthcare service is facing challenges with healthcare cost and long waiting time where telemedicine is retailing healthcare services with low cost and short waiting time <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wang, Zhang, Zhao, &amp; Shi, 2019</ref>). Yet the use of telemedicine is sluggish than expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Swan, Dahl, &amp; Peltier, 2019)</ref>, calling for further inquiry into consumer acceptance, especially in developing county context <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bagchi, Melamed, Yeniyurt, Holzemer, &amp; Reyes, 2018)</ref>. Bangladesh as a developing country was one of the 57 countries with an imbalanced healthcare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(WHO, 2011)</ref>. The country is now facing an acute shortage of skilled healthcare professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam, Hoque, Hu, &amp; Barua, 2020)</ref>. The COVID-19's outbreak has made this situation even worse where telemedicine could be a feasible solution with easy access to regular healthcare services. This is also in line with the country's initiatives to accomplish Digital Bangladesh Vision 2021 by engaging ICTs in different public services <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Daily Sun, 2019)</ref>, including healthcare. Besides, Bangladesh has a rising young generation with growing interests in health information technology (HIT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020)</ref>, making it appropriate to study telemedicine acceptance behavior for better designing technology-based health service retailing strategies targeting the promising younger generation.</p><p>With the emergence of health consumerism and increased market pressures, both the service providers and researchers are now acknowledging the importance of marketing concepts in healthcare industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Senot, Chandrasekaran, &amp; Ward, 2016)</ref>. Accordingly, healthcare industry is increasingly building around the requirements of the patient as a consumer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gaur et al., 2019)</ref>. This consequently prompts responding to challenges regarding the extent to which consumers are willing to accept the new form of healthcare delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Smith &amp; Bernene, 2014)</ref>. Responses to such challenges could include the exploration of factors motivating consumers to accept alternate, quick, cheap, convenient, and retail form of healthcare service through telemedicine. In this regard, former studies uncovered that analyzing consumers' intention and actual usage with emotional experience of using products and services (e.g., user satisfaction) help better understand consumer needs and formulate suitable marketing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Konuk, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Within the extant literature on telemedicine (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kamal, Shafiq, &amp; Kakria 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sterling &amp; LeRouge, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Swan et al., 2019)</ref>, some notable research gaps are still worth addressing. First, in the convergence of healthcare and technology (e.g., telemedicine), the predominant role of marketing is yet to be effusively explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anderson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Grewal, Hulland, Kopalle, &amp; Karahanna, 2020)</ref>. Indeed, there is a lack of studies outlining strategic and practical guidance for new entrants who are increasingly considering a viable business prospect with telemedicine service <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sterling &amp; LeRouge, 2019)</ref>. Second, user acceptance of telemedicine should be studied by combining relevant theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harst, Lantzsch, &amp; Scheibe, 2019)</ref>. Some former studies did so in HIT context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kim &amp; Park, 2012</ref>); yet such studies disregarded the Health Belief Model (HBM) or the role of facilitating conditions (FC) and social influence (SI), which are critical to understanding users' acceptance of HIT (e.g., telemedicine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harst et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Van Houwelingen, Ettema, Antonietti, &amp; Kort, 2018)</ref>. By overcoming those issues, an integration of HBM with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model could provide a holistic <ref type="bibr">(i.e., technological, social, organizational, and individual)</ref> assessment of telemedicine acceptance behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hastall, Dockweiler, &amp; Mühlhaus, 2017)</ref>, facilitating strategic healthcare marketing decisions regarding telemedicine. Third, most extant studies on HIT illustrated behavioral intention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kamal et al., 2020)</ref> or actual usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dou et al., 2017)</ref> as a resultant variable. Theoretically, however, user satisfaction captures the success of implementing any information systems (IS) (e.g., telemedicine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Isaac, Abdullah, Aldholay, &amp; Ameen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis, 2003)</ref>. Nonetheless, to date, the evaluation of user satisfaction as an outcome variable lacks in the existing telemedicine literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harst et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the abovementioned theoretical gaps, some relevant context-specific gaps require further attention. First, most existing literature has concentrated on telemedicine acceptance in rural context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zobair, Sanzogni, &amp; Sandhu, 2020)</ref> among elderly people (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sorwar, Rahamn, Uddin, &amp; Hoque, 2016)</ref>, overlooking the very promising urban young segment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020)</ref>. Second, alongside general health emergencies, telemedicine is efficaciously managing several chronic diseases (e.g., diabetic, cancer) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Burki, 2020)</ref> during COVID-19.</p><p>Nonetheless, it appears that no study has yet investigated the antecedents and satisfaction of telemedicine acceptance in a COVID-19 context.</p><p>This study addresses such research gaps by exploring the antecedents and user satisfaction as an outcome of telemedicine acceptance, making at least four key contributions to the extant literature. First, in response to the call made by earlier research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Harst et al., 2019)</ref>, it integrates the UTAUT and HBM to understand the antecedents of telemedicine acceptance. UTAUT suggests that while performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), SI, and FC directly predict behavioral intention (BI) to adopt the technology (e.g., telemedicine), FC and BI directly explain actual usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. Besides, HBM recommends that many health-related behaviors are triggered by perceived health threats, along with perceived benefits and barriers of undertaking that behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rosenstock, 1974)</ref>. Second, the results would help policymakers and healthcare marketers better predict consumers' behavior relating to technology-based health service. Third, it enriches existing literature by empirically testing 'user satisfaction' as an outcome, contributing to the enhanced understanding of users' loyalty and continuance with HIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zobair et al., 2020)</ref>. Fourth, with its focus on COVID-19, it allows a comprehensive exploration of the antecedents and outcomes of telemedicine acceptance among generation Y and Z in urban areas. By enabling service providers in making generalizations on particular age group, this study would therefore help improved strategy formulations regarding telemedicine usage during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Literature and hypotheses</head><p>As discussed, this study has built its theoretical framework on six constructs from the UTAUT model (PE, EE, SI, FC, BI, and actual usage behavior -AUB), three constructs from the HBM (PE, perceived health threat and RC), as well as user satisfaction as an outcome of telemedicine acceptance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Performance expectancy (PE)</head><p>PE refers to "the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in job performance" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2003, p. 447)</ref>. In line with this, this study has defined PE as the degree that end-users believe telemedicine usage will result in fast and improved, low-cost healthcare services that overcame geographical barriers, especially during COVID-19 pandemic. PE has been recognized as a strong, positive determinant of intention to use other IT-related services such as m-banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, &amp; Patil, 2019)</ref>. Several studies have also confirmed it is influential in predicting BI to use mhealth services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hoque &amp; Sorwar, 2017)</ref> and smartphone health technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dou et al., 2017)</ref>. Drawing on these findings and recognizing telemedicine as efficient healthcare technology, it is surmised that if users' find it useful in meeting their healthcare needs within the current pandemic, they will illustrate more positive intentions. Thus, the following hypothesis was postulated: H1. Performance expectancy positively influences behavioral intention to use telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Effort expectancy (EE)</head><p>EE refers to "the degree of ease associated with the use of the system" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2003, p. 450)</ref>, with extant studies recognizing it as having a significant influence on the enduser's intention to use e-health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Boontarig, Chutimaskul, Chongsuphajaisiddhi, &amp; Papasratorn, 2012)</ref> and electronic health record (EHR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hossain, Quaresma, &amp; Rahman, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In this context, telemedicine is argued to be an easy-to-use service with the use of such easily accessible devices as mobile phones <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Suzuki et al., 2020)</ref>. Besides, in a pandemic like COVID-19, users can easily get regular healthcare services remotely from their home by using telemedicine with minimal effort. Building on these arguments and past empirical evidence, the following hypothesis was put forward: H2. Effort expectancy positively influences behavioral intention to use telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Social influence (SI)</head><p>SI refers to "the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2003, p. 451)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Porter and Ganong (2002)</ref> identified professional caregivers, children, and peers as those that most influence the acceptance of new technology. Social settings of developing countries like Bangladesh often make it obvious that people live in joint families and they primarily tend to be influenced by the behavior and opinion of other family members (e.g., elder brothers or sisters), relatives, or even neighbors.</p><p>Evidence of such SI in telemedicine use <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kamal et al., 2020)</ref> would arguably be enhanced by further empirical examination in telemedicine acceptance. Accordingly, while several studies have reported the significant direct impact of SI on BI to use e-health <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Boontarig et al., 2012)</ref>, mhealth services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Harst et al. (2019)</ref> posited that further research is needed in the context of telemedicine. Thus, the following hypothesis was proposed: H3. Social influence positively influences behavioral intention to use telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Facilitating condition (FC)</head><p>FC refers to "the degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2003, p. 453)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boontarig et al. (2012)</ref> contended that FC positively influences the intention to use smartphones for ehealth services. Likewise, telemedicine usage is predominantly triggered by related technical and organizational support services including the provision of specific hotline numbers (e.g., 333 in Bangladesh) and required guidelines facilitating users to instantaneously contact healthcare professionals upon experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. This could foster the prompt adoption of telemedicine services among users. In this regard, while relevant studies have illustrated the positive, significant relationship between FC and both BI to use and AUB of EHR <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hossain et al., 2019)</ref> and mhealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020)</ref>, examining the influence of FC on BI to use and AUB of telemedicine with regard to generation Y and Z remains unexplored. Thus, the following hypotheses were proposed: H4. Facilitating condition positively influences behavioral intention to use telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5.</head><p>Facilitating condition positively influences actual usage behavior in telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Perceived health threat (PHT)</head><p>PHT has been determined as end-users' awareness and concern for a personal health condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dou et al., 2017)</ref>, identified as a direct determinant of BI to use HIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kim &amp; Park, 2012)</ref>. In other words, PHT is an individual's perception of the risk of facing a particular health condition (e.g., getting infected), including the likely clinical (e.g., death) or social outcomes (e.g., effects on family life) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rosenstock, 1974)</ref>. This is particularly relevant during COVID-19, because any such pandemic that triggers fear of being infected <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mamun &amp; Griffiths, 2020</ref>) is likely to create the urge to adopt new systems. Being infected with COVID-19 might cause financial threats (e.g., cost of treatments) and social threats (e.g., being isolated in the society) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mamun &amp; Griffiths, 2020)</ref>. Recognition of such threats might accelerate the uptake of preventive healthcare measures (e.g., avoiding crowds), leading people to use telemedicine services. In this regard, PHT has been confirmed as a direct determinant of BI to eating healthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deshpande, Basil, &amp; Basil, 2009)</ref> or use HIT in the context of self-management of chronic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kim &amp; Park, 2012</ref>); yet it has not been explicitly tested in telemedicine literature. Hence, the following hypothesis was proposed: H6. Perceived health threat positively influences behavioral intention to use telemedicine. People might start using telemedicine either forcibly or voluntarily; nonetheless, they would discontinue it in the longer run <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kamal et al., 2020)</ref>. Consistent with this, former studies on healthcare technology, including smartphone health technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dou et al., 2017)</ref> and mhealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hoque &amp; Sorwar, 2017)</ref>, have demonstrated that RC has a significant, negative impact on BI to use. Yet in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, whether RC still has the same impact on BI to use an alternative, less threatening healthcare service (e.g., telemedicine) remains unexplored.</p><p>Thus, the following hypothesis was put forward: H7. Resistance to change has a significant negative influence on behavioral intention to use telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Behavioral intention (BI)</head><p>BI has been conceptualized as an individual's willingness to perform a particular behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. The UTAUT model exhibits a significant positive impact of BI on AUB <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. Essentially, it is necessary to study BI's impact on actual usage behavior as BI does not always translate into AUB <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dou et al., 2017)</ref>. In a healthcare context, recent studies on health technology (e.g., mhealth, EHR) affirms that BI to use is a significant determinant of AUB <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hossain et al., 2019)</ref>. However, such an affirmation is yet to be investigated in the context of retail healthcare such as telemedicine; thus, drawing on core UTAUT logic and extant studies, this study hypothesizes that: H8. Behavioral intention to use positively influences actual usage behavior of telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.">AUB and user satisfaction (USF)</head><p>In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Isaac et al. (2019)</ref>, this study defines USF as the degree that end-users are satisfied with their decision to use telemedicine. AUB has been determined as the actual usage frequency of a system or service, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> recommending that user satisfaction be evaluated as a success factor of such usage. The important thing that matters to be with telemedicine service is the experiential outcome of AUB (e.g., satisfaction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kamal et al., 2020)</ref>. Some former studies in IT system adoption have reported that AUB positively influences USF (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Isaac et al., 2019</ref>); yet this area has been relatively unexplored in relation to telemedicine technology. In accordance with this discussion and amidst an unprecedented incident like COVID-19, we also speculated that AUB might hasten USF. Thus, it was posited that:</p><p>H9. Actual usage behavior positively influences user satisfaction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Measures</head><p>This study has adopted all but one previously validated measures for content validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hair Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2014)</ref>. The COVID-19 infection affects people both physically and socially <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mamun &amp; Griffiths, 2020)</ref>, which influenced this study's development of a perceived health threat item (i.e., I am concerned that getting infected with COVID-19 will cost me socially) in consultation with HIT experts. Items for physical concern were adapted from other sources, as specified in Appendix 1. In line with previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hossain et al., 2019)</ref>, a 5point Likert scale was used, ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. To ensure appropriateness, two academics from the psychology and marketing departments and two HIT researchers reviewed and evaluated the questionnaire, which was then pre-tested among fifteen 19-25 year-old students that represented the target population. Final refinements were then made to ensure an acceptable range of criterion validity of the questionnaire. Appendix 1 presents the list of all measurement items and their sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Target population</head><p>The target population was generation Y and Z; those born between 1980 and 1995 and 1995 and 2010 respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bencsik et al., 2016)</ref>. It has been reported that a considerable amount in these generations have been infected with <ref type="bibr">COVID-19 (IEDCR, 2020)</ref>. They are also more technology prone, meaning they are more likely to influence a radical change in healthcare services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020)</ref>. Moreover, youngers tend to use the internet more than the general people to search for health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Erdem, 2008)</ref>. The focus was also on urban generation Y and Z, based on identification of metropolitan areas as the epicenters of most countries' COVID-19 outbreaks (CNN, 2020; WHO, 2020), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Smith et al. (2020)</ref> noting that telemedicine is just as useful for patients in urban areas as it is for those in rural areas.</p></div>

Three graduates contacted these 935 potential respondents via mobile phone, email, and messenger. After explaining the study's rationale and nature, they were asked whether they were willing to participate, and if they had used a telemedicine service at least once. Moreover, participants were made aware of the option to quit participation at any phase during the survey. This generated 774 willing and relevant respondents who were then provided with the survey link via email or messenger, with two follow-ups occurring within seven-day periods. To prevent a participant from responding more than once, 'Limit to 1 response' option was checked in the setting of the Google Docs survey. Participants were not offered any incentives to avoid potential bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020)</ref>. The survey period was the first three weeks of April 2020, after COVID-19 had officially become a pandemic.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussions</head><p>This study integrated the HBM and UTAUT model to explore the antecedents and user satisfaction of telemedicine acceptance among end-users. In line with past studies on HIT and HER <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hossain et al., 2019)</ref> and mhealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alam et al., 2020)</ref>, our results suggest that PE is an important driver for the acceptance of telemedicine. The end-user's positive experience has been connected to technologies that are comfortable and easy to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alalwan et al., 2017)</ref>, indicating that if telemedicine helps to improve the ability to manage healthcare efficiently, these younger generations would be more likely to use it. Generation Y and Z's regular use of smart applications, for an easier and faster way of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bencsik et al., 2016)</ref>, aligns with this study's finding that EE has a positive influence on BI. This implies that if telemedicine usage is simple and justifiable, they will be more likely to use it.</p><p>Furthermore, result of H3 (SI is a determinant of BI) signifies these younger generations are more likely to be influenced by those close to them about accepting a new technology like telemedicine. In addition, our results highlight the positive impact of FC on end-users' telemedicine acceptance which is congruent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alam et al. (2020)</ref>. Thus, as with other technology-related services such as m-banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baabdullah et al., 2019)</ref>, adequate organizational and technical infrastructure (e.g., trained staff, technology platform) may trigger intended and actual usage of telemedicine among generation Y and Z.</p><p>Furthermore, building on <ref type="bibr">Dou et al.'s (2017)</ref> telemedicine study, our results show that PHT positively influences BI, suggesting that higher levels of awareness of health threats (e.g.,  will make generation Y and Z more likely to accept telemedicine. Our findings also suggest that RC does not have any significant negative influence on BI in adopting telemedicine, which is contrary to extant findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hoque &amp; Sorwar, 2017)</ref>. This indicates that generation Y and Z's enthusiasm toward technology drives their higher intention to use technologies like telemedicine, particularly during a pandemic like COVID-19 when social distancing is mandatory. Lastly, this study reports a positive association between AUB and USF in the context of telemedicine acceptance, which is a fresh finding, suggesting end-users are satisfied with such health technologies that provide prompt responses from specialized doctors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Theoretical implications</head><p>This study's integration of the HBM and UTAUT model to explain end-users' telemedicine acceptance behavior is a fresh approach, especially in the context of technology-based retail health service. It empirically tested and confirmed the robustness of the combined model, which is an incremental contribution to existing telemedicine literature. For example, studies applying TAM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kamal et al., 2020)</ref>  such an incorporation further exemplifies an improved explanatory power of the combined model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harst et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, this study validates the HBM in comprehending HIT acceptance (i.e., telemedicine), offering a theoretical framework for future studies on technology enabled retail services (e.g., health care).</p><p>Overall, this study's validation of the path from cognitive process (e.g., PE, EE) to actual behavior to emotional reaction (i.e., USF) is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bagozzi's (1992)</ref> disjointed concepts (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral). In this context, this study has gone a step further than simply exploring consumer acceptance by recognizing the impact of AUB on user satisfaction.</p><p>From theoretical perspective, this is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Isaac et al.'s (2019)</ref> finding, suggesting a link between telemedicine acceptance and its potential outcomes, which is largely unexplored in telemedicine literature. It consequently sets a theoretical foundation for further understanding of end-users' continuance intention with respect to health technologies like telemedicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Practical implications</head><p>While telemedicine offers a potential effective solution to healthcare services during COVID-19, challenges remain with consumers' acceptance of this service. This study's empirical findings have contributed to this issue by providing an extensive understanding of factors affecting young generation's acceptance of telemedicine as well as practical insights for health service delivery through telemedicine implementation as a supplement of traditional and retail healthcare, particularly post-COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the positive influence of PE and EE on BI, suggesting that a nationwide campaign advocating the ease of its use could extend telemedicine acceptance. Policymakers and retail health service marketers should therefore promote it as an innovative, easy-to-use option for receiving healthcare services, particularly during pandemics like COVID-19. Together with awareness building, such as campaign could generate positive word-of-mouth and accelerate the role of SI. These findings also indicate that the younger generations often value opinions of important others (e.g. friends, peers, relatives) before initiating the use of technologies like telemedicine. Health service marketers should therefore focus on these influential others by publishing articles and creating social media content (e.g., Facebook, telemedicine user community) to spread positive word-ofmouth. Educating individuals about the expected health benefits of a new healthcare service is critical to such service be successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Simons, Hampe, &amp; Guldemond, 2014)</ref>. Thus, policymakers should also ensure necessary resources are in place for telemedicine usage (e.g., trained medical staff, educational programs, well-equipped service facilities).</p><p>These findings also illustrate the positive impact of PHT on BI. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, young people concerned about the physical and social risks of infection primarily seek out healthcare services. Thus, a service or technology like telemedicine, which ensures privacy and minimizes the risk of infection, will trigger higher levels of acceptance.</p><p>Furthermore, particularly in the context of COVID-19, the findings suggest that RC does not have any significant negative influence on generation Y and Z's acceptance of telemedicine.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>3.6.
