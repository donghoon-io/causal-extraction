<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The importance of foreign knowledge in international industrial business is immense. It is considered as the most crucial intangible resource of the firm. Starting from inception and continuing the business either in the domestic or international markets, a culture of accumulating knowledge can deliver a significant competitive advantage to the firm. The knowledge base of the firm is developed from a strategic action of discovering, collating and sharing culture. Knowledge can be generated from anywhere within the organization or outside organization. In most cases, the top-level managers usually make use of valuable knowledge through strategic actions to generate economic value, such as in B-2-B marketing activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Todd, Javalgi, &amp; Grossman, 2014)</ref>. Accumulating foreign market knowledge (FMK) is considered as one of the critical success factors and a continuous process for firms that internationalize. Drawing upon the knowledge-based view, knowledge is the most crucial intangible resource to achieve competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Grant, 1996)</ref>. Due to changes in international policies, technological advancement, competitive advantage, agency's influences, and clients' preference, the entrepreneurs must keep themselves up to date through foreign knowledge in order to sustain in the international markets. This critical action of accumulating FMK requires entrepreneurs with a set of dynamic capabilities to respond to the saturated business environment.</p><p>Dynamic managerial capability (DMC) is the capability of top managers to build, integrate, and reconfigure organizational resources and competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adner &amp; Helfat, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>DMC is directly related to entrepreneurship and provides an edge for entrepreneurs to exploit and objectify opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Teece, 2012)</ref>. Two critical aspects are notable of DMC: a) it enables entrepreneurs to respond to strategic changes in the market and b) it stimulates the decision of resources allocation, optimally. DMC is rooted in three building blocks: (1) managerial human capital; (2) managerial social capital; and (3) managerial cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adner &amp; Helfat, 2003)</ref>. On the one hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Teece (2016)</ref> argues that DMC enables entrepreneurs to sense, seize, and transform opportunities to respond to strategic changes and on the other hand argues that attractive opportunities can be exploited from valuable and rare information and knowledge (Yli-Renko, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Autio, &amp; Sapienza, 2001)</ref>. However, the causal relationship between DMC and FMK is yet to be established <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Åkerman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fletcher, Harris, &amp; Richey Jr, 2013)</ref>. This study has attempted to fulfil this research gap. The fundamental research question of this study is:</p><p>What role does dynamic managerial capability play to foreign market knowledge and firm performance? It is notable to investigate this research issue in an emerging economy because the empirical research paucity is evident in this early international business context <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Knight &amp; Liesch, 2016)</ref>. The firms which are considered in this study of investigation are also known as export-manufacturers. These firms are proactive, early internationalized, and operate their businesses in multiple countries from inception. This study considers these exportmanufacturing firms because individual-level capability such as DMC is critically important in this kind of entrepreneurial firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Coviello, 2015)</ref>. These firms from an emerging economy have resource constraints, limited access to information, and have a lower level of competencies compared to firms from developed economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Roudini &amp; Osman, 2012)</ref>. Hence, DMC plays a very crucial role to identify correct information, market, valuable resource, raw material suppliers, and so forth.</p><p>The contribution of this study is twofold. First, this study unfolds the causal relationship between DMC and FMK accumulation. The empirical establishment merits more profound insights into international business knowledge and strategic management development. It will enhance the knowledge corridor of knowledge-based view and the theory of dynamic capability at individual-level. Understanding the mechanism of FMK which leads to success strengthens the relationship between DMC and firm performance. This study also reveals whether FMK accumulation is channeled in the right direction by investigating the direct effects of FMK accumulation on firm performance. Second, this study investigates firms from an emerging economy which complements the early international business literature from the capability perspective and contributes to the research initiatives indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Knight and Liesch (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tabares, Alvarez, and Urbano (2015)</ref>. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second part of the paper discusses the theoretical perspective of DMC and the foundation of FMK and proposes the hypotheses. The third part of the paper highlights the research methodology and analyses. Section four describes potential findings and results. Final part of the paper argues the outcomes, theoretical contributions, implications, limitation, and future direction of the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Foundation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic managerial capability (DMC)</head><p>DMC is the outgrowth theory of dynamic capability to explain the individual-level capability to respond to strategic action of the firm. It is the capability of managers or entrepreneurs to sense, seize, and transform opportunities. Both operational (such as routines) and strategic actions (new opportunities) of the firms can be influenced by the DMC of entrepreneurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Teece, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Substantial development has been done to improve DMC theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Helfat and Martin (2016)</ref> bring the idea of innovation and creativity which are the outcomes of entrepreneurial actions that shape through DMC. O' <ref type="bibr">Reilly and Tushman (2008)</ref> denote DMC as the "capacity of senior managers to ensure learning, integration, and when required, reconfiguration, and transformation-all aimed at sensing and seizing opportunities as markets evolve" (p. 189). Yet remarkably, great opportunities are only derived from valuable, rare, and noteworthy information <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Huikkola &amp; Kohtamäki, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Three building blocks potentially complement DMC. They are: a) managerial human capital, b) managerial social capital, and c) managerial cognition. In order to reach the performance of the firm, entrepreneurs need to transform the information to actions and involve routine procedures to deploy decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Augier &amp; Teece, 2009)</ref>. Competitive advantage is one of the critical performance outcomes that is delivered from DMC. For instance, to develop competitive business assets, entrepreneurs must have higher level of DMC to accumulate knowledge and process it to achieve an advantage from it. Information is the bridge between the intention and performance outcomes. Although, entrepreneurs improve their capability on an ad-hoc basis, but the need of DMC is immense in a volatile business market <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Oxtorp, 2014)</ref>. Not all capabilities are DMC, and not all entrepreneurs will have it. However, to confirm the maximum yield of DMC, the continuous presence of all three building blocks are crucially important <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Roberts, Campbell, &amp; Vijayasarathy, 2016)</ref>. Each dimension of DMC is unique, and there are no covariates between the dimension of the same larger concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Helfat &amp; Martin, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Capability development requires time, effort, specialization, and intelligence.</p><p>Managerial human capital is derived from previous qualification, experience, and on-going training activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Castanias &amp; Helfat, 1991)</ref>. It enables entrepreneurs to process information through cognitive concentration to take decision, for instance, resources mobilization and deployment decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Helfat &amp; Martin, 2015)</ref>. Although managerial human capital is a wellestablished concept in management, international business literature profoundly recognizes the concept of managerial social capital to sustain in the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coviello &amp; Cox, 2006)</ref>. It takes both informal and formal network relationships of entrepreneurs that develop the conduits of information to take the decision to execute strategic actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>However, DMC also considers managerial cognition because all three building blocks complement each other. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adner and Helfat (2003)</ref> argue that managerial cognition is contextual; and international entrepreneurs must posit global mindset as a pre-requisite of entrepreneurial cognition in order to survive and continue international operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Nummela, Saarenketo, &amp; Puumalainen, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foreign market knowledge (FMK)</head><p>FMK is the knowledge-base of the firm which facilitates the firm to survive and continue its business in the international market. Three particular knowledge-bases are needed to establish within the firm: a) foreign business knowledge, b) foreign institution knowledge, and c) internationalization knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eriksson et al., 1997)</ref>. An interesting question at this juncture is: Why do firms need to accumulate FMK? Because the repository of FMK enables firms to enjoy intangible unique and valuable resources. The knowledge-based view suggests that knowledge is an important strategic resource of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Nonaka, 1994)</ref>. It is an intangible resource to achieve sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. Knowledge influences the decision to market entry, expansions, pace, and market selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eriksson, Majkgard, &amp; Sharma, 2000)</ref>; and the aftermath effects of each decision contributes to firm performance.</p><p>Knowledge also plays a critical role to develop dynamic marketing capability in order to achieve innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Falasca et al., 2017)</ref>. Eventually, knowledge develops the firm's ability to deal with uncertainties. Although the development process of knowledge-base of the firm is a gradual process, early internationalized firms are proactive and accelerate the accumulation process and treat knowledge as endowed resources of the firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Andersson &amp; Wictor, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, the question that is yet to be answered is: Does FMK accumulation process require the dynamic managerial capability of entrepreneurs?</p><p>As indicated earlier, three types of knowledge are highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eriksson et al. (1997)</ref> to explain FMK. First, foreign business knowledge assists firms to develop the knowledge-base of potential competitors, customers, emerging, and existing market condition. Second, foreign institution knowledge delivers the information of new/foreign cultures, values, norms, formal and informal institutional rules and regulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eriksson et al., 1997)</ref>. For instance, changes in the exportation or importation policies. Apparently, to get valuable and very confidential information regarding new policies, entrepreneurs must have a robust network inside the institution. Although internationalization is a critical process, for early internationalization the risk is much higher. Third, internationalization knowledge develops the abilities of the firms to respond to this risk. It refers to the knowledge of adaptability, international operations, and international market engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zhou, 2007)</ref>. The awareness of possible opportunities and handling new disputes can be dealt with the knowledge from foreign business and foreign institutional knowledge. However, the internationalization knowledge stimulates the process of realizing those opportunities by taking appropriate actions in the international market <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Mostafiz &amp; Goh, 2018)</ref>. But do all entrepreneurs have the ability to create economic value and deal with uncertainties in the international market? This paper addresses this critical research issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses Development</head><p>Drawing upon DMC, this study proposes the following conceptual framework as highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The fundamental theoretical underpinning of the framework suggests that DMC enables entrepreneurs to respond to strategic changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Teece, 2012)</ref>. Seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adner and Helfat (2003)</ref> propose the definition of DMC as the capacity of managers to build, integrate, and transform resources and competencies. FMK is a critical intangible resource of the firm and the accumulation process of FMK is a continuous strategic action of the firm. This study argues that to create economic value and successful performance from knowledge, the entrepreneurs should have a higher level of DMC which consists of managerial human capital, managerial social capital, and managerial cognition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between dynamic managerial capability and foreign market knowledge</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial human capital</head><p>Managerial human capital refers to the skill, knowledge and the analytical ability of entrepreneurs which is derived from previous educational, experience, and training activities to respond strategic changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adner &amp; Helfat, 2003)</ref>. The learning orientation of the firm and managerial human capital is intimately connected and it enhances the ability of the firms to transform information into action <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dimov, 2007)</ref>. Human capital is a core resource in smallmedium size firm if it is rare, unique, and inimitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Campbell, Coff, &amp; Kryscynski, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Higher level of human capital, such as more experiences of entrepreneurs can deliver the opportunity to bypass the conventional market and develop a new market <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Seghers, Manigart, &amp; Vanacker, 2012)</ref>. Efficient human capital delivers neat alternatives for financial success.</p><p>Sometimes, mobilization of existing strategy in a new manner requires new learning. This type of learning is the outcome of continuous training and development of human capital. Although, replication, common practices, and learning are not so dynamic, in order to sustain in the volatile business environment, entrepreneurs need to adapt to changes and keep themselves upto-date. Adaptation and learning require both tacit and explicit knowledge, and entrepreneurs with a high level of human capital can develop this <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Grichnik et al., 2014)</ref>. Efficient human capital improves the proactive behavior of entrepreneurs, their critical thinking, and a variety of other operational and strategic capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Zhao, Seibert, &amp; Hills, 2005)</ref>. Undoubtedly, managerial human capital is a very critical antecedent and a success factor. Therefore, we propose H1: There is a positive relationship between managerial human capital and FMK of the firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial social capital</head><p>Social capital and social network relationships get most attention in international business research <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Knight &amp; Liesch, 2016)</ref>. Social capital is the most critical success factor and antecedent to achieve successful internationalization. In fact, nascent entrepreneurs need strong social capital to commit internationalization and continue operation in the international market <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Davidsson &amp; Honig, 2003)</ref>. The social capital of the entrepreneur develops from business partners, alliances, government officials, union leaders, and other potential and influential stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Turnbull, Ford, &amp; Cunningham, 1996)</ref>. These network relationships increase entrepreneurial power, control, and gain international footprints in multiple markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kiss &amp; Danis, 2010)</ref>. Managerial ties, trust, and solidarity between entrepreneurs strengthen this networking relationship. It is not necessary for social network to happen from an external relationship. Strong internal social networking also plays a role in capability development, for instance the marketing capability of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kemper, Engelen, &amp; Brettel, 2011)</ref>. Other benefits in emerging economies include: alleviate resource constraints, build political liaison, give first mover advantage, and provide tax promotional benefits. These can be feasible if the social capital of entrepreneurs is effective and efficient. Managerial social capital of entrepreneurs potentially escalates the growth and the performance of the firm in a distinctive way <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Coviello, 2006)</ref>. New opportunities are essential for resources configuration, and these opportunities require new sources of information <ref type="bibr">(Mostafiz et al., 2019)</ref>. Strongest network relationships of top-level management provide an edge to gather information, thus, enhancing the knowledge-base of the firm. Higher level of DMC of entrepreneur facilitates them to identify new sources of information for resource reconfiguration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andersson &amp; Evers, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Results from effective social capital, such as strategic alliances between businesses also provide meaningful insights to improve the innovative culture and creativity level of firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Luk et al., 2008)</ref>. Hence, the importance of FMK that might deliver from managerial social capital of entrepreneur is immense to sustain in the international market. Therefore, we propose: H2: There is a positive relationship between managerial social capital and FMK of the firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial cognition</head><p>Building a knowledge-base of the firm is a primary duty of entrepreneurs. Directly or indirectly, an entrepreneur influences the quality and the value of the knowledge-base of the firm. The mental and knowledge structure, belief system and processing capability of information of entrepreneurs is ultimately responsible for strategic action and outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adner and Helfat (2003)</ref> have conceptualized managerial cognition as the mindset of entrepreneurs to execute multiple types of strategic actions, simultaneously. Apart from that, if international entrepreneurs want to sustain in the international market, then they must follow the global mindset <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Oviatt &amp; McDougall, 1994)</ref>. It is defined as a vision of entrepreneurs to practice openness and cultural diversification which increases the propensity of entrepreneurial commitment towards international markets and creates synergy among diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gupta &amp; Govindarajan, 2002)</ref>. Global mindset of entrepreneurs is a complete international orientation which also smoothens the internationalization process by developing learning capability, adaptation, international marketing, and technological advancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Weerawardena et al., 2007)</ref>. It is a pre-requisite of international success <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Nummela et al., 2004)</ref>. For instance, global mindset of entrepreneurs enables them to create new ventures, anticipate future market and changes, and commit decision on resource allocation. These are the critical success factors to sustain in the international market. A successful entrepreneur will never compromise and always seeks for valuable information. Only effective information can deliver successful international expansion. Evidence has shown that wrong information can lead to accidental internationalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hennart, 2014)</ref>. Therefore, if the global mindset of the entrepreneur is active then it can create a bridge between the variety of organizational goals that are related to the international market and bring success. Therefore, we propose: H3: There is a positive relationship between managerial cognition and FMK of the firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating role of FMK</head><p>This study argues that DMC of entrepreneurs enhances the performance of the firms through the acquisition of FMK. Knowledge is something which is developed over-time. In this study, we conceptualize that to develop knowledge-base of the organization, entrepreneurs need specialized capability which is delivered from DMC. Previous study suggests that FMK plays a significant mediating role between entrepreneurial proclivity and the pace of internationalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zhou, 2007)</ref>. Given that knowledge is considered the most important intangible asset of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Autio, Sapienza, &amp; Almeida, 2000)</ref>, FMK is the acquisition of information which requires experimental knowledge on the international market, competitors, customers, and potential business partners. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cantwell and Piscitello (2000)</ref> denote that FMK increases the innovative culture of the firm through market expansion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Presutti, Boari, and Fratocchi (2007)</ref> have conceptualized that FMK can be gained from weak ties with customers to achieve foreign success. In a high-tech organization, FMK plays a very important role to develop new idea, strategic deployment of resources, and increase firm's willingness to invest in R&amp;D activity to respond to market stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cantwell &amp; Mudambi, 2005)</ref>. If internationalization is a strategic initiative, then a higher level of FMK fastens the internationalization process. If the entrepreneurs have the ability to acquire and accumulate valuable knowledge on formal and informal institutions, then the barriers of market expansion will minimize to a great extent. Market expansion is considered as one of the key revenue generating strategies of exporting firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gabrielsson &amp; Pelkonen, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Åkerman (2015)</ref> suggests that entrepreneurs having market-specific knowledge and internationalization knowledge increase the firm's ability to realize better opportunities. Since FMK is a continuous process, existing FMK improves the absorptive capability of the firms, which in turn makes the process easier for the accumulation of new knowledge. Rich FMK increases the confidence of entrepreneurs to deal with uncertainties and ease the internationalization process of the firms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Liesch et al., 2011)</ref>. For instance, if entrepreneurs want to position a new product in the international market, then greater knowledge is a pre-requisite for success <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Musteen, Datta, &amp; Butts, 2014)</ref>. If FMK is delivered from an appropriate network, then chances of risky resources commitment will minimize and at the same time entrepreneurs survive from costly mistakes which are associated with the internationalization efforts. We argue that if the entrepreneurs have effective human capital, social capital, and managerial cognition, then the chances of better performance are certain through the accumulation of FMK from the international market.</p><p>Therefore, we proposed: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design and samples</head><p>The sample of this study consists of export-manufacturing firms operating in an emerging economy, Bangladesh. According to the WTO, this export-manufacturing industry of apparel products is considered as the world's third-largest exporters of readymade garments <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(WTO, 2017)</ref>. This industry is a low-technology but labor-intensive industry and plays the role as contract manufacturers for large multinationals. These firms operate their business in a business to business environment. There are approximately 5500 firms registered under BGMEA (Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association) and BKMEA (Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association). This study adopted a random sampling method to select firms from BGMEA and BKMEA. Eight-hundred firms were invited to participate in this study however, only 470 firms completed the survey. The data of DMC and FMK were collected from the entrepreneurs and top managers of the firms. These entrepreneurs are considered as the founders of their firms. In the context of apparel industry of Bangladesh, entrepreneurs/founders play the role of CEO. They are solely responsible for taking all strategic and major decisions. During the data collection, we encountered difficulties to collect data directly from the entrepreneurs, because they were too busy to fill out the questionnaire. In those situations, we approached the second person-in-command who was very close to the entrepreneurs, for instance, deputy managing director or general manager of the firm. This approach of collecting data facilitates this study to control social desirability bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chandler and Hanks (1994)</ref> highlight the importance of collecting data from subordinates or peer than selfassessment. We also conducted the review of the data from an anonymous person in the firm to check the accuracy of the data to minimize the social desirability <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Zahra &amp; Covin, 1995)</ref>. For higher reliability and validity, this study collected financial data (return on assets and return on equity) from the finance manager of the company. The data collection on the performance of the firm was conducted by a face-to-face structured survey with the finance manager of the firms.</p><p>The manager provided the information of ROA and ROE for the last five years from the annual report of the firm. Lastly, the operational manager provided the non-financial data on international market operations and perceived success of the firms. The complete questionnaire is given in Appendix 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement</head><p>This study measured international performance based on financial and non-financial performance. The financial performance of the firm was measured based on the average of return on assets; and the average of return on equity for the last five years <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cerrato &amp; Piva, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jantunen et al., 2008)</ref>.

Four items were used to measure managerial human capital such as prior managerial and entrepreneurial experience, academic qualification, and training activities on ordinary scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Grichnik et al., 2014)</ref>. we asked the entrepreneurs on their prior managerial experience and captured the responses where 1 represents no prior experience; 2 represents one year experience; 3 represents two years of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kemper et al., 2011)</ref>. Managerial tie was captured on seven-point Likert scale where 1 represents 'very little tie' and 7 represents 'very extensive tie'. We captured trust and solidarity also on a seven-point Likert scale where 1 represents 'strongly disagree' and 7 represents 'strongly agree'. Managerial cognition was measured based on the entrepreneurial global mindset which consisted of international commitment, pro-activeness, and, vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Nummela et al., 2004)</ref>, on a seven-point Likert scale where 1 represents 'strongly disagree' and 7 represents 'strongly agree'. This study captured FMK based on foreign business knowledge, foreign institution knowledge, and internationalization knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eriksson et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hadley &amp; Wilson, 2003)</ref>, on a seven-point Likert scale where 1 represents 'much worse' and 7 represents 'much better'. Items considered for foreign business knowledge were: top manager's knowledge about foreign competitors and top manager's knowledge about the needs of foreign clients/customers. Foreign institution knowledge covered top manager's knowledge about (1) foreign language and norms, (2) foreign business laws and regulations, and (3) host government agencies. Finally, internationalization knowledge captured top manager's experience in (1) identifying opportunities, (2) dealing with foreign business contacts, and (3) managing international operation. FMK was operationalized as a second-order construct. This study controlled the relationships between exogenous and endogenous variables through firm size, firm age, and environmental dynamism. Firm size was measured based on the number of employees and age was measured based on firm's experience of operation in the international market <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gerschewski et al., 2015)</ref>. Environmental dynamism was measured on seven-points Likert scale where '1' represents to very high dynamism and '7' represents to low dynamism <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Schilke, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussions and Implications</head><p>Following the appeal of <ref type="bibr">Åkerman (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Helfat and Martin (2015)</ref>, this study contributes to the knowledge of DMC and FMK. The fundamental idea articulated in this study has been to identify antecedents and outcomes to FMK. This study has shown that managerial social capital and managerial cognition of entrepreneurs play significant roles as antecedents to FMK and improves the performance of export-manufacturing firms. It is a noteworthy contribution to international business and strategic management literature which unfold the causal relationship between DMC, FMK, and firm performance. This study contributes significantly to the individual-level capability of entrepreneurs (DMC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adner and Helfat, 2003)</ref> and its impact on FMK <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eriksson et al., 1997)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> represents the final research framework with standard estimates.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> goes here This study used the data from one of the largest export manufacturing industry in the apparel industry in the world. Drawing on dynamic managerial capability theory and foreign market knowledge perspective, this study tested the research model through structural equation modeling. This study created the linkage between the attributes of DMC, FMK, and firm performance. The first attribute of DMC, managerial human capital, turned out to be insignificant. We hypothesized that managerial human capital positively influenced the FMK accumulation and improved the performance of the firm. Our operationalization of managerial human capital was based on prior managerial experience, prior entrepreneurial experience, academic qualification, and training activity. In this context of export manufacturing firms in the apparel industry, the managerial human capital was not significantly important. Possible reason for such results could be contextual. In a low technology labor-intensive industry where firms play a significant role as contract manufacturers, the higher level of human capital does not add sufficient value to the accumulation of FMK and firm's performance. It is notable to mention that in the emerging economy like Bangladesh, the quality of training and development is not effective. Due to resource constraints, the government cannot provide adequate support and initiate training and development programs for entrepreneurs. Unavailability of training programs creates hindrance in the development of productive human capital through specialized skills and abilities. Evidence of human capital from other studies has shown mixed results. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Campbell et al. (2012)</ref> have noted that diversified human capital creates a constraint in employee mobility. Higher level of heterogeneity in managerial human capital is rare, valuable, and inimitable in early internationalized firms. Dimov (2010) denotes similar industrial experiences limits the capability of entrepreneurs to identify opportunities from broader markets. Similar patterns of managerial and entrepreneurial experiences are the conventional processes of entrepreneurial development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Li and Zhang (2007)</ref> have studied human capital and have identified that extraordinary human capital of entrepreneurs in the high-tech industry has a high level of negotiating power with government policymakers. Our study in the low-tech industry has identified an insignificant relationship. Similar types of insignificant relationships have been reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Davidsson and Honig (2003)</ref> while identifying first-time sales opportunities. The accumulation of knowledge requires critical analysis and revisions of the market to identify correct information. Critical analysis requires a great deal of creativity and innovation. More sophisticated training and development can bring creativity in entrepreneurial behavior and promote flexibility in decision making in export manufacturing firms. Previous research has also highlighted a few positive relationships between human capital and strategic actions of the firms, such as in tourism industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Haber &amp; Reichel, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, it is noteworthy to mention the contextual role in this research. When the diversified experience of entrepreneurs take place, then the level of knowledge corridor will be higher to process information <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gruber, MacMillan, &amp; Thompson, 2013)</ref>. In a competitive foreign market, valuable knowledge is the power and a critical success factor, and entrepreneurs should unlearn first to learn and accumulate new knowledge.</p><p>The relationship between managerial social capital and FMK accumulation is positively significant. In fact, managerial social capital indirectly influences the financial and nonfinancial performance of the firms. Managerial social capital has turned out to be the most significant antecedent in the model (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). The level of international competition is intense in an industrial business environment. It can be minimized through valuable knowledge and easier diffusion of important networks. Although, export manufacturers directly do not communicate with end customers, understanding the trend and customer demand directly influences the innovative process of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Faroque, Morrish, &amp; Ferdous, 2017)</ref>. Managerial social capital also improves the information inflow regarding buyer and suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lee &amp; Ha, 2018)</ref>. Networking with important agents and potential stakeholders can embrace FMK accumulation in the organization. Our findings reveal that managerial social capital of the entrepreneurs help them establish a broader set of the international knowledge base which provides less redundant knowledge. This study captures the solidarity of social capital of entrepreneurs. This finding indicates that if entrepreneurs have mutual confidence with each other, the chances of risky knowledge accumulation and commitments will be lower. This finding extends the knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Musteen et al., 2014)</ref> to the individual-level capability perspective by providing evidence and creates a direct link between DMC attributes and FMK accumulation and benefits associated with the financial and non-financial performances of export manufacturing firms. Furthermore, through this study, we argue that managerial social capital of entrepreneurs is equally important to improve financial and non-financial benefits.</p><p>This study significantly contributes to the international business context from emerging economies by using objective and subjective data while measuring international performance.</p><p>Although social capital and network relationships are highly recognized in early internationalization literature, most of the previous studies from this context use subjective data which creates generalizability issues. Our study addresses this important knowledge gap to highlight the importance of social capital to achieve the return on assets and return on equity.</p><p>The hypothesis between managerial cognition and FMK accumulation has turned out to be significant. The conceptualization of managerial cognition is based on entrepreneurial global mindset. We have captured the global mindset based on entrepreneurial pro-active behaviors, international commitment, and vision. Our study complements the earlier study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kyvik et al. (2013)</ref> by highlighting the contribution of global mindset as an antecedent to FMK accumulation in an international business context. One of the most critical competitive advantages of the apparel industry of Bangladesh is the labor advantage. However, other countries such as India, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka are also providing similar advantages in lowtech apparel industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(WTO, 2017)</ref>. Hence, our study highlights that the knowledge base of the firm through DMC by explicitly focusing on the entrepreneur's global mindset is critical for international development. This result supports the idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ghannad and Andersson (2012)</ref> by highlighting the importance of global mindset in the internationalization process.</p><p>This study has found that FMK accumulation fully mediates the relationship between managerial global mindset and financial performance; managerial global mindset and non-financial performance of the firms. Hence, our investigation contributes to the international business literature by providing evidence on global mindset by highlighting the importance of FMK accumulation to gain global footprints, reputations, and continuously develop the market share. Currently, the apparel industry of Bangladesh is positioned third in the world ranking in exporting readymade garments <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(WTO, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Faroque et al. (2017)</ref> has investigated this industry and highlights the importance of capability to achieve international performance. Out study complements <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Faroque et al. (2017)</ref> by contributing to evidence on individual level capability and creates a link between DMC, FMK and firm performance.</p><p>This study also identified insignificant mediating effect of FMK on the relationship between managerial human capital and non-financial performance; and between managerial human capital and financial performance. In a low-tech industry, managerial human capital turns out to be insignificant. The main concept in the literature highlights a positive relationship between experience and knowledge. However, emerging markets are incredibly volatile and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dimov (2010)</ref> argues that diversified experience can bring significant value to the knowledge base. As mentioned earlier, broadening the knowledge corridor can bring significant diversity in the knowledge base of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gruber, MacMillan, &amp; Thompson, 2013)</ref>. It can also improve the information processing mechanism of the firms. In this study, we did not capture the diversified experiences of entrepreneurs. Future research can significantly benefit if managerial human capital includes the measurement of diversified experiences. Then, FMK as the mediator may bring different results in a different research context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial and policymaker implications</head><p>This research has potential managerial implications. Since managerial social capital and managerial cognition have turned out to be significant antecedents to FMK accumulation, managers should encourage internal knowledge integration between departments and build a culture of network relationship so that valuable knowledge can be kept intact and risky knowledge can be avoided. Thus, FMK can enhance the firm's corporate strategy. Besides, managers can better understand FMK through their proactive behavior and higher level of commitment and vision towards international markets. These behaviors can be assimilated and integrated in the organizational structure to increase foreign operations. By increasing foreign activities, the firm will be able to generate higher profits as well as gain foreign market reputation. New sources of FMK can also deliver information to minimize cost, such as cheap raw materials. It is noteworthy to mention that FMK evolves over time and the gradual improvement of DMC is absolute.</p><p>Policymakers should focus on the improvement of DMC of entrepreneurs in the apparel industry. Policymakers can develop specialized and technical training activities, which can bring diversity in entrepreneurial profile. Entrepreneurs will be more capable in dealing with information and knowledge and thus their cognitive capability will flourish. The diversity is important because it transcends into firms' accumulating FMK, which can lead to greater financial and non-financial success. Entrepreneurs can learn technical skills and aspects that can foster innovation. It is evident that accumulation of correct FMK is an innovative process of the firms. Furthermore, organizing international trade fairs is a very important activity that policymakers can pursue. They can invite professionals from potential institutions such as export promotion bureau and government officials and endeavor a single platform where entrepreneurs can further extend their network. It can minimize the knowledge asymmetry between partners and promote proximity in network relationships. These associations facilitate entrepreneurs to get many advantages such as new license to open business or information regarding new opportunities as well as enhance their relational capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rungsithong, Meyer, &amp; Roath, 2017)</ref>. This type of environment of developing network also fosters strategic cluster by promoting inter-firm cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Radas &amp; Božić, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation and Conclusion</head><p>Although this study highlights important knowledge contributions and implications on DMC and FMK, the findings must be interpreted within the context of the study. This study examines the low-tech apparel industry in an emerging economy where managerial human capital turned out to be insignificant. This result cautions against a direct generalization of specific location and the samples of this study, especially the effects of managerial human capital on FMK accumulation and performance. This study is a cross-sectional study which is another limitation of this study. A longitudinal investigation of multiple years can capture the full benefit of FMK accumulation in internationalization and firm's performance. Future research can also consider comparative studies of multiple industries to provide empirical reinforcement in knowledge management literature. With regards to mediating and moderating effects, future study can focus on accelerated internationalization process in investigating how it can improve performance by interacting with FMK. Government participation is another future research agenda which the scholars can look at. A potential area of future study can be in analyzing the impact of government participation in enhancing human capital and FMK accumulation process.</p><p>Finally, this research can be broadened further by incorporating firm-level capability. To complete the capability framework, future research can incorporate dynamic capability such as, innovation capability, technological capability, and absorptive capability to identify the factors that are most significant and empirically tenable in FMK accumulation and contributes to firm's performance and contributes to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jin and Cho (2018)</ref>. Furthermore, future research can be benefitted from moderating effects. This study did not capture the data on entrepreneur's age.</p><p>Future research could focus on socio-demographic characteristics of entrepreneurs and investigate how these factors such as age play the role as a moderator between DMC and strategic outcomes. In conclusion, this research is one of the initial attempts to explain individual-level capability in FMK accumulation domain in low-tech industrial business from emerging economies. It can be considered as the springboard to future studies aimed at understanding FMK in internationalization and performance enhancement process. Such studies will help managers and policymakers to minimize the risk of knowledge asymmetry, understand networks, and develop their cognitive mentality to sustain in the complex international market.
