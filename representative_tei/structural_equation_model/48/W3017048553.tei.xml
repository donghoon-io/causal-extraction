<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of hospital leaders and highperformance work practices (HPWPs) in intensive care units (ICUs) on organizational agility and its impact on healthcare personnel satisfaction.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach: This study was carried out in three ICUs of an important Spanish public hospital, one for adults, one paediatric and one neonatal. The unit of analysis was ICUs personnel (324 individuals: 14.5%, 48.8%, and 36.7% from the categories of doctors, nurses, and nurses' aides, respectively) who were invited to participate in the study.</p><p>The sample had 248 individuals, with a sampling distribution by categories that was quite similar to that of the population. To test the hypotheses proposed, SEM models were used as the maximum likelihood estimation method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings:</head><p>The results confirm the proposed model and reveal the importance of the human dimension in ICUs on hospital agility and on its performance in terms of satisfaction of the clinical staff working in this area.</p><p>Originality/value: This paper is original because it analyzes units of great complexity such as ICUs from a management and not clinical perspective. In addition, it studies the role of hospital managers and HPWPs on employee outcomes, as well as in hospital responsiveness in a very dynamic context that demands agility on the management approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Settings where organizations currently carry out their activities are increasingly changeable, turbulent, and complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Uhl-Bien and Arena, 2017)</ref>. In light of this fact, organizations must act in a dynamic way from a systemic, long-term perspective. Thus, today's context calls for a new management paradigm oriented towards agility <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Labaf and Bigdelli, 2015)</ref>. Based on this paradigm, the organizational activity must respond rapidly and flexibly to changes in the environment and have the capacity to manage situations of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sharifi and Zhang, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sherehiy et al., 2007)</ref>. In this regard, more studies are necessary to analyze the factors that determine organizational agility in the health sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Suresh and Patri, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In particular, the role of the personnel on organizational agility is a requisite to successful performance, given that individuals in organizations must be committed to and prepared for change, as stayed by <ref type="bibr">Nijssen and Paauwe (2012)</ref>. Therefore, it is easy to understand why the role of the human factor on organizational agility has been addressed in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Harraf et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mooghali et al., 2016)</ref>. Specifically, <ref type="bibr">Walsh et al. (2002)</ref> analyzed the role of human resources management (HRM) on organizational agility in public and private sector. In this regard, hospitals, as organizations, is not exempt from the role played by the human dimension in organizational agility. Hospitals are complex institutions that offer multiple services where the employees and the relationship between departments and units are critical factors for successfully providing health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lee, 2016)</ref>. In this sense, <ref type="bibr">Nembhard and Tucker (2011)</ref> point out that healthcare professional face great complexity, uncertainty and dynamism in their daily work due, among other things, to advances in medicine and technology and the variability of patient response to treatments. In this context, the agility is key, hence the growing interest in studying the elements that contribute to increase hospital units' agility, including the role of the human component, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pipe et al. (2012)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, the study of ICUs as complex work areas that present a high level of uncertainty is of special interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Backes et al., 2012)</ref>. ICUs are highly specialized units that offer 24-hour clinical care to critical patients whose evolution is changing and unpredictable.</p><p>They also demand high-qualified professionals with high environmental dependence on resources and services from other hospitals and out-of-hospital sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Valentin and Ferdinande, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Van der Sluijs et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, ICUs are dynamic, complex, and interdependent systems of internal and external hospital personnel that require agility, and where professional performance is the key to the service's success <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Nascimento et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Massaroli et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, it is important to analyse the relationship between the human dimension in ICU and agility in hospitals, providing solutions from the services literature. Thus, this research analyses ICUs from a service management perspective and helps to close the gap in the literature on the management of ICUs. Another contribution to academic literature in general is the empirical validation of theoretical proposals about the novel concept of organizational agility.</p><p>Based on the above, the objective of this study is to validate a model in which the human dimension influences both the organizational agility and the employee satisfaction. In this model, the human dimension is analysed from the perspective of HPWPs, considering as an antecedent of them, the leadership exercised by the hospital's top management. From this point on, the article begins by explaining organizational agility as a management criterion for hospital units in dealing with both external changes and internal needs. Next, the model is proposed, hypotheses are justified, and then the methodology and analysis of the results are presented. Finally, conclusions stemming from the study carried out in this article are described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational agility as a management criterion in hospital units</head><p>Agility is an organization's capacity to adapt to dynamic and turbulent environments, reducing threats and maximizing opportunities that can take place in new scenarios that arise <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Appelbaum et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baškarada and Koronios, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, agility is associated with concepts related to the organization's stability in the presence of changes, such as speed, flexibility, or the organization's capacity to respond <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Santos Bernardes and Hanna, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roberts and Grover, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The healthcare system is composed of a network of interrelated parts (primary care centres, hospitals, rehabilitation units…) that interact in a non-linear way at different levels (patient, family, medical centres, government), and they often produce undesired consequences (adverse reactions to treatments, re-hospitalizations…) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lipsitz, 2012)</ref>. This complexity justifies the need to implement organizational agility as a management criterion in hospital units, as state <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pipe et al. (2012)</ref>. Effectively, healthcare systems are human organizations that mix different professionals and disciplines, where cooperation and interdependence take precedence over individuality, and flexibility and adaptation over rigidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Martínez-García and Hernández-Lemus, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>ICUs represent areas of the hospital that offer integral care, seeking to improve patients' health with life-sustaining treatments, as well as providing palliative care at the end of life for a dignified death <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cook and Rocker, 2014)</ref>. This situation needs the teamwork of highly qualified professionals from different disciplines within the unit or from other units (pharmacies, x-rays, analytical, emergency ...) and/or out-of-hospital (other hospitals, service providers…) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Marshall et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Van der Sluijs et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, ICUs make intensive use of highly complex technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wikström et al., 2007)</ref> and so they are constantly dependent on technological innovations in order to improve the quality of the service. Thus, the study of ICUs to agile hospitals is justified by their complexity, dynamic nature, and dependence on internal and external resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of the human dimension in hospital agility</head><p>The active role of the human dimension in achieving organizational agility at the level of both management and the rest of the staff is widely mentioned in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Crocitto and Yousef, 2003)</ref>. Organizational agility produces important results in terms of economic and non-economic performance, including its impact on the attitudes of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sanadgol, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nafei, 2016)</ref>. This effect is even more relevant in ICUs, which typically involve a high level of human contact with considerable interaction among patients, relatives, and healthcare staff, especially physicians and nurses. Thus, due to the importance of healthcare personnel in the success of the ICU <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Nascimento et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Massaroli et al., 2015)</ref>, it is necessary to study how the human dimensionleadership and HPWPsinfluences the hospital's agility, as both an antecedent and an outcome of performance linked to the employee.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hospital leadership and HPWPs</head><p>Leadership is management's skill in providing guidance and vision, recognizing and encouraging individual abilities, and inspiring employees to make a commitment to achieving the organizational objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Idris and Ali, 2008)</ref>. In this regard, Al <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Harbi et al. (2019)</ref> state that leadership performs a key role on employees' attitudes toward the organizational goals.</p><p>Moreover, leadership formulates future visions, promotes their followers' innovation and creativity and improves employee motivation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McAlerney (2006)</ref> recognizes the importance of leadership development in the context of inherently complex healthcare organizations where leaders must respond to multiple stakeholders and different performance goals.</p><p>HPWPs describe a group of different but interrelated practices that select, develop, retain, and motivate employees, with the capacity to generate added value for the organization (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Luna-Arocas and Camps, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guthrie et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mihail and Kloutsiniotis, 2016)</ref>. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Selden and Sowa (2015)</ref> state that HPWPs reduce voluntary turnover and thereby increase service quality. Regarding the key aspects or dimensions demanded by current HRM, the HPWPs proposals are, for example, extensive continuous training, employees' participation and multidirectional communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Guthrie et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lee et al., 2012)</ref>. The adoption of HPWPs in the healthcare sector is recognized in literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mihail and Kloutsiniotis, 2016)</ref>. In this regard, the literature emphasizes the importance of effective management of healthcare personnel working in ICUs through training <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sandahl et al., 2013)</ref>, participation and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dorgham and Mahmoud, 2013)</ref>, and rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(James et al., 2015)</ref>, among others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gittell et al. (2010)</ref> state that HPWPs influence on quality and efficiency outcomes for patients by relational coordination. They suggest that these practices are predictors of relational coordination in order to achieve better clinical results in interdependent work contexts.</p><p>The study of how the effective leadership of hospital managers contributes positively to the HRM in ICUs constitutes a topic of research of growing interest in literature. In this regard, senior management should be committed to service quality and work collaboratively with all members of the organization. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hopkins et al. (2007)</ref> developed a respiratory ICU based on an improvement culture, which required substantial changes in patient care in ICU. In spite of being an innovative system for patients and hospital management, the unit received the necessary managerial support. In addition, hospital management could encourage innovation and improvement in ICUs. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bai et al. (2018)</ref> highlight the role of operational research/management science (OR/MS) in identifying efficient methods to manage the ICU to ensure quality of service. Consequently, hospital management must promote innovation culture and foster continuous training of new methods to improve ICU patient care <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hackner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Reader and Cuthbertson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Silva et al., 2018)</ref>. Likewise, hospital managers as effective leaders could influence employees and the work they perform in the UCI by increasing their participation in management. Thus, <ref type="bibr">Oerlemans et al. (2018)</ref> propose the use of the Delphi method, as a useful tool for hospital management, to identify critical attributes for care quality to patients in any hospital unit and especially in ICU. For example, meeting the needs of patients' families requires the capacity to listen to and support them. To this end, authors propose a sustained dialogue between ICU and hospital management on care quality provided to patients and relatives. Furthermore, hospital management could encourage staff participation in organizational plans and goals setting by developing working teams or committees, among others. From this perspective, <ref type="bibr">Parand et al. (2014)</ref> note that achieving quality outcomes in hospitals demands continuous management and intensive staff relationships. For example, hospital managers could promote ongoing coordination efforts between the Board and medical staff in establishing the organizational quality strategy. ICU is a service with special and complex needs and hospital managers need ICU personnel participation to determine plans, objectives and resources of this unit, as well as basic demands on other units to which they are directly related (e.g., pharmacy, laboratories). Recently, <ref type="bibr">Clay-Williams et al. (2019)</ref> advocate this idea and highlight the need to have a team of clinically influential leaders in hospital and ICU executive members to discuss the implementation of a new system in hospital. This system aimed to determine a set of rules to help make decisions in ICU, as well as to improve relations between patients, the surgery department and ICU. To achieve this goal, authors state that is necessary to enhance cohesion by using a multidisciplinary meeting to evaluate the status of ICU according to the plan.</p><p>In respect to the influence of leadership on the design of human resources practices (HRPs), the management literature provides some evidence. Pons-Verdú and Ramos-López (2012) point out that, these two concepts are closely related because the organization management has the responsibility to design the HRP. In this sense, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knies et al. (2018)</ref> show that frontline managers can make an important contribution to mission achievement by supporting implementation of HRPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Smith et al. (2015)</ref> emphasize the need for an effective leader in dynamic contexts to foster improvement and continuous change, and empower talent, motivate staff, and listen actively. In this regard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hodgetts (2011)</ref> states that effective leaders in hospital management should promote ongoing relationships with other organization members, thus encouraging staff participation. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Stockwell and Slonim (2006)</ref> argue the need for ICUs to have effective leaders in order to foster teamwork and engage health workers through strategies and goal achievement to improve the quality of patients' care and safety. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Martin et al. (2014)</ref>, in a study involving healthcare staff of ICUs, determine the need to have effective leaders who make a commitment to communicating and have a shared vision, contributing to greater collaboration and improvements in the quality of patients' care and safety. In this regard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lee et al. (2016)</ref> also refer to effective leadership when they allude to leadership capable of dealing with the environment and commitment to innovation and continuous improvement. They analyse the role of effective leadership in the hospital environment and use the term "hospital leadership", which we adopted in this research. From the above discussion, this study proposes in hypothesis H1 that hospital leadership influences on HPWPs design applied in ICUs.</p><p>H1 Hospital leadership positively and directly influences HPWPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HPWPs and employee satisfaction</head><p>The next hypothesis (H2) proposes a positive effect of HPWPs on employee satisfaction. As a conceptual basis for this premise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Macky and Boxall (2007)</ref> find that if the organization puts more HPWPs into effect, the employees are more satisfied. <ref type="bibr">Nazneen et al. (2018)</ref> empirically demonstrate that employees' personal satisfaction is positively correlated with HRPs like training, performance appraisal, team working, employee participation and compensation. In this regard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Li et al. (2019)</ref> point out that organizations must create a work environment that conveys to employees that they are valuable to the organization and taken into account by senior management. Thus, authors identify some HRPs such as continuous training, the employee's participation in work commissions and receiving performance evaluations, among others, to improve employee wellbeing. From <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhang et al. (2018)</ref>, it can be explained that when the organization invests in HRPs that benefit employees, they respond positively with positive behaviors and attitudes, such as employee satisfaction and organizational commitment. This reasoning finds theoretical support in Social Exchange Theory (SET) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Birtch et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zoller and Muldoon, 2019)</ref>, which states that employees will show a positive attitude towards the organization if he/she finds that the organization is beneficial to him/her. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brink et al. (2019)</ref> also theoretically and statistically confirm the influence of HPWPs on employee satisfaction. Thus, these authors find that higher employee involvement, higher promotion and career development, and more autonomy result in higher employees' personal satisfaction. Moreover, they establish that the relationships between HPWPs and organizational performance can be mediated by employee outcomes. The positive influence of HRPs on employees has also been justified in the literature on healthcare, based on the reciprocity of employee-employer relations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almaaitah et al., 2017)</ref>. Hence, the influence of HRP on employee attitudes in healthcare organizations finds meaningful academic support <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lee et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Zhang et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Fan et al., 2014)</ref>. Thus, Ogbonnaya and Validaze (2018) confirm the positive influence of HRPs on employee outcomes, such as personal satisfaction and employee engagement in healthcare. In the same vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vermeeren et al. (2014)</ref> empirically demonstrate the positive relationship between HRPs and organizational performance in healthcare sector, finding that employee satisfaction plays a fundamental role as a mediator variable in this relationship. However, the lack of studies about the effects of HPWPs on healthcare' personal satisfaction on ICUs justifies their analysis in this research. Moreover, when different studies highlight the role of ICU personnel in the service quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Oerlemans et al., 2018)</ref>. Taking the aforementioned studies as a reference, hypothesis H2 is formulated as follows:</p><p>H2 HPWPs positively and directly influence employees' personal satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hospital leadership and organizational agility</head><p>Today's organizations require proactive and sensitive managers with strong technical and relational capabilities. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Harraf et al. (2015)</ref> indicate that in agile structures, the leaders have a defined business vision and direction that the members of the organization are excited by and share. In the configuration of agile organizations, <ref type="bibr">Crocitto and Youssef (2003)</ref> point out that, leaders are essential in promoting organizational learning and acceptance of change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vinodh et al. (2012)</ref> add to this thesis that the type of management stimulates organizational agility. More specifically, they establish, for example, the need for a participative management style and the importance of employee awareness of management's objectives. In this regard, the latest version of the EFQM Excellence Model 2013 (EFQM, 2012) defends leadership as a key factor in the capacity to deal with situations of change and uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(EFQM, 2012)</ref>. Therefore, ICUs need effective leaders who are engaged and motivate others to act on changes and adverse environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Smith et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, because ICUs are interconnected areas in hospitals, they need overall effective support and cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Marshall et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, effective hospital leaders, as members of middle and top management and clinical professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Rotar et al., 2016)</ref>, play an important role in improving organizational agility to facilitate the work in ICUs. Hence, the hypothesis H3 is formulated as: H3 Hospital leadership positively and directly influences organizational agility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HPWPs and organizational agility</head><p>Regarding the positive impact of HRM in contexts that require agility, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sumukadas and Sawhney (2004)</ref> recommend several formulas, such as fostering employee training to deal with enriched and redesigned jobs and using systems of monetary and non-monetary incentives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Harraf et al. (2015)</ref> indicate that employees involved in decision-making show less resistance to the changes demanded of agile organizations. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mooghali, et al. (2016)</ref> recognize that hospitals need to be agile in order to respond to dynamic environments, and they show that HRP favour employees' agility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Patri and Suresh (2017)</ref> state that motivated employees, flexible workforce, cooperation between management and employees, training and implementation of employee's suggestion influence healthcare organization agility. In this regard, the complexity and dynamism of ICUs require organizational agility in order to ensure quality and patient safety. The ICU professional must always work quickly and effectively and make the right decisions in changing circumstances, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nascimento et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Massaroli et al. (2015)</ref>. Hence, we propose H4: H4 HPWPs positively and directly influence organizational agility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational agility and employee satisfaction</head><p>In general, employees feel more satisfied when the organization has the processes and methods to develop the products and services that satisfy the clients' changing needs. In this regard, the agility must satisfy not only the clients, but also the employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Melnik and Maurer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mohammadi et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mohammadi et al. (2015)</ref> point out that agile organizations increase employees' productivity and motivation. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Melnik and Maurer (2006)</ref> observe that in software development teams, among other factors, agile methods increase employees' personal satisfaction by improving communication among team members and with the customer, promoting continuous feedback and allowing developers to make decisions that affect them. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Labaf and Bigdelli (2015)</ref> state that there is a positive and significant impact of organizational agility on employee efficiency and satisfaction. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sanadgol (2014)</ref> finds a strong correlation between organizational agility (response capacity, competence, flexibility, and speed) and employee satisfaction, in the educational context. The lack of studies on the effects of organizational agility on UCI' personal satisfaction justifies their study in this work. If the results of these studies are extrapolated to our context, hypothesis H4 can be formulated in this way: H5 Organizational agility positively and directly influences employee satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and participants</head><p>This study was carried out in three ICUs of a Spanish public hospital, one for adults, one paediatric and one neonatal. In 2018, this Hospital had around 4,850 employees and 27,800 patients, and more than 22,600 surgical interventions were performed. The Intensive Care Service of the analysed hospital follows international quality standards and is accredited with ISO 9001. It has also received national and regional awards and recognition of the quality of its service. All of this confirms the suitability of the unit of analysis chosen. Following valid and accepted performance criteria, it represents a model to follow. The unit of analysis was ICUs personnel and the size of the population consisted of 324 individuals (14.5%, 48.8%, and 36.7% from the categories of doctors, nurses, and nurses' aides, respectively) who were invited to participate in the research. The sample had 248 individuals, with a sampling distribution by categories that was quite similar to that of the population (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), which guarantees its representativeness and assumes a sampling error of +3.08% at a 95.5% confidence interval. This sample size represents a response rate of 76.54%. The sample is characterized by being composed mainly of women (76.6%) between 36 and 50 years old (60.5%), with more than 10 years of experience in the profession (83.5%) and five years in ICU (75%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>To collect the information, a self-administered personal survey was used, with 7-point Likert scales (from 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree). A Delphi study was previously carried out with experts from the sector to assess the suitability of the scales proposed, and that a rigorous and comprehensive pre-test had been completed. The surveys were conducted in the workplace of the participants. In order to achieve the highest possible response rate, the members of the research team took responsibility for the fieldwork.</p><p>The items on the measurement scales are based on literature review and reflections of expert professionals. First, regarding the evaluation of the leader's role, she/he must firmly implement the corporative philosophy so that it is valued and followed by the entire hospital organization. In doing so, it is ideal for the personnel to participate in designing plans and setting objectives. Likewise, hospital managers have to be committed to service quality and a culture of innovation, encouraging continuous improvement and creativity in their employees in order to be prepared for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lakshman, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Idris and Ali, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lee et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the attributes included in this dimension are coherent with and based on the leadership philosophy and practices from the EFQM Excellence Model (2012), and they have recognized importance in the healthcare sector (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">West et al., 2015)</ref>. The HRM scale is composed of four types of practices <ref type="bibr">(training, participation, recognition, and communication)</ref>. Training is identified as an intensive system of formal training that collaborates in the employees' development process and covers technical and social skills (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guthrie et al., 2011)</ref>. Employees' participation evaluates their involvement in the company's information process, decision-making, and/or problem-solving activities and is based on authors as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gallie (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mihail and Kloutsiniotis (2016)</ref>, among others.</p><p>Recognition is related to a stimulation and compensation scheme for the effort of the individual or group <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Elmadağ and Ellinger, 2017)</ref>. Finally, communication analyses if the organization share business information (plans, objectives, mission…) across different structural levels, as stated <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guthrie et al. (2011)</ref>.</p><p>In the organizational agility scale, it was considered advisable to include aspects such as the organizational capacity to predict and respond quickly to changes (patient evolution, technological development, demand peaks…). To develop this scale, proposals by different authors were considered, such as those by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sharifi and Zhang (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sherehiy et al. (2007)</ref>,</p><p>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roberts and Grover (2012)</ref>. In addition, studies were reviewed that analyse agility in hospitals and ICUs, although it is a relatively unexplored area, especially the studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bottani (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pipe et al.

This scale aimed to measure ICUs personnel's feelings about their work and performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Before testing the hypotheses, it is necessary to analyse the dimensionality and psychometric properties of the measurement scales used to evaluate the constructs in the proposed model:</p><p>(1) the application of HPWPs (HR), (2) the leadership by Hospital management (LEADER),</p><p>(3) the Hospital's agility as an organization (AGIL), and (4) the healthcare personnel's satisfaction with the job (EMPSATIS). To do so, confirmatory factorial analyses (CFA) were performed using the maximum likelihood estimation method.</p><p>To test the hypotheses, SEM models were used as the maximum likelihood estimation method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the dimensionality and validity of the measurement scales</head><p>The final HR measurement model is a second-order construct composed of four dimensions .08] because it presents higher significance levels and fit indexes, confirming that the scale is not one-dimensional. In fact, the chi-squared analysis of differences reveals significant differences (Dif. χ2=752.26, Dif. df=4, p=0.000).</p><p>Even though this model is statistically significant [χ2(86)=229.21, p=0.000], it should be pointed out that the chi-squared statistic depends on sample size, and so it is necessary to analyse other fit indicators. In this regard, the results show that other global fit indexes of the model fall within the values recommended by the literature (CFI=0.95, NFI=0.92, TLI=0.93, RMSEA=0.08), leading to the conclusion that the specified model adequately reproduces the observed covariance matrix. This model shows a satisfactory fit because the CFI lies between 0.90 and 0.95, and the RMSEA value does not exceed the maximum recommended value of 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mathieu and Taylor, 2006)</ref>. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows, the model has acceptable individual reliability because the relationship between each item and its respective dimension is statistically significant, and most of the standardized regression weights are above 0.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that the specified models adequately reproduce the observed covariance matrix. Moreover, the individual reliabilities, the composite reliabilities, the variances extracted, and the Cronbach's alphas are satisfactory (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Appendix 1 shows all the variables and final items for each of the scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis testing</head><p>To test the hypotheses, the sample size restrictions recommended treating the dimensions of the HR construct as observed variables, and so four new variables were created based on the results of the CFA. These variables correspond to the weighted means of the items that make up each dimension, weighted by the regression weights for each of them in the CFA.</p><p>The results of the SEM model, included in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, indicate that the model is excellent [χ2(50)=211.56, p=0.000; CFI=0.96; NFI=0.93; TLI=0.94; RMSEA=0.08] because the CFI value is above 0.95, and RMSEA does not exceed 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mathieu and Taylor 2006)</ref>.</p><p>These results allow us to draw the following conclusions:</p><p>• Hospital management's leadership positively and significantly influences the application of HPWPs (ß=0.878, p=0.000), explaining 77.1% of the variability in the application of these practices in the ICU. Therefore, hypothesis H1 can be supported.</p><p>• Both hospital leadership and the application of HPWPs bring agility to the organization (ß=0.537, p=0.000 and ß=0.347, p=0.003, respectively), explaining 73.6% of its variability.</p><p>Therefore, hypotheses H3 and H4 can be supported.</p><p>• Finally, the application of both HPWPs and organizational agility positively and significantly influences the healthcare personnel's satisfaction with their work (ß=0.274, p=0.050 and ß=0.287, p=0.033, respectively), explaining 28.7% of the variability. Therefore, hypotheses H2 and H5 are supported.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>The main contribution of this study was to measure the role of the human dimensionleadership and HPWPs-on organizational agility of hospital management in complex, uncertain environments, which is of particular importance in ICUs. The results obtained in this study support the importance of the human dimension in organizational agility, validating the proposed model. Thus, this research supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Liang et al. (2018)</ref>'s premise on the role of the human dimension on organizational agility in public sector.</p><p>First, results show that, in hospital hospital leaders play an important role in the design of HRP in ICUs. This confirms the findings of similar studies in other contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tarí et al., 2007)</ref>. As a recommendation, a medical chief of staff can and must propose certain training courses for the members of his/her team. Second, there is also a positive and direct impact of HPWPs on the satisfaction of ICU personnel. This hypothesis, confirmed specifically in ICUs, supports the results from previous studies in hospitals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ang et al., 2013)</ref> and healthcare service (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vermeeren et al., 2014)</ref> from a global perspective.</p><p>Third, the relationship between leadership and organizational agility has been shown.</p><p>This research shows the need for enthusiastic, effective, and proactive leaders who are committed to quality, continuous improvement, and innovation. In addition, hospital managers should engage personnel in the establishment of hospital objectives and plans.</p><p>Thus, innovation culture promotes a proactive management attitude and a greater capacity to predict and adapt to future changes in environment.</p><p>Fourth, results also recognize the effect of HPWPs on organizational agility (e.g., Nijssen and Paauwe, 2012 This effect is relevant because, although it has not been broadly studied at an academic level, it helps to explain the fact that workers feel more satisfied with their work when they perceive that the hospital is agile and responds quickly and flexibly to dynamic contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>Regarding the practical implications of the results obtained, hospital leaders should show intense concern and a positive attitude towards quality, ongoing improvement, and innovation. However, it is essential the development of HPWPs that are coherent with the organizational philosophy that management defends. Specifically, hospital leaders must orient training, participation, recognition, and communication towards excellence as a goal for everyone. As a result, hospital management will be able to increase organizational agility, that is, its capacity to adapt to the challenges and opportunities of the environment and respond better to the demands and needs of the healthcare system and society in general. This </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and limitations</head><p>The present study shows that the human dimension in hospitals, and specifically in ICU, contributes to organizational agility. Thus, the leader's effort to have a proactive and participative organization, fostering quality, ongoing improvement, and innovation in processes and services, is decisive in increasing the hospital's capacity when facing contexts of change. In addition, from the perspective of ICU personnel, HPWPs positively influenced by the leader's role also favour organizational agility. Likewise, organizational agility influences the attitudes of ICU personnel -doctors and nursing-, exerting a positive impact on employee satisfaction. These results contribute to addressing the argument by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ramanujan and Rousseau (2006)</ref> that the new challenges in hospital management are organizational rather than just clinical. The main limitation is that the data were collected from three ICUs in one public hospital.

With regard to the internal consistency measures of each dimension and the global construct, the composite reliability (CR) indicator reaches values above 0.70, and the average variance extracted (AVE) values are above 0.50.

The final measurement models for LEADER, AGIL, and EMPSATIS are onedimensional and composed of 3, 4, and 4 items, respectively.

It should be noted that all the practices analysed influence organizational agility, but communication, acceptance, and understanding of organizational objectives and values are fundamental to the daily work of ICU personnel. In turn, implementing HRPs and greater organizational agility will lead to making healthcare professionals more satisfied with the work they do. Although all HRPs influence the satisfaction of ICU personnel, the ones with the most positive correlations are training and participation. For this reason, hospital management is advised to promote the development of the technical and social skills and competencies required by healthcare personnel and foster teamwork and multidisciplinary collaboration in the ICU work system.</figDesc></figure>

In other words, HRPs such as training, participation, recognition, and communication, it positively contributes to improving hospital agility. For example, staff members who receive training to deal with critical situations, are involved in decision-making, and feel valued become intangible assets and contribute to effective hospital management in changing and uncertain contexts. This result constitutes an original and significant contribution to literature due to it analyses a clinically very complex unit that affects hospital management. Indeed, ICUs are key organizational units within the hospital system so that if care quality in ICU is deficient it affects other departments(Oerlemans et   al., 2018). Moreover, the high interdependence of the ICU with other units may generate a poor interdepartmental coordination, problems with hospital functioning and, therefore, poor resilience to changing conditions (e.g., problems between ICUs and emergency areas)(Clay-  Williams et al., 2019). Thus, enhancing HRPs which train, empower and motivate ICU personnel contribute to improve unit performance and hospital system. Finally, it is important to highlight the impact of organizational agility on healthcare personnel satisfaction in ICUs.</figDesc><table /></figure>

In order to do so, the degree of correlation between each of its dimensions with both constructs was determined through Pearson's correlation coefficient r (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The results clearly indicate that all the practices have a positive relationship with both constructs. However, these results reveal that, related to organizational agility, communication has the highest correlation (r = 0.682), followed by the other three dimensions with similar levels, ranging from 0.545-0.577. In this regard, these data reveal the importance of knowing and sharing the strategic direction, objectives, and values of both the hospital and its specific work area for ICUs personnel at all times. On the one hand, in ICUs it is important to be continuously informed about organizational priorities, especially when working in contexts of uncertainty in patient care <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Smith et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Marshall et al., 2017)</ref>.
