<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose -This research aims to investigate responsible environmental behavior intention of travelers formed upon visiting ecotourism sites in Indonesia. Nowadays, ecotourism has become a popular concept of tourism in Indonesia due to its rich potential of natural and cultural resources. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that not all travelers visiting ecotourism objects demonstrate positive environmental behavior. Several previous studies have already revealed that travelers' behavior may alter after visiting tourism sites. Unfortunately, there has not been much discussion on travelers' positive behavior formed after visiting an ecotourism site. In this research, four variables regarded as significant in shaping responsible environmental behavior intention included destination image, trip quality, perceived value, and satisfaction. Design/Methodology -This research applied a survey method. The research sample consisted of travelers who had visited ecotourism sites in Indonesia, while the number of respondents amounted to 210 travelers. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was selected as the technique of analysis. Finding -This research confirmed that five proposed hypotheses were supported. Hence, this study clearly contributes to the development of the theory and concept of ecotourism useful for practitioners associated with ecotourism activities. Originality of the research -Research on ecotourism in developing countries has not been much done. Similarly, the research on ecotourism related to intention to behave environmentally responsible is still not much to investigate, while the ecotorurism activities in Indonesia began in earnest. Therefore, research is expected to contribute ideas and implementation of ecotourism in developing countries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In many countries, tourism industry has greatly contributed to the countries' economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bajpai and Lee 2015)</ref>. Similarly, a wide variety of natural and cultural resources in Indonesia has become one of the favorite destinations for both domestic and international tourists. According to Central Bureau of Statistics Indonesia, the number of tourist arrivals in Indonesia reached more than 8 million in 2012, an increase of 5.16% from the previous year, with the majority originated from countries within short to medium distance, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China and Japan. Furthermore, an increase also occurred in the average spending of visiting tourists staying for more than one week at US$1,118 per head. These indicate that Indonesian tourism is in the growth phase and has great potential since there are many resources in Indonesia that have not been exploited and many of which are not able to be exported <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nirwandar 2013)</ref>.</p><p>However, the utilization of cultural and natural resources for tourism sector could also lead to several disadvantages, such as loss or destruction of biological authenticity of these resources. As a result, it may negatively affect the sustainability of tourism industry in the future. To reduce the negative impacts, marketing activities of cultural and natural resources for tourism need to develop a new method with little impact on the culture and environment.</p><p>Green marketing or environmental marketing, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Polonsky (1994)</ref>, consists of all activities designed to generate and facilitate any exchanges intended to meet the needs or desires of travelers with little adverse impact on the natural environment. Thus, green marketing can be defined as a holistic management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying the needs of customers and society in a way that is profitable and sustainable. The concepts of green marketing, moreover, have a very broad meaning, one of which can be applied to industrial goods and even service marketing. The application of green marketing in tourism services is known as ecotourism. As an example, many tourism sites in the world nowadays have promoted themselves as ecotourist facilities specializing in natural exploration or operating in a new mode that minimizes its negative impacts on the environment <ref type="bibr">(May 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ingram and Durst 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Troumbis 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Covering a large territory populated with a variety of endemic animal and plant species along with tribal and distinctive culture that inhabit the region, Indonesia has a great opportunity to create ecotourism to develop its tourism industry. Based on the Data Protection and Nature Conservation in 2012 reported by the World Travel Tourism Council (WTTC), the average growth of ecotourism was 10% per year. The figure was higher than the average growth per year for tourism in general, ie by 4.6% per year. It indicates that ecotourism in Indonesia still has large potential for the economy.</p><p>In addition, ecotourism, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Valentine (1993)</ref>, is defined as "nature based tourism that is ecologically sustainable and is based on relatively undisturbed natural areas; is non-damaging and non-degrading; provides a direct contribution to the continued protection and management of protected areas used; and is subject to an adequate and appropriate management regime". Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wight (1993)</ref> defines ecotourism as an enlightening nature travel experience that contributes to conservation of the ecosystem, while respecting the integrity of host communities. Based on such understanding, ecotourism has several important aspects, namely nature conservation activities, cultural integrity, education, contribution to the improvement of the local economy and a source of funding for nature conservation activities. In other words, ecotourism activities emphasize on the natural conservation of tourist sites as well as environmental awareness. Therefore, visitors need to obey local regulations and avoid damage to the natural environment through their responsible environmental behavior.</p><p>Unfortunately, it cannot be denied that not all travelers who visit ecotourism sites demonstrate positive environmental behavior because they are only attracted to the natural resources in the area. Several studies on the visitors of ecotourism also note some differences between the behavior of travelers who care about the environment and the behavior of those who have the intention to visit <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kerstetter, Hou and Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tangeland 2011). Hedlund, Marell, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Garling (2012)</ref> explain further that travelers who care about the environment will concern more with perceived sustainability of the nature in choosing a travel destination, which is also influenced by gender, education, age and income. Meanwhile, the description of goals, motivations and attitudes can be used to predict future behavior intentions and different attitudes of travelers visiting ecotourism sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Luo and Deng 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wurzinger and Johansson 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The concepts of ecotourism, furthermore, emphasize on sustainable development of environment as well as responsible behavior towards the environment as nature conservation mechanisms. Therefore, if the intention of visiting does not reflect positive environmental behavior, it will not attain the purpose of ecotourism activities itself, but even damage the environment, instead. By means of responsible behavior towards the environment, travelers are expected to be able to restrict their damaging behavior toward environment, such as littering during the tour, capturing live animals at the sights, damaging the vegetation and so forth <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chiu, Lee and Chen 2014)</ref>. Additionally, responsible behavior towards the environment, according to Chiu, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lee and Chen (2014)</ref>, is strongly influenced by the travelers' perception prior to their visit and their experience during ecotourism activities. Consequently, the growth of responsible behavior towards the environment will indirectly increase the number of visits to ecotourism sites. Thus far, there have been relatively few researches on responsible environmental behavior in ecotourism since most researches consider environmental responsible behavior as a generic nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lee 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vaske and Kobrin 2001)</ref>. Several previous researches on ecotourism, moreover, also consider responsible environmental behavior intention as a generic nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lee 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vaske and Kobrin 2001)</ref>. However, those studies have not comprehensively analyzed responsible environmental behavior intention as a result of changes in behavior.</p><p>Many researchers actually have suggested that tourist behavior may alter as experience received as stated in expectancy theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cole 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lee, Graefe, and Burns 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lin et al. 2003)</ref>. Accordingly, in addition to developing the research previously conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chiu, Lee and Chen (2014)</ref>, this research also aims to analyze responsible environmental behavior intention based on expectancy theory. If previous researches discussed responsible environmental behavior intention using perceived value and satisfaction as antecedent variables, this research attempts to add destination image and trip quality variables as stated in a research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Tsai (2007)</ref>. Hence, this study further analyzed the results of the research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chiu, Lee and Chen (2014)</ref> regarding the antecedents of responsible environmental behavior intention. Finally, further researches are expected to add other variables, such as intention to return for another visit because travelers who are satisfied with the experience gained from ecotourism activities can be predicted to revisit the area of ecotourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Han et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prendergast and Ho 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ryu et al. 2008)</ref>. The following sections further disscus the literature review and proposed hypotheses, research methods, analysis and discussion, and conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND CONCEPTUAL MODEL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Green Marketing</head><p>Green marketing is also defined as all activities designed to generate and facilitate any exchanges intended to satisfy human needs or desires with minimal adverse impacts on the natural environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Polonsky 2011)</ref>. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Stanton and Futrell (1987)</ref> define green or environmental marketing as actions intended to replace current needs and wants with minimal harmful impact on our environment.</p><p>Research on environmental responsibility has been started in the 1970s and 1980s, when a few consumers realized the serious impact of products on the environment. The research topics at the time were much related to energy conservation and politic activism. Research on consumer behavior has also appeared with greater frequency in recent years. The 1990s has been identified as the 'decade of the environment' or as 'the Earth decade'. During this decade, social and environmental problems had significantly influenced purchasing decisions of consumers. Therefore, environmental concerns and consumer demands for green products can be considered as the factors driving the rise of green marketing, which aims to achieve a balance between the objectives of sales and profits as well as the environmental concerns of the community. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rahbar and Wahid (2011)</ref> argued that applying the green marketing tools plays an essential role to switch consumer's actual purchasing behavior to buy environmental friendly products, therefore, reduce the negative impact of synthetic products on the environment.</p><p>The concept of green marketing, in fact, has been established at least since the first Earth Day in 1970. Even though environmental problem was reported as one of the top concerns among the public at the time, the growth of green marketing was still disappointing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wong et al. 1996)</ref>. However, an increase in the public interest towards the environment later on has triggered an increase in the demand for greener products. Consequently, manufacturers have started to provide and label hundreds of new products that are environmentally friendly. <ref type="bibr">Meller and Ham (2012)</ref> describe that green marketing implies cooperation between suppliers and sellers, partners as well as rivals, in order to achieve environmentally sustainable development throughout the entire value chain, while at the same time, it internally calls for the cooperation of all business functions in finding the best possible solutions for two major guiding principles: profit and long-term, positive contributions to the environment (society and the natural surrounding).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Ecotourism</head><p>Ecotourism, based on NEAP (Nature and Ecotourism Accreditation Programs), is ecologically sustainable tourism whose primary focus is to experience natural areas that foster enviromental and cultural understanding, appreciation and conservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Crabtree et al. 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Meller and Ham (2012)</ref> conclude that ecotourism represents a tourism industry form realized in cooperation with the nature. Meanwhile, the Ecotourism Society defines Ecotourism as a responsible trip to natural areas that conserve the environment and improve the welfare of local communities.</p><p>Ecotourism can also be defined as nature-based travel that is ecologically sustainable; as a result, it will not destruct natural areas, or diminish the authenticity of the environment. Instead, it will contribute directly to enhance protection and management of protected areas and obey the management regime adequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Valentine 1993)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Young (1992)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bјӧrk (2000)</ref> describes Ecotourism as an Ecotourism is tourism to natural areas that fosters environmental understanding, appreciation and conservation and sustains the culture and well-being of local communities. Based on those definitions, ecotourism can be defined based on three perspectives, namely as (1) products, (2) market, and (3) development approach. As a product, ecotourism is all the attractions based on natural resources. As a market, ecotourism is a journey that is directed towards environmental conservation efforts. Meanwhile, as an approach to development, ecotourism is a method of resource utilization and management of environmentally friendly tourism. As a result, tourist activities in ecotourism must concern with the welfare of the local communities as well as the protection of the environment. Accordingly, the parties involved in ecotourism are not only tourists, but also tourism stakeholders who must facilitate travelers to demonstrate their responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Damanik, et al. 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Destination Image</head><p>Destination image is defined as a person's mental representation of knowledge, feelings and overall perceptions of a tourist destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crompton 1979)</ref>. Destination image can also be defined as overall perceptions of tourists toward a tourist destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fakeye and Crompton 1991)</ref> or as a mental representation of the area <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alhemoud and Armstrong 1996)</ref>. Additionally, destination image, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Tsai (2007)</ref>, is a subjective perception of travelers to the reality of a tourist destination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Trip Quality</head><p>Trip quality can be obtained with service quality approach. The attributes of service quality, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry (1985)</ref>, are reliability, empathy, formity, warranties, and reponsitivity. Since service is intangible, customers always need quality assurance given by the providers to reduce uncertainty of services rendered <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Etzel, Bruce, and William 2001)</ref>. As a result, in terms of tourism, service quality or trip quality refers to the travelers' assessments on the standards of services related to travel experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Tsai 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Perceived Value</head><p>Perceived value concerns with consumers' feeling upon buying a product or service, by comparing the input to the received output <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zeithaml 1988)</ref>. Perceived value, according to <ref type="bibr">Bolton and Drew (1991)</ref>, can also be defined as value caused by a difference between service expected by consumers and service that have been accepted by consumers related to the value incurred by consumers. Value obtained then reflects the value received and the costs incurred by consumers, both tangible and intangible products accepted, as well as a combination of quality, service and price <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kotler and Keller 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In tourism literature, perceived value, moreover, is often interpreted as a personal evaluation of the characteristics of tourism products, such as service quality, price, emotion, and social factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Petrick, 2004)</ref>. These factors determine whether the value of a product is suitable for consumption and affects tourist satisfaction after traveling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Tsai, 2007)</ref>. In short, perceived value refers to travelers' assessment in general to the net value of a trip based on the benefits obtained and the costs compensated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6.">Satisfaction</head><p>Satisfaction deals with cognitive differences between expectations and actual services after customers make a purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Oliver 1977)</ref>. In the context of tourism, satisfaction can be measured from tourists' expectations as well as their actual formation of positive feeling to reach tourist destinations during or after the process of tourism consumption (Bosque and Martin 2008). Similarly, satisfaction, according to Tain- <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Cole and Cromption (2003)</ref>, can reflect psychological output generated by positive experiences during a tour. Therefore, positive satisfaction as stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Davis, Le, and Coy (2011)</ref> can trigger behavior to protect the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7.">Responsible Environmental Behavior Intention</head><p>Responsible environmental behavior intention, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cottrell and Graefe (1997)</ref>, is a reflection of individual attention to the environment, commitment and ecological knowledge. Meanwhile, Thapa (2010) defines responsible environmental behavior intention as a manifestation of political actions, recycling, education, green consumption and social activities. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kang and Moscardo (2006)</ref> proposes responsible environmental behavior intention to be regarded as a consequence of environmental care in line with appropriate norms in the area of ecotourism. Consequently, travelers are expected to search for information about the destination before departure and obey the prevailing norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.">Interrelationship between Research Variables</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.1.">Destination Image on Trip Quality</head><p>Destination image can generally be considered as as a key aspect to tourists' decisionmaking process <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Palacio and Martin 2004)</ref>. Additionally, destination image can positively affect experience, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions of tourists in the future <ref type="bibr">(Bignȇ et al. 2001)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee (2011)</ref> reveals that someone who perceive destination's image to be high will have positive experience during the trip, which then indirectly affects the level of his or her satisfaction and behavior intention. In conclusion, destination image is an important factor that affects experience at a tourist spot (trip quality).</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Destination image has positive significant effect on trip quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.2.">Trip Quality on Perceived Value</head><p>Trip quality, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Tsai (2007)</ref>, can be defined as assessment of travelers to the standards of services related to travel experiences. Meanwhile, perceived value is assessment of travelers in general to the net value of a trip based on the benefits obtained and the cost compensated. Hence, trip quality is the antecedent of perceived value. Similarly, previous studies show that service quality is the antecedent of perceived value owned by travelers, consequently, service quality can make a significant impact on the perceived value of travelers <ref type="bibr">(Sweeney, Soutar and Johnson 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bolton and Drew 1991)</ref>. Another research also shows that service quality is one of the important variables that affects the perceived value of visitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lovelock and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wirtz 2011). Bojanic (1996)</ref>, moreover, also states that trip quality is one of the factors that determine the perceived value of travelers.</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Trip quality has positive significant effect on perceived value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.3.">Trip Quality on Satisfaction</head><p>Trip quality is a significant predictor for measuring customer satisfaction in order to form behavior intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cronin and Taylor 1992)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Ryu and Hand (2006)</ref> also state that trip quality can affect satisfaction, and positive satisfaction can trigger both intention to revisit and positive word-of-mouth behavior.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Trip quality has positive significant effect on satisfaction,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.4.">Perceived Value on Satisfaction</head><p>Perceived value in tourism literature is often defined as a personal evaluation of the characteristics of tourism products, such as service quality, price, emotion and social factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Petrick 2004</ref>).Accordingly, these factors determine whether the value of a product is suitable for consumption and affects travelers' satisfaction after the trip <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Tsai 2007)</ref>. In other words, perceived value is a strong predictor in determining satisfaction. Similarly, a research conducted by Chiu, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lee and Chen (2014)</ref> shows that perceived value of ecotourism is based on cost paid and benefits obtained according to consumption calculus.</p><p>Hypothesis 4: Perceived value has positive significant effect on satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8.5.">Satisfaction on Responsible Environmental Behavior Intention</head><p>Satisfaction in ecotourism, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Orams (1995)</ref>, is highly dependent on the experience gained during tourism activities, and satisfaction generated from positive experience can trigger changes in behavior. Similarly, Ballanytne and Packer's study <ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref> shows that experiencing direct contact with the natural environment in ecotourism sites can stimulate satisfaction and a sense of excitement for the travelers; consequently, it has a potential to improve tourist understanding toward the natural environment and then alter their attitudes and behavior. In short, when travelling generates positive feelings, knowledge about the environment will increase, which eventually trigger responsible environmental behavior intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chiu, Lee and Chen 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Satisfaction has positive significant effect on responsible environmental behavior intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Identification and Operational Definition of Variables</head><p>Destination image variable is a subjective perspective of travelers on ecotourism site <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Tsai 2007)</ref>. Perceived value variable is assessment of travelers in general to the net value of a trip based on what benefits gained and what has been sacrificed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Tsai 2007)</ref>. Trip quality variable is assessment of travelers to the standards of services related to travel experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Tsai 2007)</ref>. Satisfaction variable, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kotler and Keller (2016)</ref>, is happy or disappointed feeling experienced by customers after comparing the experiences gained to their expectations. Responsible environmental behavior intention variable is a positive attitude of travelers towards ecotourism area after taking part in ecotourism activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chiu, Lee and Chen 2014)</ref>. Measurement of each indicator on those variables in this research was conducted by using Likert scale of five levels, namely 1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = undecided; 4 = agree; and 5 = strongly agree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Sampling Design and Data Analysis Technique</head><p>Sample unit in this research is an individual, namely travelers in ecotourism sites in Indonesia. The sampling technique used in this study is purposive sampling. The number of respondents was 210 travelers, there are 103 female and 107 male..Data were collected through questionnaires to respondent and analyzed using a SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). Meanwhile, the results of the discriminant validity tests revealed that the magnitude of Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for all constructs of this research was more than 0.50. It denoted that the model had well convergent validity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Reliability Test</head><p>Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, it is apparent that all of the variables had a construct reliability value of more than 0.70, which indicates that the five variables in this research had good reliability. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Normality and Outlier Tests</head><p>All of those indicators exhibited a normal distribution since the critical ratio skewness value was below 2.58. Meanwhile, the results of outlier test in this research indicate mahalanobis distance. If mahalanobis value is greater than the values of the freedom degree in Chi-square table, it suggests that the number of indicator variables is at the level of significance of P &lt;0.001, and those variables will be considered outliers. In this research, the value obtained was 45.32 (df: 20, p &lt;0.001). It means that there was no outlier data.</p></div>

This finding is also supported by a research conducted by <ref type="bibr">Bignȇ et al.

Correspondingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lee et al. (2005)</ref> state that a person who has a high image destination will obtain positive experience during the trip, which then indirectly affects the level of his/her satisfaction and responsible environmental behavior intention. Therefore, when image destination is constructed as a high and good one, trip quality offered by ecotourism must also be high and good in order to meet the standards and expectations perceived by travelers.</p><p>As confirmed by those studies, destination image has two important roles in the study of behavior. First, destination image can influence decision-making process. Second, destination image can also condition behavior after the decision-making process, such as participation (earned on-site experience), evaluation (satisfaction), and behavior intentions in the future (intention to return and willingness to recommend) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashworth and Goodall 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bigne et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cooper, Flethcher, Gilbert, and Wanhill 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lee et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mansfeld 1992</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, this research also revealed that travelers have a good perception towards ecotourism upon gaining experience and assessment of the sightseeing trip (trip quality). Similarly, Bojanic's study <ref type="bibr">(1996)</ref> shows that trip quality is one of the factors determining travelers' perceived value since their experience will directly affect their impression; consequently, they will reconsider whether or not to return for a visit. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Tsai (2007)</ref> state that trip quality concerns with travelers' assessment of the standard of services related to their travel experiences. Meanwhile, perceived value refers to travelers' assessment in general toward the net value of a trip based on the assessment on the benefit obtained and the cost compensated. In other words, trip quality is the antecedent of perceived value. Several researches have also confirmed that service quality is the antecedent of travelers' perceived value, and it will make a significant impact on the perceived value <ref type="bibr">(Sweeney, Soutar and Johnson 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bolton and Drew 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, this study revealed that travelers have high satisfaction after assessing trip quality. Several researches on service quality and satisfaction thathave identified that those two concepts are closely related to behavior intention in the future. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cronin and Taylor (1992)</ref> highlight that service quality is a significant predictor for measuring travelers' satisfaction that will trigger behavior intention. Therefore, when travelers have good experience in a tourist site, they are willing to recommend it to others. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen and Tsai (2007)</ref> also state that experience received by travelers about a tourist site not only will affect their impression about the site, but will also increase their desire to return and recommend it to others.</p><p>Based on these results, is apparent that perceived value has a positive and significant impact on satisfaction, as supported by Chiu, Lee and Chen's study (2014) emphasizing that perceived value of ecotourism is based on cost paid and benefits obtained measured by the calculus of consumption. As a result, when ecotourism organizers can provide a service that meets travelers' needs, positive perceptions towards ecotourism will be formed, which eventually trigger tourist satisfaction. In addition, perceived value is often defined as a personal evaluation of the characteristics of tourism products, such as service quality, price, emotion and social factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Petrick 2004</ref>). These factors determine whether the value of a product is fit for consumption and can affect tourist satisfaction upon traveling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen and Tsai 2007)</ref>. In short, these studies have shown that perceived value is a strong predictor in determining satisfaction.</p><p>Finally, this study revealed that satisfaction could positively and significantly affect responsible environmental behavior intention. Therefore, when travelers feel happy and satisfied with ecotourism, their responsible environmental behavior intention will emerge with a high value. Although the original purpose of travelers visiting ecotourism locations is merely for a walk, enjoying a new atmosphere and relaxing, they will feel more satisfied, pay more respect and care for the environment when they participate in the activities organized. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Orams (1995)</ref> states that satisfaction on ecotourism is highly dependent on experience gained while doing tourist activities; consequently, satisfiying experience can generate changes in behavior. Ballanytne and Packer (2011) also explain that experience of ecotourism area not only provides travelers with the opportunity to make direct contact with the natural environment, but also give them the feeling of satisfaction and pleasure. As a results, it will improve their understanding of the natural environment and then trigger changes in their attitudes and behavior. Correspondingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Otto and Ritchie (1996)</ref> assert that satisfaction is a subjective feeling experienced by the tourists upon visiting a place, including emotional response to the location, which then generates an understanding of the location as well as an appreciation toward the environment. Its similar with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anisimov and Ryzhenkov (2014)</ref> that implementing ecotourism programmes does not have a commercial or educational impact, but also a social effect, especially important when it comes to communities of indigenous people and minorities whose rights require protection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This research is expected to provide valuable contribution to improve the management of Ecotourism regions in inducing positive future behavior among travelers to concern more about the environment. By doing so, travelers are expected to obey regulations during their return visit to the area of ecotourism. The results of the study revealed that there are many variables affecting this behavior, such as trip quality, perceived value, destination image and tourist satisfaction. In order to improve tourist satisfaction, the management is required to support the development of tourism area by increasing the quality of standard attributes, such as accessibility, tourist attraction, tourist activities and maintainance for local residents helping the preservation of mangrove forests. Therefore, road access as infrastructure as well as other tourist objects of the Tourism Region needs to be maintained and developed, such as by promoting mangrove-patterned batik, outbound locations, etc.</p><p>In addition, services that can influence the perceptions of travelers is also considered very important since services can positively and indirectly affect the increase in environmentally responsible behavior intention, and encourage public awareness on the importance of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chiu, Lee and Chen 2014)</ref>. Next, constructing a good destination image of the ecotourism is highly essential since this variable is the initial factor that affects other variables. Therefore, the existence of ecotourism is expected to give better contribution to the future of Indonesian regional tourisms in general. Finally, human resources as a major asset in an organization also need to be improved since capabilities, skills and knowledge of tourism service providers has significant roles in the success of ecotourism. Hence, to win the competition in the tourism sector, the huge potential of Indonesian ecotourism as one of the world tourism destinations needs to be improved, especially its human resources.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Convergent validity test was conducted by assessing the loading factors that reflect the relation between each statement item and latent variables.
