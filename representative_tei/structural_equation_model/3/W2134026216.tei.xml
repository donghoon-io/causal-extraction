<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Metabolic Syndrome (MetSyn), which is a clustering of traits including insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia, is estimated to have a substantial genetic component, yet few specific genetic targets have been identified. Factor analysis, a sub-type of structural equation modeling (SEM), has been used to model the complex relationships in MetSyn. Therefore, we aimed to define the genetic determinants of MetSyn in the Framingham Heart Study (Offspring Cohort, Exam 7) using the Affymetrix 50 k Human Gene Panel and three different approaches: 1) an association-based "one-SNPat-a-time" analysis with MetSyn as a binary trait using the World Health Organization criteria; 2) an association-based "one-SNP-at-a-time" analysis with MetSyn as a continuous trait using second-order factor scores derived from four first-order factors; and, 3) a multivariate SEM analysis with MetSyn as a continuous, second-order factor modeled with multiple putative genes, which were represented by latent constructs defined using multiple SNPs in each gene. Results were similar between approaches in that CSMD1 SNPs were associated with MetSyn in Approaches 1 and 2; however, the effects of CSMD1 diminished in Approach 3 when modeled simultaneously with six other genes, most notably CETP and STARD13, which were strongly associated with the Lipids and MetSyn factors, respectively. We conclude that modeling multiple genes as latent constructs on first-order trait factors, most proximal to the gene's function with limited paths directly from genes to the second-order MetSyn factor, using SEM is the most viable approach toward understanding overall gene variation effects in the presence of multiple putative SNPs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The Metabolic Syndrome (MetSyn) is a clustering of metabolic disturbances that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of other complex diseases, including cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. MetSyn is estimated to affect over 47 million adult Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> and is becoming increasingly more prevalent worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Although MetSyn has been shown to increase with age, recent studies have shown a rise in this disease among younger people in the U.S., particularly in women 20 to 39 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Interestingly, this rise mirrors the increasing rates of obesity in women of these ages.</p><p>Although it is well established that MetSyn involves the co-occurrence of multiple metabolic traits, there are differences in the formal definitions set forth by the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP III), the American Heart Association/ National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), predominantly in defining the most relevant elements and their biological cut-points, which has contributed to confusion in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Nevertheless, all of these definitions include criteria on four common traits: 1) insulin resistance, 2) obesity, 3) hypertension, and 4) dyslipidemia. Factor analysis, a statistical method under the umbrella of structural equation modeling (SEM), has been used, albeit sparingly, to help define the critical elements and structure of the syndrome. Studies conducted in adults using 8 to 10 metabolic measures (fasting insulin, fasting glucose, post-challenge insulin, post-challenge glucose, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) have shown that the MetSyn is best described, statistically, as a unifying, second-order factor defined by four first-order factors (Insulin Resistance, Obesity, Hypertension, Lipids) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>MetSyn is hypothesized to have fairly large genetic component with heritability estimates ranging from 6.3% to 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, yet few potential genetic targets have been identified. Thus, we aimed to define the genetic determinants of MetSyn in the Framingham Heart Study (Offspring Cohort, Exam 7) using the Affymetrix 50 k Human Gene Panel data and three different approaches: 1) an association-based "onesingle-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-at-a-time" analysis with MetSyn defined as a binary trait using the WHO criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; 2) an association-based "one-SNP-ata-time" analysis with MetSyn defined as a continuous trait using second-order factor scores derived from insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia factors; and, 3) a multivariate SEM analysis with MetSyn defined as a second-order continuous factor trait modeled simultaneously with putative genes (identified in Approaches 1 and 2), which we represented as latent constructs defined by multiple SNPs within each gene.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Data cleaning and preparation: phenotype and genotype variables First, we examined the distribution of metabolic variables (TG, HDL, SBP, DBP, fasting glucose, BMI) in the Offspring Cohort, Exam 7 using SAS v9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Variables not following a normal distribution, as determined by visual inspection of histograms and quantile-quantile plots and formal Shapiro-Wilk's and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, were natural log transformed (TG, HDL, fasting glucose). To adjust for potential bias by antihypertensive treatment and more closely reflect pretreatment BP values, we added 10 mm Hg to SBP and 5 mm Hg to DBP, following Cui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, in subjects who reported taking blood pressure medications. We used the WHO criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to define MetSyn; however, waist circumference and microalbuminuria measures were not available, and we applied the most recent IDF fasting glucose cut-point value of ≥100 mg/dL <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Mendelian inconsistencies were identified in the Affymetrix 50 k Human Gene Panel data using MARKERINFO (S.A.G.E. v5.4.1). If an inconsistency was found, genotypes of all individuals in that family were set to missing. Of the 2760 subjects in the Offspring Cohort (Approach 1), 2544 had complete data on all metabolic measures (Approach 2) and 1512 had complete data on all metabolic measures and putative genotypes (Approach 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods for association-based analyses Approach 1 and 2</head><p>We evaluated the potential association between each SNP on the 50 k panel and each phenotype using the following model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in ASSOC (S.A.G.E. v5.4.1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h y h c c c z i i i n n i i i ( ) ( ) , = + + + + + + α γ γ γ δ η 1 1 2 2</formula></div>

Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and age × sex. p-Values were calculated using likelihood-ratio and Wald tests and compared to ensure consistency; however, we report only the Wald p-values since results were similar in all cases. In Approach 1 and 2, a gene was considered statistically significant if it had ≥2 SNPs associated with an individual metabolic variable or MetSyn at p &lt; 0.001. Significant genes were then utilized in Approach 3.</p><p>Statistical methods for factor analysis (FA) and SEM Approach 2 and 3</p><p>We used previous reports to devise our second-order MetSyn factor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>; however, because fasting insulin and waist circumference were not available, firstorder factors, Insulin Resistance and Obesity were defined using only fasting glucose and BMI, respectively. Similar to previous models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, the BP and Lipids first-order factors were defined using SBP and DBP and TG and HDL measures, respectively. We performed confirmatory factor analysis using a robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR), which provides test statistics and standard errors robust to non-independence of observations and non-normality (Mplus v5. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Approach 1, we evaluated the potential associations between each SNP on the Affymetrix 50 k Human Gene Panel and MetSyn as a binary trait defined using the modified WHO criteria (see Methods) and between each SNP and each individual metabolic measure. We found that several genes had two or more SNPs with significant (p &lt; 0.001) associations, the majority of which are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Of these genes, the most significant associations were observed with CETP SNPs rs11508026 (p = 7.60 × 10 -7 ) and rs3764261 (p = 1.34 × 10 -6 ). Two of the same KIAA0329 SNPs (rs12434098, rs1190547) were associated with TG and HDL but not with MetSyn. Multiple CSMD1 SNPs were associated with BMI and MetSyn, while WDR64 SNPs were associated with SBP and MetSyn.</p><p>In Approach 2, we modeled MetSyn as a continuous, second-order factor defined by four first-order factors (Obesity, Insulin Resistance, BP, Lipids) and observed a good fitting model by several fit indices (c 2 = 59.48, df = 7, p &lt; 0.05; CFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.02). We found Insulin Resistance was the most important factor (b std = 0.99 ± standard error of b std = 0.02; p &lt; 0.001) followed by Obesity (0.96 ± 0.03; p &lt; 0.001), Lipids (0.69 ± 0.05; p &lt; 0.001), and BP (0.50 ± 0.04; p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Using this model, we examined potential associations between each SNP on the 50 k panel and the second-and first-order factor scores (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). KIAA0329 SNPs were found to be associated with Lipids factor scores (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>), which is consistent with the results observed in Approach 1 in that KIAA0329 SNPs were also associated with TG and HDL measures. However, CSMD1 was the only gene with ≥2 SNPs found to be associated with MetSyn factor scores (p &lt; 0.001). In Approach 3, we extended the latent gene construct SEM method of Nock et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> to model multiple putative genes identified in Approaches 1 and 2 simultaneously with MetSyn as a second-order factor modeling MetSyn as second-order factor with 24 SNPs in seven genes improved model fit by several indices (c 2 = 523.52, df = 375, p &lt; 0.05; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.01; SRMR = 0.02) and increased the R 2 of MetSyn from 0.23 to 0.43, compared to the same model without genes. To further illustrate the utility of SEM, we also added a path between MetSyn and coronary heart disease (CHD) in models with and without genes. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the strongest associations in terms of effect size and statistical significance were found between CETP and Lipids (b std = 0.15 ± 0.02; p = 1.04 × 10 -8 ), STARD13 and Insulin a MetSyn defined as binary trait using a modified WHO definition (see text). b rs1997137 and rs2930355 in CSMD1 were associated with MetSyn at p = 0.007 and p = 0.003, respectively.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depict a similar model). b No genes with two or more SNPs were found to be associated with the BP first-order factor at p &lt; 0.001.</p><p>Resistance (b std = 0.14 ± 0.08; p = 0.05), and STARD13 and MetSyn (b std = 0.08 ± 0.03; p = 0.007); however, the CSMD1 latent construct was not associated with MetSyn even when using different combinations of SNPs to devise the construct (data not shown). The MYO16 latent gene construct was not associated with either BP or MetSyn factors; and, for parsimony reasons, was dropped from the final model shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The association between MetSyn and CHD was similar, but slightly attenuated in the model with (b std = 0.13 ± 0.04; p = 0.002) versus without (b std = 0.14 ± 0.03; p &lt; 0.001) the seven genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Results between approaches were similar in that CSMD1 SNPs were found to be associated with MetSyn when using both the modified WHO definition (Approach 1) and the factor scores (Approach 2). However, when evaluating associations between each SNP and each individual metabolic measure, the factor scores (Approach 2) produced fewer putative genes with ≥2 SNPs using a p &lt; 0.001. Because we were most interested in defining putative genes and not individual SNPs, we retained genes with ≥2 SNPs at p &lt; 0.001 versus correcting for multiple tests using a standard Bonferroni correction approach. If we had applied a correction factor for 2,000 tests (p ≤ 2.5 × 10 -5 ), which is the approximate number of genes on the 50 k panel, only CETP (mean SNP p = 1.05 × 10 -6 ) would have qualified for use in Approach 3. Interestingly, the CETP latent gene construct (Approach 3) had the strongest association of all of the gene constructs in terms of effect size (b std = 0.15) and significance (p = 1.04 × 10 -8 ) in the 7-gene, 24-SNP model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Although CSMD1 SNPs were associated with MetSyn in Approaches 1 and 2, the CSMD1 latent gene construct (Approach 3) was not associated with Metsyn when modeled in the presence of SNPs in six other genes, even when devising the construct with different combinations of SNPs, which emphasizes an important advantage of Approach 3 in that it can better control for the effects of multiple putative SNPs (and genes) in the same model. Although sample sizes differed between approaches, the consistent findings we observed across all three approaches for CETP (HDL (Approach 1), Lipids (Approach 2)) and STARD13 (fasting glucose (Approach 1), Insulin Resistance (Approach 3)) make attributing the CSMD1 discrepancies to sample size differences less compelling. Moreover, SNPs in genes previously shown to be associated with MetSyn using the WHO criteria, including LDLR, PPARG, and ACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, were not found to be significant at p ≤ 0.05 in our study. The lack of replication may be due to modifications we had to make to the WHO definition to accommodate available data and, perhaps, genetic heterogeneity of this complex phenotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The multivariate framework of SEM is inherently better suited for modeling the hierarchical, complex relations involved in MetSyn; and, the latent gene construct SEM approach appears particularly useful for disentangling the influence of individual genes on MetSyn in the presence of multiple putative SNPs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Model of the MetSyn and genes as latent constructs using SEM.
