<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim:</head><p>To test an explanatory model of the relationships between the nursing work environment, job satisfaction, job stress and emotional exhaustion for haemodialysis nurses, drawing on Kanter's theory of organizational empowerment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>: Understanding the organizational predictors of burnout (emotional exhaustion) in haemodialysis nurses is critical for staff retention and improving nurse and patient outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated high levels of emotional exhaustion among haemodialysis nurses, yet the relationships between nurses' work environment, job satisfaction, stress and emotional exhaustion in this population is poorly understood. Design: A cross-sectional online survey. Methods: 417 nurses working in haemodialysis units completed an online survey between October 2011 and April 2012 using validated measures of the work environment, job satisfaction, job stress and emotional exhaustion.</p><p>Results: Overall, the structural equation model demonstrated adequate fit and we found partial support for the hypothesized relationships. Nurses' work environment had a direct positive effect on job satisfaction, explaining 88% of the variance. Greater job satisfaction, in turn, predicted lower job stress, explaining 82% of the variance. Job satisfaction also had an indirect effect on emotional exhaustion by mitigating job stress. However, job satisfaction did not have a direct effect on emotional exhaustion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The work environment of haemodialysis nurses is pivotal to the development of job satisfaction. Nurses' job satisfaction also predicts their level of job stress and emotional exhaustion. Our findings suggest staff retention can be improved by creating empowering work environments that promote job satisfaction among haemodialysis nurses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Haemodialysis nurses work in highly complex environments caring for people with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring renal replacement therapy <ref type="bibr">(Bennett 2011a)</ref>.</p><p>Globally there has been an increased demand for renal replacement therapy associated with ageing populations and the rising incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk factors (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caskey et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Evans &amp; Taal 2011)</ref>. The increasing burden of CKD and concomitant global shortage of nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan et al. 2013)</ref> underscores the importance of retaining experienced nurses in a specialty area such as haemodialysis nursing. Retention of experienced registered nurses and adequate nurse-topatient ratios in the haemodialysis setting are associated with improved patient outcomes and fewer adverse events including intra-dialytic hypotension, skipped treatments, shortened treatments, hospitalizations and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Saran et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Gardner et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">, Thomas-Hawkins et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In Australia and New Zealand, haemodialysis is provided in three distinct work environments: in-centre, satellite and home haemodialysis units. Small nurse-led community units (satellite dialysis units) located distant from tertiary hospitals and specialist medical care cater for most of the patients receiving haemodialysis treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bennett 2011b</ref>). The workforce in both countries is predominately registered nurses, with limited use of technicians as found elsewhere around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Polaschek et al. 2009)</ref>. Regardless of the work environment, haemodialysis nursing is characterized by ongoing, prolonged and at times intense contact with patients often over a period of years or even decades . People with ESKD often present a clinical challenge to nurses by having multiple concurrent chronic conditions requiring complex care <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ashker et al. 2012</ref>). The challenging nature of haemodialysis nurses' work environments, complexity of patient care and intense, prolonged relationships with patients all influence job satisfaction, stress and burnout in haemodialysis nurses .</p><p>Previous research has found approximately half of the haemodialysis nursing workforce report high levels of emotional exhaustion <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hayes et al. 2013)</ref>. These levels are comparable to nurses working in stressful environments such as emergency departments (O'Mahony 2011), but is higher than nurses working in hospital wards and nursing homes (34% and 32% respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(McHugh et al. 2011)</ref>. Understanding the organizational predictors of emotional exhaustion in haemodialysis nurses is critical for staff retention and improving nurse and patient outcomes. The nursing work environment plays a pivotal role in providing job satisfaction, which in turn can ameliorate job stress and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cicolini et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, Van Bogaert et al. 2013)</ref>. Studies have shown the work environment is a significant correlate of job satisfaction, stress and burnout among haemodialysis nurses <ref type="bibr">(Harwood et al. 2010b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Gardner &amp; Walton 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, O'Brien 2011)</ref>. Where high levels of stress and burnout exist there has been a corresponding decrease in patient satisfaction, increased patient morbidity and mortality, increased nurse absenteeism and nurses leaving the profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Flynn et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Aiken et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Flynn et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Structural empowerment theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kanter, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kanter, , 1993) )</ref> offers a theory-driven approach to explain how the work environment influences employee attitude and behaviour outcomes, such as job satisfaction, job stress and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Laschinger 2012)</ref>. From a structural perspective, empowerment refers to an employee's ability to access information, support, resources and opportunities to complete tasks in a fulfilling manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kanter 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Kuokkanen &amp; Leino-Kilpi 2000)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kanter (1993)</ref>, power is derived from formal (the employees' position in the organization) and informal (social contacts inside and outside the organization) systems in the organization. Empowerment is a positive dynamic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kuokkanen &amp; Leino-Kilpi 2000)</ref>, where a nurse's perception of empowerment varies according to individual, organizational and social factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rao 2012)</ref>. A growing body of organizational research suggests that nurses who are empowered to accomplish their work in meaningful ways through supportive organizational structures experience greater job satisfaction and lower job stress and burnout, which ultimately influences performance and retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Laschinger 2012)</ref>. Where high levels of job stress and burnout exist, nurses are more likely to leave their job or exit the profession altogether <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al. 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, Hyrkas &amp; Morton 2013)</ref>. The purpose of this study was to test an explanatory model of the relationships between the nursing work environment,job satisfaction, job stress and burnout for haemodialysis nurses, drawing on Kanter's theory of organizational empowerment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Job satisfaction for haemodialysis nurses is linked to organizational factors and nurses' perceived ability to deliver quality nursing care, including being able to meet the psychological needs of the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hayes &amp; Bonner 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Gardner &amp; Walton 2011)</ref>. Nurses are satisfied with their work when they have the time to answer patient questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Perumal &amp; Sehgal 2003)</ref>, are able to provide a therapeutic environment and by being empathetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ross et al. 2009)</ref>. Lack of night shift is also highlighted as contributing to job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brokalaki et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Arikan et al. 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Thomas-Hawkins et al. (2003)</ref> found that haemodialysis nurses felt they were not recognised as valued members of the health team and by hospital administration.</p><p>The major contributors to job stress and burnout for haemodialysis nurses are related to workloads, inadequate support and issues surrounding patient care <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brokalaki et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Murphy 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Flynn et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">). Flynn et al. (2009)</ref> found that the incidence of burnout doubled when workloads exceeded nurses' ability to complete required tasks. Stress levels also increase if nurses are not able to take breaks or have shorter breaks during a shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brokalaki et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Murphy 2004</ref>). In-centre and satellite work environments are known to have differing workload stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dermondy &amp; Bennett 2008)</ref>, with in-centre nurses experiencing higher levels of stress and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hayes et al. 2013)</ref>. Higher levels of stress occur when nurses feel unsupported in their practice by the organization where they work <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ridley et al. 2009)</ref>. Limited access to professional development <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Uğur et al. 2007)</ref>, ineffective communication and lack of support from hospital management <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brokalaki et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Di Lorio et al. 2008)</ref> are known contributors to stress and burnout in haemodialysis nurses. Regular interactions with patients receiving haemodialysis treatment also increase the emotional toll on nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Klersy et al. 2007)</ref>, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chayu and Kreitler (2011)</ref> finding emotional exhaustion and cognitive weariness increasing burnout in these nurses. Difficult interpersonal relationships with physicians associated with patient care decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Murphy 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Arikan et al. 2007)</ref>, violence from patients directed at nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brokalaki et al. 2001)</ref> and increased exposure to infectious diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kapucu et al. 2009</ref>) are also reported as contributing to stress and burnout in haemodialysis nurses.</p><p>The theoretical basis for this study was <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kanter's (1993)</ref> structural theory of organizational empowerment. Over the last two decades Kanter's theory has been used to demonstrate the link between empowering workplace structures, job satisfaction, stress and burnout in healthcare settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Laschinger 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Maynard et al. 2012)</ref>. Empowered nurses have greater job satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al. 2001a)</ref>, lower job stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davies et al. 2006)</ref> and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Sarmiento et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Laschinger et al. 2010b</ref>). Further studies using Kanter's theory supports that empowered nurses are more likely to provide high quality care <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ning et al. 2009)</ref>, empower patients <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al. 2010a)</ref>, feel more respected in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Faulkner &amp; Laschinger 2007</ref>) and experience less bullying <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Laschinger et al. 2010b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">, Read &amp; Laschinger 2013)</ref>. Empowering work structures have also been linked to improved nurse retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Zurmehly et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Laschinger 2012</ref>).</p><p>In the context of nephrology nursing, Kanter's theory has been used to investigate the relationship between workplace empowerment and burnout <ref type="bibr">(Harwood et al. 2010b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, O'Brien 2011)</ref> and the association between the work environment and nurse-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ridley et al. 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Harwood et al. (2010b)</ref> surveyed 121 Canadian nephrology nurses finding that higher levels of empowerment were negatively correlated with emotional exhaustion. In a study of American haemodialysis nurses, O'Brien (2011) found low levels of structural empowerment and higher levels of burnout. Overall a significant negative relationship existed between structural empowerment and burnout in these nurses. Predictors of burnout in nephrology nurses include a lack of: opportunities for advancement, rewards for innovation, flexibility in the work place and support from administration and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ridley et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>While the studies reviewed provide important evidence about the nursing work environment, job satisfaction, stress and burnout in haemodialysis nurses, no research could be identified that examined these variables together. Furthermore, no studies have been published using structural equation modelling (SEM) to tease out the directional nature of these relationships in haemodialysis nurses. SEM allows researchers to test theoretical propositions regarding how constructs are theoretically linked and the directionality of significant relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Schreiber et al. 2006)</ref>. In this study we sought to add to the literature by using SEM to test the direction and strength of the relationships between work environment, job satisfaction, job stress and emotional exhaustion in a haemodialysis nurse population. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kanter's (1993)</ref> theory we hypothesized that empowering structures in the nursing work environment positively influence haemodialysis nurses' job satisfaction, which in turn reduces emotional exhaustion both directly and indirectly by lowering job stress (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE STUDY Aim</head><p>To test an explanatory model of the relationships between the nursing work environment, job satisfaction, job stress and emotional exhaustion for haemodialysis nurses, drawing on Kanter's theory of organizational empowerment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>This study used a cross-sectional design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited through the Renal Society of Australasia (RSA). The RSA is the peak body for nephrology nurses and dialysis technicians working largely in Australia and New Zealand. At the time of the study, the RSA had 1328 members (April 2011) who work in a variety of nephrology nursing roles including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal wards, CKD clinics, home therapies and transplantation. Of the membership, 95% identify themselves as nurses and 61% indicate that they work in a haemodialysis unit <ref type="bibr">(Membership Officer, Renal Society of Australasia, 26 April 2011)</ref>. For this study, nurses aged between 18-65 years and working at least 0.5 full-time equivalent or greater in a haemodialysis unit in either Australia or New Zealand were included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>Permission was sought from the Federal Board of the RSA to invite members to complete the online survey and an invitation to participate was included in the monthly enews and the bi-monthly Communiqué to all members. Email correspondence was also sent to all branch presidents to direct potential participants to the survey website. A reminder to participate was also announced at branch meetings. Data was collected between October work environments that cause nurses to be dissatisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Webster et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Flint et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Reid et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was measured using the 44-item Part B of the Index for Work Satisfaction (IWS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stamps &amp; Piedmonte 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">, Stamps 1997</ref>). This instrument measures six components associated with job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stamps &amp; Piedmonte 1986</ref>, p.17):</p><p>'pay, dollar remuneration or fringe benefits received for work done; autonomy, amount of job related independence, initiative and freedom, either permitted or required in daily work activities; task requirements, tasks or activities that must be done as a regular part of the job; organizational policies, management policies and procedures put forward by the hospital and nursing administration of the hospital; interaction, opportunities presented for both formal and informal social and professional contact during working hours; and professional status, overall importance or significance felt about your job, both in your view and in the view of others.' It uses a 7-point Likert scale that ranges from agree to disagree, with higher scores indicating greater levels of satisfaction.</p><p>Job Stress. Job stress was measured using the 34-item Nursing Stress Scale (NSS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gray-Toft &amp; Anderson 1981)</ref>. The NSS has seven subscales: death and dying; conflict with physicians; inadequate preparations; lack of staff support; conflict with other nurses; workloads; and uncertainty concerning treatments. The NSS asks respondents to rate attitudinal statements on a 4-point Likert scale (never, occasionally, frequently and very frequently). This instrument has not been previously used to examine haemodialysis nurses' stress, but it has been widely used in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abualrub et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Garcia-Izquierdo&amp; Rios-Risquez 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">, Suresh et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion was measured using the 9-item emotional exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Maslach &amp; Jackson 1981)</ref>. This subscale of the MBI is considered the core measure of burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Maslach 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Helkavaara 2013</ref>). Emotional exhaustion is the strain component of burnout and is described as the overextension and depletion of one's emotional as well as physical resources.</p><p>Emotional exhaustion is considered the precursor to feelings of decreased personal accomplishment and cynicism, leading to decreased job satisfaction and nurse turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Maslach 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Helkavaara 2013</ref>). The emotional exhaustion subscale of the MBI has previously been used as a sole measure of burnout in studies of nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kanai-Pak et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Gilbert et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, Laschinger et al. 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical Considerations</head><p>Approval to conduct the study was granted by the University's Human Research Ethics Committee. At the start of the survey, detailed study information was provided and participants were informed that completion of the survey implied consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Data were analysed using SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) version 21 and AMOS (Chicago, IL, USA) version 22 software. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics and major study variables. Given the voluntary nature and length of the survey, there was a progressive rate of missing data: 92% of participants completed the B-PEM, 82% the IWS, 79% the NSS, with an overall item completion of 78%. Missing data were found to be missing completely at random using Little's MCAR test. We used multiple imputation to replace missing data as it produces unbiased estimates and provides the best estimation for high rates of missing data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Argyrous 2011)</ref>. Data from each study measure were assessed to ensure normality by evaluating skewness and kurtosis. Principle component analysis was used to examine the structure of the B-PEM, IWS, NSS and EE. A correlation matrix for all the variables was constructed. The hypothesized model was then analyzed using SEM techniques using maximum likelihood estimation, an iterative estimation procedure to approximate values for each parameter that has more than one possible solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne 2010)</ref>. Overall, data from 417 nurses was included in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Schreiber (2008)</ref> suggests that a sample size should have at least 20 cases for each parameter for SEM. In this study there are 20 free parameters, indicating adequate power from the sample size. Bollen-Stine bootstrapping was used to account for skewed data and to report with greater accuracy the parameter estimates of the hypothesized model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Several fit indices were used to evaluate whether the data fitted the hypothesized model: Normed Chi-Square (χ 2 /df), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). Normed Chi-square (χ2/df) values of less than 3 are considered to demonstrate reasonable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hair et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Iacobucci 2010</ref>). The CFI is considered the index of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne, (2010)</ref>, with values of ≥ 0.95 indicating good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hu &amp; Bentler 1999)</ref>. The GFI measures the relative amount of variance and covariance in the sample data that is jointly explained by the hypothesized model and has a cut-off level of &gt; 0.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne 2010)</ref>. The RMSEA takes into account the complexity of the hypothesized model and good fit is indicated by values &lt; 0.60 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hu &amp; Bentler 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The initial fit statistic for the overall model revealed poor fit (χ 2 /df = 3.79; CFI = 0.68; GFI = 0.65; RMSEA = 0.120). After assessment of the modification indices and parameter estimates several paths in the hypothesized model were identified as being nonsignificant and so were deleted from the measurement model; a technique supported by <ref type="bibr">Schrieber (2008)</ref>. The deleted variables included doctor/nurse interactions (IWS), organizational policies (IWS), conflict with doctors (NSS), workloads (NSS), uncertainty regarding treatment (NSS) and getting things done (B-PEM). This appeared to be due to multicollinearity or heavy cross-loadings on a similar item in the model due to similar wording of the items or conceptual overlap in these measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Grewal et al. 2004</ref>). For all analyses, p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity and reliability</head><p>Study measures were well validated instruments. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the factor structure of the instruments in this sample. All instruments demonstrated reasonable to good model fit using standard fit indices. Internal reliability of each scale was also examined using Cronbach's alpha. The B-PEM subscales ranged from 0.80-.86, with an overall alpha of 0.91. The IWS (Part B) subscales ranged from 0.72-.85, with an overall alpha of 0.90. The NSS subscales ranged from 0.70-.85, with an overall alpha of 0.82. Finally, the emotional exhaustion scale also demonstrated good internal reliability, with an alpha of 0.92.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>The final sample included 417 nurses (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Respondents were predominantly women (90.9%), registered nurses (97.4%), from Australia (94.9%), had worked in the haemodialysis environment over six years (75.6%) and were over 40 years old (74.3%). Most nurses worked in a satellite (48.4%) or in-centre environment (44.8%). Approximately half (48.5%) had a postgraduate nursing qualification and 73% had a specialist renal nursing qualification.</p><p>The correlation matrix, means, standard deviations and Cronbach alphas of the main variables included in the final analysis are presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Strong correlations were found in the work environment variables with feeling valued and management support having the strongest correlation (r = 0.74, p&lt; 0.01), followed by professional development and management support (r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.01). Moderate correlations were found between some job satisfaction variables and the work environment variables: Nurse/nurse interactions had a moderate correlation with feeling valued (r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.01) and autonomy and feeling valued had a moderate correlation (r = 0.69, p&lt; 0.01). All stress factors were significantly correlated with emotional exhaustion.</p><p>The final model demonstrated good overall fit: χ 2 /df = 2.36; CFI = 0.96; GFI = 0.95; and RMSEA = 0.06 (90% confidence interval = 0.05-0.07). The structural model with standardized path estimates is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The findings demonstrate that nurses' perception of the work environment had a direct positive effect on job satisfaction (β = 0.94, p &lt; 0.01). Greater job satisfaction, in turn, predicted lower job stress (β = -0.91, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Higher job stress also predicted higher emotional exhaustion scores (β = 0.65, p &lt; 0.05). Job satisfaction had an indirect effect on emotional exhaustion through job stress (β = -0.59).</p><p>However, counter to our hypothesis, job satisfaction did not have a direct effect on emotional exhaustion (β = 0.07, p = 0.82). The work environment accounted for 88% of the variance in nurses' job satisfaction. Job satisfaction explained 82% of the variance in job stress. Job satisfaction and job stress together explained 34% of the variance in emotional exhaustion scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This is the first study using SEM to test the relationships between work environment, job satisfaction, job stress and emotional exhaustion in a haemodialysis nurse population. A strong direct and positive relationship was found between the work environment and job satisfaction indicating that existing organizational structures in the haemodialysis work environment are important contributors to job satisfaction. This finding should be of considerable interest to nurse managers given the strength of the relationship. It also supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kanter's (1993)</ref> theory and is consistent with previous nursing studies that have demonstrated the relationship and the importance of a positive work environment in predicting greater job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aiken et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Laschinger et al. 2009b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Cicolini et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">, Yang et al. 2013)</ref>. The work environment and job satisfaction has been studied in haemodialysis nurses where factors in the environment were associated with job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Thomas-Hawkins et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Gardner et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Gardner &amp; Walton 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, O'Brien 2011)</ref>, but the strength of this relationship between these two variables has not been previously reported.</p><p>Job satisfaction had a significant negative relationship with job stress in this study which indicates that as levels of job satisfaction increase the incidence of job stress decreases.</p><p>In addition, job satisfaction indirectly reduced emotional exhaustion by lowering job stress.</p><p>The strength of these relationships in this model predicts that haemodialysis nurses who have greater job satisfaction are less likely to perceive events as stressful and will have lower emotional exhaustion. This finding reinforces the work of <ref type="bibr">Laschinger et al. (2001b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lautizi et al (2009)</ref>, who found positive work environments predicted greater job satisfaction, which in turn offset stress experienced by nurses. Only one previous study of haemodialysis nurses found higher levels of job stress were associated with lower job satisfaction and a reduction in the quality of patient care <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Uğur et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The hypothesis that job satisfaction has a direct effect on emotional exhaustion was not supported in this study. Our findings show that job stress appears to be more important for developing emotional exhaustion than level of job satisfaction in haemodialysis nurses.</p><p>This was an unexpected finding and is counter to previous research examining the relationship between job satisfaction and burnout. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kalliath and Morris (2002)</ref> were able to predict that nurses working in community hospitals would develop burnout (emotional exhaustion) due to lowered levels of job satisfaction. That the nurses in our study reported high levels of both job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion prompts some reflection. It is possible that some of the same contributors to job satisfaction among haemodialysis nurses may, over time, also lead to emotional exhaustion. Some unique aspects of haemodialysis nursing not captured in our model, such as the complexity of the work environment and prolonged relationships with patients in haemodialysis units, may also help explain this paradoxical finding.</p><p>Job stress was an important predictor of emotional exhaustion among haemodialysis nurses in this study. Existing literature on burnout supports the relationship found between job stress and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Maslach &amp; Jackson 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Jourdain &amp; Chenevêrt 2010)</ref>. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arikan (2007)</ref> found that burnout was positively correlated with stress and negatively correlated with job satisfaction in haemodialysis nurses. Several studies have suggested that the haemodialysis work environment presents unique stressors due to the prolonged, intense relationship with patients and the complex care provided by nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Flynn et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Ashker et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Dolan et al. 2012)</ref>. Managing job stress is important to prevent burnout and turnover of these specialized nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Flynn et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Ashker et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>While unavoidable, key contributors to job stress in the haemodialysis context need to be identified and targeted with proactive strategies to decrease emotional exhaustion. In haemodialysis units, stress not only affects patient outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ridley et al. 2009)</ref>. It is also detrimental to the health and well-being of haemodialysis nurses <ref type="bibr">(Harwood et al. 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Ashker et al. 2012)</ref>, with stressed and burnt out nurses more likely to resign from their position or leave the profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Uğur et al. 2007)</ref>. The incidence of stress and burnout can be reduced through interventions such as allowing nurses to participate more fully in decisions regarding their practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Laschinger &amp; Finegan 2005)</ref>, encouraging autonomous practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kramer &amp; Schmalenberg 2008)</ref>, ensuring stable leadership that is viable, accessible and responsive to staff needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Flynn et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">, Tourangeau et al. 2010)</ref>, increased psychological support through support networks, team building (e.g. integrating new nurses into the ward environment, open lines of communication, rewarding staff) and routine rather than reactionary debriefing.</p><p>An empowering work environment is crucial to developing and sustaining job satisfaction that in turn contributes to the retention of haemodialysis nurses. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Laschinger (2012)</ref>, nurse managers play a pivotal role in creating work environments that empower nurses to provide quality care for patients and thereby improve the job satisfaction in that ward. It is important that nurse managers have a sense of empowerment because 'power begets power' <ref type="bibr">(Kanter 1977, p. 168)</ref> and the sense of empowerment can be passed onto other nurses. Nurse managers need to explicitly examine the work environment to evaluate the presence of empowering workplace structures (e.g. access to information, support, resources and opportunities) as this study found that a positive work environment was major determinant of job satisfaction. The work environment can be assessed by listening to nurses' feedback and ensuring organizational strategies are in place that will enable nurses to transform their work environment to improve job satisfaction.</p><p>Other factors not measured in this study also warrant further research. The role that psychological empowerment has on overall employee attitudes and behaviours along with testing an expanded model that incorporates psychological empowerment on patient and nurse outcomes is needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Laschinger 2012)</ref>. Qualitative methods could be used to better understand the cultural context and the social processes inherent in the haemodialysis work environment as triggers for job satisfaction, stress and burnout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>A strength of this study was the large sample size. Participants, however, were drawn from a professional organization for renal nurses with voluntary membership which may introduce selection bias. It is possible that participants may be more motivated and committed to their career in haemodialysis nursing compared with non-members and thus not be representative of the target population. The questionnaires used in this study also led to measurement issues such as multicollinearity. We suggest future researchers undertaking SEM in this area carefully select instruments that are measuring distinct constructs and variables. For example, the Nursing Stress Scale measures the frequency of stress rather than its severity or impact. While generic organizational measures allow comparisons with other studies, they may not fully address the complexity of haemodialysis nursing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Retention of expert nurses in specialty areas such as haemodialysis nursing is an imperative in the context of a growing global shortage of nurses. This study has examined the relationships among the work environment, job satisfaction, stress and emotional exhaustion in the haemodialysis context. It found that nurses who view their work environment positively are more likely to be satisfied in their work. Consistent with Kanter's theory, these results demonstrate that an empowered work environment is a key contributor to job satisfaction and lower job stress and emotional exhaustion. Our findings point to key organizational determinants of emotional exhaustion in haemodialysis nurses. Nurse managers have a vital role in assessing and developing strategies to target these modifiable factors to improve retention.   </p></div>

Participants completed an online questionnaire including nurse and work characteristics and measures of the nurse work environment, job satisfaction, stress and emotional exhaustion. Work environment. The nursing work environment was measured using the 26-item Brisbane Practice Environment Measure (B-PEM) (Flint et al. 2010), developed to measure satisfaction with the work environment and perceived organizational deficits. The B-PEM focuses on structural and psychological factors in the environment that empower nurses to complete their work. It has four subscales: 'Getting things done', having the staff, skill mix, information to be able to work effectively and reward for work done; 'flexibility of management support', incorporates the issues around roster scheduling, accessibility to management for assistance and other factors affecting work-life balance; 'feeling valued, the nurse's experience of the workplace and how s/he is treated in the practice environment; and professional development', the extent to which opportunities for professional development is available. The instrument uses a 5-point Likert scale where respondents indicate the frequency that the statement occurs. The B-PEM was chosen as a validated scale developed in and for the Australian context.
