<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 An introduction to structural equation modeling</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">General considerations</head><p>Let p variables be observed upon n units. The p variables are partitioned in J subsets or blocks of k j variables which are presumed to be pertinent for describing the phenomenon. Each of these blocks is designed to describe a theme of the general phenomenon. We shall designate these blocs by X j and we shall consider them as matrices with dimension (n × k j ). In structural models the observed variables are called manifest variables. The latent variables are not observable: they exist by the relations they have with the manifest variables. In the following we shall always suppose that each block is associated with only one latent variable (unidimensionality). Therefore we can identify the blocks by the same name as their latent variable. The latent variable corresponding to the X j block will be designated by ξ j . A structural model needs 2 types of models: the measurement model (outer model) which connects the manifest variables to the latent variables and the structural model (inner model) which connects latent variables between them.</p><p>1.1.1 The measurement model (outer model) After having determined the blocks, we must specify the type of relationship between latent variables and manifest variables which correspond to block X j . There are 3 ways: the reflective way, the formative way, the MIMIC way (Multiple effect Indicators for Multiple Causes).</p><p>The reflective way In this way, the manifest variables are considered like the "reflection" of their latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Tenenhaus et al., 2005]</ref>. This kind of situation exists for instance in models which analyse customer satisfaction of a particular kind of service: a set of questions about the image of the service which represents a latent variable in the model. Each manifest variable is related to its latent variable, as follows:</p><p>x jh = π 0 jh + π jh ξ j + jh ∀h = 1 . . . k j π 0 jh = constant term; π jh = regression coefficient; jh = residual term. The formative way Here the latent variables represents the "reflection" of the manifest variables which belong to block X j , and are thus a result of these <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Tenenhaus and al., 2005]</ref>. In this type, the latent variable is a linear function of the manifest variables which generate it:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ξ j = Σ kj h=1 jh x jh+δj ; jh (h = 1 . . . h j )= multiple regression coefficients of ξ j on ; δ j = resid- ual term.</formula><p>1.1.2 The structural model (inner model) Opposite to the measurement model, which deals with the relations between latent variables and their manifest, the structural model concerns the mode of estimation of latent variable between them. The relations between latent variables have the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ξ j = β 0 j + Σ J i=1,i =j β ji ξ i + ζ j ∀j = 1 . . . J<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">β 0 j = constant term; β ji = regression coefficient; ζ j = residual term.</formula><p>Wold <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Wold, 1966]</ref> formalized the concept of partial least squares. His algorithm consists in estimating the latent variables (outer estimate and inner estimate) and the structural equations by OLS (Ordinal Least Squares) multiple regression with an iterative process. The initial value of the coefficients being equal to ±1, according to the sign of the correlation between latent variables or between latent and manifest variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">A comparison between PLS and LISREL</head><p>We will follow here <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Jöreskog and Wold, 1982]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Chin, 2000]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Vinzi, 2003]</ref>. In PLS approach, there are less probabilistic hypotheses, data are modeled by a succession of simple or multiple regression and there is no identification problem. On the contrary in LISREL, the estimation is done by maximum likelihood, based on the hypothesis of multinormality and allows the modelisation of the variance-covariance matrix. However, identification problems and non-convergence of the algorithm are sometimes encountered. The differences between the estimations for a causal model using PLS and LISREL depends on the order in which the parameters of the model and latent variables are computed. For PLS the estimated latent variables are first computed by making them belong to the space spanned by their manifest variables. The model parameters are computed by using OLS multiple regression. With LISREL, one computes the model parameters by maximum likelihood and impose some constraints on latent variables. Consequently, the structural equations are more significant in LISREL than in PLS (the R 2 are larger) and the correlations between the manifest variables and their latent are larger in PLS. In LISREL approach, each latent variable is estimated by multiple regression, using all manifest variables. In PLS, latent variables are calculated as a linear combination of the associated manifest variables. PLS favours the outer model and LISREL the inner model. The table 1 summarizes criteria for choosing between PLS and LISREL. 2 Practical application</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Satisfaction in automobile market</head><p>Taking into account that the PLS approach is less used than LISREL in marketing research, even though it is more advantageous than the latter, our objective was to introduce how PLS works and to show its' capacities.</p><p>To reach this goal, we used data provided by the PSA Company (Peugeot Citroën) on customers' satisfaction. We used the experimental PLSX module of the SPAD software, which has been developed within the framework of the ESIS project about the construction of a tool to analyze European customer satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The questionnaire</head><p>The data obtained by questionnaire (which is confidential) represents satisfaction scores (with the scale of 1 to 10) on about thirty services. 2922 customers participated. Manifest variables are the followings (table 2): Since we are interested in the relationships between variables, and not in their values, it was not necessary to rescale the answers, despite the fact that customers do not use the scale in the same way.</p><p>3 The analysis</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Blocks building</head><p>We first had to partition the manifest variables (MV) into homogenous blocks, each one being explicitly associated with only one latent variable. After many trials and with the help of experts, we considered the following division of the 32 variables into 6 blocks (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The causality scheme</head><p>The measurement model has been established in the previous paragraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.1</head><p>The structural model (inner model) Supposing that the themes reflect correctly the characteristics of the satisfaction, we must then propose relations between these themes, so as to explain the latent variable "general satisfaction". In the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we can visualize the structural model which shows the relations between the latent variables:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results and interpretations</head><p>We see that the variable "construction quality" is the most important variable for the "general satisfaction" (the correlation coefficient is 0,4339) and the less important is the "driving quality" (the correlation coefficient is 0,2683). Consequently, in order to increase the general satisfaction of the client, the producer should concentrate firstly on the "construction quality" and then on the "solidity", "costs", "internal comfort" and "driving quality". Let us now interpret the results in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.3.1</head><p>The measurement model After convergence of the PLS algorithm, one obtains the final weights which allow us to link the manifest variables with the latent variables:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Gsat = 0, 2188 × S01 + 0, 5746 × S02 + 0, 4850 × S03 Soli = 0, 4682 × S08 + 0, 4242 × S09 + 0, 4151 × S33 Conq = 0, 2103 × S04 + 0, 2730 × S05 + 0, 3396 × S06 + 0, 3930 × S28 +0, 3787 × S29 Drivq = 0, 1962 × S20 + 0, 1595 × S21 + 0, 1415 × S22 + 0, 1615 × S23 +0, 1775 × S24 + 0, 1658 × S25 + 0, 1728 × S26 + 0, 1805 × S27 Comf = 0, 1492 × S11 + 0, 1795 × S12 + 0, 1756 × S13 + 0, 1542 × S14 +0, 1667 × S15 + 0, 1424 × S16 + 0, 1282 × S17 + 0, 1457 × S18 +0, 1092 × S19 + 0, 1513 × S34 Costs = 0, 2396 × S30 + 0, 5707 × S31 + 0, 5042 × S32</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents only correlations larger than the mean of the absolute values (0,3723):</p><p>We observe that all latent variables are well correlated with their own manifest. So, the manifest variables "describe" their latent appropriately and the blocks are therefore validated. We see also that the largest correlation (0,8692) is between "general satisfaction" and their manifest "quality in general".</p><p>The R 2 coefficients between connected latent variables are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R 2 (Conq; Soli) = 0, 2889 R 2 (Comf ; (Soli, Conq)) = 0, 3468 R 2 (Drivq; (Conq, Comf )) = 0, 5286 R 2 (Gsat; (Soli, Conq, Comf, Drivq, Costs)) = 0, 2516</formula><p>In this table the most interesting relation concerns the "general satisfaction". For this variable, the R 2 coefficient generated by the other latent variables is 25%, and we consider that as satisfactory because there are 2922 individuals. The correlations between the latent variables are given below in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p><p>We can see that to improve "internal comfort", the producer should concentrate on "solidity" (correlation coefficient = 0,5353) and on the "construction quality" (0,4948). The producer?s efforts for improving "construction quality" also greatly affect the variable "leading quality" (0,5764). In order to obtain a good "construction quality" the producer could concentrate on "solidity" (0,5375).</p><p>We also observe an important correlation between "solidity" and "driving quality". We have chosen not to establish a relation between these two because this relation does not in any way influence the model. Given the causality scheme the determination of "general satisfaction" is a complex procedure in which almost all the latent variables are directly involved. The equation is as follows: The negative coefficient for "driving quality" can be explained by the fact that this variable increases with "construction quality" and the regression coefficient between "construction quality" and "general satisfaction" is 0,2721. This multiplication coefficient is without doubt corrected by the negative coefficient on the "driving quality".</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Gsat = 0, 2721 × Conq + 0, 1678 × Soli + 0, 198 × Costs +0, 082 × Comf + 0, 095 × Drivq</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>Firstly it must be underlined that this study did not follow the logical sequence of steps of the PLS approach: the construction of a model by experts, the construction of a questionnaire using this model, and the collection of customer data using this questionnaire. In our case, we have inverted the process: we have tried to build a model using data that had already been collected with a questionnaire. This fact has obviously effects on the final results which cannot be precisely measured. A hierarchy of the influence of the latent variables on general satisfaction can be established using the structural model: I. Construction quality; II. Solidity; III. Costs; IV. Internal comfort; V. Driving quality. The results obtained for general satisfaction are satisfactory: R 2 = 25% which is a good result for a large sample of almost 3000 respondents.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
