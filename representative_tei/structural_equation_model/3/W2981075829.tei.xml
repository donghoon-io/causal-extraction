<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The advent of metagenomics in animal breeding poses the challenge of statistically modeling the relationship between the microbiome, the host genetics and relevant complex traits. A set of structural equation models (SEMs) of a recursive type within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework was proposed here to jointly analyze the host-metagenome-phenotype relationship. A non-recursive bivariate model was set as benchmark to compare the recursive model. The relative abundance of rumen microbes (RA), methane concentration (CH4) and the host genetics was used as a case of study. Data were from 337 Holstein cows from 12 herds in the north and north-west of Spain. Microbial composition from each cow was obtained from whole metagenome sequencing of ruminal content samples using a MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Methane concentration was measured with Guardian ® NG infrared gas monitor from Edinburgh Sensors during cow's visits to the milking automated system. A quarterly average from the methane eructation peaks for each cow was computed, and used as phenotype for CH4. Heritability of CH4 was estimated at 0.12 ± 0.01 in both, the recursive and bivariate, models. Likewise, heritability estimates for the relative abundance of the taxa overlapped between models and ranged between 0.08 and 0.48.</p><p>Genetic correlations between the microbial composition and CH4 ranged from -0.76 to 0.65 in the non-recursive bivariate model and from -0.68 to 0.69 in the recursive model.</p><p>Regardless of the statistical model used, positive genetic correlations with methane were estimated consistently for the 7 genera pertaining to the Ciliophora phylum, as well as for those genera belonging to the Euryarchaeota (Methanobrevibacter sp.), Chytridiomycota (Neocallimastix sp.) and Fibrobacteres (Fibrobacter sp.) phyla. These results suggest that rumen's whole metagenome recursively regulate methane emissions in dairy cows, and that both CH4 and the microbiota compositions are partially controlled by the host genotype. Recursive models are an interesting approach to disentangle this complex relationship.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The collection of genes and genomes from the members of a microbiota are defined as the metagenome. Its association with complex traits of interest has been previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Marchesi &amp; Ravel, 2015)</ref>. The metagenome is gaining a crescent interest in animal production worldwide for different purposes on several species <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Thompson et al., 2017)</ref>. Previous studies have analyzed the association between the metagenome in ruminants (sheep, goat, beef cattle, dairy cattle, tammar wallaby) and different traits such as methane emissions or feed efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tapio, Snelling, Strozzi, &amp; Wallace, 2017)</ref>. The relationship between the metagenome and the host genotype has also been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Roehe et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Camarinha-Silva et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gonzalez-Recio, Zubiria, García-Rodríguez, Hurtado, &amp; Atxaerandio, 2017)</ref>. Previous studies have analyzed the relationship between the metagenome and the phenotype but ignoring any recursive phenotypic relationship that might exists between the involved traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Difford et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buitenhuis et al., 2019)</ref>. Analyzing the host effect on the microbiota and a complex trait of interest simultaneously, accounting for a recursive plausible effect between them, might be useful because it could lead to more realistic estimates, hence refining the conclusions drawn from these studies. Statistical complexity and limited availability of software capable to deal with this kind of relationship are among the reasons of the lack of studies considering this joint relationship. Thus, there is the need to consider simultaneously the host-metagenome-phenotype relationships. Structural equation models (SEM) could fill the gap in this area. They allow representing recursive or simultaneous mechanisms among phenotypic traits, while provide inference on the magnitude of those relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rosa et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Valente &amp; de Magalhães Rosa, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In SEM a trait can be used as a predictor of some other trait, assuming a functional link between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rosa et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Applying SEM in this context may contribute in elucidating the hostmetagenome-phenotype relationships. They also assist on clarifying the direct and indirect effects of the microbiota on relevant complex traits. This relationship can be either recursive or simultaneous: a recursive system describes an unidirectional effect between traits, with one trait affecting the other without feedback from the latter. A simultaneous system assumes a feedback effect between variables, with changes of a quantity indirectly influencing the quantity itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gianola &amp; Sorensen, 2004)</ref>. Although SEM has been extensively used in animal breeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Los Campos et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wu et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Konig et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">López de Maturana et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heringstad et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rosa et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">De Los Campos et al., 2014)</ref>, their application to host-metagenome studies has not been yet referenced.</p><p>We hypothesized that there is a recursive relationship in which the microbial composition affects the methane production (CH4) and both are under the host genetic control. Here enteric methane is used as a case of study, which is affected by the microbial digestion fermentation that occur in the rumen. Both CH4 and the relative abundance (RA) of the rumen microbes are partially controlled by the host genetics. Hence, it is rational to modelize a recursive effect from RA on CH4, without a feedback from CH4 over the microbial RA. The two traits recursive system include environmental (E) and genetic (U) effects and could be represented schematically as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where a structural coefficient 𝜆 𝐶𝐻 4 ←𝑅𝐴 describes the rate of change of methane emissions with respect to the RA of a given genus in the metagenome. Under this assumption, RA has a direct recursive effect on CH4, which corresponds to the structural coefficient 𝜆 𝐶𝐻 4 ←𝑅𝐴 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(López De Maturana, Wu, Gianola, Weigel, &amp; Rosa, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>This study plains to implement recursive SEM to analyze the host-metagenomephenotype relationship, and to evaluate their behavior using methane emissions in dairy cattle as a case of study. Traditional bivariate models were used as benchmark.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>This study was carried out in accordance with Spanish Royal Decree 53/2013 for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes, and was approved by the Basque Institute for Agricultural Research and Development Ethics Committee (Neiker-OEBA-2017-004) on March 28, 2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Four hundred and sixteen lactating Friesian Holstein cows (primiparous or second lactation) from 12 commercial farms at regions of País Vasco, Gerona and Navarra in Spain were included in this study. Methane emissions (ppm) were measured using a nondispersive infrared methane detector (The Guardian ® NG infrared gas monitor from Edinburg Sensors; measure range 0-1%), installed within the feed bin of the automatic milking system (AMS). Methane concentration in breath samples was measured individually for each cow, during the milking time at each cow visit to the AMS for 2-3 weeks periods. Eructation peaks recorded were averaged to obtain a single record per cow. During this sample period herds underwent a test-day recording as part of the official test day recording scheme. All traits related to milk yield and composition were also available.</p><p>During the ruminal content sampling, cows were placed in individual stalls. A custom made mechanical device was used to raise the snout of the animal. Samples of ruminal content (approximately 100 ml) were extracted from each cow by introducing a stomach tube (18 mm diameter and 160 mm long) orally through the esophagus connected to a mechanical pumping unit (Vacubrand ME 2SI, Wertheim, Germany) with a 1000 ml Erlenmeyer trapped in-between. Samples were then stored in a sterilized container. Hose and all material in contact with the samples were systematically washed between cows.</p><p>Samples were filtered through 4 layers of sterile cheesecloth, in order to remove the solid fraction and the filtered fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen (N2) vapors immediately after. Then frozen samples were transported to the laboratory in liquid N2 containers and stored at -80 °C until analysis.</p><p>The samples were thawed, and then homogenized in a blender. The DNA extraction was performed using 250 µl from the homogenized samples with the commercial "DNeasy Power Soil Kit" (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). The genomic DNA concentrations and their purity were measured by spectrophotometry using a Nanodrop ND-1000 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies Inc., DE, USA) and also the Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, 150 Waltham, MA, USA). 1 µg of DNA sample were analyzed following the 1D Native barcoding genomic DNA (with EXP-NBD104, EXP-NBD114) and ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) protocol from Oxford Nanopore, using the MinION sequencer. This device uses the variation in an ionic current to perform the base calling. This current is distinctively generated depending on which nucleotide from a DNA simple strand passes through the proteinbased nanopores in a flow cell.</p><p>Sequences were analyzed using the open-source program software DIAMOND (double index alignment of next-generation sequencing data), to exhaustively find all significant alignments. This software is based on double indexing to determine the list of all seeds and their locations in both the query and the protein reference sequences database; the two lists are sorted lexicographically and traversed together to obtain all matching seeds and their corresponding locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Buchfink, Xie, &amp; Huson, 2014)</ref>. Next, MEGAN software was used to compute the taxonomical content of the data set, using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy database to assign reads to a taxonomic category <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Huson, Auch, Qi, &amp; Schuster, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Cows were genotyped using the EURO12K SNP chip from Illumina, and then imputed to 54609 SNPs (Bovine 50k SNP chip, Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) using BEAGLE software (<ref type="url" target="http://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/beagle.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/beagle.html</ref>), using the Spanish reference population provided by CONAFE (Spanish Friesian Associations Confederation), as described by Jiménez-Montero, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gianola, Weigel, Alenda, &amp; González-Recio (2013)</ref>. Monomorphic SNPs and those with MAF&lt;0.05 were filtered out from the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grouping and filtering of zero inflated compositional data</head><p>The initial metagenome dataframe contained nucleotide counts linked to 627 taxonomically classified taxa in the 416 samples. Data were summarized at the genus level, resulting in the clustering of 134 genera. Counts in each sample were closured to 100 in order to obtain a relative abundance (%) at the genus level. Then, genera that were not present in at least 70% of the samples were excluded from the analysis, as well as samples that lacked reads from more than 50% of the genera. This hard filter reduced the dataframe to 24 genus plus a taxonomically unknown group in 337 samples. The remaining zeros were assumed to be count zeros and were then imputed using a Bayesianmultiplicative replacement of count zeros through a geometric Bayesian Multiplicative method with the cmultRepl function of the zCompositions package (<ref type="url" target="https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/zCompositions/zCompositions.pdf">https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/zCompositions/zCompositions.pdf</ref>) in R environment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Methane is the second most relevant greenhouse gas (GHG) after carbon dioxide (CO2). It is relevant for global warming because it has a global warming potential ≈ 28 times greater than CO2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Myhre et al., 2013)</ref>, although it remains less time in the atmosphere than CO2 (12 years vs 100 years). Ruminants emit enteric CH4 as a by-product from feed degradation and fermentation processes. In addition to the detriment caused by methane on the environment, the loss of energy associated with the production of methane is an undesirable metabolic route for the productive system, since this energy could be used in other ways directly related to the final product of the system. The CH4 produced is mainly exhaled through breath and eructation to the atmosphere and not seize by the host. It is estimated that the loss of energy for the animal due to methane production varies between 2 and 12% of gross energy consumption <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The daily CH4 production of an adult cow, of the Holstein breed, has previously been estimated at 369 g/d (range 278 to 456 g/d CH4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Garnsworthy, Craigon, Hernandez-Medrano, &amp; Saunders, 2012)</ref> and more recently at 395.8 g/d (SD = 63.5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Difford et al., 2018)</ref>. Values as high as 506 g/d (SD =56) had been reported for this trait in a latter study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ramayo-Caldas et al., 2019)</ref>. A recent result from 28 heifers averaged 267 g/d of CH4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Flay et al., 2019)</ref> indicated that younger cows are in average less CH4 emitters than adult cows. Regarding CH4 concentration, a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wu, Koerkamp, &amp; Ogink, 2018)</ref> reported a range between 543 ppm (SD, 33) to 1,100 ppm (SD, 92), using a different infrared spectroscopy gas analyzer. Those values are in accordance to our estimations (853 ppm, SD = 278). Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Huhtanen, Cabezas-Garcia, Utsumi, &amp; Zimmerman, 2015)</ref> reported CH4 concentrations of 1405 ppm (SD=247) using a sniffer method. A possible reason for our lower values compared to the latter study could be due to the measurement instrument used. Another reason for lower estimation of CH4 emissions in this study could be due to parity; as animals in our study were first and second calving cows instead of adult cows.</p><p>Methane heritability estimates (0.09 to 0.18) were relatively homogeneous across the set of recursive Gaussian SEM.

In dairy cattle, there are many studies associating the metagenome of the host with phenotypic traits. A meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Guyader et al., 2014)</ref> with 28 experiments on ruminants analyzed the relationship between methane emissions and the number of protozoa. They found a significant linear relationship (R 2 = 0.90, P &lt;0.05) in the association of these traits. In a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Delgado et al., 2018)</ref> found that Holstein cows with better feed efficiency had higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, Prevotella, and lower abundance of Methanobacteria and Methanobrevibacter in the rumen microbiota than less efficient cows, concluding that more efficient animals showed different metagenomes than less efficient animals. These findings provide evidence about the relationship between the animal metagenome and the phenotypes expressed by its host.</p><p>The range of ℎ 𝑅𝐴 2 obtained from both models is in accordance with previous estimates of this parameter from previous studies. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Li et al., (2019)</ref> reported ℎ 𝑅𝐴 2 for Firmicutes, (0.16 ± 0.08; mean ± SE), unclassified Clostridiales (0.25 ± 0.09) and Blautia (0.18 ± 0.08), as well as for Methanobacterium (0.23 ± 0.08), Mbb. ruminantium (0.18 ± 0.08), and Methanobacterium alkaliphilum (0.23 ± 0.08). Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wallace et al., 2019)</ref> informed about heritable microbial OTUs with heritability estimates ranging from 0.20 to 0.60.</p><p>The study of the relationship between metagenome and methane production using SEM allows to account for biologically plausible effects between traits, and hence, modelize a more realistic scenario, which could yield to better estimation of parameters and a better fitting of the statistical models for this biological problem. Non-zero estimates for λ CH 4 ←RA indicated that there exist a biological recursive effect of microbes RA on CH4. While some taxa, like ciliate protozoa or Methanobrevibacter sp., increased the CH4 emissions (positive values of λ CH 4 ←RA ), others like Succinivibrio sp. from Proteobacteria phylum decreased it (negative value of λ CH 4 ←RA .These variation between λ CH 4 ←RA could be useful to generate a ranking of ruminal microbial taxa linked to CH4 emissions, which added to the relative (or total) abundance of a given genus in the metagenome, could contribute as a proxy for CH4 predictions at the phenotypic level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological implications of genetic parameters for RA and CH4</head><p>Among taxa analyzed, Ciliate protozoa (7 genera) showed moderate heritabilities (0.28-0.32) as well as positive genetic correlations (0.43-0.56) with CH4, regardless of the model used. Protozoa are known to be associated to CH4 emissions, especially through their ability to produce H2 in their hydrogenosomes and their ability to play a symbiotic role with methanogenic archaea while protecting them from the toxicity of oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Suen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Belanche, De La Fuente, &amp; Newbold, 2014)</ref>. On the other hand, the most abundant genera from Bacteroidetes phylum was Prevotella sp. which resulted in negative correlation with CH4. This is congruent to previous studies reporting that Prevotella sp. is associated with improved feed efficiency in dairy cows <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bach et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The two genera from the Proteobacteria phylum (Succinivibrio sp. and Succinimonas sp.) were only negatively correlated to CH4 in the recursive model, which is congruent to previous studies reporting that lower abundances of Proteobacteria seem to be associated with high methane emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tapio et al., 2017)</ref>. Those two genera had been negatively correlated to CH4 emissions previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Granja-Salcedo et al., 2019)</ref> trough increasing fumarate reductase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asanuma &amp; Hino, 2000)</ref>, resulting in less free H2 and therefore lower CH4. In the non-recursive bivariate model one genus from the Proteobacteria phylum (Succinivibrio sp.) showed positive genetic correlation, while the other (Succinimonas sp.) was negatively correlated. The genetic correlation between CH4</p><p>and the RA of Methanobrevibacter sp. was also moderate positive. There are some inconsistencies regarding the association in the literature between the relative abundance of archaea and methane <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Negussie et al., 2017)</ref>. A possible explanation to this phenomenon could be based on the endosymbiotic relationship from methanogenic archaea to anaerobic ciliates <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(van Hoek et al., 2000)</ref>, in which ciliates provide to methanogenic archaea with an intracellular source of hydrogen as the basis for a stable association <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Finlay et al., 1994)</ref>. The archaea cell walls are structurally different from that of bacteria. It confers archaea more resistance to lytic protocols that work well for bacterial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Roopnarain, Mukhuba, Adeleke, &amp; Moeletsi, 2017)</ref>. This may affect and difficult their DNA extraction. Consequently the archaea relative abundance could be an unreliable indicator of methane synthesis, while a higher relative abundance of ciliates could indicate a favorable ciliates-archaea symbiosis and therefore higher production of CH4. The RA of Ciliate in the rumen is larger than that of archaea, and it may assist on a more reliable estimate of the genetic correlation with CH4.</p><p>New strategies to jointly analyze host-metagenome-phenotype relationship, as the one presented here, are to be developed, with the purpose of integrating the complex biological interrelationships between microorganisms and its link to genotype and phenotype. The magnitude of ℎ 𝑅𝐴 2 and ℎ 𝐶𝐻 4 2 and genetic correlations obtained here indicates that there could be an opportunity to include CH4 emissions in animal breeding programs. In the same way as the λ CH 4 ←RA could be useful to generate a ranking of ruminal microbial taxa linked to CH4 emissions, to be used as proxies; genetic parameters of rumen microbiota composition, including the genetic correlations with CH4, could be used to select individuals that are able to modulate a favorable microbiota composition that pass their genes onto the next generations for lower CH4. Future genetic trends in CH4 could be modified through direct selection of animals with favorable genetic breeding values for RA of relevant microbes. For instance, selecting animals with low relative abundance of ciliates could reduce the substrate for methanogenic microorganisms in next generations. Based on the high heritabilities found for those genus, a decrease of CH4 emissions from the progeny of selected cows would be expected.</p><p>This kind of strategies could enhance the genetic progress of lower values for CH4 in the future populations. Ross, Moate, Marett, Cocks, &amp; Hayes (2013) argued that it is possible that metagenomic predictions could aid in the reduction of enteric methane production from ruminants, if increased accuracy in the prediction of enteric methane production level is achieved. Genetic selection using estimation of additive breeding values is potentially the most sustainable way of reducing enteric methane emission from ruminant <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pickering et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
