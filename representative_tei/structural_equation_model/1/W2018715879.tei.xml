<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A number of studies have shown that e-learning implementation is not simply a technological solution, but a process of many different factors such as social and behavioural contexts. Yet little is known about the important rule of such factors in technology adoption and use in the context of developing countries such as Lebanon. Therefore, the main objective of our study is to empirically validate an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (to include Social Norms and Quality of Work Life constructs) in the Lebanese context.</p><p>A quantitative methodology approach was adopted in this study. To test the hypothesized research model, data were collected from 569 undergraduate and postgraduate students studying in Lebanon via questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique based on AMOS methods and in conjunction with multi-group analysis. As hypothesized, the results of the study revealed perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), social norms (SN) and Quality of Work life (QWL) to be significant determinants of students' behavioral intention (BI). This provides support for the applicability of the extended TAM in the Lebanese context. Implications to both theory and practice of this study are discussed at the end of the paper.</p></div>

INTRODUCTION</head><p>During the last two decades, with the widespread use of the World Wide Web (WWW), universities and other educational institutions have been investing in information systems (such as Moodle, Blackboard and WebCT) to support both face-to-face and remote course delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Although the internet is considered as a global technology, the efficiency of such tools should also be measured locally since users usually work in local/national contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This is more crucial especially in developing countries such as Lebanon where universities and higher education institutions support traditional styles of pedagogy in education due to the lack of financial resources or trained staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> which in turn affect the acceptance of technology within such countries.</p><p>The successful implementation of e-learning tools depends on the perception of the users and also their knowledge and skills in using computers. Such major factors have been shown to affect users' initial acceptance of computer Manuscript received <ref type="bibr">October 19, 2012</ref>; revised December 15, 2012.

TAM's reliability and validity and thus its generalizability are still questionable as it was criticised for its cultural bias especially when tested in non-western countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Additionally, TAM suffers from other limitations such as inconsistencies in previous studies and is still questionable in explaining the social influence on the acceptance of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. To address these limitations, this study will extend TAM to include other determinants such as social norms and quality of work life <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>The main aims of the current study are to address the above limitations. Specifically, our research focuses on the factors that affect student's acceptance and usage of web-based learning systems in Arab culture, particularly in Lebanon as a cultural context and Blackboard as a web-based learning system.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, research model and a summary of the literature review in the field of e-learning system acceptance are provided. In section three, the methodology that guided the research is described. The data collection analysis and results are then described in Section four. Finally, Section four concludes the paper with the main findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</head><p>This paper proposes and tests a conceptual model of e-learning technology acceptance based on TAM, drawing from previous literature that used TAM in an educational context. Additionally, the model extends TAM through the inclusion of Subjective Norms (SN) and Quality of Working Life (QWL) as additional predictor variables. The overall conceptual model is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and the sections which follow explain and justify each of the predicted relationships in light of previous findings from the literature.</p><p>A. Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness Many researchers have used the TAM to measure students' acceptance of Web-based learning tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. For example, Amoako-Gyampah <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> found that the perceived ease of use (PEOU) has a direct and positive influence and effects on the intention to use the system, and his result were also supported by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In contrast, Chesney <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> concluded that PEOU did not have a direct and significant influence on the intention to use the system Reviewing the literature, several studies in the educational context have been found to be inconsistent. Some claim that PEOU had a significant influence on the intention to use the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Another two studies by Saade &amp; Galloway <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and Landry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> considered the student's usage of Web-based learning using the TAM and found that both Perceived ease of use and Perceived usefulness are the determinants for the system usage. They suggest that if students perceive an e-learning tool (in this case Blackboard) to be easy to use, they would also perceive the tool to be useful. All the subsequent studies about student perceptions on using technologies support Davis's (1989) model. In addition, perceived usefulness were found the most influential variable in predicting the intention to use the web-based learning system in TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> while Saeed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> found that PU has an influence on the intention to use but was not the most influential factor. Moreover, literature shows that studies using TAM and models derived from TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> demonstrated that there is a relationship between PU and PEOU and behavioural intention in the acceptance and adoption of technology. Therefore, it is hypothesized that:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Perceived Usefulness will have a direct positive influence on the intention to use web-based learning in the Lebanese sample. H2: Perceived Ease of Use will have a direct positive influence on the intention to use web-based learning system in the Lebanese sample B. Social Norm Impact Usage Behaviour</head><p>Social norm was adopted and included in the TAM model, in order to overcome the limitation of TAM in measuring the influence of social environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. SN is defined as the person's perception that most people who are important to him or her think he or she should or should not perform the behaviour in question <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. SN was studied in some research as an antecedent of BI and in other studies as an antecedent PU. However, as mentioned by Venkatesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> the influence of SN is very complex, This research assumes the effect of SN on BI is highly considered in the Lebanese context. The rationale is based on the cultural index which proposed by Hofstede (1980), He indicated that power distance (PD) and Masculinity (M/F) are high and Individualism (I/C) is low in Lebanon. SN is particularly crucial in a multi-religious, multi-ethnic country like Lebanon.</p><p>There was some inconsistency in the literature about the influence of SN on the intention to use the technology. For example, many researchers found a significant impact of SN on BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, while a number of others failed to find any impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Building on Venkatesh and Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> research, this study will consider only the direct impact of SN on BI. Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> omitted the social norms construct from the original TAM, however SN was added later in TAM2 due to its importance in explaining the external influence of others on the behaviour of an individual. Therefore, SN will be measured by the influence of instructors and other colleagues on students' perception to use the web-based learning system. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:</p><p>H3: social norms will have a positive influence on student's behavioural intention to use and accept the e-learning technology C. Quality of Work Life Quality of Work Life (QWL) was included based in some previous empirical studies in IS in order to extend and improve the TAM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. However, it has not previously been considered within an educational context. In this paper, QWL is defined in terms of students' perception and belief that using the technology will improve their quality of work life such as saving expenses when downloading e-journals, or in communication when using email to communicate with their instructors and friends. Therefore, it is hypothesised that:</p><p>H4: QWL will have a positive influence on student's behavioural intention to use the web-based learning system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Behavioural Intentions for Using an E-Learning System</head><p>The presence of behavioural intention (BI) in the TAM is one of the major differences with TRA. BI is considered to be an immediate antecedent of usage behaviour and gives an indication about an individual' readiness to perform a specific behaviour. In TAM, both PU and PEOU influence an individual's intention to use the technology, which in turn influence the usage behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. There were many supports in the literature for the relationship between BI and usage behaviour in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[32-[33]</ref>, this has recently been extended to the e-learning context <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p><p>H5: Students' BI will have a positive effect on his or her actual use of web-based learning system</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</head><p>A survey was employed due to its advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. This research aims to test hypothesized relationships within the context of technology acceptance in an objective manner where the researcher is isolated from the aim of the study. Additionally, the constructs and their relationships used within the conceptual model were developed and validated thoroughly in the theories and models about the adoption and technology acceptance. Furthermore, this study uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique in order to test hypotheses and moderators and to perform a number of tests such as group comparisons which require a large number of participants. Therefore, using the survey as a data collection method is appropriate from the ontological, epistemological and methodological point of view.</p><p>The target sample for this survey was Lebanese web-based learning system users, studying full or part time for Masters or undergraduate degrees (in a number of disciplines) at two universities located in Beirut. Participation was on a voluntary basis and no financial incentive was offered.</p><p>The current study, as the majority of empirical research in technology acceptance, has used a non-probability convenience sampling technique as it enables the researcher to collect data from the participants based on their availability. It also helps the researcher to improvise with the resource available for the research especially when there is lack of time and financial resources. A total of 1000 self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the students, the number of returned questionnaires were 640 indicating a 64% response rate. We also excluded the incomplete questionnaires which resulted in 596 valid questionnaires. Additionally, all the items (questions) used by this research have been drawn from the literature, where they were quoted to be reliable and valid to measure constructs of the phenomena that they intend to represent (see Appendix A)</p><p>In the present study, the convenience sampling method was employed. This method is the most commonly used method in behavioural and social science studies. It allows the researcher to select the sample subjects from the targeted population based on who are willing and easily accessible to be recruited in the research. It is also the least expensive, least time-consuming among all other techniques IV. RESULTS Also the descriptive statistics showed that the majority of participants indicate positive responses to the constructs that are measured in this study (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>). All means were greater than 5 for the independent variables (PEOU, PU, SN and QWL) and 4.21 for the dependent variables (BI and AU). This comes as a surprise as the previous literature suggests that Web-based learning system in Lebanon is still in its infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sample Descriptive Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Structural Model Analysis and Hypothesis Testing</head><p>Structural equation modeling was used to test all the hypothesized relationships (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>). The estimated values of fit indices have shown the good structural model fit to the data for the proposed research model in this study (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This is clear from the table that all values were in the recommended range.   The research question of this study is focused on the factors that affect the acceptance and usage of web-based learning systems in Lebanon. A conceptual model that extends the TAM to include social norms and quality of work life constructs as main determinants was proposed. This research is therefore the first to find empirical support for these relationships in the Lebanese context. Our results show that all the direct relationship between PEOU, PU, SN, and QWL with BI (with 40.2 % of its variance explained) and also BI with UB were supported. These results are very close to traditional TAM as proposed by Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Different most of the studies that consider western countries, our study supports TAM's reliability and validity in an educational context in the developing world and more specifically in Lebanon. Our results revealed that e-learning is well accepted in Lebanon despite potential problems mentioned earlier</p><p>Although TAM and other user acceptance models have been validated empirically, research continues to add social factors to overcome the limited explanatory power of such models. This study moves in that direction. By including social norms and quality of work life as main dominants, we can describe and understand how the students make their decisions about using and adopting web-based learning system. Our study empathised that e-learning implementation should focus more on the social contexts rather than the technological solution. The freedom to get the course information any time of the day will helps me to have more time for a creative thinking and leisure.</p></div>
