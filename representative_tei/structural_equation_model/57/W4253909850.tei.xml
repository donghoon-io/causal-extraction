<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of anthropometric measures with continuous metabolic syndrome (cMetS) risk score components in a large population-based sample of children and adolescents using a path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This multi-centric study was performed on 3843 students aged 7-18 years who were selected by multistage, strati ed cluster sampling method from 30 provinces of Iran. Demographic, anthropometric and biochemical factors were obtained and standardized residuals ( z -scores) were calculated for MetS components. A structural equation modeling approach was applied to evaluate the relationships among the study variables and to implement the subsequent structural modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The mean age of participants (52.3% boys) was 12.4±3.05 years. Standardized scores of body mass index (ZBMI) and waist circumference (ZWC) had a direct effect on standardized scores of mean arterial pressure (ZMAP) (0.23 and 0.24 in boys and 0.22 and 0.23 in girls; respectively) and triglyceride (ZTG) (0.07 and 0.04 in boys and 0.02 and 0.06 in girls; respectively), but the effect of ZWC was stronger than ZBMI on these variables. Age, socioeconomic status and sedentary behaviors showed a positive direct effect on ZWC (0.01, 0.05 and 0.07 in boys and 0.05, 0.08 and 0.002 in girls; respectively). These variables induced indirect effects on cMets risk score components through ZWC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The magnitude of association between WC and continuous metabolic syndrome risk score components was higher compared with BMI in school-aged children, emphasizing on paying more attention to central obesity in childhood.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adults is generally de ned as a coexistence of abdominal adiposity, elevated levels of serum triglycerides (TG) and glucose, high blood pressure (BP), as well as low serum high density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C) <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2)</ref>. Many studies in children and adolescents use the adult de nitions with modi ed cutoff points for each component which could be the cause of controversial ndings across epidemiologic studies as well as the low prevalence of MetS in some populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. In this regard, using a continuous score has been suggested in children and adolescents instead of a dichotomous one <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Different methods have been used to calculate a continuous metabolic syndrome (cMetS) score from its components including principal component analysis, standardized residuals of Z-scores, and centile rankings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Compared with binary de nition of MetS, cMetS is more sensitive and less error-prone and might increase the statistical power particularly at early stages of metabolic abnormalities (6). Although the associated of obesity with higher risk of MetS is rmly established, it needs to be clari ed at a population level, especially during periods of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The relationship between general and central obesity with MetS components can be better dissected using a multivariate multistage model like path analysis (structural equation modeling). Path analysis model is more complicated and realistic than multiple regression with its single dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. This approach has been previously used to examine the interrelationships among the components of MetS in selected groups of patients and adults (8). Since there are limited evidences that determine the association between anthropometric measures and cMetS using path analysis method and also it is not obvious which of body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC) can better identify cMetS risk score in children and adolescents, the current study aimed to assess association of anthropometric measures with cMetS risk score components in children and adolescents using a path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials And Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p>This study was performed on 3843 students aged 7-18 years who were selected by multistage, strati ed cluster sampling method from 14,138 participant of fth phase of a national school-based study entitled "Childhood and Adolescence Surveillance and Prevention of Adult Non-communicable Disease" (CASPIAN-V). The details of sampling and operation of the study has been described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The study protocol was approved by the Research and Ethics Council of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (code: 194049). Written informed consent and verbal assent were obtained from all the parents and students, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures And Measurements</head><p>The demographic questionnaire was completed for participants. The screen time (ST) was considered as the average number of hours per day spent watching television, leisure time use of computer using a validated questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. For calculating the family's socioeconomic status (SES), we included questions about the following socioeconomic indicators: (a) parental level of education (illiterate: score 1, less than high school: score 2, high school graduate: score 3, academic education: score 4); (b) parental occupational status (unemployed: score 1, worker/farmer: score 2, governmental employee: score 3, self-employed: score 4); (c) number of inhabitants in home, and (d) possessing a family private car (yes/no). Of note for questions (a) and (b) (i.e. parental occupational status and level of education) data from the parent with a higher occupational status/education was considered.</p><p>Trained healthcare providers measured the weight and height of students and parents. Height was measured in a standing position to the nearest 0.5 cm, without shoes. Weight was measured on a scale placed on a at ground to the nearest 0.1 kg while the subjects were minimally clothed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by square of height (m 2 ). Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the point midway between the lower border of the rib cage and the iliac crest at the end of normal expiration to the nearest 0.1 cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Blood pressure (BP) was measured twice using a standardized mercury sphygmomanometer on the right arm after a 15min rest in a sitting position; the rst and fth Korotkoff sounds were recorded as systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. The mean of the two measurements was considered as the subject's blood pressure. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated using the following equation: MAP = [(SBP - DBP)/3] + DBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Fasting blood samples were obtained from students after 12-14 h of overnight fast. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) were measured enzymatically by Hitachi auto-analyzer (Tokyo, Japan) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. The cMetS score was computed by standardizing the residuals (z-scores) of WC, MAP, HDL-C, TG, and FBG by regressing them according to age and sex to account for age and gender related differences. It should be noted that HDL-C was multiplied by - 1, as it is inversely related to MetS risk. The methodology of the cMetS score calculation in details has been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>All variables were checked for normality. Continuous variables were expressed as means (standard deviation, SD), and categorical data as number (percentage). Student's two-tailed t test was applied to compare the mean differences of general characteristics and standardized components of cMetS between boys and girls. The Pearson correlation coe cient was calculated to evaluate the relationships among the variables. Afterwards, path analysis was applied to examine the relation of anthropometric measures with continuous metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Path analysis was applied to evaluate the relationships among the study variables and to implement the subsequent structural modeling. Path analysis is an extension of the regression model that allows estimation the strength and sign of directional relationships for complicated causal schemes with multiple dependent variables (16). Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents our conceptual model based on previous ndings in the literature. Regarding the tness indices of models in path analysis, the preferred value of normed t index, comparative t index, goodness of t index, and adjusted goodness of t index is above 0.9. About the root mean square error of approximation criteria, score ≤ 0.05 indicates a good t, and score up to 0.08 is acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. SPSS-16 and Lisrel-8.8 software were used for data analysis with the application of path analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Totally, 3844 students (52.3% boys; mean age 12.4 ± 3.05 years) were assessed in this study. As observed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, there were no signi cant differences in general characteristics and cMetS score components between boys and girls except for mean age and SES (P = 0.02, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>The correlation among demographic, clinical and biomedical variables according to sex was presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. For boys, ZBMI was positively correlated with ZMAP and ZTG but negatively with age. For girls, ZBMI was positively correlated with ZMAP and ZHDL. In both genders the most correlation was observed between ZBMI and ZMAP (r = 0.228 for boys and r = 0.219 for girls). ZWC in both sexes was positively correlated with ZMAP, SES and ST. There was a negative correlation between ZWC and age in girls. ZWC showed the most correlation with ZMAP in both genders (r = 0.544 for girls and r = 0.571 for boys).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> illustrates the direct effect of each variable on cMetS risk score components according to sex. ST and SES in both groups had a signi cant positive direct effect on ZWC. The direct effect of ST on ZWC was greater in boys than girls (0.068 vs 0.001), while the direct effect of SES on ZWC was lower in boys than girls (0.050 vs 0.084). The direct effect of ST and SES on other outcome variables was not signi cant. Age had a negative direct effect on ZBMI in both genders but it was signi cant only in boys (-0.047). Age showed a positive direct effect on ZWC which was signi cant only in girls. ZBMI and ZWC showed a signi cant direct effect on ZMAP in both sexes, which were greater in boys than girls (0.23 vs 0.22 and 0.24 vs .023; respectively). ZBMI and ZWC were directly associated with ZTG in both sexes. The direct effect of ZBMI on ZTG was greater in boys than girls (0.069 vs 0.018), while the direct effect of ZWC on ZTG was lower in boys than girls (0.039 vs 0.060). Totally in both genders, the direct effect of ZWC was stronger than ZBMI on ZMAP and ZTG. The direct effect of ZBMI on ZHDL was signi cant only in girls (0.059). In order to measure the indirect effects of age, SES and ST on our outcome variables, we analyzed their standardized β of indirect effects. All of these three variables showed signi cant slight indirect effects on ZMAP in both sexes. The results of statistical analysis evaluating the validity of our models are characterized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> which shows the overall tness of four models was good. The path analysis diagrams of association of anthropometric measure and general characteristics with cMetS score components for boys and girls are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We assessed the relationship between anthropometric measures with cMetS risk score components in a large, nationally representative sample of children and adolescents using the structural equation modeling. Path analysis is a powerful statistical model in evaluating a complex cluster of dependent variables. This model is more complicated and realistic than multiple regression with its single dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. We previously in a liner regression model documented that higher anthropometric indices are associated with higher cMetS risk score in children and adolescents (18). Here, we extend our previous work by evaluating the direct and indirect effect of ZBMI and ZWC, as pivotal indices, on cMets risk score components according to sex. Our study also provided new data regarding the effect of three predictive variables including age, sedentary behaviors and SES on ZBMI and ZWC. In this study, sedentary behaviors and SES in both groups were positively correlated with ZWC but not ZBMI.</p><p>Age had signi cant effect on ZBMI and ZWC. The direct effect of age on ZBMI was negative but on ZWC was positive in both genders. It means that in children and adolescents, by increasing age, increasing hours of sedentary behaviors and increasing level of SES, the tendency of accumulating fat centrally increases in spite of not changing or even decreased level of BMI. These results con rm the ndings that WC can change independently of BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Previous studies on children and adolescents revealed that WC is a better marker of metabolic risk factors than BMI and it was shown that children with a high BMI and high WC were twice as likely to have increased levels of TG and insulin and Mets, when compared to those who had a normal WC but high BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, it seems that BMI by itself does not su ce for monitoring obesity and related metabolic complications in school-aged children and it is suggested paying more attention to WC as predominant underlying risk factor for development of MetS in this age group.</p><p>Another point in the current study is the relationship of higher SES with higher ZWC. We previously showed that higher SES was associated with unhealthy diet and inactive lifestyle in Iranian school children <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. During the last decades, because of a rapid nutritional transition in Iran, the trend toward high-calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle has increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. It has been shown that in Iran similar to some developing countries, the children in families with high SES have more preference to western diets such as fast foods and they also spend a considerable part of their time with sedentary entertainments, such as watching television, playing computer games, and sur ng the Internet which in turn lead to more fat accumulation and overweight in this group <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, among different components of cMetS, ZBMI and ZWC showed a signi cant direct effect on ZMAP and ZTG in both sexes, but the effect of ZWC was stronger than ZBMI on these variables. It should be mentioned that in our models, age, sedentary behaviors and SES impressed indirect effects on cMets risk score components through ZWC.</p><p>These results are in consistent with several population studies which documented the close correlation between central obesity and MetS components (28-30). The Bogalusa Heart Study showed that the distribution of central fat determined by WC, was associated with abnormal concentrations of TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, and insulin in children and adolescents at the ages of 5-17 yeas <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. It was shown that the association of BP with WC was stronger than those with BMI implicating that visceral fat is the primary etiological component of excess adiposity underlying the development of adiposity-related hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</p><p>Since high fat mass during childhood and adolescence is associated with higher blood pressure and unfavorable metabolic pro le, childhood nominates as an important period for interventions to manage obesity to minimize long-term metabolic abnormalities. This syndrome may developed by unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, overweight and central obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</p><p>Compared to the previous studies regarding the parameters correlated with MetS in pediatrics, this study has the strength of using the path analysis in a large sample size. However, it had some limitations. First, the crosssectional nature of study cannot demonstrate a causative relationship. Second, the information on SES and sedentary behaviors was obtained by self-report which may affect the estimates by under-or over-reporting. Third, some effective factors on MetS including dietary pattern, pubertal stage and smoking habits were not assessed in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This is the rst study using path analysis to ascertain the association of anthropometric measures with cMetS risk score components among a nationally representative sample of Iranian children and adolescents. We demonstrated that ZBMI and ZWC had a direct effect on ZMAP and ZTG in both sexes, but the effect of ZWC was stronger than ZBMI on these variables. In our models, age, sedentary behaviors and SES impressed indirect effects on cMets risk score components through ZWC. We suggest paying more attention to WC and other central obesity markers in childhood, as the substantial preventive strategy for MetS in this age group.</p><p>Figures</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>General characteristics and continuous metabolic syndrome score components according to sex</figDesc><table><row><cell>variable</cell><cell>n = 3844))Total</cell><cell>Male(n = 2013)</cell><cell>Female(n = 1831)</cell><cell>P-Value</cell></row><row><cell>Age (year)</cell><cell>12.45 ± 3.049</cell><cell>12.63 ± 3.026</cell><cell>12.27 ± 3.064</cell><cell>0.00</cell></row><row><cell>SES (score)</cell><cell>-0.0132 ± 0.988</cell><cell>0.0211 ± 0.99</cell><cell>-0.05098 ± 0.975</cell><cell>0.02</cell></row><row><cell>ST (hour)</cell><cell>1.24 ± 0.654</cell><cell>1.25 ± 0.67</cell><cell>1.237 ± 0.635</cell><cell>0.54</cell></row><row><cell>ZWC</cell><cell>-0.045 ± 1.02</cell><cell>-0.07534 ± 1.06</cell><cell>-0.0123 ± .9628</cell><cell>0.06</cell></row><row><cell>ZBMI</cell><cell>-0.03162 ± 1.0007</cell><cell>-0. 02094 ± 0.99</cell><cell>-0.04336 ± 1.006</cell><cell>0.48</cell></row><row><cell>ZMAP</cell><cell>-0.049 ± .966</cell><cell>-0.044 ± 0.99</cell><cell>-0.055 ± .935</cell><cell>0.715</cell></row><row><cell>ZTG</cell><cell>0.00 ± .999</cell><cell>0.000 ± 1.007</cell><cell>0.00 ± .991</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell>ZHDL</cell><cell>0.00 ± .999</cell><cell>0.000 ± 1.01</cell><cell>0.00 ± .981</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell>ZFBS</cell><cell>0.00 ± .999</cell><cell>0.00 ± 1.06</cell><cell>0.00 ± .920</cell><cell>1</cell></row></table></figure>
