<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A significant portion of the global population is connected via social media, where users exchange consumption experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lund et al., 2017)</ref>. As such, in 2019 over 2.8 billion people use social networking sites in their daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(eMarketer, 2019)</ref>. Of the social media platforms, Facebook is the largest social networking site with more than two billion people using it every month and has become one of the dominant tools for today's businesses <ref type="bibr">(Valaei &amp; Baroto, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stueber &amp; Wurth, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Consumers generate and share brand-related content with others on social networking sites. For example, consumers may share brand experiences, pin the store (brand) location on the map, or share their location in the store (brand); tag posts concerning the brand; participate in contests launched by the brand; or forward online ads or "like ads" to network members. This form of brand content, generated or shared, is referred to as "brand-related user-generated content" (BRUGC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kim &amp; Lee, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bagić Babac &amp; Podobnik, 2018)</ref>. BRUGC is considered a form of consumer engagement which happens when consumers actively recommend a specific brand to network members on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Liu, Burns, &amp; Hou, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Proliferation of BRUGC on social media platforms has a strong impact on the choice and purchase decision of network members <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sabermajidi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kim &amp; Song, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, BRUGC has become an essential source of brand-related information, where users interact with other peers and share their brand experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yang et al., 2017)</ref>. Previous research has found that BRUGC has a direct effect on brand image, brand performance, and purchase intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jin &amp; Phua, 2014)</ref>. Unlike marketer-generated content, which is passive and biased, consumer-generated content is perceived as more credible, unbiased, and trustworthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ertimur &amp; Gilly, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Athwal et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Although prior studies have revealed that user-generated content influences the consumer decision-making process, little is known about the factors that drive consumers to engage in BRUGC on social networking sites. Furthermore, there exists a significant difference in the generating of BRUGC (e.g., writing brand-related experiences, responding to advice or queries on the brand) and sharing of BRUGC (e.g., tagging brand-related posts, articles, and ads; sharing location or pin brand or brand store location in a map). Although both generating and sharing BRUGC involves creation or production of brand-related content by users, activities in which they engage are distinct. For instance, generating BRUGC requires increased consumer engagement with the brand and is more effortful; sharing BRUGC, on the other hand, entails reduced effort. Although factors that drive generation and sharing of BRUGC can be different, scant attention has been given to this issue in extant literature.</p><p>To address the above gaps, the present study examined antecedents and consequences of BRUGC in a hospitality context. More specifically, it explored the role of demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity), behavioral variables (Facebook usage, network strength), and individual motivations (self-enhancement and self-affirmation) on generating and sharing BRUGC on Facebook. Furthermore, it investigated the role of BRUGC on consumer attitude, involvement, and repurchase intentions in a restaurant setting in Malaysia, an emerging market.</p><p>We chose the restaurant sector and Malaysia as the study context for two major reasons.</p><p>First, as reported by Bank Negara in Malaysia, the hotel sector, including the restaurant business, is one of the main contributors to GDP in the service domain with a 5.9 percent growth rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Negara, 2017)</ref>. Second, dining in a restaurant has become a passion for Malaysians, owing to the wide range of cuisines and affordable food options <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kueh &amp; Ho Voon, 2007)</ref>. In other words, eating in a restaurant has become intertwined with Malaysians' lifestyles, as they seek enhanced relaxation, time-savings, and convenience.</p><p>This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, proliferation of social media has led it to become a prominent socialization agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mishra et al., 2017)</ref>. BRUGC allows consumers to engage or interact with network members, thereby influencing their decision-making process. The present investigation thus contributes to extant knowledge on consumer socialization by examining the role that BRUGC plays in consumer decision making.</p><p>Second, the current effort extends prior empiricism on user-generated content by considering both the generation and sharing of BRUGC <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Yang &amp; Wang, 2015)</ref>. Third, previous studies have found that individual motivations influence brand-related activities on social media (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vries et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hollebeek &amp; Macky, 2019)</ref>; to augment understanding of consumer motivations to engage in BRUGC on social media, the present undertaking extends that work by considering demographic and behavioral factors, along with individual motivations. Finally, the present examination expands on prior studies of brand-related activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Muntinga et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schivinski et al., 2016)</ref> by considering the influence of BRUGC on such outcomes as consumer attitudes, involvement, and repurchase intentions. By utilizing an integrated model of BRUGC, this study will help managers in developing effective social media strategies.</p><p>The rest of the article's organization is noted below. We initially briefly describe the user-generated content and consumer socialization theory. Then, the proposed hypotheses are presented. The methods used for developing the BRUGC scale and hypothesis testing are subsequently offered. The findings and discussion of the results follow, along with a conclusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">User-Generated Content</head><p>The advent of social media platforms (i.e., online communities, social networking sites, and blogs) have revolutionized the customer information search system into "a source of community and understanding" <ref type="bibr">(Kozinets, 1999, p. 254)</ref>. Prior studies have shown that peer communication on social media predicts consumer attitudes and behaviors towards brands and products (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barber, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>People use different social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp) to interact with others and share their consumption experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Halliday, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2010)</ref>. User-generated content is the engagement of consumers on social media platforms. It may take different forms, such as videos on YouTube, status updates on Instagram and Facebook, Twitter tweets, and reviews and ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mishra et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>BRUGC is a form of user-generated content pertaining to a specific brand. BRUGC is much broader than electronic word-of-mouth: it includes all resources in the form of reviews, media, location, status, or metadata <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Berthon, Pitt, Plangger, &amp; Shapiro, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The nature of BRUGC varies across different social networking sites <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al., 2012)</ref>. For example, a Facebook wall post is different from a YouTube video. A comprehensive interpretation of this difference would be significant for digital marketers undertaking digital marketing activities of their brands on various social media platforms. Moreover, the differences in social media platforms determine the type of BRUGC in which a consumer engages.</p><p>This study considered both generation and sharing of BRUGC on social networking sites. Generating BRUGC entails the creation and delivering of BRUGC, thus inferring that actual customers develop content (opinions, pictures, videos) about their brand experiences on social media. Sharing BRUGC refers to sharing content-such as links, status, and moodson social media about users' brand experiences. Relative to content generation, content sharing is less effortful; however, it excludes sharing content created by others. In this case, for instance, actual customers (owners of the content) share their status, location, moods, or links related to the brand on their Facebook timeline with their friends and the network members in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Consumer Socialization Theory</head><p>The term socialization refers to the "whole process by which an individual develops, through transaction with other people, his specific patterns of socially relevant behavior and experience" <ref type="bibr">(Zigler &amp; Child, 1969, p. 474)</ref>. This notion of socialization can be transferred to the specific area of consumer socialization, which is the procedure of developing consumerrelated expertise, information, and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ward, 1974)</ref>. Consumer socialization is defined as "the process by which young people develop consumer-related skills, knowledge, and attitudes" <ref type="bibr">(Moschis &amp; Churchill, 1978, p. 599)</ref>. In other words, consumers learn about the consumption environment by accumulating knowledge they receive from the environment, advertisement observation, and interaction with adults or peers. This knowledge then shapes their purchasing behavior as well as their consumer experiences.</p><p>Consumer socialization involves three elements: antecedents, socialization processes, and behavioral consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Moschis &amp; Churchill, 1978)</ref>. Antecedents include those characteristics of the individual that potentially affect their interaction with others, as well as directly affect consumption behavior. Socialization agents include parents, peers, mass media, SNSs, and the Internet. In the socialization process, such agents shape a person's knowledge, skills, and attitude, who will likely later make purchasing/repurchasing decisions. Finally, the behavioral outcomes are observed by the change in attitudes an individual has towards a promotional plan, a product/service, or a brand. The modification in attitude then shapes consumption behavior of that individual or may even affect his/her purchasing decisions <ref type="bibr">(Wang, Yu, &amp; Wei, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>There are several reasons for choosing socialization theory for the present study. First, the social learning approach "emphasises on the sources of influence known as socialization agents which transmit norms, attitudes, motivations, and behaviors to the learner" <ref type="bibr">(Moschis &amp; Churchill, 1978, p. 600)</ref>. Thus, in our work, BRUGC on social media platforms acts as a socialization agent that creates a source of influence on others. Second, because socialization theory focuses on interaction between environment and intraindividual processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aladwani, 2018)</ref>, we argue that, as consumers interact with social media platforms, they are exposed to BRUGC from other network members who might affect their brand attitudes and behaviors.</p><p>Finally, socialization theory states that individuals learn from observing others' participation.</p><p>Thus, we expect BRUGC to impact network members' attitude towards BRUGC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Research gaps</head><p>The present study draws from consumer socialization theory as its theoretical framework in examining antecedents and consequences of BRUGC in a restaurant context. Various research gaps were identified that motivated the current study. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Muntinga et al. (2011)</ref> examined the motivations for engaging in online brand-related activities in an instant messaging setting. They proposed a continuum of brand-related activities, such as consuming (e.g., viewing brand-related videos, reading product reviews), contributing (rating brands, commenting on brand-related pictures), and creating (writing brand reviews and related articles, uploading brand-related videos and images) on social media. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schivinski et al. (2016)</ref> adopted the <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Muntinga et al. (2011)</ref> brand-related activities in developing a scale for consumer engagement with brand-related content. Although these studies offer a typology of brandrelated activities, scant attention has been directed at factors that determine consumer engagement in brand-related activities. Furthermore, because new activities pertinent to brandrelated activities have emerged in recent years, there is a need for further research to enhance understanding about what constitutes BRUGC. Furthermore, prior research was conducted solely in developed countries and considered social media platforms in general. These factors likely affect generalizability of the findings from those erstwhile investigations.</p><p>Drawing on the theory of close relationships, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Simon and Tossan (2018)</ref> examined brand-consumer interactions on social media and introduced the concept of brand-consumer social sharing value. Using a student sample of brands' Facebook page users, they identified four dimensions of brand-consumer social sharing: brand individual recognition, brand community belonging, brand influence, and brand intimacy. The findings of their study showed that brand-consumer social sharing is positively related to media satisfaction and gratification.</p><p>One of the limitations of their research, similar to prior research, though, was that they utilized different types of brands and retailers from various sectors in a single study.</p><p>Grounded in self-determination theory, de Vries et al. (2017) identified self-expression and socializing as motivations for engaging in different brand-related activities on social media. However, a shortcoming of that study was that consumer socialization theory posits that an individual's socio-demographic factors strongly influence his/her behaviors. Thus, there is a need to include both socio-demographic and motivations when examining determinants of consumers' BRUGC on social media.</p><p>Using social response theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Perez-Vega et al. (2018)</ref> found that the impact of brand fan pages with human-like attributes positively affects user engagement of tourism brands. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gómez et al. (2019)</ref> proposed that user-generated content is a precursor to social media brand communication, which leads to airline brand engagement. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kim and Lee (2017)</ref> discerned that recommendations from a close friend generate more product-related information-sharing attributions than recommendations from a celebrity. Though these studies indicate that BRUGC has a significant influence on consumer engagement, there is a need to distinguish between generation and sharing of BRUGC in understanding consumer engagement on social media platforms.</p><p>Combining source credibility theory with the technology acceptance model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ayeh (2015)</ref> proposed a framework of consumer-generated media acceptance for travel planning through TripAdvisor. His findings indicated that combining technology acceptance factors with information adoption enhances understanding of consumer-generated media usage in a vacation-planning context.</p><p>Based on uses and gratification theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rossmann et al. (2016)</ref> showed that senders' prior experiences with a product or service are positively related to user engagement with eWOM. Also, Tsai and Men (2013) found that para-social interaction and community identification induce students' engagement on Facebook brand pages. Additionally, they ascertained that consumers were not meaningfully engaged with branded Facebook pages as there as a one-way communication for consuming the brand-related content of the pages. Given these findings and recent advances in social media marketing, there is a need for further research for examining consumer engagement with BRUGC. <ref type="bibr">Verhagen et al. (2015)</ref> examined the drivers of customer engagement in virtual environments. They found that cognitive, social integrative, and hedonic benefits are the main factors stimulating customer engagement intentions. Their research was conducted in the context of Dutch telecommunications on company-hosted platforms (firm-owned media).</p><p>Thus, the current investigation in the context of earned media (i.e., Facebook) will complement <ref type="bibr">Verhagen et al.'s (2015)</ref> findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hollebeek and Macky (2019)</ref> also used uses and gratification theory to develop a conceptual framework of antecedents of consumer-based digital content marketing. They identified hedonic-, functional-, and authenticity-based motives as driving factors of digital content marketing interactions that are conducive to emotional, cognitive, and behavioral engagements. <ref type="bibr">Hollebeek and Macky (2019, p. 35, 36)</ref> called for "alternative theories other than uses and gratification theory to understand digital content marketing" and indicated that to fill this critical knowledge gap, future research needs to focus on "how are digital content marketing communications created, executed, and disseminated for optimal consumer and firm-based outcomes?"</p><p>In addressing the limitations of previous research, the present study examined antecedents (socio-demographic factors, such as age, gender, and ethnicity; behavioral factors, such as social media usage; and individual motivations of self-affirmation and selfenhancement) and consequences (attitude, involvement, and repurchase intentions) of BRUGC (generating and sharing) in a restaurant context. Shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is the conceptual framework.</p><p>[Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Hypothesis development</head><p>In consumer socialization theory, demographic factors, such as age and gender, are referred to as "social structural variables and they are useful variables in socialization research" <ref type="bibr">(Moschis and Churchill, 1978, p. 600)</ref>. Consequently, the present study examined the role of key demographic variables of age, gender, and race in generating and sharing BRUGC on social media. Prior work has observed that young adults and females are the main users of social media: they are more curious, information savvy, and interested in socializing with others through social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Filieri and McLeay, 2014)</ref>. Similarly, middle-aged adults are more actively engaged in social media and its content compared to others (Ukpabi and Karjaluoto, 2018). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akman and Mishra (2010)</ref> determined that age has a positive impact on average daily use of the Internet and a negative effect on utilization of the Internet for entertainment. Likewise, scholars have suggested that social media usage, as well as social identities, differ across dissimilar ethnic groups or races <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Perrin, 2015)</ref>. Accordingly, we argue that significant differences exist in generating and sharing BRUGC on social media. We propose the following hypotheses: H1: There is a significant difference between females and males in (H1a) generating BRUGC and (H1b) sharing BRUGC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2:</head><p>There is a significant difference between different age groups of individuals in (H2a) generating BRUGC and (H2b) sharing BRUGC on Facebook.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3:</head><p>There is a significant difference between individuals of different races in (H3a) generating BRUGC and (H3b) sharing BRUGC on Facebook.</p><p>Social communities provide an environment in which users can generate content, as well as share various types of content with their friends and followers and the public. Moreover, the quality of such social community, as well as the quantitative measures (such as number of friends and active hours spent on SNSs), has been shown to be related to generating, sharing, and perceiving BRUGC <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barber, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">de Gregorio and Sung, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Iyengar et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Social support theory also elucidates the importance of social connections in social communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coulson et al., 2007)</ref>. Thus, this study sheds light on the differences between generating and sharing BRUGC among different groups of individuals having a dissimilar number of Facebook friends. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee, Baring, Maria, and Reysen (2017)</ref> found that having a greater number of friends on Facebook leads to increased self-esteem and life satisfaction, which influence their social media usage. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pham, Shancer, and Nelson (2019)</ref> observed that millennials having greater levels of social media usage and time expenditure on Facebook are more like to be influenced by content on Facebook. Therefore, we hypothesize the following: H4: The number of Facebook friends (network strength) is positively related to (H4a) generating BRUGC and (H4b) sharing BRUGC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5:</head><p>The amount of time on Facebook is positively related to (H5a) generating BRUGC and (H5b) sharing BRUGC on Facebook.</p><p>Currently, people are taking advantage of SNSs (particularly Facebook) to express their feelings and experiences about their daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Seidman, 2014)</ref>. In fact, Facebook has become such a critical part of individuals' daily lives that some users are addicted to checking news feeds and actively generating new content <ref type="bibr">(Valaei &amp; Baroto, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">According to Zajonc (1980)</ref>, when an individual uses a medium frequently, his/her likes and attitudes are likely to change. This exposure effect can be conductive to excessive usage of social media platforms.</p><p>For instance, Zhu and Zhang (2010) demonstrated that Internet utilization is positively associated with online opinion seeking and opinion leadership. They discerned that a high degree of Internet usage augmented the passion and intention to share service/product-related information. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cha et al. (2009)</ref> ascertained that perceived user experience with SNSs and purchase behavior are positively related. As a result, SNSs use intensity is a predictor of eWOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Balaji et al., 2016)</ref>. Social support theory espouses that the structure and size of an SNS lead to one's propensity to search for social support or give support in the online user community <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Balaji et al., 2016)</ref>. Examining Facebook users in Spain, Rodríguez-Ardura and Meseguer-Artola (2018) determined that a more intense Facebook flow experience results in a higher degree of engagement. The number of minutes spent on Facebook represents the overall usage of a social media platform; Facebook intensity refers to a more active engagement with Facebook--it represents the perceived role of Facebook in an individual's lifestyle and daily routine. Based on the above discussion, intensity of usage of Facebook will engage consumers more actively in generating and sharing BRUGC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the following: H6: Facebook use intensity is positively associated with (H6a) generating BRUGC and (H6b) sharing BRUGC.</p><p>There are two perspectives "self" in modern empirical psychology: (1) as a set of cognitive appraisals and schemata and (2) as a mirror of social evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Deci and Ryan, 1991)</ref>. However, social needs have virtually no meaning without personal needs, also, the fundamental nature of the self reflects the merits of socialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Ostrom, 2014)</ref>. As such, the assessment of self-related merits is derived before creating and sharing content. <ref type="bibr">Yoo and Gretzel (2011)</ref> argued that self-enhancement influences travel-related consumer-generated media creation. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alexandrov et al. (2013)</ref> examined self and social motives as stimuli to WOM and proposed that the transmitter is expected to get social and personal benefits from sharing her/his brand-related viewpoints in terms of expected self-needs and social-needs satisfaction (self-enhancement and self-affirmation). Self-enhancement and selfaffirmation refer to intrinsic motivation of social media users. According to <ref type="bibr">Deci and Ryan (1980, p. 41)</ref>, intrinsic motivation has "its roots in self-determination theories"; and events that augment self-determination (instances that conduce to internal perceived locus of causality) will increase intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Deci et al., 2001)</ref>. Those individuals participating in content generation in Wikipedia, for example, are stimulated by self-enhancement opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Muntinga et al., 2011)</ref>. Therefore, the current study argues that self-enhancement and selfdetermination motivations determine generating and sharing of BRUGC on Facebook.</p><p>Accordingly, we hypothesise that the following: H7: The need for self-enhancement is positively associated with (H7a) generating BRUGC and (H7b) sharing BRUGC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H8:</head><p>The need for self-affirmation is positively associated with (H8a) generating BRUGC and (H8b) sharing BRUGC.</p><p>Consumer socialization theory refers to how socialization agents affect mental and behavioral characteristics of the learner; they do so by providing knowledge and information or building values and norms to follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Moschis &amp; Churchill, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ward, 1974)</ref>. Internet and social media have been suggested as having similar roles as conventional social agents; such processes have not been captured, though, owing to its contemporariness <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wohn et al., 2013)</ref>. BRUGC, as a novel social agent in today's Internet era, has yet to be adequately investigated in this line of thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Christodoulides, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Halliday, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abzari, Ghassemi, and Vosta (2014)</ref> suggested that there is an impact of UGC on social media, repurchase intention, and brand attitude. In a recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kim and Song (2018)</ref> ascertained that, when the experience-centric content is organic, chances are that it motivates favorable outcomes, such as attitude towards brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kim &amp; Song, 2018)</ref>. More recently, Wang, Cao, and Park (2019) found that engaging in community-based activities can cultivate positive attitudes towards the brand, as well as increase purchase intentions. Similarly, Martín-Consuegra, Díaz, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gómez, and Molina (2019)</ref> determined that consumers engaged in brand-related activities on social media influence their own behavioral intentions towards the brand. Therefore, we hypothesise that the following: H9: Generating; and H10: Sharing BRUGC is positively associated with attitude towards the restaurant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lavine, Borgida, and Sullivan (2000)</ref> found that attitude and involvement are positively associated with information-gathering strategies. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sharma and Singh (2017)</ref> showed that brand attitude and product involvement are positively related. We argue that, when consumers have a positive brand attitude, they are more likely to develop a feeling of interest, enthusiasm, and excitement towards the brand. This occurs because brand attitude creates an evaluative judgment of personal relevance towards the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Das, Agarwal, Malhotra, &amp; Varshneya, 2019)</ref>. The relationship between brand attitude and repurchase intentions is well established in the literature. For example, Yeo, Goh, Rezaei (2017) and Hernández-Ortega (2019) observed that attitude has a positive influence on behavioral intentions. Accordingly, we propose that the following: Attitude is positively associated with (H11a) involvement and (H11b) repurchase intention.</p><p>Chen and Hung (2011) found a strong positive relationship between product involvement and customer purchase intention. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Yen and Teng (2015)</ref> determined that involvement is positively related to behavioral intentions towards the brand in the context of celebrity advertisements. These findings infer that, when customers are highly involved in the brand, they are more likely to engage in repurchase intentions-doing so is congruent with their enthusiasm and excitement towards the brand. Thus, we propose the following: H12: Involvement is positively associated with repurchase intention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Measures</head><p>Measurement items were mainly adapted from extant research; slight modifications were made to ensure relevance to and adequacy for the context and purpose of the study. Generating and sharing BRUGC were developed specifically for the investigation using a scale development process consisting of two phases. In phase one, eight in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with active Facebook users. We applied a general inductive coding approach <ref type="bibr">(Thomas, 2006)</ref>. Following the coding process, 25 items were listed that described how customers shared and posted their product/service experiences and opinions on Facebook. This was followed by a two-stage sorting procedure (unstructured and structured sorting), which was used to verify the construct validity of the items. This resulted a 12-item scale for measuring BRUGC.</p><p>The 12-item BRUGC scale was pretested with a sample of 183 respondents; positive restaurant experiences (90 responses) and negative restaurant experiences (93 responses) were used as stimuli. Researchers in social sciences and human behavior, particularly in a service context, have found that a scenario-based survey is a useful tool to elicit people's experiences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rosson &amp; Carroll, 2009)</ref>. The respondents were informed to imagine visiting a restaurant and experiencing a positive or negative experience.</p><p>Before conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA), calculation of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) (value of 0.896) and Bartlett's test of sphericity (P&lt;0.05) revealed that the sample was adequate, and that the data were suitable for factor analysis. Initial EFA results showed that six items had low factor loadings (&lt;0.04) or had high cross loadings and thus were dropped from further analysis. The remaining six items extracted two factors, as expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Procedure</head><p>For the main study, a purposive sampling intercept method was used. Target respondents were individuals who had had their meals (lunch or dinner) at internationally-branded restaurants in 10 selected shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Trained assistants systematically intercepted every fifth potential respondent as s/he exited the restaurant and requested participation in the study. A total of 413 completed paper-based questionnaires were collected from 500 respondents, from which 10 cases were removed owing to a missing value rate of 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, outliers were checked; based on the results, 28 cases were further excluded from the data set. Hence, a total of 375 questionnaires were accepted for data analysis. The sample size was tested using inverse square root and gamma exponential methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ned &amp; Pierre, 2018)</ref>. It was found to have a high-power level of 90%, which is satisfactory (required sample size = 335 using the inverse square root, and 319 using the gammaexponential method). Shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are sample characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Table 1 about here]</head><p>To ensure no systematic bias, both statistical and procedural approaches, per <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref>, were applied to check for common method bias. The results of Harman's singlefactor test showed that the first factor explained 27.62% of the total variance, which is less than the threshold level of 50%. As such, common method bias was not a serious concern in the present study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Hypothesis testing and structural model</head><p>To examine H1a and H1b, a t-test was performed. The results, presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>, indicate that gender does not have an impact on generating or sharing BRUGC. Therefore, these hypotheses are rejected.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref> about here] Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test H2, H3, H4, and H5. The results, presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref>, reveal a significant difference across age groups in generating and sharing BRUGC (thus supporting H2a and H2b). Specifically, we find that consumers between 35 to 53 years old are more likely to engage in generating BRUGC (M = 3.93, SD = 0.68). Alternatively, consumers under 17 years of age are more likely to engage in sharing BRUGC. When testing H3, it receives no empirical support: no significant difference was observed in generating and sharing BRUGC across different ethnic groups.</p><p>[Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> about here]</p><p>The results also suggest that number of Facebook friends significantly influence sharing of BRUGC but not generating BRUGC. This supports H4b, but not H4a. Because amount of time using Facebook was found to be significantly related to generating and sharing BRUGC, H5a and H5b are supported. Specifically, we observed that consumers spending between 10 minutes and 3 hours are more likely to engage in generating BRUGC. However, consumers spending less time on Facebook are more likely to engage in sharing BRUGC.</p><p>The structural model results showed that Facebook usage intensity has a positive and significant impact on sharing BRUGC (β = 0.27, p &lt; 0.01), thus supporting H6b. However, no support was provided for H6a. Self-enhancement was found to be positively related to both generating BRUGC (β = 0.69, p &lt; 0.01) and sharing BRUGC (β = 0.62, p &lt; 0.01). This provides support for H7a and H7b. We did not find support, however, for H8a or H8b regarding the role of self-enhancement's influence on BRUGC. H9 and H10 were supported generating BRUGC (β = 0.16, p &lt; 0.01) and sharing BRUGC (β = 0.26, p &lt; 0.01) have a significant impact on attitude towards the restaurant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>The present study presents an integrated model of antecedents and consequences of BRUGC on Facebook in the restaurant context in the emerging market of Malaysia. Following the scale development of BRUGC, the role of demographic, behavioral, and individual motivations in determining generation and sharing of BRUGC was examined. Findings showed that consumer socialization through generating and sharing BRUGC is driven by demographic, behavioral, and individual motivations, which, in turn, influence consumers' attitudes and intentions towards the brand. In other words, consumers' characteristics determine their engagement in consumer socialization process through generating and sharing brand-related user-generated content, which influences their decision-making process.</p><p>The findings showed that there were no differences between males and females in their generating and sharing BRUGC. This finding is in contrast with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barber's (2013)</ref> findings which revealed that women are more likely to socialize on social networking sites and thus are more apt to engage in BRUGC. A likely explanation for the contrasting finding is that Facebook has become extremely so popular, that there appears be no differences in its usage between genders.</p><p>We found that age is a significant predictor of generating and sharing BRUGC. Our findings showed that customers below 17 years of age and between 17 and 35 years old are more likely to share their dining experience at branded restaurants by tagging people on their statuses, pictures, and videos on their Facebook timeline. Older customers, between 35 and 53 years old, are more active in generating their dining experiences by writing their opinions on their Facebook timeline and sharing it with the public or putting a comment on a restaurant website and making it public on their Facebook timeline. Contrary to our predictions, there were no significant differences across ethnicities in their generating and sharing BRUGC. These results are in contrast to <ref type="bibr">Taylor et al.'s (2011)</ref>, which revealed a significant influence of race on social interactions and the socialization process. A plausible reason could be the study context of Malaysia, which has one of Facebook's highest usage rates in the world.</p><p>In addition, number of Facebook friends has a significant impact on sharing, but not on generating, BRUGC. As such, consumers with a greater number of Facebook friends (more than 300) are more likely to share their dining experiences via tagging people in their statuses, pictures, and videos and even by making them public on their Facebook timeline. However, number of Facebook friends does not lead to significant differences in generating BRUGC through providing opinions and comments about the experience. A possible explanation for this finding is that consumers may be more likely to engage in generating BRUGC when they have strong ties with network members. When the number of friends rises, conceivably the connection strength may be weak with many members; this might impact their engagement in less effortful forms of brand-related activities (generating content in this study). This supposition is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chu and Choi (2011)</ref> who found that number of friends and strength of the bond between network members determines socialization in online communities.</p><p>The results also suggest that amount of time on Facebook has significantly different effects on both generating and sharing BRUGC. Consumers with a greater degree of Facebook time (between 2-3 hours a day and more than 3 hours a day) are more likely to generate and share their dining experiences with their peers, friends, and the public on their Facebook timeline. This finding is compatible with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Iyengar et al. (2009)</ref>, which revealed that amount of time on social media influences one's online social behavior.</p><p>The results of the structural model demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between Facebook use intensity and generating and sharing BRUGC. This finding implies that individuals who intend to express their feelings, opinion, and experiences by creating content (e.g., opinions, comments) and sharing content (e.g., status, picture, videos) about their brand experiences using online communication tend to be active users of Facebook. Our results are congruent with extant work that has discerned increased exposure to an SNS community and online daily routine activities correspond to augmented community interaction that bridges social capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ellison et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The findings also show that both generating and sharing BRUGC are affected by selfenhancement, which indicates that individuals who create and transmit content are motivated by their intention to boost their self-image. From a self-enhancement perspective, writing opinions on a consumption experience and making it public on Facebook; offering comments on a restaurant's website about the experience and sharing it on Facebook timeline; or tagging friends/others in status/pictures/videos while sharing that experience, are ways of improving one's image among network members. This is consentient with previous research which has found that self-enhancement is a motive for positive WOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alexandrov et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the results show that there is no positive relationship between need for self-affirmation and generating or sharing BRUGC. A possible reason could be that one's need for self-affirmation may act as a form of protection when the self is intimidated, which may occur after one has a negative experience with a brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Koole et al., 1999)</ref>. The findings reveal a positive relationship between generating and sharing BRUGC and brand attitude. This infers that attitude has a direct and significant impact on both involvement and repurchase intention.</p><p>Collectively, the relationships between attitude, involvement, and repurchase intention lend support to the consumer socialization process with BRUGC influencing attitude and future intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Theoretical implications</head><p>The present study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, prior work on consumer socialization theory have mostly emphasised the impact of various consumer socialization agents--such as parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Nelson and McLeod, 2005)</ref>, peers, school, mass media, TV, and the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bush et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Moschis &amp; Churchill Jr., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012)</ref>and social interactions, social ties, and attitudes of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Luczak and Younkin, 2012)</ref>. The current investigation adds to the literature by examining BRUGC on social media as a consumer socialization agent. Generating and sharing BRUGC on social networking sites, such as Facebook, may significantly influence attitudes towards the product/service and repurchase intention.</p><p>Second, understanding the effects of age and social structure variables, such as gender and race, provides insight into how consumer characteristics associate differently with generating and sharing BRUGC. This study, hence, bridges the gap between the impact of BRUGC and the process of consumer socialization as an e-socialization agent, besides determining one's behavior (including attitude, involvement, and repurchase intention) towards a product/service. The results contribute to previous research on the importance of online communications and especially eWOM in a service context.</p><p>Third, restaurant services are intangible and are considered as moderate to high involvement in nature. Previous research has chiefly focused on tangible products and on developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dellarocas and Narayan, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Duan et al., 2008)</ref>. This study contributes to the stream of literature by examining antecedents and consequences of BRUGC in a restaurant service context in a developing nation.</p><p>Fourth, previous research on consumer socialization on social media have not focused on a specific industry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Simon and Tossan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schivinski et al., 2016)</ref>. Rather, they have used various brands and product types collectively, thus impeding generalizability of study findings. We address this by contributing to the understanding of the generation and sharing of BRUGC in the restaurant context.</p><p>Finally, prior studies have relied on uses and gratification theory <ref type="bibr">(Rossmann et al., 2016, Hollebeek and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Macky, 2019)</ref>, self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(de Vries et al., 2017)</ref>, attribution theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kim and Lee, 2017)</ref>, and theory of community engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wu et al., 2018)</ref> in understanding consumer online social behavior. The present work addresses the need for "alternative theories" <ref type="bibr">(Hollebeek and Macky, 2019, p. 35)</ref> in examining generation and sharing of BRUGC using consumer socialization theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Managerial implications</head><p>This research will help managers understand the importance of BRUGC as a socialization agent on social networking sites. Specifically, study findings can assist restaurant managers in developing effective strategies for engaging customers in socialization behavior on social networking sites, such as Facebook, through generating and sharing of BRUGC. Results indicate that brand managers can leverage determinants of generating BRUGC, including the need for self-enhancement and users' time on Facebook. while targeting different age groups.</p><p>A campaign directed at actively encouraging generating BRUGC could carry this slogan: "Tell people how awesome you are with the fantastic choice you made, be more in touch with them on your Facebook timeline, and see what they think." Indeed, the implementation of such online strategies conceivably should improve consumer engagement with the restaurant brand.</p><p>To motivate customers to share BRUGC, brand managers could take note of the factors (such as need for self-enhancement, age, amount of time on Facebook, number of Facebook friends) that affect the sharing of BRUGC. A promotional theme aiming at such behavior might be: "Be more impressive by making more friends and tagging them in your unique pictures and videos of your experiences with the brilliant choice you made." For instance, branded restaurants such as Nando's has implemented promotional strategies in Malaysia referred to as "So you think you can pose?" Nando's offers a postcard for a discount to encourage individuals to post a picture with their Nando's meals during their holidays and use the tag "for @NandosMy" (Nandos in Malaysia) and hashtag "for #CutiCutiAyam" (a type of customized chicken meal), as well as tag friends and make the information public on their Instagram profile. Another example of using a social networking site in the food and beverage industry in Malaysia is derived from McDonald's Happy Meal Box design. It is decorated in a style that influences parents to hashtag their opinions about it and to tag their peers to share the experience with them. In other words, the products tell the consumers to share their views.</p><p>Hence, the elements on a product/service design can encourage positive behavior towards content generation based on what is especially appropriate for the respective groups of customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Limitations and future research directions</head><p>The present study is not without its limitations that offer avenues for future research. First, the research developed a scale for generating and sharing BRUGC in a restaurant context in an emerging marketing. Future work could replicate the current undertaking by utilizing the BRUGC scale in different services and in other emerging, as well as developed, countries to examine generalizability of this investigation's findings. Second, the present effort explored the role of demographic, behavioral, and individual motivations as antecedents of BRUGC.</p><p>Because social motivations, such as desire for social reciprocation and maintenance of relationships, can influence online social behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Yang, Zhang, &amp; Gallagher, 2016)</ref>, subsequent empiricism should consider social motives in understanding the generation and sharing of BRUGC. Third, tie (bond or relationship) strength with network members influences online content contribution behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Rishika &amp; Ramaprasad, 2019)</ref>. Thus, further endeavors should reconnoiter the moderating role of tie strength in determining BRUGC on social media.</p><p>Although the present study utilized cross-sectional data, scholars might conduct longitudinal studies to determine the causal relationship between antecedents and BRUGC.</p><p>Despite the shortcomings the present study offers some interesting insights into the factors that determine consumers from engaging in generation and sharing of brand-related user generated content on social networking site such as Facebook. More specifically, we find that age, number of friends on Facebook, time spent on social media, Facebook usage intensity, and self-enhancement are significant predictors of generating and sharing of BRUGC on Facebook. Furthermore, we found that BRUGC acts as a socialization agent by which it influences attitude, involvement, and repurchase intentions towards the brand   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FU5:</head><label></label><figDesc>I feel I am part of the Facebook community. 0.76 Self-Enhancement (SE) (Adopted from Seokhwa et al., 2007) If I share my opinion about the restaurant in Facebook: 0.73 0.75 0.50 SE1: It will create the impression that I am a "good" person. 0.70 SE2: I will receive positive feedback from others about my gesture. 0.73 SE3: I will create a positive impression on others. 0.68 Self-Affirmation (SA) (Adopted from Napper et al., 2009) If I share my opinion about the restaurant in Facebook: 0.83 0.84 0.56 SA2: It will reveal what I stand for. 0.73 SA3: It will make the other person aware of what I value about myself. 0.76 SA4: It will make the other person understand what is important to me. 0.78 SA5: It will make me think about positive aspect of myself.
