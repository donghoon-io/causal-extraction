<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In today's competitive business environment, employees are considered a company's most valuable asset and main source of financial gains and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Singh et al. 2011)</ref>. Thus, employees' job satisfaction is a vital concept in every organization. Job satisfaction is the extent to which employees' jobs fulfil their desires <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jayaweera 2015)</ref>. Greater employees' satisfaction can lead to a healthy workplace and employees' well-being, whereas dissatisfaction brings extremely negative outcomes to the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Halkos and Bousinakis 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Job satisfaction represents individuals' attitudes toward the work-roles that they are presently occupying associated with work motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sarrasin et al. 2017)</ref>. There can be no job satisfaction without motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dawal and Taha 2006)</ref>. Motivation can be defined as a psychological drive that stimulates, directs, and influences individual behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Snepenger et al. 2006)</ref>. It is the driving force behind all of 2015, Ayamolowo 2013). However, very few studies have specifically modelled and empirically tested the nature of the relationship between psychological work environmental factors and employees' job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Arsalani et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Bjorner and Pejtersen 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Kristensen et al. 2005)</ref>. Examining this relationship offers important managerial insights into influencing employees' job satisfaction.</p><p>Given the paucity of literature in this area, this paper aims to explore the association between work environmental factors and job satisfaction, together with the role of work motivation in this relationship. Given the strong need to investigate these proposed relationships in a developing economy, the context selected for this study is that of the commercial banks in Jordan. The following two research questions are addressed:</p><p>RQ1: What is the impact of four work environmental factors (quantitative demands, job insecurity, social support from supervisors, and role clarity) on job satisfaction? RQ2: How does work motivation mediate the association between work environmental factors and job satisfaction?</p><p>Section 1 discusses the literature on job satisfaction, work environmental factors, and work motivation. Then, it formulates hypotheses for examining the proposed relationships. Section 2 details the study's empirical method, through which data were collected from 295 middle and top managers in Jordan's banking sector. After presenting and discussing the results in sections 3 and 4, the last section offers some conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Work environmental factors</head><p>The work environment in which employees operate and perform their daily tasks is one of the most critical factors continually affecting their productivity and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Wilson 2015)</ref>. It comprises two major dimensions: the work itself and the context. Work refers to job characteristics, the way tasks are carried out, and all related activities. Context comprises the physical and social working conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Raziq and Maulabakhsh 2015)</ref>. It can also be perceived to combine three dimensions: the technical, the organizational, and the human environment. The technical environment includes equipment and tools; the organizational environment comprises the organizing philosophies, systems, and practices; and the human environment refers to groups, teams, and peers with whom employees interact. All three should be designed in a manner that encourages employees to effectively perform and interact in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Opperman 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spector (1997)</ref> argues that a positive work environment assures employee safety, motivates and acknowledges good performance, provides job security, induces stable relations among peers, and allows employees to participate in decision-making processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lane et al. (2010)</ref> highlight that numerous factors within the organizational environment, such as salary, working hours, employees' autonomy, organizational structure, and communication between employees and supervisors can all impact job satisfaction. Relatedly, Wen <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lim et al. (2018)</ref> emphasize the importance of a workplace's safety climate, which significantly affects safety motivation and, in turn, safety performance.</p><p>Based on the many identified dimensions of the work environment, two fundamental categories are commonly recognised: physical factors and psychological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Arsalani et al. 2011)</ref>. This empirical analysis focuses on psychological factors, the most commonly analysed of which are quantitative demands, job insecurity, social support from supervisors, and role clarity <ref type="bibr">(Bjorner and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pejtersen 2010, Kristensen et al. 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The concept of quantitative demands in the workplace is defined as the amount of work required to an employee. The possible mismatch between the time available and the amount of time needed to complete the assigned tasks is a potential source of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kristensen et al. 2004</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kristensen et al. (2005)</ref> argued that quantitative demands should be considered in association to some psychosocial factors such as stress, employees' well-being, and some personality factors in order to enhance and facilitate research on this topic and practical workplace interventions.</p><p>Job insecurity refers to the subjective perception that individual's job is at risk or unstable. Since it is often accompanied by stress, fear, and anxiety, it is a key psychosocial risk that can cause significant problems for organizational performance and employees' mental and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Probst et al. 2017)</ref>. Subjective job insecurity often derives from a previously signalled threat that aggravates an employee's perceived fear or worry about the future of their job. There is variation in the extent of employees' dependence on their current jobs because this is governed by economic factors (financial security), transferable skills, and the availability of employment protection legislation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Green 2011)</ref>. Workers with permanent contracts feel more secure than those who have temporary ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Cuyper and De Witte 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The concept of social support has become very popular and pervasive in the analysis of various organizational outcomes, such as satisfaction, commitment, turnover, and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lucas et al. 2009)</ref>. Social support provides employees with feelings of attachment to groups and individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(House 1981)</ref>. Social support can be emotional (listening to peers' problems, providing sympathy and consultation), informational (giving information and advice), and instrumental (help getting the task done) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sias 2009)</ref>. Within an organization, social support comes from two sources: co-workers and supervisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Appu and Kumar 2015)</ref>. Supervisor support is the extent to which supervisors provide encouragement and support to employees within their work teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Griffin et al. 2001)</ref>. It is also the degree to which a manager or supervisor reinforces and encourages training in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Suleiman et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Role clarity concerns the extent to which individuals comprehend the responsibilities, duties, tasks, and expectations of their work roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lee and Lee 2017)</ref>. It acts as a vital enabler in formulating and maintaining collaborative work practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Curnin et al. 2015)</ref> and focuses on limiting ambiguity over exactly what an employee is expected to do <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jackson and Schuler 1985)</ref>. Some studies suggest that working in teams and reporting to several managers can improve clarity in tackling more complex and abstract tasks, but other studies have shown that multiple roles and communication channels may also create ambiguity and conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Henderson et al. 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Work motivation</head><p>Work motivation is an effective tool to enhance employees' performance with respect to organizational, personal, and cooperative goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alhassan et al. 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref> identify competence, autonomy, and relatedness as the three fundamental psychological needs that individuals try to satisfy. In the work environment, two types of motivation are relevant to these needs: intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation derives from work being inherently interesting or enjoyable, while extrinsic motivation is reward-driven behaviour. Rewards and other incentives are used as motivations for specific activities. As such, motivation can assist an individual to achieve job satisfaction and commitment to their role <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahluwalia and Preet 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In the literature, work motivation is analysed according to three major dimensions: intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, and external regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tremblay et al. 2009)</ref>. "Intrinsic motivation" induces an individual to undertake an activity for its own sake as inherently interesting and satisfying; it represents a prototype of self-determined motivations, which lead to the most positive outcomes. "Integrated regulation" refers to the process of identifying with the value of an activity to the extent that it becomes part of the individual's sense of self. This is the most fully internalized form of extrinsic motivation, and so it is said to be autonomous <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tremblay et al. 2009</ref>). Finally, "external regulation" is a non-self-determined motivation, described as doing an activity only to obtain a reward, which leads to negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tremblay et al. 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Job satisfaction</head><p>It is essential for today's organizations to ensure the psychological and social satisfaction of employees, since this should increase their desire to stay with the organization and enhance their work efficiency, leading to increased profitability for the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aksoy et al. 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spector (1997)</ref>, job satisfaction entails employees' positive feelings towards their jobs. It concerns the extent to which employees' physical, mental, and social needs are met, and affects their happiness and levels of productivity and success in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Canan and Oksay 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ayamolowo (2013)</ref> highlights that job satisfaction is an emotional response resulting from the employee's evaluation of their work and work environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Atefi et al. (2014)</ref> assert that job satisfaction is important in terms of the employee's performance, life satisfaction, and quality of life. Moreover, prior research has identified three primary dimensions of job satisfaction: rewards, job stress, and job characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Alarcon et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Clark et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Fairbrother and Warn 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Hackman and Oldham 1976</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Li et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, Wanous et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Yuen et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Rewards are the most used tool to guide employees' behaviour and performance, aiming to attract and retain the best qualified and to keep them both motivated and satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bratton and Gold 2017)</ref>. Rewards have recently been conceptualized as any valued outcome that employees receive from the employer in exchange for their hard effort and contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Henderson 2003)</ref>. Thus, rewards can be financial (often termed "pay") and psychological. Prior research has distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ganzach and Fried 2012)</ref>. Extrinsic rewards are external to the job itself and provide the means to support both personal and family goals, such as living in a nice neighbourhood and providing one's children with a good education. Intrinsic rewards are those that come from within the employee. An employee who is motivated intrinsically is working for his/her own satisfaction and may value challenging work perceived as being meaningful to the company.</p><p>Job (or role) stress refers to anything in the organization that may be detrimental to individual health and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Devi and Rani 2016)</ref>. Job stressors predict job dissatisfaction and higher turnover intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fairbrother and Warn 2003)</ref>. The costs of the stress manifested at the individual and organizational level ultimately influence also society at large <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Petreanu et al. 2013)</ref>. Seckin-celik and Coban (2016) highlight several factors that might contribute to increase the level of stress. These factors can be intrinsic to the job (e.g. workload, time pressure, poor physical working conditions) or related to the organization (e.g. role conflict or ambiguity), career development (lack of job security and over/under promotion), relationships at work (e.g. poor relations with managers or colleagues), or organization climate (e.g. policies or level of participation in decision-making).</p><p>Regarding job characteristics, the content and nature of a job can positively influence job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bhattacharya and Sengupta 2007)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hackman and Oldham (1976)</ref>, job characteristics comprise five core dimensions: skill variety, autonomy, task identity, feedback, and task significance. These dimensions represent the degree to which an employee's task entails variety in activities, constitutes a whole process, impacts on other tasks, and gives freedom in decision-making (Na-Nan and Pukkeeree 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Development of model and hypotheses</head><p>The main premise of the paper is that an organization with the right work environmental factors to promote a healthy workplace is likely to motivate its workforce, which is likely to result in greater employees' satisfaction and well-being. The model is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.1.">Work environmental factors and job satisfaction</head><p>One of the major challthe enges for an organization is to satisfy its employees, especially with dynamic changes in the modern work environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Raziq and Maulabakhsh (2015)</ref> found a positive relationship between work environment and employee job satisfaction. Similarly, in a study of Ghana's banking sector, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agbozo et al. (2017)</ref> found that the physical, social, and psychological environment of the workplace has a significant effect on employees' job satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Singh et al. (2011)</ref> suggest that healthy work environment factors are those physical and psychological conditions, procedures, structures, relationships, and policies that positively influence employees' satisfaction, motivation, and performance in the workplace. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H 1 : Work environmental factors such as quantitative demands, job insecurity, social support from supervisors, and role clarity are positively associated with job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.2.">Work environmental factors and work motivation</head><p>Work motivation and environment have been identified as key factors affecting performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Muchtar (2017)</ref> examined the effect of the work environment on work motivation and the effect of both on business performance. A good work environment in which employees are conducting an optimal, healthy, safe, and comfortable job in conjunction with high motivation to work was found to influence organizational performance positively and, in turn, the achievement of organizational goals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jayaweera (2015)</ref> explored the relationship between work environmental factors and job performance among hotel workers focusing on the role of work motivation. Working conditions and work motivation were both found to be important predictors of job performance, Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H 2 : Work environmental factors such as quantitative demands, job insecurity, social support from supervisors, and role clarity are positively associated with work motivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.3.">Work motivation and job satisfaction</head><p>One of the major challenges for a business company is to satisfy its employees in an ever-changing and evolving environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Raziq and Maulabakhsh (2015)</ref> examined the relationship between work motivation and job satisfaction in educational, banking, and telecommunications organizations in Pakistan. Their study revealed a positive relationship between work environment and job satisfaction. Motivation derives from the nature of work, the sense of achievement obtained from work, and the related rewards. Managers should pay attention to ensuring that the motivational factors help employees to find their worth with respect to the value given to them by the organization. This, in turn, will increase employees' motivational levels and ultimately raise their happiness, which will cause job satisfaction. Furthermore, work motivation is likely to result in greater employees' loyalty, commitment, efficiency, and productivity. Given these considerations, the following hypothesis is proposed: H 3 : Work motivation is positively associated with job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.4.">Mediating effect of work motivation</head><p>The work environment is one aspect of the organization perceived by its employees. It can influence employees' behaviour and level of job satisfaction. Meanwhile, motivation Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The conceptual framework of the study also plays a considerable role in influencing employees to deliver high performance and achieve satisfaction in their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Raziq and Maulabakhsh 2015)</ref>. Motivation concerns employees' willingness to devote extensive efforts to accomplishing the organization's goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tremblay et al. 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Utami et al. (2016)</ref> assert that work environmental factors can affect work motivation. If an organization's work environment combines ideal quantitative demands, a high level of role and duty clarity, and social support and assistance through supervisors or managers, then employees will be encouraged and motivated to produce their best for the company, which in turn fosters job satisfaction. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H 4 : Work motivation significantly mediates the relationship between work environmental factors and job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Sample and procedures</head><p>The data were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to middle and top managers in Jordanian commercial banks. The banking sector was selected because banks tend to compete with each another, and it is imperative to adopt leading edge technology, and employ high skilled labour force while investing heavily in improving the work environment that has been characterized by a rapidly changing environment. For instance, the banking sector is considered the first mover in the market, and so needs to develop and maintain a healthy motivating environment that supports and satisfies employees to maximise their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Al-Fayoumi and Abuzayed 2009)</ref>. The research population comprised over 1,000 employees across 13 commercial banks listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) in Jordan. For this population, a sample of 278 is considered representative <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sekaran and Bougie 2013)</ref>. The units of analysis for this study are all middle and top managers.</p><p>The questionnaire survey was face-validated by three professors of Organisational Behaviour and pilot tested on 25 managers from Jordanian commercial banks, of whom 24 returned valid responses. Based on the professors and managers' feedback, the sequencing and language of the questions were modified. In the finalised questionnaire, all respondents were asked to evaluate their agreement or disagreement with each statement on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Based on proportional sampling, 500 questionnaires were distributed across the 13 banks. In each bank, the questionnaires were distributed to employees using simple random sampling. The number of returned questionnaires, 295, with a response rate of 59% is suitable for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Measurements</head><p>Work environmental factors were measured with an 18item scale that covers four dimensions: quantitative demands, job insecurity, social support from supervisors, and role clarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bjorner and Pejtersen 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Kristensen et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Rosário et al. 2017)</ref>. To measure work motivation, a nine-item scale was used, comprising three items for each of three dimensions: intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, and external regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gagné et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">, Tremblay et al. 2009</ref>). Finally, job satisfaction was measured with a 13-item scale covering three dimensions: job characteristics, rewards, and job stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Yuen et al. 2018</ref>). The final construct measures are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Validity and reliability</head><p>To confirm construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used. EFA was executed using principal component analysis and the Promax rotation method. To examine whether the data collected were appropriate for factor analysis, both the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's test of sphericity were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al. 2010)</ref>. The KMO and Bartlett's results confirm that factor analysis is suitable: the KMO statistics of all the constructs exceeded 0.50, and Bartlett's test revealed significant statistics for all the scales (p &lt; 0.05). The pattern matrix showed ten distinct factors with loadings larger than 0.40 and eigenvalues larger than one.</p><p>Based on these EFA results, a CFA was performed. The findings revealed a good fit: Chi-square to degrees of freedom (CMIN/DF) = 2.12; goodness-of-fit index (GFI) = 0.921; comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.919; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.062 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Moreover, following the guidelines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>, composite reliability (CR) was examined to measure internal consistency reliability. For each of the constructs, the CR value exceeded 0.60, confirming that the measurement model has internal consistency reliability. Further, convergent validity was assessed using the average variance extracted (AVE). Each construct was found to have an AVE value exceeding 0.50, which represents excellent convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Byrne 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Hair et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>To confirm the reliability of the measurement scales, Cronbach's α tests were conducted for each scale. The Cronbach's α coefficients for every scale exceeded 0.70, which demonstrates adequate internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al. 2010)</ref>. The final construct items are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Discriminant validity, maximum shared variance (MSV), average shared variance (ASV), and inter-construct correlations were calculated to ensure that the square root of each AVE value exceeded the absolute correlation value between that construct and other constructs. Since both MSV and ASV are less than their corresponding AVEs, there is strong support for discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al. 2010</ref>) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Structural equation modelling (SEM) using Amos 24 was used to test the research hypotheses. The first step was to test the direct effect of work environmental factors on job satisfaction (H 1 ) without including the mediating variable (work motivation). The estimate of the standardized regression weight (beta value) from work environmental factors to job satisfaction was positive and significant (β = 0.692, P &lt; 0.01); consequently, H 1 was supported. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> illustrates the test result.</p><p>To test the other hypotheses and the mediating effect, the mediation analysis approaches of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> and Hayes (2013) were adopted. Including mediation in the model reduced the effect of work environmental factors on job satisfaction (β = 0.257, p &lt; 0.001). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref>, work motivation partially mediates the relationship between work environmental factors and job satisfaction. Mediation was also tested using a bootstrapping re-sampling method <ref type="bibr">(Shrout and Bolger 2002)</ref>. A total of 5,000 bias-corrected bootstrapping resamples with a 95% confidence interval were generated in the path model. The presence of the indirect effect in the 95% confidence interval confirms that the mediating effect is valid <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hayes 2013)</ref>.

Also, the effect of work motivation on job satisfaction was significant (β = 0.352, P &gt; 0.05); therefore, H 3 is supported. The goodness-of-fit indices for this model are acceptable: the CMIN/DF value of 2.806 implies a statistically significant effect at the 0.01 level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This study proposed four hypotheses to examine the effect of work environmental factors on job satisfaction, with work motivation as a mediating variable. The study's results indicate that work environmental factors positively affect the dimensions of job satisfaction, consistent with prior research (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abualrub et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Agbozo et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Ayamolowo 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Bojadjiev et al. 2015)</ref>. This finding highlights the essential role of work environmental factors (specifically quantitative demands, job insecurity, social support from supervisors, and role clarity) in promoting job satisfaction.</p><p>More specifically, quantitative demands that ideally balance available time and the amount of work to be done reinforce job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kristensen et al. 2004</ref>). Job insecurity, as the perceived threat of losing one's job based on organizational cues or fears about the future of the role, is associated with increased job stress, fear, and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Probst et al. 2017)</ref>, and so lower job satisfaction. Conversely, more extended social support from supervisors or managers and higher clarity in the role and its duties influence positively job satisfaction in terms of rewards, job characteristics, and job stress reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Suleiman et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The findings also reveal that work environmental factors positively affect work motivation, consistent with prior studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dawal and Taha 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Jayaweera 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Muchtar 2017)</ref>. A work environment that sets clear expectations regarding individuals' work roles, and offers positive emotional and material aids to the employees (i.e. social support from supervisors) will positively influence the individuals' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to work to achieve organizational goals. By contrast, in a work environment characterised by job insecurity, employees might act as requested, or at least go through the motions of performing assigned tasks, only to obtain a reward (external regulation), but are unlikely to have self-determined motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tremblay et al. 2009)</ref>. The results also provide strong evidence that work motivation, in terms of intrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, and external regulation, positively affects job satisfaction, again consistently with prior studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Raziq and Maulabakhsh 2015)</ref>. This demonstrates that motivation plays an integral part in job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dawal and Taha 2006)</ref>. Accordingly, managers should pay close attention to ensuring that their employees work in an appropriate and motivating environment, since motivation increases employees <ref type="bibr">' loyalty, commitment, and job satisfaction.</ref> This study also confirmed the mediating role of work motivation in the association between work environmental factors and job satisfaction, consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Elnaga (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jayaweera 2015, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Muchtar (2017)</ref>. As discussed earlier, the work environment combines the work itself and the contextual factors that foster or inhibit job satisfaction through the level of motivation. To achieve competitive advantages in any work environment, work environmental factors (such as job security, social support from supervisors, role clarity, and quantitative demands that optimally balance between available time and the amount of work), and a highly motivated workforce are needed to boost employees' job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tremblay et al. 2009</ref>). As such, work motivation is closely related to work environmental factors and positively affects job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This paper aimed to explore empirically how non-physical work environmental factors affect job satisfaction through the mediating role of work motivation. For this purpose, it focused on 13 commercial banks operating in Jordan. This is among the first studies to investigate how psychological factors related to the work environment affect work motivation and job satisfaction.</p><p>A comprehensive review of the literature identified the underlying dimensions associated with work environmental factors, job satisfaction, and work motivation, thus informing the development of a conceptual model focused on work psychological attributes. By identifying the conceptual relations among work psychological attributes, this Note: ***: p &lt; 0.001; a : indirect effect; b : direct effect. The results of SEM analysis revealed that work motivation positively and significantly mediates the association between work environmental factors and job satisfaction. This finding is attributable to the work itself and contextual factors contributing to employees' positive feelings towards their jobs through work motivation. The findings also confirm a positive and significant effect of work environmental factors on work motivation, and that work motivation subsequently enhances job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>The theoretical and managerial contributions of this study are twofold. First, by formulating a comprehensive model of the work environmental factors, this paper contributes to theory and practice. The study's findings potentially provide inputs to the policy-makers in Jordanian commercial banks, helping them realize its work environment and development. The study extends research in the area of work motivation and job satisfaction and offers a set of measures to assess those variables, helping researchers and practitioners to develop empirical and action studies that explore more deeply the proposed effects.</p><p>Second, the study's supported hypotheses can practically help commercial bank managers to improve work motivation and job satisfaction. The study underscores that work environmental factors (such as job insecurity) and lower work motivation (such as external regulation) lead towards lower job satisfaction. Therefore, if the existing scenario (job insecurity and low work motivation) persists and remains unaddressed in Jordan's commercial banks, it could lead to a discouraging work environment and serious issues of employees' work-related stress. Also, it could determine a breakdown in employees' job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>This research is not free from limitations. First, the questionnaire survey was directed only to commercial banks in Jordan. Measuring middle and top managers' perceptions in a single industry allows for maximal control over the contextual and psychological work environment. However, it limits the external generalizability of the study's findings. Future research should expand this study's approach across various industries to enhance generalizability.</p><p>Secondly, the study employed a cross-sectional research design to answer the two research questions. While this comprehensively served the study's purpose, it has the weakness of single-impression data. Future research could address this by using a longitudinal research design.</p><p>Another possible area to explore is the moderating effects within the proposed framework. For instance, we examined the association between work environmental factors and job satisfaction, but other aspects might influence their relationships as well. Future studies should further investigate the work environmental factors that contribute to create a sense of confidence and loyalty toward the organization and improve the quality of outcomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
