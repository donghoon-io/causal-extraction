Several reforms and plans have been introduced in France, since the early 1990s for instance, to foster in particular the employment of older workers <ref type="bibr">(more precisely in 1993, 2003, 2010 and 2014)</ref>. Positive results<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> have been observed regarding the rate of employment of older workers in recent years in the southern half of European countries. Besides the economic and legal spheres, organizational policies are Retirement issues certainly also affected by a renewed vision of retirement and retirees <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Van Soligne and Henkens, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Christin and Peretti, 2005)</ref>. In the past, Instead of considering retirement was considered as a private matter and and it was assumeding that employees preferpreferred to retire early <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Henkens et al., 2009)</ref>. Nowadays, organizations can benefit from a skilled and experiencedn aging population if by developing a comprehensive suite of management strategies intended that to maintain and attract a motivated older workforce are implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Shacklock and Brunetto, 2011)</ref>. Besides the economic and legal spheres, organizational policies are also affected by a renewed vision of retirement and retirees <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Vough et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Van Soligne and Henkens, 2014)</ref>. Formerly, retirement was synonymous with the absence of paid employment among older employees <ref type="bibr">(Shultz, 2003)</ref>. Nowadays, confirming the conceptualization of retirement as a process that evolves over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Beehr, 1986)</ref>, the transition to full retirement is comprised of older workers can consider different pathways when transitioning into full retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jones and McIntosh, 2010)</ref>, including the form of work exercised during retirement known as "bridge employment." Unlike full retirement that refers to a complete and definite withdrawal from the labor market, bridge employment concerns older workers taking up employment after they retire from their main career jobs.</p><p>Bridge employment can be exercised either part time or full time, in the same or in a different field to the career job <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Feldman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Feldman and Beehr, 2011)</ref> and is becoming very common among older workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Greenwald, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Olleman, 2006)</ref>. Bridge employment has become a valid retirement option for many older workers. For example, a study conducted in 2005 on individuals aged 50 years and over concluded that four out of five older workers were interested in bridge employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Olleman, 2006)</ref>. In another study, 78% of employees said they expected to continue working in some capacity during their retirement years <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Greenwald, 2004)</ref>. Further, research suggests that bridge employment is becoming a popular career choice for older workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Greenwald, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond the benefit of allowing organizations to keep skilled and experienced employees <ref type="bibr">(Shacklock and Bunetto, 2011)</ref>, bridge employment is also beneficial for individuals as it enhances life satisfaction during the retirement years <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Wang and Shultz, 2010)</ref>, as well asand is positively related to physical and psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Zhan et al., 2009)</ref>. Also, It fulfills the need for both social contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Lancee and Radl, 2012)</ref> and generativity by allowing older workers to mentor younger employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kerr and Armstrong-Stassen, 2011)</ref>. Given the potential benefits of bridge employment at both individual and organizational levels, several scholars called for research on organizations would do well to examine the mechanisms leading why highly skilled older employees to decide to pursue their careersby holding a career bridge employmentrather than to decide to fully retire <ref type="bibr">(Bennet et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wang and Shultz, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Zanibioni et al., 2010)</ref>. Developing</p><p>In that perspective, conceptual models that take differentintegrating different retirement intentions into consideration can give us more insights into the issueneed to be developed.</p><p>Several studies have identified aBoth Acknowledged antecedents of retirement intentions include . Attention has mainly been paid to the identification of personal variables (e.g. health: <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Talaga and Beehr, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Taylor and Shore, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">financial situation: Adams, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mariappanadar, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">marital quality: Davis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Henkens and Leenders, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">personality trait: Schwaba and Bleidorn, 2018)</ref> and more recently, the identification of organizational variables (e.g. organizational commitment: <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jones and McIntosh, 2010</ref>; Job satisfaction, Work stress: <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> self-directed career attitude: <ref type="bibr">DeVos and Segers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">organizational tenure: Davis, 2003)</ref> have been shown to influence the different retirement pathways. For example, <ref type="bibr">Davis (2003)</ref> found that married retirees and those who had longer organizational tenure were more likely to full retire than to engage in career bridge employment. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang et al. (2008)</ref> found that retirees who were younger, had better health, were more educated, were less stressed and more satisfied at preretirement jobs, and thought less about retirement, were more likely to engage in bridge employment than full retirement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang et al., (2008)</ref>, findings from previous research suggest that individual variables, such as financial situation or health, may not be the primary driving force for people taking up bridge employment against full retirement. In other words, older employees who intended to look for a bridge employment may bewere more driven motivated by the nature of the work environment (e.g. job design) and individual attitudes (e.g. organizational commitment) than by weak financial situation or poor health. So far, Thus, more research is needed to explore the effects of work-related variables on retirement intentions. Furthermore, prior research that has studiedon work-related variablesantecedents, has explored individual and organizational characteristics separately. However, variations in retirement intentions may not result precisely from the interaction between just the person and or his or her work environment but rather from the link between both aspects. There may not be "one best environment" for older employees, but situations of fit or misfit between employees and their work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Wang and Shultz, 2010)</ref>. Despite the large body of research on the individual's relationship with his or her work environment in the study of organizational behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Schneider, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schneider et al., 1998)</ref>, and its considerable explanatory power in predicting human organizational behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Van Vianen, 2018)</ref>, there is surprisingly little research was done on the role of the individual-work environment interaction in determining retirement intentions (for an exception, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Oakman and Wells, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, this study participates main contributions to to the literature on retirement are targetedin two ways which include theoretical and managerial contributions. First, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Topa and Alcover (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jones and McIntosh (2010)</ref>this study considers the complexity of retirement intentions is considered by distinguishing the intention to opt for full retirement from the intention to occupy some form of bridge employment, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Topa and Alcover (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jones and McIntosh (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Zanibioni et al. (2010)</ref>. In this study, , we mainly focus on career bridge employment as this form of employment can help address labor shortages <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jones and McIntosh, 2010)</ref> and allow older workers to fully express their human capital potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gobeski and Beehr, 2009)</ref>. Our This choice is also motivated by the current need for executives in France: according to APEC<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> forecasts (2018), French enterprises should hire more than 230,000 executives need to be hired each year 13% more executives than in 2017 by the end of 2018 with 270,000 recruitments. This number in 2018 significantly exceeds the first pre-crisis level and the andhiring trend should continue in 2019, significantly exceeding the first pre-crisis level. In this context, given the knowledge and skills held by older executives, understanding the organizational factors influencing career bridge employment is of particular interest for recruiting companies.</p><p>Second, responding to the call by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wang and Shultz (2010)</ref>, this study adopts an interactionist perspective based on the theory of Person-Environment (P-E) fit. As suggested by previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cable and DeRue, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Greguras and Diefendorff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Yu, 2016)</ref>, it contributes to the P-E fit literature by exploring how different types of P-E fit predict retirement behavioral intentions.. Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cable and DeRue, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Greguras and Diefendorff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Yu, 2016)</ref>. called for a consideration of the multidimensionality of fit by examining human behaviors at work. The present study adopts a similar this integrative approach by considering the three main conceptualizations of fit proposed in by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kristof (1996)</ref> widely cited review: Needs-Supplies, Demands-Abilities and Value congruence. This approach should provide multilevel guidance for managerial actions to maintain older workers' participation in organizational performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Retirement intentions</head><p>An older worker began to develop expectations and to express intentions about his future retirement projects well before the effective departure to retirement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ekerdt (1998)</ref> identifies an anticipation phase of retirement that lies between 50 and 55, when the older worker begins to organize his life around his retirement projects. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kosloski et al. (2001)</ref>, the planning of retirement in its first stages can be depicted as an intention regarding the desired form that it will take. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Beehr (1986)</ref> in his well-recognized model of retirement antecedents considers retirement intention to be the first antecedent of retirement behavior.</p><p>The use of intentions is motivated by both theoretical and practical reasons.</p><p>First, from the perspective of planned behavior theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, intention is central in the determination of actual behavior. Also, the intention to retire has been shown to be an effective antecedent of retirement behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Henkens and Tazelaar, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van Soligne and Henkens, 2007)</ref>. For example, through a longitudinal study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Henkens and Tazelaar (1997)</ref> show that 83% of those who have expressed the intention to take early retirement realize this intention by actually leaving their jobs three years later. Second, from a practical perspective, the use of intentions offers intervention margins to managers, especially for those who want to maintain older wokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Zanibioni et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>During career transitions, individuals deal with disruptions that involve loss of resources such as skills, relationships and identity. They may be tempted to minimize these losses through the use of different strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ashforth's (2001)</ref> Role Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashforth, 2001)</ref> and Continuity Theory <ref type="bibr">(Atchley, 's (1989)</ref> Continuity Theory both provide an explanatory framework of retirement intentions based on past work experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role theory and continuity theories</head><p>During career transitions, individuals deal with disruptions that involve loss of resources such as skills, relationships and identity. They may be tempted to minimize these losses through the use of different strategies. Role Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashforth, 2001)</ref> and Continuity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref> Continuity Theory both provide an explanatory framework of retirement intentions based on past work experiences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ashforth's (2001)</ref> Role Theory focuses on role identity and the role transition process.</p><p>Role identity is a set of goals, values, beliefs, norms, interaction styles and time horizons. Thus, identification is encouraged when the role occupant defines him or herself entirely or partially in terms of perceived role identity. As passing from work to retirement can be viewed as a role transition, role theory is relevant to the study of retirement decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Barness-Farell, 2003)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ashforth's (2001)</ref> Role Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashforth, 2001)</ref>, retirement means vanishing from a work-related role identity. This loss of identity related to professional role can be a source of stress at retirement. Conversely, professional workers who feel that work gives meaning to their livesidentify themselves with their professional roles tend to take later retirements and even prefer to avoid retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barnes-Farrell, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ashforth (2001)</ref>, role identity can is built from one or several foci of identification (i.e. vocation, organization, organizational job and workgroup). Different employee populations may build their role identities largely from one or several of these foci of identification This leads us to suggest thatTherefore, if work role identity is central to global an individual's identity, older workersthis person should will be inclined to pursue a professional activity once retired from their his or her career job, preferably in the dominant focus of identification. Otherwise, the transition will should be oriented toward extraprofessional roles that are valued at the time of retirement (i.e. associative activities or volunteering). As a complement to identity preservation, continuity theory explains the dynamics of retirement intentions with the preservation of accustomed strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuity theory</head><p>Atchley's (1989) Continuity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref> posits that individuals search for continuity in their personal and professional trajectories: they can maintain and preserve internal (e.g. ideas, emotions) and external (e.g. social and physical environment) structures by using strategies they know in familiar domains. After retirement, people who leave their career employment remain the same psychologically; that is, they still have the same likes, dislikes, temperament and inclinations; , and consequently, they still engage in the same activities, sometimes including work in similar jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gobeski and Beehr, 2009)</ref>. As full retirement involves the loss of the work environment, older workers search for strategies to ensure continuity. Continuity can be found either internally or externally. Internal continuity refers to the stability of internal structures (i.e. psychological dispositions and structures, temperament, knowledge) in relation to past experiences. It corresponds to the individual's ability to connect internal changes (e.g. ideas, temperament) to his or her past and to consider this past as supporting or justifying the new self in the aging phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lieberman and Tobin, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>External continuity refers to the stability of physical and social environments. It is manifested through the persistence of relationships and behaviors.</p><p>Several empirical studies have confirmed the relevance of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Atchley's (1989)</ref> Continuity Theory to explain the decision to pursue careers by taking on bridge employment (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gobeski and Beehr, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kim and Feldman, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang et al., 2008)</ref>. Individuals who retire remain psychologically stable when they retain the same temperaments and attitudes by engaging in similar activities to those they enjoyed before retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Beehr, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schmidt and Lee, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To explain retirement intentions, we integrate Role and Continuity theories offer which provide a fully-fledged theoretical framework to explain retirement intentions. More specifically, retirement intentions this choice iscan be explained motivated by the desire to maintain a valued role <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashforth, 2001)</ref> or and to act in continuity with internal and external structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref>. Hence, retirement intentions are determined by the centrality of work role and possible options to preserve internal and external structures. We suggest that this phenomenon depends on the perceived fit between the person and his or her current work environment. Personal identity can be built on belonging to a specific vocation, organization, job or workgroup if the employee has developed a satisfying level of fit with these identification foci. Similarly, continuity can be planned through bridge employment in the same vocation, organization, job or workgroup if the individual perceives a propitious adjustment to them. The theoretical framework built into Person-Environment fit suggests evaluating perceived fit with the level of adequacy between needs and supplies, demands and abilities, and the level of value congruence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Person-Environment (P-E) fit</head><p>P-E fit corresponds to "the compatibility between the individual and the work environment that occurs when their characteristics are matched" <ref type="bibr">(Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 281)</ref>. P-E fit can also be considered at various 'levels' of work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kristof, 1996)</ref>: Person-Vocation fit; Person-Organization fit and Person-Workgroup fit; Person-Job fit; Person-Supervisor fit. This is generally assessed by comparing the same basic dimensions, such as job demands and the person's ability to deal with them. The High levels of P-E fit higher levels of the different dimensions of P-E fit contribute to variance in attitudes and behaviors such asare related to many work attitudes and behaviors such as job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gabriel et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hardin and Donaldson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Yu, 2016)</ref> organizational citizenship and perceived organizational support <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cable and DeRue, 2002)</ref>, well-being <ref type="bibr">(Ostroff and Schutlle, 2007)</ref>, organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Greguras and Diefendorff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">O'Reilly III et al., 1991)</ref>, work performance <ref type="bibr">(Ostroff and Schutlle, 2007)</ref> and organizational goal ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Sun et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Antecedents of P-E fit and their effects on work attitudes and behaviors have mainly been established with regard to new recruits (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gardner et al., 2012)</ref>, neglecting empirical validations on older workers. To the best of our knowledge, apart from the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Oakman and Wells (2016)</ref> in the Australian context, which examined the effects of job demands and person abilities fit on the intended timing of retirement, the relationship between P-E fit and retirement intentions has not been investigated to date. We attempt to fill this gap since recent late career transformations suggest indicate that older workers do not necessarily adopt full retirement directly. We suggest that the perception of fit with the different components of the work environment encourages older workers to occupy a bridge employment once retired from their career employment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis development</head><p>The vocation, the organization, the job and the workgroup represent the most relevant aspects of the work environment for older executives, a population whose skills and abilities are needed in countries with aging populations, relevant aspects of the work environment are the vocation, the organization, the job and the workgroup. Indeed, Person-Supervisor (P-S) fit is less pertinent was excluded as thefor older executives as they occupy leadership positionsin this study were all in positions of managerial leadership. 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Person-Vocation (P-V) fit (value congruence) and retirement intentions</head><p>P-V fit is conceptualized as value congruence, which corresponds to the perceived fit between individual and vocational values <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kristof, 1996)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Obodaru (2017)</ref>, when forgone professional identities are linked to unfulfilled values, people look for ways to enact them and retain them in their self-concept. At the end of their careers, employees who perceive work as meaningful tend to make plans to postpone full retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Richardson and Kilty, 1992)</ref>. In addition, older workers whose personal identity is strongly linked to a profession, are more likely to obtain a bridge employmentjob than to directly retire <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Feldman, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>In accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ashforth's (2001)</ref> Role Theory, we suggest that P-V fit is positively linked related to the intention to occupy a bridge employmentjob. When vocational role identity is valued, career bridge employment is a way for older workers to maintain their internal structure as far as values are concerned, and consequently to ease transition to retirement.</p><p>3 Person-Supervisor fit This component was not cited by respondents to a preliminary qualitative study based on 12 interviews with senior French executives (methodology and results on demand).</p><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Atchley's (1989)</ref> Continuity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref>, our proposition explains that future activities are chosen in continuity with past ones. Personality is built on experiences and social roles that have been assumed during life <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref>. Once retirement age is reached, individuals continue to draw upon their past experiences to adapt to new situations.</p><p>Based on these arguments, we formulate the following hypotheses:</p><p>H1A. P-V fit (value congruence) is negatively related to full retirement intention.</p><p>H1B. P-V fit (value congruence) is positively related to bridge employment intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Person-Organization (P-O) fit (needs-supplies and value congruence), Person-Group (P-G) (Value congruence) fit and retirement intentions</head><p>P-O fit is captured by two notions, 1) the match between individual needs and organizational supplies and 2) the value congruence between employee and organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Edwards, 1991)</ref>. P-O fit (needssupplies) involves the organization satisfying employees' needs, wishes or preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Edwards, 1991)</ref>. This concept is assessed by comparing whatIt results from the match between what the work environment provides (e.g., financial, physical and psychological resources) with and what the individual needs (e.g., payroll, development or training opportunities). Specifically, at the end of careers, financial needs are less important than intrinsic rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kanfer and Ackerman, 2004)</ref>.

Conversely, as explained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ashforth's (2001)</ref> Role Theory, the match between individual values and organizational or group values makes the related role identity central in the overall identity of older workers; full retirement represents the loss of a central and valued identity.

P-J fit is captured by two conceptscomposed of two elements: 1) . On the one hand, the match between individual knowledge, skills and abilities, and the demands of the job, and on the other hand, 2) the match between an individual's needs and desires and what is provided by the job <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Edwards, 1991)</ref>. Several studies have suggested that demands-abilities fit fosters bridge employment. Older workers who perceive their abilities as adequate are more dynamic in their career development and more open to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Zanibioni et al., 2010)</ref>. Conversely, knowledge obsolescence increases the likelihood of retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Beehr, 1986)</ref>. In fact, knowledge and skills are represent a source of personal control <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Deci and Ryan, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Individuals favor roles that increase their sense of control; if feelings of control in personal life are stronger than in employment, then older workers will opt for full retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barnes-Farrell, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Elovainio et al., 2005)</ref>. In addition, the intention to fully retire is high increased for when older workers are subjected to significant psychological and physical job demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Elovainio et al., 2005)</ref> and a substantial workload <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Boumans et al., 2008)</ref>.

From a continuity point of view, feelings of incompetence introduce discontinuity in the professional role <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref> and foster full retirement intention.</p><p>Given the corollary phenomenon, feelings of competence at work thus encourage career choices in continuity with past jobs.

In the same vein, older workers in jobs that offer them development opportunities are more likely to find a bridge employmentjob than to fully retire <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gobeski and Beehr, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Zanibioni et al., 2010)</ref>, and are less inclined to take early retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Schreurs et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Atchley's (1989)</ref> Continuity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref> stipulates that individual needs are invariant, even during career transitions. On the basis of this theoretical anchoringTherefore, we propose that, through continuity, older workers who perceive P-J fit (needs-supplies) before retirement will express the intention to occupy a bridge employment in order to satisfy their needs. This proposal leads us toHence, we formulate the following hypotheses: H3C. P-J fit (needs-supplies) is negatively related to full retirement intention.</p><p>H3D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and sample</head><p>The population under study consists of private sector executives in France. On the one hand, the development of an economy based on the tertiary sector and technologies with high added value requires many executives to manage companies. The number of executives increased by 5.2% between 2010 and 2015. In parallel, 64% of SMEs claim to experience recruitment difficulties. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> On the other hand, in the private sector, executives' retirement behaviors tend to nurture this scarcity as opposed to observed behaviors in the public sector. The proportion of departures with a pro rata pension at 65 years old is higher in the public sector than in the private sector. In the private sector, one in six employees retires before 65, even without the required number of annuities to obtain a full pension <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Buffeteau and Godefroy, 2005)</ref>. For this population, retirement decision is not based on financial factors other than financial ones (e.gand other factors such as. P-E fit) need to be investigated in order to better understand retirement decision.</p><p>We targeted people who met the requirements of age over 50 and held corporate executive status. The field sampling method consistedRespondents were approached via the Internet and directly of directly approaching people via the Internet. The direct approach to avoided the bias of interviewing only older executives active on social networks. Indeed, one of the reasons for being active on professional social networks is to signal one's presence on the job market. Our goal was to reach employees from diverse organizations in various sectors with different retirement intentions. Concerning online surveys, based on the title of the position and the tasks performed, we conducted a preliminary identification of profiles on the professional social network viadeo and then sent an introductory email about the study. Once the targeted person had agreed to take part in the study, web-based questionnaires were sent early in the morning in order to optimize the opportunities for email reading. Concerning face-to-face surveys, the questionnaires were distributed in two phases: first the principal author of the article briefly explained the issues and academic character of the study; second, once an agreement had been obtained, a questionnaire and an envelope were provided and hand delivered the following day at the same time.</p><p>A total of 1,500 questionnaires were distributed (95% online and 5% face to face). In all, 355 fully filled out questionnaires were retained for analysis, giving a response rate of 24%. This response rate is consistent with past research using online surveys. Our sample was composed of executives in different occupational categories (i.e., 18.8% in studies and consulting services, 12.9% in IT services). Most respondents were men (74%) with an average age of 56.5 years old. Most respondents indicated they were married (84%) and highly educated (38.4% had completed college or university while 39.5% had obtained a Master's degree). The latter socio-demographic information is consistent with the nature of the executive position that requires advanced education.</p></div>

Other researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Zhan et al., 2009)</ref> have used longitudinal panels such as the Health Retirement Study (HRS) or the Normative Aging Study (NAS). Some researchers have operationalized retirement by asking about the intended timing of retirement (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Oakman and Wells, 2016)</ref>. Taking into account the absence of measurement scales whose reliability and validity have been rigorously demonstrated, following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hinkin (1995)</ref> we applied a qualitative study to generate develop the following two measurement scales (both with six items) of retirement Bridge employment intention and Full retirement intention..

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The influence of value congruence on retirement intentions</head><p>Assuming that work values are stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chatman, 1991)</ref> and affect work performance and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Schein, 1992)</ref>, we analyzed value congruence at work. We hypothesized that the congruence between older workers' values and those of their profession, organization and workgroup influenced retirement intentions. Our findings indicated that only value congruence at the vocational level was positively related to bridge employment intention (H1B). This result confirms the theoretical models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Holland (1959)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Feldman (1994)</ref>, as</p><p>well as empirical research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Richardson and Kilty (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Wöhrmann et al., (2016)</ref>: employees who perceive their profession as meaningful to their lives plan to postpone full retirement. This finding is line with Role Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashforth, 2001)</ref>. Unexpectedly, value congruence at organizational and workgroup levels had no influence on full retirement intention. These counterintuitive results do not necessarily disconfirm Role Theory as they can be explained by the investment of older workers in substitute roles, such as associative roles, which can replace the loss of identity related to organizational or workgroup roles.</p><p>These results can also be explained by the fact that older workers identifying to their current organization or workgroup by other means different fromthan values congruence to identify with the current organization or workgroup. For instance, Vough (2012) demonstrated that identification with the workgroup was highly behavioral and experiential. In other words, identification with a workgroup might be more influenced by the emotional experience related to day-to-day actions than by the congruence of values when employees come to consider their identification with a workgroup, the most salient factors are related to their day-to-day experiences that impact their emotional experience rather than value congruence. Another explanation concerns is specific to the population under study: vocational values may be more constitutive of older executives' identities than group and organizational values. in older executives' identities asIndeed, the executive profession is institutionalized and benefits from a high social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chreim et al., 2007)</ref>. Consequently, compared with other types of P-E fit (i.e., P-O fit, P-G fit), congruence of values at the vocational level is the type of P-E fitcompared with other types of fit i.e., P-O fit, P-G fitthat is most likely to influence senior executives' identities and their related behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The influence of needs-supplies fit on retirement intentions</head><p>We hypothesized that older workers who perceived that their needs (e.g., pay, development opportunities and recognition) were satisfied by their work environment (e.g., financial, physical and psychological resources) were more likely to occupy a bridge employment than to fully retire. Indeed, Our findings indicated that needs-supplies fit at the organizational level was positively related to bridge employment intention (H2A), confirming the proposition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Feldman (1994)</ref>.</p><p>The findings also indicated that a needs-supplies fit at the job level had a positive influence on bridge employment intention (H3D). These results confirm Continuity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref> and are in line with the empirical studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gobeski and Beehr (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Armstrong and Ursel (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Zanibioni et al. (2010)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gobeski and Beehr (2009)</ref> demonstrated that individuals holding positions that offered them development opportunities were more likely to occupy a bridge employmentjob during retirement. Furthermore, assuming that needs remain stable during retirement, bridge employment offers optimal continuity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref> to individuals who perceive a needssupplies fit at the job level. However, this type of fit was not related to full retirement intention, regardless of the level (H2A and H3C). This result can be explained by the preeminence of non-work-related needs (e.g. leisure) in determining the intention to fully retire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The influence of demands-abilities fit on retirement intentions</head><p>This type of fit is based on a comparison between individual abilities and work demands. The results demonstrated that, unlike other types of fit, demands-abilities fit at the job level positively influenced bridge employment intention and negatively influenced full retirement intention (H3A and H3B). By considering the demands-abilities fit, these findings complement and enrich past research which focused solely on the influence of job characteristics on retirement intentions or behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Elovainio et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Boumans et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dal Bianco et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oakman and Wells, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Van Soligne and Henkens, 2014)</ref>. Those results are also in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Atchley's (1989)</ref> Continuity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref>. Individuals keep roles over which they feel they haveperceive a personal control.</p><p>Conversely, perceived lack of control encourages older workers to opt for full retirement.</p><p>Therefore, P-J fit (demands-abilities) induces individuals to maintain optimal continuity by occupying a career bridge employment job in the same field. Unlike other types of fit for which continuity can only be obtained within the same organization, demand-abilities fit at the job level can be achieved through a career bridge employmentjob in another organization as long as the skills required remain unchanged and individuals can control their new role.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>P-E fit can be presented as a person-situation interaction that implies a correspondence between the attributes of an employee and those of the working environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Ostroff and Schuttle, 2007)</ref>. Responding to the call by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wang and Shultz (2010)</ref>, this study contributes to knowledge of retirement antecedents by exploring the role of P-E fit. More specifically, it differs from prior research that examined individual and organizational variables separately by introducing the lens of P-E fit, offering a fresh approach to research into retirement antecedents. Also, as recommended by several authors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cable and DeRue, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Greguras and Diefendorff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Yu, 2016)</ref>, our study reveals the differentiated effects of various fit levels. Retirement is complex as P-E fit can influence both full retirement and bridge employment intentions.</p><p>Nevertheless, The results of this study showed that, contrary to the intention to fully retire, bridge employment intention was closely related more closely to the different levels of P-E fit. These findings can be explained by the fact that, When contemplating anticipating the eventuality of holding a bridge employment job, older employees take evaluate carefully the quality of their interaction fit with their organization and career job; by contrast, into consideration more than when envisaging full retirement, which is liable to be relatedolder employees might consider other spheres of life (e.g., marital status, dependent persons) to a greater extent. ThusFinally, by exploring the effects of P-E fit on both full retirement and bridge employment intentions, we can conclude that the results of this study give greater insightsreveals into the work-related nature of bridge employment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>To establish career plans, managers need to know about the availability of their older colleagues. Identifying high-potential aging executives who intend to occupy a bridge employment once retired could encourage HR strategies designed to recruit them by improving their P-E fit. This practice can be beneficial to all parties. On the one hand, organizations would avoid the loss of human capital caused by retirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Wang et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, older employees could gradually prepare their full retirement through a bridge employment.</p><p>The P-E fit scales, which present good psychometric qualities, provide HR managers with tools to follow the evolution of older workers' fit levels over time. For organizations interested in maintaining older employees, a lack of fit with the work environment would alert managers and help to shape corrective actions.</p><p>The results indicated that bridge employment intention was positively related to needssupplies fit at organizational and job levels. Older workers' needs, which are dominantly intrinsic, can be satisfied at organizational level through policies such as competency development and career planning. In addition, managers can respond to the needs of their older executives by offering greater flexibility, a recurrent requirement among older workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tremblay and Larivière, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The influence of demands-abilities fit on different retirement intentions also raises questions on how to maintain older workers' employability. The aim is to manage the timing and form of their retirement. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ilmarinen (2009)</ref>, older workers' employability depends on their functional capacity (physical and mental health), skills updating, motivation to continue working and the work itself (work environment and management style). Thus, organizational practices in favor of work-life balance, continuous learning, and work-related flexibility are more likely to satisfy older workers' needs and to retain those who wish to continue expressing their potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Wang et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, improving the work environment of older employees could be beneficial for all employees whatever their age <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Munk, 2003)</ref>. In an examination of work-related organizational structures, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Griffiths (2007)</ref> asserted that, to date, research has been conducted with age-free models that fail to capture age-related changes and therefore, cannot account for shifts in work attitudes that occur with aging. She argues thatNew models should take into account predictors of retirement into account in order to support effective strategies benefitting the retention of older employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>Despite our contributions, this study presents some limitations that need to be addressed.</p><p>First, regarding the sample, The interviews respondents were predominantly with male private sector executives working in France. A generalization of the findings would require the inclusion of more female and international respondents. Second, As the majority of retirement intention studies use self-report measures, common method bias can skew the results to some extent <ref type="bibr">(Naudé et al., 2013)</ref>. We nonetheless took some measures to minimize these potential biases: separation of . First, the sets of items of variables (i.e., independent or dependent) were separated into different sections; use of . Second, different question formats were used within each set of items <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Third, the current study only relies on subjective measures of P-E fit. However, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Verquer et al. (2003)</ref> in their meta-analysis of P-O fit outcomes, future studies should investigate the different effects of both subjective and objective fit on retirement intentions. Fourth, Several researchers acknowledge the changing nature of P-E fit over time, recognizing it as "dynamic" rather than "static" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Kristof-Brown et al., 2002)</ref>. Longitudinal data could help uswould be required to assess the stability of older workers' intentions over time. Such data could also be used to assess actual retirement behavior rather than intentions.</p><p>Fifth, with regard to the variables included in our conceptual model, we suggest that For a deeper understanding of retirement intentions, future studies should include other types of bridge employment, such as non-career bridge employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Topa and Alcover, 2015)</ref> or bridge employment in the same organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jones and McIntosh, 2010)</ref>. For instance, older employees may want to maintain some aspects of their role identities that are specific to their organizational roles (e.g., linked to the status and seniority achieved in their current positions) by holding a bridge employment in the same pre-retirement organization. Sixth, the model can also be extended by incorporating mediating variables such as job satisfaction or different commitment foci in the relationship between P-E fit and retirement intentions. Assessing actual retirement behavior rather than intentions is another potential research avenue. Seventh, this study does not distinguish misfit directions. For example, individuals may feel that their skills undermatch or overmatch the job requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cable and DeRue, 2002)</ref>. Therefore, future research should investigate the directions of P-E misfit as antecedents of retirement intentions and behaviors.</p><p>Although further research is needed, it is encouraging from the present study that retirement decisions concerning full retirement and bridge employment are not symmetrical processes. In addition, bridge employment can be noticeably influenced by P-E fit; this result makes compatible the consideration of career idiosyncrasies (as P-E fit is specific to each employee) and the identification of patterns of bridge employment intentions.</p><p>Finally, all the respondents came from France. Our findings should therefore be considered as preliminary supporting evidence that needs to be corroborated by further empirical validations in other countries which present comparable job market dynamics and work legislation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The management of career ends represents a pending issue for aging societies striving to finance their pension systems, for organizations confronted to the loss of expertise, and for aging employees preoccupied by the potential loss of valued internal and external structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Atchley, 1989)</ref> valued role identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashforth, 2001)</ref> after retirement. In this regard, bridge employment is likely to become an increasingly frequent form of employment after the age of retirement due to aging populations and to the lengthened life span in most developed countries.</p><p>As bridge employment seems to be an increasingly prevalent option for older workers <ref type="bibr">(Bennet et al., 2016)</ref>, more needs to be understood about its implications for individuals, families, employers and society as a whole. In addition to the human capital held by older employees, some organizations might be interested in employing retired workers because they are frequently paid less than active employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Feldman, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Our study attempted to expands the understanding of predictors of bridge employment and full retirement intentions by testing their relationship with different levels of P-E fit. It also reveals that decisional processes differ for full retirement and bridge employment. Precisely, full retirement intention is only negatively influenced by one type of P-E fit, i.e., P-J fit; whereas bridge employment is positively influenced by P-V fit, P-O fit (needs-supplies and value congruence) P-J fit (demands-abilities and needs-supplies). Bridge employment presents a work-related nature, as opposed to full retirement, presumably dominantly related to the sphere of personal life. Therefore, The results show that oorganizations canould use foster bridge employment to facilitate the pursuit of careers after retirement by increasing the level of P-E fit --i. Instead of acting on variables such as health, family constraints or pension levels, organizations could act on the level of P-E fit. The main contribution of this study is its assessment of the influence of P-E fit on retirement intentions, as it reflects the compatibility of older workers with their work environment. Depending on the level or the conceptualization of P-E fit, managerial actions could be put in place to promote the employment of older workers.</p><p>For a deeper understanding of retirement intentions, future studies should include other types of bridge employment, such as non-career bridge employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Topa and Alcover, 2015)</ref> or bridge employment in the same organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jones and McIntosh, 2010)</ref>.

Future research could also investigate mediating variables such as job satisfaction or different foci of commitment in the relationship between P-E fit and retirement intentions. Another future direction would be to investigate the directions of P-E misfit (i.e. undermatch or overmatch: <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cable and DeRue, 2002)</ref> as antecedents of retirement intentions and behaviors.
